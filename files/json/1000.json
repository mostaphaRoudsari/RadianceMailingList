I was just\nstruggling for the soft shadows. This is my parameters for rpict:\nrpict -vf default.vp -ps 1 -aa .08 -ab 2 -ad 512 -as 256 -ar 128\n-dj .6 -ds .1 -x 12288 -y 9216 scene.oct > scene.pic\nI made such a large image to get 12 times oversample. I then filter\nit down. This is for pfilt:\npfilt -e .4 -r .7 -x 1024 -y 768 scene.pic > scene_filt.pic\nEven so, I still get the image like that. I'm really confused. How\nto get a satisfying result?\n\ncheers,\n\nAlex\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: scene_filt.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 43854 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041202/a2d1f012/scene_filt-0001.jpg\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "alex wang", "datetime": "Thu Dec  2 19:45:11 2004"}
