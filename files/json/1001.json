{"body": "\nHi,\n\nsorry, so again, I try to be clear in asking this time ;-) By the way,\nhave nice holidays (I hope that's the reason for your travel ;-)!\n\nAll is about the question how to map pictures onto a surface without\ncorrupting its material properties. I understand that colorpict\nmultiplies the material color components with those of the picture.\n\nIf I have a grayscale image processed by normpat (which means that the\naverage gray value is 1.0) and apply it to a material, the overall\ncolor and brightness will remain the same. So I get the \"pattern\" from\nthe image, but the surface still has the correct material properties\n(color, brightness etc). I used this so far.\n\nNow I want to use a colored picture for mapping. I also apply normpat\nto it, so, as far as I understand, the average of all R, G and B must\nbe 1.0, right? For example, I use a normpat'ed picture of green marble.\nI than apply this using colorpict to a surface, which has a \"marble\"\nmaterial. Will the overall color and brightness still be that of the\ndefined material, as the picture map has the average of 1.0?\n\nThe background: I try to use exact data for material definitions, but\nthe image maps can't all be color corrected. So I want the overall\ncolor and brightness from defined materials, e.g. from the plastic\nmaterial, and use the map only for what I would call \"local color\nvariation\". The reason is that I have e.g. red marble, got its color,\nbrightness and all that defined as plastic marble. But the marble has\nblue particles which won't appear if I use a grayscale imagemap. So I\nwant to use a normpat'ed (NOT colorcorrected e.g. by macbethcal!) to\nbring these blue parts onto the surface. The whole surface however must\nstill have the average color of my plastic marble material.\n\nIf I understand the man-page of normpat, that's just what it was\ninvented for. However, I am a bit unsure, as all Radiance documentation\nuses colorpict with a bright white material.\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n--\nLars O.
