{"body": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm brand new to Radiance, and I'm using DAYSim with Google Sketchup.\n\nMy first question is simple: does the model always assume that there are\nblinds installed in the building?  Is there a way to tell the program that\nthere are no blinds?  How can I compare a model with blinds to a model\nwithout?\n\nThanks,\n-Taylor Sharpe\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100413/8361df9e/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Taylor Sharpe", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<g2geea676221004131748m4c3f9008n124d24baf0791fc0@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr 13 17:48:39 2010", "email": "newspectrum at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Blinds"}
