{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI am just looking the rtcontrib -c option in the hope that it might be\nuseful for reducing the graininess in images or noise in readings.\n\nWhere I am stuck is this: How do I get reinhart.cal to produce\nthose multiple rays which rtcontrib -c would then sum up?\n\nThis is for sensor illuminance readings:\n\n$ cat data/2photocells.pts |rtcontrib -h -I $opt -e MF:1 \\\n-f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins \\\n-o tmp/sensors/s%03d.dat -c 10 \\\n-m sky_glow -w testroom_whitesky1.oct\nrtcontrib: warning - partial accumulation in final record\n\nIs the idea to create those multiple sample rays in a pre-run with\nrtrace or rcalc, and feed them to rtcontrib instead of the .pts file?\n\nThanks\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib -c", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4BBF0868.9070704@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4bbb84d3.4644f10a.2a9a.ffffe931SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Apr  9 03:56:53 2010", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib -c"}
