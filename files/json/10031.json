{"body": "\nHi!\nAll you have to do is to multiply your pixel values by your f(x) with x\nbeing the radius to the center. This can be done just using pcomb. Make\nsure to include the -o switch to eliminate any display settings\n(exposure etc).\n\nBe aware that \"center\" is the optical axis and not necessarily the\ncenter of the sensor, so you must find out the pixel position of it.\n\nCheers\n\nLars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] vignetting correction on a fish-eye image", "sender": "Lars O.
