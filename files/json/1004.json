In most high-quality printing jobs (e.g. art catalogues)\nadditional pigments are used to overcome the cmyk (saturation)-limitations.\n\nBut instead of quarreling about this I simply wanted to say that the new\nRGB laser printers usually do a very good job with their automatic\noperation, at least for images without strong color bias.\nI admit that I haven't bothered so far about what's going on inside the\nmachine, they're very expensive, so I believe you that some complicated\nstuff is working inside.)\n\nI also think it's out of question that the contrast range and color\nsaturation of machine made prints cannot compare to those of\ntransparencies or oil paintings. But the color resolution of those laser\nprints is fairly high so you can get a lot of information from the image\nonto the print also. I noticed this once in a negative sense, when I\nhoped that some faint splotches which were hardly visible on the screen\nwould finally disappear on the print due to limited color space\nresolution - they didn't, and remained nicely visible.. :-(\n\nahmm, and yes, Rob, I meant of course pcond..\n\n-cb\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Thu Dec  2 20:54:13 2004"}
