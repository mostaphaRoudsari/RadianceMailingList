{"body": "\nIf you have access to Rhino you could use that also to open a DWG file and export to OBJ. If the DWG is separated by layers you can assign each layer a material name in Rhino, which will be carried into your OBJ export and kept successfully via obj2rad. Occasionally I?ve seen bad DWG export that when opened in Rhino moves some surfaces out of place.\n\n\n\nThis process usually creates good OBJ/RAD files. The Rhino OBJ export also allows you to select the polygon size/count you require depending on how complex your geometry is.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100505/6e71053d/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] import to Radiance", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7076D195F@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<i2t3ccbd68d1005041903jf67fd22bsad3f767af78947f0@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed May  5 06:18:26 2010", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] import to Radiance"}
