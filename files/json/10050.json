{"body": "\nHi,\nI have run into some trouble using the lcp0.cal file that models a Laser Cut\nPanel.\n\nThe problem I'm seeing is that when I replace my regular window with one\nmade of the lcp_material direct sunlight seems to eliminated entirely (both\ndeflected and undeflected) from the interior of my room. My facade is south\nfacing and is fully glazed with either glass in the 1st case or lcp_material\nin the second. The 1st case, with no LCP, shows a diagonal stripe of direct\nsun hitting the wall. In the second picture with the lcp_material, instead\nof the direct beam being split into deflected and undeflected portions as\nexpected, the direct beam is completely eliminated.\n\nI have read Phillip Greenup's paper \"RADIANCE algorithm to simulate\nlaser-cut panel light-redirecting elements\". I get the feeling that there's\nsomething wrong with my alignments somewhere, but I haven't been able to\nfind a combination of -rz material rotation, surface normal of the polygon,\nand rotation of the room as a whole that produce the correct results.\nEverything I've tried results in the same thing: direct beam sunlight\neliminated from the room. One thing I'm not clear on: the -rz rotation in\nthe prism2 material definition should point the surface normal of the\nmaterial in the same direction as the final orientation of the polygon, and\nboth of those normals should point toward the exterior, correct? I am\ndefining the room with the +Y wall being the window and then rotating that\nroom 180 degrees so that it is south facing. As a result, my -rz rotation is\n270, to point the normal in -Y. Unfortunately, the results have the same\nproblem I described whether the -rz rotation is 90, 180, 270,  or 0. I've\nincluded some of the relevant code at the bottom of this email.\n\nI'm hoping this is something that someone else has run into before. I've\nbeen using Radiance for about 8 months, so I've learned some, but definitely\nnot all, of the ins and outs of the program.\n\nThanks very much for your help,\nKevin Thuot\n\n\n#lcp_material definition\nvoid prism2 lcp_material\n11 f1 dx1 dy1 dz1 f2 dx2 dy2 dz2 lcp0.cal -rz 270\n0\n2 .5 1.5\n\n#part of conf2.rad file:\nlcp_material polygon window\n0\n0\n12\n16    9    2.8\n16    9    0\n0    9    0\n0    9    2.8\n\n#rotating the room so that the window faces south instead of north\n!xform -n conf2 -t -8 -4.5 0 -rz 180 conf2.rad\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100505/e80ca438/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kevin Thuot", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<r2u4a3e24cc1005050808mb02fcda3t5510ac9f2dc529d@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed May  5 08:09:17 2010", "email": "kthuot at mit.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Laser Cut Panel (LCP) Modelling Problem"}
