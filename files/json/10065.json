{"body": "<p2m89355c0f1005060755o1be4752ev87a7d9ad3fad996e@mail.gmail.com>\n\nThomas,\n\nThanks for the quick reply,\nI thought about the possibility of using pextreme, although I was really\nhoping somebody had that already worked that out for me! ;) Moreover the\nsolution implemented by Greg with -s auto is so much more elegant than\nwhat I could do with pextreme!\n\nThanks anyway and thanks for falsecolor2 and wxfalsecolor, they are\nreally nice and useful tools!\n\nBest,\n\nG\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nThomas Bleicher\nSent: 06 May 2010 15:55\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nGiovanni.\n\nThe \"-s auto\" option uses phisto and sed to work out the maximum scale\nfrom the image. One or both may not be available on your system. BTW:\nWhere does the falsecolor binary come from? The 3.9 MinGW bundle does\nnot have it, iirc. Perhaps that feature is not implemented at all.\n\nAs for falsecolor2 I just haven't implemented the \"auto\" option.\n\nIf you can script a bit you can try to find the max value with\npextreme and calculate a maximum scale from that.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, May 6, 2010 at 3:19 PM, Giovanni Betti\n<gbetti@fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\ninto\nbegins\nBleicher\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C304A57F2F@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May  6 08:05:34 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Falsecolor auto scale"}
