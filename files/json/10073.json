{"body": "\nHi Jia\n\nNot sure why you want to go fbx to 3ds with the converter. 3ds is an old\nformat that has limitations to geometry that may impact your model. You\nshould be able to go to obj and then import the obj into Rhino to do\nwhat you want (such as fix normals and export a \"good\" obj). For obj2rad\nyou want the object to have material names assigned.\n\nLayers and materials are distinct methods of organization. If you are\nworking with Autocad and going to Radiance, layers are the principal\nmethod of organizing your geometry. If you are working with Revit,\nmaterials are the principal method of organizing geometry (unless you\nwant to work on a per object basis).\n\nIf I recall correctly, it has been awhile, if you export from revit to\ndwg, then certain family categories will get compressed onto one\nrepresentative layer. Depending on what you are doing this may loose\ncritical geometry differentiation that you need to have. And it is a\nreally big pain to try to edit the resulting autocad model to recover\nsuch differentiation.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\nJia Hu wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] import to Radiance", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4BE31436.1010704@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<i2t3ccbd68d1005041903jf67fd22bsad3f767af78947f0@mail.gmail.com>\t<4BE1986A.5030207@visarc.com>\t<o2x3ccbd68d1005051001p8b0375cke581f768915c041b@mail.gmail.com>\t<4BE1A5FA.7010402@visarc.com>\t<m2l3ccbd68d1005051112i4daacba8k1680a3da53401381@mail.gmail.com>\t<g2v3ccbd68d1005060035j6e9cfb8eq2eb1a795db84a61c@mail.gmail.com>\t<4BE2A1A6.4090903@gmx.net>", "<4BE2D2C4.6040405@visarc.com>", "<i2s3ccbd68d1005061142r4364abc0s83f6d2677e7f6001@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu May  6 12:10:59 2010", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] import to Radiance"}
