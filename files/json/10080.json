{"body": "\nHi All\n\n\n\nI'm doing a glare analysis using Radiance in IES Virtual Environments.\n\n\n\nFor some reason, the components in the room sometimes don't show up and\nI get the following error:\n\n\n\n0.00 %, oconv started processing    0.0000 hrs.\n\nxform2: cannot find file\n\"\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\Laptop13.rad\"\n\nxform2: cannot find file\n\"\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\Screen16.rad\"\n\nxform2: cannot find file\n\"\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\PERPET~1.RAD\"\n\nxform2: cannot find file\n\"\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\PHONE1~1.RAD\"\n\nwarning - (!xform2 -rz 90.000  -t 0.544 1.084 0.701\n\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\Laptop13.rad): empty file\n\nwarning - (!xform2 -rz 90.000  -t 0.544 1.084 0.701\n\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\Screen16.rad): empty file\n\nwarning - (!xform2  -t -0.469 0.492 0.021\n\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\PERPET~1.RAD): empty file\n\nwarning - (!xform2 -rz 90.000  -t -0.023 0.839 0.053\n\\CHRIST~1\\100501~1\\MELBOU~1\\Radiance\\PHONE1~1.RAD): empty file\n\n99.00 %, oconv finished      after   0.0000 hrs.\n\n\n\nThis error came up after I changed the sky file, but it happened quite\nrandomly before, so I'm not sure whether this has anything to do with\nit. Sometimes the same simulation worked fine when I ran it on a\ndifferent PC. However, the problem seems to spread.\n\n\n\nDid this happen to anyone before? Can anyone point to what am I doing\nwrong?\n\n\n\nGreetings from Melbourne\n\nChris\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\nChristoph Begert\nAssociate\n\nsbe\n\nsustainable built environments\n\nInnovative ideas, collaborative design, practical solutions\n\n\n\nMelbourne\nLevel 2, 525 Flinders St\nMelbourne Victoria 3000\nAustralia\nT:   +61 3 9923 2345\nF:   +61 3 9923 2346\nE:  christoph.begert@sbe.com.au\nW:  www.sbe.com.au <http://www.sbe.com.au/>\n\n\n\nSydney\nLevel 6, 61 Market Street\nSydney NSW 2000\nAustralia\nT:   +61 2 8289 5720\nF:   +61 2 9286 3745\n\nPerth Agent  Encycle\nLevel 10, 200 St Georges Terrace\nPO Box 7620\nCloisters Square\nPerth WA 6000\nAustralia\nT:   +61 8 9321 8760\nF:   +61 8 9485 0575\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSBE - Winners of:\n\n\n\nNational Australian Women in Construction - 2009\n\nWinners of the Crystal Vision Award for advancing the interests of women\nin the construction industry.\n\n\n\nNational Australian Women in Construction - 2009\n\nWinners  of The Building Commission Award for outstanding achievement as\na business woman.\n\n\n\nRoyal Australian Institute of Architects (National) - 2007\n\nAward for Sustainable Architecture University of Tasmania School of\nArchitecture in collaboration with Six Degrees.\n\n\n\nRoyal Australian Institute of Architects (National) - 2007\n\nLachlan Macquarie Award for Heritage University of Tasmania School of\nArchitecture in collaboration with Six Degrees.\n\n\n\nRoyal Australian Institute of Architects (Tasmanian Chapter) - 2007\n\nSustainable Architecture, Heritage and Public Architecture For the\ndesign of the School of Architecture at the University of Tasmania as\narchitects in collaboration with Six Degrees\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of this email and its attachments are confidential and\nprivileged.
