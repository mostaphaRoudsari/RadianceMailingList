{"body": "\nFellows,\n\nThe intention here is to try to envisage what the software landscape\nmight be like in five / ten years time, at least for Radiance users\ndoing climate-based (i.e. annual) daylight modelling, perhaps\nincluding complex glazing systems.\n\nJan Wienold mentioned a while back that a photon-mapping Radiance add-\non (I assume pmap) is in the works, and that it would be integrated\nwith DAYSIM for annual simulations. Greg Ward has recently\ndemonstrated the rtcontrib-BSDF approach that seems to offer similar\nfunctionality.\n\nSo, are we being presented with a fork in the road ahead?  If so, how\nwill we decide which path to take?  Is now perhaps the right time to\nconsider working-up a checklist of capabilities/strengths/weaknesses\nfor the two approaches?\n\nI don't believe that we are too far away from seeing metrics founded\non climate-based daylight modelling appearing in guidelines such as\nLEED etc.  In which case, there could be something of a scramble as\npotentially many, many new Radiance users join what is still a fairly\nsmall bunch of 'enthusiasts' doing annual simulations.  It think it\nwould be useful to get this discussion on the go sooner rather than\nlater.\n\nBest,\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D537B22C-55D6-4085-A0F9-769067408D97@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon May 10 07:11:20 2010", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rtcontrib-BSDF and DAYSIM-pmap: where are weheading?"}
