Search for a\npackage like \"X11-dev\" or similar and install that.\n\nOn Tue, May 11, 2010 at 3:48 PM, Cramer Silkworth\n<silkworth@transsolar.com> wrote:\n\nYou should probably do a\nsudo ./makeall clean\nsudo ./makeall install\n\nAfter that you can add another \"makeall clean\" to remove files from\nthe process.
