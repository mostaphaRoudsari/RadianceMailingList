Just follow his steps one by one.\n\nI would strongly advice users to go this way - the generic\n/usr/local-approach leads to a lot of confusion with people ending up\nwith a mess of files in that directory. This makes debugging difficult\nand successful updates become challenging. Nothing to say against it as\nlong as one really keeps track and can do a rm -R /usr/local from time\nto time - but impossible to maintain for a casual user.\n\nCheers,\n\nLars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Upgrading to R4: \"There were some errors.\"", "sender": "Lars O.
