{"body": "\nHi Giovanni,\n\nI see nothing wrong with your parameter settings, so it may have\nsomething to do with your scene description.  You must be using the\n\"mirror\" primitive in order to generate your virtual sources -- is\nthis correct?  How many surfaces do you have using the mirror type?\nIs it a large surface tessellated into many smaller polygons?  The\nfewer surfaces you hand to the virtual source calculation, the better\nit will do.  I've never encountered this error before.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] system - out of memory in makevsrc", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89A77B09-9C2C-494F-9325-0D19D7CA82EF@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C304F58369@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>"], "datetime": "Wed May 19 08:24:41 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] system - out of memory in makevsrc"}
