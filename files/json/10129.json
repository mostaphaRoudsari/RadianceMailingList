{"body": "\nDear list,\n\nI have a brightfunc applied to the glow of the sky dome. I would like\nthis pattern to be visible to the camera, but use a normal gensky\ngenerated sky for all sample rays.\n\nConceptually, this is similar to the illum type where a different\nmaterial is applied when the object (the sky in my case) is viewed directly.\n\nI did try with illum:\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4  1 1 1  0\n\nskyglow brightfunc bracelet\n2 band bracelet.cal\n0\n0\n\nskyfunc illum skymat\n1 bracelet\n0\n3  1 1 1\n\nskymat source sky\n0\n0\n4  0 0 1  180\n\nThis works, but results in about twice the horizontal illuminance\ncompared to a normal glow sky. The sky now takes part in the direct\ncalculation (this works with -ab 0), and all light expectedly emenates\nfrom the zenith. So using illum is not an option.\n\nMany thanks for your ideas\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4BF9A378.4060003@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun May 23 14:48:12 2010", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] illum-like behaviour for sky dome"}
