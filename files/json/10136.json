{"body": "\nHi Cramer,\n\nI've done a fair amount of daylight modeling for LEED\ncertification/documentation -- more than I'd like to have done, honestly!\nAt my last job, we would use the glazing factor method if the spaces were\nsimple enough, and rely on Radiance models for the more complicated\ndesigns. There are spaces that are simply not supported by the glazing\nfactor method, and then you need to rely on better tools like Radiance or\nAGi32 to do the required simulations.\n\nThe sky condition is, admittedly, a gross simplification. Better than\ndaylight factors for predominantly clear climates, though. But you're\nright, neither are really adequate for quantifying the daylighting on an\nannual basis. Hopefully the emerging tools in Radiance v4.x, and planned\nimprovements to AGi32, will provide more thorough climate based daylight\nmodeling capability to more users, and that this practice will find its\nway into the emerging daylight quantity and quality metrics, and building\nrating systems.\n\n- Rob G.\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, May 25, 2010 12:35 pm, Cramer Silkworth wrote:\n\n\n\n===================\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] LEED modeling", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ead9658b180f4410948ccb25cba614b2.squirrel@webmail.rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<4BFC188B.8070208@transsolar.com>"], "datetime": "Tue May 25 11:47:13 2010", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] LEED modeling"}
