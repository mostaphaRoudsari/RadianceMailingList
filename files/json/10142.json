{"body": "\nThomas,\n\nThanks for the suggestions.\n\nI am trying to avoid the first option that you suggested below. I get\nthe impression that it is more difficult. Can you elaborate further?\n\nI tried your suggestion to use xwd. The problem with this route is that\nboth the ximage (which is called by xglaresrc) and the xwd are\ninteractive programs. We end up trying to automate something that is\ninteractive.\n\nThe catch is how to select the window to be dumped. The xwd by default\nasks the user to click on the window to be dumped. I tried to use the\nHDR file name as the window_name and pass it to xwd. Something like:\n\n$ xwd -name sc01jd_view.hdr -out sc01jd_view.xwd\n\nIt works but (1) it assumes that no other window is on top of this\nwindow and (2) it captures what is displayed. The first catch means that\nwe cannot do anything else on the computer while the script is working.\nThe second catch means that if the xglaresrc picture is bigger than the\nmonitor (e.g. netbook screen) the picture is actually cut.\n\nFor now, I think I can live with that.\n\nThanks,\n\nEry\n\n\nOn 05/27/2010 03:06 AM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dumping xglaresrc result to a file", "sender": "Ery Djunaedy", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4BFE64C4.7060704@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4BFD4539.80404@gmail.com>", "<AANLkTimKTSK4xkAsyVmcj694IMDsCCv7AQATDCkREMwd@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu May 27 05:25:45 2010", "email": "ery.mailinglist at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dumping xglaresrc result to a file"}
