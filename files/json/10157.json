{"body": "\nHi,\nI'm trying to use the daylighting coefficient method (using rtcontrib) to\nget annual simulation results for a room equipped with a mirrored\ndaylighting system (like a light shelf, for example). Is this possible? I\nknow that by using the -dr option, Radiance will create virtual light\nsources to account for specular reflections of direct light from the sun.\nHowever, since the daylight coefficients are calculated using a blank sky\nhaving a uniform luminance distribution, there is no sun for the -dr option\nto find. I believe this would make the sky patch coefficients come out lower\nthan they should be because the specular direct reflection of the sun would\nnot be included, but my understanding of how the program works may not be\ncorrect.\n\nCan the daylight coefficient method be made to work with specular\nreflections in Radiance, or is this not possible given the way the program\nis implemented?\n\nThanks,\nKevin Thuot\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100601/243f1623/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kevin Thuot", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTim2TAFnoh3vylXbEhOkntmPYecQD0zJ_vocsABz@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jun  1 06:55:46 2010", "email": "kthuot at mit.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Specular Reflections with the DaylightCoefficient Method"}
