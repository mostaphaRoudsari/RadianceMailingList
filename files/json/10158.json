{"body": "\nHi Kevin,\n\nThe daylight coefficient method usually puts the sun's energy into 1\nto 4 sky patches, so the rtcontrib method will work, though it won't\ngive very accurate shadows.  The total energy should still be correct\nif you do it right.\n\nAnother approach is to create a set of suns at different positions in\nthe sky corresponding to the expected trajectory throughout the year,\nand interpolate these results in a separate rtcontrib run.  I have\ndone it both ways, and the latter technique tends to produce slightly\nmore accurate shadows.  The -dr option will work properly if you do\nthis to calculate reflected beam radiation.\n\nI regret that I don't have a script to provide,  but my 2005\npresentation covers this in overview:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop4/cd/website/PDF/Ward_rtcontrib.pdf\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<AANLkTim2TAFnoh3vylXbEhOkntmPYecQD0zJ_vocsABz@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<15D4F87F-D6D7-4E17-92F6-A00839213546@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<AANLkTim2TAFnoh3vylXbEhOkntmPYecQD0zJ_vocsABz@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jun  1 09:33:48 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Specular Reflections with the DaylightCoefficient Method"}
