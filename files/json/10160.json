{"body": "\nHi Terrance,\n\nThe trouble is that you are using the -i rendering option as if it\nwere part of a view.  Very clever, and it works if you don't use the -\nN option of rad, but the mechanism behind the -N option with multiple\nviews is that the view= variable is written to the stdin of an rpict\nrunning with the -S and -PP options, which shares memory on a\nmultiprocessing platform.  In this mode, rpict just ignores any non-\nview options on stdin, which is why it isn't working as expected.\n\nThe latest HEAD allows you to run rad with -N on a single view (i.e.,\n\"-v Plan\" or \"-v Plan-i\" in your case), and it runs rpiece to split\nthe work.  With your rad input file, you could run two rad processes,\neach with -N 4, one for each type of image, and get your job done in\nparallel that way.\n\nI usually have a separate rad input file if I'm using the -i option,\nwhich I attach to the render= variable.  I had never thought of doing\nit your way.  Reprogramming rad to properly handle non-view options in\nview= settings would be a bit of work....\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4C05C5F1.20004@curtin.edu.au>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0FE4AB4C-7A9D-4B7E-ACAB-1ED9BE26B209@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4C05C5F1.20004@curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Tue Jun  1 21:52:18 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Apparent inconsistency in rad when using the-N option"}
