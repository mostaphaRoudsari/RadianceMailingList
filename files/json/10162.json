{"body": "\nGreg, all:\n\nSo what is the protocol for determining the number of patches the sun's energy is distributed across? In Axel Jacob's (excellent) tutorial on rtcontrib three patches are used to represent the sun regardless of whether the Tregenza or the finer Reinhart patch density/distributions are used, but you mention one to four patches being used, Greg. How or when would this number change? Does genskyvec actually make a choice?\n\n- Rob\n________________________________________\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 2010 10:33 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Kevin,\n\nThe daylight coefficient method usually puts the sun's energy into 1\nto 4 sky patches, so the rtcontrib method will work, though it won't\ngive very accurate shadows.  The total energy should still be correct\nif you do it right.\n\nAnother approach is to create a set of suns at different positions in\nthe sky corresponding to the expected trajectory throughout the year,\nand interpolate these results in a separate rtcontrib run.  I have\ndone it both ways, and the latter technique tends to produce slightly\nmore accurate shadows.  The -dr option will work properly if you do\nthis to calculate reflected beam radiation.\n\nI regret that I don't have a script to provide,  but my 2005\npresentation covers this in overview:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop4/cd/website/PDF/Ward_rtcontrib.pdf\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "<15D4F87F-D6D7-4E17-92F6-A00839213546@lmi.net>", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA320C46211B58@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<AANLkTim2TAFnoh3vylXbEhOkntmPYecQD0zJ_vocsABz@mail.gmail.com>,", "<15D4F87F-D6D7-4E17-92F6-A00839213546@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Jun  2 07:41:26 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Specular Reflections with the Daylight  Coefficient Method"}
