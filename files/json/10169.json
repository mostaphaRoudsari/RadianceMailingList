{"body": "\nDear group,\n\nTwo years after Greg's presentation (Fribourg 2008) on Surface Depth\nHallucination, I would like to experiment with the suggested procedure\nwithin Radiance. The article \"A Perceptually Validated Model for Surface\nDepth Hallucination\" says ''Once we have an albedo map and a depth map for\nour surface, virtually any rendering algorithm may be applied. We use\nthe *Radiance\n*physically-based renderer.\" Are there software or resources available which\ndescribe in more detail how albedo and depth maps can be achieved and used\nin Radiance?\n\nMy best,\n\nIebele\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100608/a98a3995/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Iebele Abel", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikuRQJ5rkig-mthXHTCeOqu1NlHzMgH85BfBujC@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jun  8 08:19:10 2010", "email": "iabel at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Surface Depth Hallucination"}
