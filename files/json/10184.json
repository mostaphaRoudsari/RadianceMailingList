{"body": "\nHello All,\nI have a pic file of an indoor scene with windows that I want to test\nwith varying visible transmittance of the glass. Without having to run\nrpict again, is there a way of dropping down the sky luminance using a\nmultiplier OR to uniformly drop down the light in the scene by combining\nthe pic (using pcomb) with pic file of a screen of a specific\ntransmittance? In other words, can I just filter down the light levels\nuniformly in the scene without having to run rpict again.\nThanks.\nAutif\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100610/19edfcfb/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Can this be done with pcomb?", "sender": "Autif Sayyed", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AA9B9F375669B94D9634E480F2EC721C071FB965@ossa.TWGI.com>", "refs": ["<humbjk$6c7$1@dough.gmane.org> <4C0FAE06.1090703@transsolar.com>", "<huoens$9bk$1@dough.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 09:24:55 2010", "email": "AutifS at TWGI.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Can this be done with pcomb?"}
