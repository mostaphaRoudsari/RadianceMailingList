It should behave just like trans at that point -- it\nwon't create any virtual sources, which is presumably why you would use\n'mirror' in the first place.  Virtual sources only get created for\nplanar surface types:  'polygon' & 'ring'.  Any other surface type\n(including meshes) just get treated normally.\n\nFor a 90% reflective material with 10% transmission, the following\n'trans' should work:\n\nvoid trans mirror_mat\n0\n0\n7 .92 .92 .92 .9 0 1 1\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Transparent Mirror Materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Dec  3 18:29:45 2004"}
