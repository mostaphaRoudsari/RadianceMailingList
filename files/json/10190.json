{"body": "\nHi, everybody,\n\nWhen I type \"objline buildings.rad | x11meta\" and return in the Terminal in\nMac OS X Snow Leopard, the *X11 window showed up for a very very short of\nperiod and then disappeared immediately*.\n\nAs to my understanding, what we'll get by execute the objline command is an\nimage with four wire frame views of the geometry described in a specific\n.rad file and the image window will stay on the screen rather than flash and\ngone, am I right?\n\nIt seems the rest Radiance commands are still working. I can use Python to\nexecute in batch those most fundamental radiance commands like getinfo,\ngensky, genbox, oconv, rpict, rvu, etc. with images displaying correctly.\n\nSo, can anybody help to point out what's wrong here and how to fix it?\n\nBoth my Mac OS X system and my Radiance are fresh installation.\n\nI install the latest Radiance following the guide from the this website\nafter I tried and failed by following the README file in the installation\nfolder of Rad4R0.\nhttp://www.designcommunity.com/forum/8756.html\n\nIs it because my Radiance is not properly installed?\n\nReally appreciate your help!\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100611/5798d497/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?UTF-8?B?SmkgWmhhbmcg5byg5YaA?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTilO-MLxMVlabPfe6FnwG9E0mmOEomZ0A89OtWkm@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 07:00:54 2010", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] objline doesn't seem to work properly and X11window flash and gone very quickly"}
