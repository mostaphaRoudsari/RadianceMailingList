{"body": "\nOops. Yeah, I guess step zero is: \"get the developer tools installed on your system\". Sorry about that!\n\nThe developer tools (now called XCode) include the compiler and the program \"make\", which you need to compile the source code (and its absence on your system is causing all your error messages there). XCode is a free (but large) download from Apple:\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html\n\nYou have to create a developer account, but its free and amounts to a login/password. Grab XCode and install it, making sure you install all the X11 dev stuff, then go back to that ray directory and try rerunning ./makeall install and we'll go from there.\n\nOn Jun 11, 2010, at 11:30 AM, Ji Zhang ?? wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100611/d0712107/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "<AANLkTikbTNr_fLY5dL-r75Q7Z18FDeyWYAwZdqLqousQ@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BE7B526C-B4E7-4C18-A0E4-A98540C6787F@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<8EF421DC-E12D-4AF0-B1F4-C24AC56D1346@dmu.ac.uk>", "<AANLkTimEH3PJZPuUxYyyH812S_jw9zPjirCbHXr8Ar8P@mail.gmail.com>", "<8342DDAA-380E-4DE5-9387-FDC830191009@rumblestrip.org>", "<AANLkTikbTNr_fLY5dL-r75Q7Z18FDeyWYAwZdqLqousQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 10:39:06 2010", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] objline doesn't seem to work properly and X11window flash and gone very quickly"}
