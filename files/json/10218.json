{"body": "\nHi all:\n\nI have some questions.\n\n(1) Besides measure, through which methods I can find the common values of\nmaterial property, such as RBG, reflectivity and roughness value? I know\ntwo places: Colar picker at http://luxal.eu/resources/radiance/index.shtml\nand Ecotect which provides some examples, but RBG values are not 0-1, should\nI divide the RBG value by 255?\n\n(2) When typing \"man texfunc\", I can not find the command. Is that my\ninstallation problem?  I use ubuntu and Radiance version 4.0.\n\n(3) Is that right I can add texture and pattern by using procedural\nfunctions (e.g. wrinkle.cal) and bitmaps accoring to\nhttp://www.artifice.com/radiance/rad_materials.html ?  If I have an image\nwith an .png extension, how can I add the image as the the pattern ?\n\nThank you.\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100706/a17d0511/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTildptDIkXTVcKQk8JnZvHatsl6Ywmm5kNpoo2es@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jul  6 19:25:07 2010", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] materials and texfunc"}
