{"body": "\nHi Jia,\n\nSome quick answers:\n\n1. The Luxal resource is an excellent starting point for values, but yes measurement of your own samples is the best way. The macbethcal procedure that is documented in Rendering with Radiance is very useful, too. If Ecotect is giving RGB values in the 0-255 range, then yes you would divide the color channels by 255 to get a 0-1 value that Radiance expects.\n\n2. textfunc is a Radiance material primitive, not a program, so there is no manual page for it. Its use is documented in the Radiance reference manual and several other places. Linkage:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf\n\n3. To use a .png as a pattern, you need to save it in .hdr format for Radiance to use it. if you first convert the .png to .tiff, you can then use ra_tiff to convert it to .hdr format thusly:\n\nra_tiff -r pattern_image.tif pattern_image.hdr\n\nAxel Jacobs has some good stuff on using images as patterns in his tutorials.\n\nHope this helps...\n\n- Rob\n\nOn Jul 6, 2010, at 8:25 PM, Jia Hu wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100706/3d3a47be/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] materials and texfunc", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AC962B6E-6D05-4B87-BFB2-DF8B120EDDD8@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<AANLkTildptDIkXTVcKQk8JnZvHatsl6Ywmm5kNpoo2es@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul  6 21:46:17 2010", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] materials and texfunc"}
