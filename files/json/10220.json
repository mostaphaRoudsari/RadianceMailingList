{"body": "\nThank you very much. I am learning the tutorial of Axel Jacobs. It is very\ngood.\n\nIn Ubuntu, I built materials,  rad, sky.mat, sky.rad and .vf. files, when I\nuse oconv to compile them, I have to input the command into the terminal\nwindow of Ubuntu to execute the command. Can I just run a script which\ncontains multiple commands such as oconv and rvu?\n\nThanks,\n\nJia\n\nOn Wed, Jul 7, 2010 at 12:46 AM, Rob Guglielmetti <rpg@rumblestrip.org>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100707/2b103dea/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] materials and texfunc", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTiny4Im2vz1UILE6t1ddCf0j0LkLnWaDHtTy5Dw-@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTildptDIkXTVcKQk8JnZvHatsl6Ywmm5kNpoo2es@mail.gmail.com>", "<AC962B6E-6D05-4B87-BFB2-DF8B120EDDD8@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Wed Jul  7 18:25:53 2010", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] materials and texfunc"}
