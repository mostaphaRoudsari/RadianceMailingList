{"body": "\nYou can even call rad from within a script.\n\nDefine only the common settings for rad within the rif file, and those that change after each rad command within the script (scene=___ PICTURE=___ ). Check the rad manual page for usage syntax.\n\nA few of rad's variables assign naming of output files, including PICTURE, OCTREE, RAWFILE, and AMBFILE (others?). Be sure to assign these names differently for each option in the script, otherwise your output images will default to common rif file name, or you could accidentally share an ambient file between options.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100708/d69e4044/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] materials and texfunc", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B0478FF8EC79@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<8B1AE209-7D16-4018-851A-77F9DE601A69@gmx.net>", "<C85B477F.5099%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<AANLkTikBxC0_U_blPEPYdxV5rixW9rf-CVougqTs6ndx@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jul  8 12:18:26 2010", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] materials and texfunc"}
