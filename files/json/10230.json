{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI think that for most types of Radiance automation/scripting, I would\nsuggest the following:\n\n* make - for automating basic repetitive tasks including calls to\nrad or other radiance programs\n* perl or python - offer robust programming capabilities. Both are\nquiet industrial strength, although I have been a perl person for\na long time, my impression is that coding in python is perhaps a\nbit cleaner (shocked gasps from those who know me...)\n\nThis being said, a few comments on the following:\n\n* bash/csh - if you end up needing to reference/modify any of the\nscripts that are included with the Radiance distribution then you\nwill need to get some understanding of these scripting languages\n* bc/awk/sed - it has been a long time since I have had to deal with\nany of these, I would suggest that it would be easier to do in\nperl/python\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\nThomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] python", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4C372DC7.4080802@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTil23grfkwoia0OUheui7xAcp68LUPPbE5KRXXOX@mail.gmail.com>", "<AANLkTimg8meHlpZjcRUUPQuKvMNqrdKte8tmaAr4n6Fs@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Jul  9 07:11:14 2010", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] python"}
