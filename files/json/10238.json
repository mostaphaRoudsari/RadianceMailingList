{"body": "\nDear Radiance experts,\n\nI found that the rtrace output may differ every time I execute this command,\neven if the oct file and the sensor point file are the same.\n\nThe rtrace command I'm using is:\n\ncat SENSORS.pts | rtrace -I -aa .2 -ab 8 -ad 1024 -as 512 -h -w -oov\nscene.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)' >\nRESUTLS_lx.dat\n\n\nin which:\n1) \"SENSORS.pts\" describes the sensors' xyz coordinates and xyz vector,\n2) \"scene.oct\" describes the geometry, material, and environment and sky\nconditions (overcast sky with zenith radiance value set at 22.86)\n3) \"RESULTS_lx.dat\" is expected to contain the xyz coordinates and\nilluminance value of each sensor point.\n\nHowever, I found that the output values in the RESULTS_lx.dat file varies\neach time I execute this rtrace command in the Terminal in Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nIs it normal? or is there anything wrong with my rtrace command parameters?\n\nHope you can help me on this!\n\nThanks!\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100713/95d97f34/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTilkZG4CNUvnqdjLrTiNJcF5z7Wezfs08ZMtG0fn@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jul 12 21:41:41 2010", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtrace result varies for each calculation"}
