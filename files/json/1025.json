{"body": "\nHi-\n\nI have been using a script with rtrace to calculate the illuminance\nvalues on a grid of points representing the work surface in my modeled\nroom. But now I would like to generate a false-color image of the\nilluminance values on a plane .8m above the floor. I can easily do\nthe floor (or walls, etc.) with a parallel projection view, but I\ndon't see how to get the workplane illuminance values without creating\nan opaque surface at the correct height which would change the light\ndistribution. Does anyone know of a way to specify a \"virtual\" surface\nor other technique to do this?\n\nThanks,\nJim Estes\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jim Estes", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<40DF35DC.704@austin.rr.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Jun 27 23:02:29 2004", "email": "jmestes at austin.rr.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminance calculation on a virtual surface?"}
