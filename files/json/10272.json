{"body": "\nI have a pile of data from an actual test room, with more coming, and a\nRadiance model under construction. Do people have an opinion as to\nwhich sky model might best reflect the actual skies of Berkeley,\nCalifornia? I've got some reading ahead of me, Perez and Shirley and\nperhaps some CIE documents, but I'm wondering if anyone has perhaps\nsome thoughts or cites to share. The test room is, yes, in Berkeley,\nCalifornia.\n\nBTW, I did find the discussion of sky modeling on the list in October\nof 2003.
