{"body": "\nGreg, in this case I'm looking at a 20' linear fluorescent\nIndirect/Direct pendant.  The IES file is for a 4' section and I would\narray it 5 times.  A sphere with 2' diameter would probably not work if\nthe suspension length were less than 2' since this is a partially\nindirect pendant..  Also, not sure if having the pendant poking through\nthe illum sphere would work.\n\nI thought of a different way of handling this.  Since the ies2rad\nprogram creates the top and bottom rectangles in this case, why not just\nuse an illum material with a void modifier to create the edges of the\nbox?\n\nThanks for the response.  It would certainly be faster to use the -i\noption.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\nillums\n\nwhen\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040624/1b9bacff/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<s0da8fa5.049@wmtao.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun 24 15:24:21 2004", "email": "MdelaFuente at wmtao.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES file manipulation"}
