{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to understand the output of mkillum. The dat-files are\nwritten in Radiance's standard format. So I should be able to understand\nthe header. However I am not really sure whether I am doing the right\nthing here. Take an example:\n--\n2\n1.041667 0.041667 13\n0.000000 6.283185 39\n\n1.504918e+00 1.530097e+00 1.525389e+00 1.501599e+00 1.505246e+00\n1.461270e+00 1.463038e+00 1.489136e+00 1.481565e+00 1.451201e+00\n1.374334e+00 1.296027e+00 1.410817e+00 1.343876e+00 1.477319e+00\n1.365996e+00 1.366200e+00 1.397315e+00 1.407394e+00 1.484092e+00\n1.482776e+00 1.570183e+00 1.525340e+00 1.572320e+00 1.561935e+00\n1.576046e+00 1.486079e+00 1.629394e+00 1.528797e+00 1.621227e+00\n[...]\n--\nMy understanding:\n\n1) I have a two-dimensional array (line 1) of 13 rows and 39 columns\n(lines 2, 3), right?\n\n2) The rows are counted down from 1 to 0 (the 0.041667 probably is some\nerror to avoid 0), thus in steps of 1/13=-0.0769 .\n\n3) The columns are counted up from 0 to 2*pi in steps of 6.2832/39=0.1611 .\n\n4) This means that the columns represent the \"azimuth angle\" (the angle\nin the plane of the illum surface) from 0 to 2*pi radians, the rows are\nrelated to.... what? If it were the elevation angle (the angle to the\nsurface normal of the mkillum surface), why is it not counted beyond 1\nradians? Or what else is it?\n\nIn illum.cal which is referred to by the illum-modifier generated by\nmkillum, I find these comments:\n--\nFor the hemispherical case, A1-A9 are the unit vectors for the\nhemisphere's coordinate system:\n\nil_alth         - Altitude (1 to 0) for hemispherical coordinates\nil_azih         - Azimuth (0 to 2*PI) for hemisphere\n--\nIt would be great if anyone could shed some light onto this...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100720/03c46c95/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
