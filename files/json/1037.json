{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI have a question regarding the proper use of colorpicts.\n\nI have \"calibrated\" pics of materials (using macbethcal) that I used to\nget the rgb-values for material definitions. These samples have\ntypically dimensions of about 30 x 20 cm (similar to the Macbeth\ncolorchecker). I rendered using the materials colors obtained from\nthese samples.\n\nNow I want to map pictures onto the surfaces. I still want to use the\ncolor as obtained from the sample. But the mapped picture is usually\nmuch larger than the sample. So I would need a way to bring the average\ncolor of the picture to the (average) color of the calibrated sample.\nIs there a way to do that with Radiance's tools? I could use these\nmappings on a clear white (.9 .9 .9) surface than, right?\n\nIs there a way to use the pic only as variation of the color? E.g.\nconverting from radiance pic to a file that could be used by\nbrightdata? I could use the color from the calibrated (small) sample\nthan, and the big pattern only to map some structure.\n\nThe way I used so far: applying normpat to a grayscale pattern, and\nmapping that onto the surface which has the color measured from the\nsample. Similar to using brightdata, and not able to reflect the color\nvariation.\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
