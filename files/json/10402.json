{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\n\nI can't answer any of your technical questions, but I spoke to a Siteco\nrep a few months ago. I ask her about Radiance cal files for their fancy\nglazing. Her reply was that Siteco do have Radiance descriptions of\ntheir advances glazing products, but are 'very reluctant' to give them\nto anybody.\n\nHer explanation to this was that in order to get that advanced glazing\nworking correctly, the optimum orientation of the panels needs to be\ndetermined based on window orientation and slope. It is quite easy to\nget this wrong, in which case the product would actually reduce the\ndaylight rather than improving it. Subsequently, Siteco's product would\nappear to be rubbish.\n\nWith this in mind, Siteco do free-of-charge calculations when you decide\nto go with one of their products, making sure that if someone gets it\nwrong, it'll be them.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Prismatic glazings", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4C3D8D7B.6040706@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4c3d8025.01a9640a.0408.51b7SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Jul 14 03:06:51 2010", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Prismatic glazings"}
