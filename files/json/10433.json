{"body": "\nHi,\n\nthe typical way to automize the steps required to get an image from\nyor scene is to write a rif-file and let rad (look at the manpage of\nrad) determine what has to be done. It is a bit like using make. I\nwould recommend not to copy one of the complete and complex rif-files\ncoming with the examples, but to start with a minimal one.\n\nThis again is very nicely doable following Axel's tutorial!\n\nGood luck, cheers, Lars.\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
