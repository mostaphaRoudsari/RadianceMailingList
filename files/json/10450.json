{"body": "\nDear colleagues,\n\n\n\nSome of you might be interested in a new Radiance/Daysim plug-in that we\nhave developed for the Rhinoceros - NURBS modeling for Windows\napplication. The plug-in, called DIVA-for-Rhino, supports a series of\nperformance evaluations including:\n\n\n\n- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)\n\n- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)\n\n- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)\n\n- Glare analysis (Evalglare)\n\n- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)\n\n\n\nThe plug-in offers a highly optimized simulation workflow within\nRhinoceros and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in\norder to generate animated Radiance/Daysim simulations.\n\nMore information can be found at\nwww.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. You can download the\nplug-in from www.diva-for-rhino.com.\n\n\n\nHappy simulations!\n\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec, Kera Lagios and Jeff Niemasz\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100803/07c40f7f/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF077CA129@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Aug  3 19:31:18 2010", "email": "reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] DIVA-for-Rhino"}
