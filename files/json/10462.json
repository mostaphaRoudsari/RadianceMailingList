{"body": "\nOne other hint... for anyone who is entering the world of building\nmodels, I can recommend formZ. It combines CAD and modelling features\nand supports a broad range of 2d and 3d formats. We have used it with\nsuccess to create models for Radiance via dxf (and then Schorsch's\ndxf2rad) and obj, and I have also verified that you could even use\nbrlcad as a converter to keep all CAD data in IGES and convert\niges-obj-Radiance (that would mean a neutral CAD standard linked to\nRadiance).\n\nHowever the most important is to learn modeling for simulation is\ndifferent from producing architectural drawings. And... I usually use a\ntext editor for that reason, no CAD.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100805/6a7ebe21/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radout", "sender": "Lars O.
