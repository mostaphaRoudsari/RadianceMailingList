Make sure the outer\nvertices are in counter-clockwise order around the normal, and the\ninterior (hole) vertices are clockwise.  Then, the algorithm goes\nsomething like this:\n\nFirst N vertices are N vertices of outer contour\nNext M1 vertices are M1 vertices of hole 1\nClose hole loop with vertex that is copy of the first hole vertex\nClose seam by adding copy of last outer contour vertex\nRepeat 3 steps above for each hole contour\n\nIn Radiance, polygon seams can cross all over each other and it doesn't\ncreate any artifacts.  This is how fonts are rendered, for example.\nThis is also why I never bothered implementing holes in polygons; I\nnever found where seams caused a problem, and I couldn't think of any\nway besides seams for implementing holes.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<Pine.BSF.4.58.0501060948510.78081@emancholl.pair.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jan  6 17:22:53 2005"}
