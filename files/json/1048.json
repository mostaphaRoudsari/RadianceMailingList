In the scene file, you would modify your gensky line\nto read:\n\n!gensky 6 21 12 | rcalc -p -i sunlight.fmt \\\n-e 'sr=1.035*si;sg=1.003*si;sb=0.826*si' \\\n-o 'void light solar 0 0 3 ${sr} ${sg} ${sb}'\n\nThe color for the sun is converted from the CIE (x,y) chromaticity for\nstandard illuminant B, which is (0.3485,0.3517).  The file\n\"sunlight.fmt\" must contain the following:\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 ${si} ${si} ${si}\n\nYou'll need the latest version of rcalc (3.6.1 release), as previous\nversions did not have the -p option.\n\nHope this works for you.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sun Color", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jan  6 17:38:09 2005"}
