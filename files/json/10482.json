{"body": "\nHello Christoph.\n\nI don't quite understand how you want to create a \"reflected\" sun without\nknowing the position and orientation of the reflecting window. And if you do\nknow that why don't you just use a \"mirror\" material for this window which\nwill create the reflected sun for you?\n\nAnyway, back to creating a second sun:\n\nOn Wed, Aug 11, 2010 at 3:36 AM, Christoph Begert - SBE <\nChristoph.Begert@sbe.com.au> wrote:\n\nI was thinking of adding another line into my sky file, however am not\n\nIf you look at the output of a gensky command for skies with sun (\"+i\" or\n\"+s\" option) you will find the definition for the sun; something like this:\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 6.92e+06 6.92e+06 6.92e+06\n\nsolar source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.067845 -0.617210 0.783868 0.5\n\nThe definition of \"solar\" defines the intensity of the sun which you have to\nmodify according to the reflection of the glazing.\n\nThe second block creates the actual sun with the first 3 parameters as\ndirection vector. This vector needs to be modified by \"reflecting\" it on the\nplan of the reflecting window. You should be able to find the math for the\nthat on the internet.\n\nThe fourth parameter is the size of the sun (in degrees) and can probably\nstay unchanged.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100811/6072a903/attachment-0001.html\n", "replyTo": "<83C0527DB301124DA259186C7039281204472982@ptamel05>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikDGVYggiW6Kzoh9fyF75MLNyzWuqRiYsz2OB8S@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<83C0527DB301124DA259186C7039281204472982@ptamel05>"], "datetime": "Wed Aug 11 01:30:38 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modelling reflections from surroundingbuildings"}
