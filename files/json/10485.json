{"body": "\nHi Thomas, Lars and Jack\n\n\n\nThanks for your answers.\n\n\n\nThe aim is to determine what performance the blinds need for protection.\nSo I identified a few critical cases, one includes reflection from\nsurrounding buildings towards the west. These have very reflective\nfacades, which means that they get some glare on this side during the\nmornings. Since it is a rather simple model and because I lack detailed\ngeometry data of the surroundings, I thought adding a sun in the view\nfor the as a reflection is a bit quicker than placing a mirror.\n\n\n\nAnyway, thanks again.\n\n\n\nGreetings from Melbourne\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\nChristoph Begert\n\nAssociate\n\nsbe\n\nsustainable built environments\n\nInnovative ideas, collaborative design, practical solutions\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nThomas Bleicher\nSent: Wednesday, 11 August 2010 6:31 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\n\nHello Christoph.\n\n\n\nI don't quite understand how you want to create a \"reflected\" sun\nwithout knowing the position and orientation of the reflecting window.\nAnd if you do know that why don't you just use a \"mirror\" material for\nthis window which will create the reflected sun for you?\n\n\n\nAnyway, back to creating a second sun:\n\nOn Wed, Aug 11, 2010 at 3:36 AM, Christoph Begert - SBE\n<Christoph.Begert@sbe.com.au> wrote:\n\n\n\nI was thinking of adding another line into my sky file, however\nam not totally sure how to exactly do this and was hoping that someone\nhere could help me with this.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the output of a gensky command for skies with sun (\"+i\"\nor \"+s\" option) you will find the definition for the sun; something like\nthis:\n\n\n\nvoid light solar\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3 6.92e+06 6.92e+06 6.92e+06\n\n\n\nsolar source sun\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4 0.067845 -0.617210 0.783868 0.5\n\n\n\nThe definition of \"solar\" defines the intensity of the sun which you\nhave to modify according to the reflection of the glazing.\n\n\n\nThe second block creates the actual sun with the first 3 parameters as\ndirection vector. This vector needs to be modified by \"reflecting\" it on\nthe plan of the reflecting window. You should be able to find the math\nfor the that on the internet.\n\n\n\nThe fourth parameter is the size of the sun (in degrees) and can\nprobably stay unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100812/875e9447/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "<AANLkTikDGVYggiW6Kzoh9fyF75MLNyzWuqRiYsz2OB8S@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<83C0527DB301124DA259186C7039281204472988@ptamel05>", "refs": ["<83C0527DB301124DA259186C7039281204472982@ptamel05>", "<AANLkTikDGVYggiW6Kzoh9fyF75MLNyzWuqRiYsz2OB8S@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Aug 11 16:57:16 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] modelling reflections from surroundingbuildings"}
