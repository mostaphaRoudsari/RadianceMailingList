{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nI suppose this belongs in a FAQ.  If you read the fine print on the -i option, you'll see that it differs in an important way from -I.  In the -i case, rays are traced to surfaces, where irradiance is then computed.  Using -I, rtrace computes irradiance from input interpreted as measurement points and orientations.  Thus, you don't need to have actual surfaces where you measure using -I.\n\nIn short, your two calculations are measuring different values, probably at different positions in the scene as well as in different directions.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] illuminance measurement", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<38673122-32DC-4236-A5ED-B35350B8E04E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<D98B6025-7BB1-416F-965B-76C13E4F836E@bb3.net.au>"], "datetime": "Mon Aug 16 00:12:41 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] illuminance measurement"}
