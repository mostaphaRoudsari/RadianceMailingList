{"body": "\nGreetings from inside the octree.\n\nI'm trying to make a script that will as one of its steps call rtcontrib and\ncompute a set of daylight coefficient images, based on Axel Jacobs'\ntutorial.\n\noptions (in a file called rtc.opt), the following command...\n\nvwrays -ff $vw | rtcontrib @rtc.opt -fo -ffc $(vwrays -d $vw) -f\ntregenza.cal -b tbin -o images/patches/treg%03d.hdr -m sky_glow model_dc.oct\n\n...works. I get treg[000-145].hdr in my images/patches directory. This is\ngood.\n\nBut if I try to put the same construct into a Ruby script (note slightly\ndifferent variable names), the following command...\n\nvwrays -ff #{vw} | rtcontrib #{rtc} -n 15 -ffc $(vwrays -d #{vw}) -fo -f\ntregenza.cal -b tbin -o #{Dir.pwd}/output/dc/test/treg%03d.hdr -m sky_glow\nmodel_dc.oct\"\n\n...does not work. Fail. Boo. What I end up with is just a single\ntreg000.hdr. Any ideas why? I have a feeling the system doesn't like the\nvwrays call inside of the rtcontrib call. Anyone know how to pass this\nthrough from Ruby without a problem?\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C891B0A3.5A1B%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Aug 18 14:45:34 2010", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rtcontrib inside of script"}
