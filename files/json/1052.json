{"body": "\nHi Olga,\n\nThere is no method provided for looking at the ray values in a holodeck\nin ASCII format, as I never found this useful even for debugging\npurposes.  The data is organized in a very hard-to-understand way, and\nthe individual ray values are so many that I'm not sure what you would\ndo with them if you had them.  However, there are a couple of useful\nutilities for holodecks that you might enjoy:\n\nrhinfo\t- prints the header and grid information from a holodeck file\nrhcopy\t- copies information from one holodeck to another, or from a\npicture to a holodeck\nrhoptimize\t- optimizes beam placements in a holodeck for more efficient\nrendering\nrhpict\t- reconstructs a picture from beams stored in a holodeck\n\nWhat purpose did you have in mind for recovering ray values?\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck file", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C1F5FD5D-C342-11D8-B62A-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1087739284.40d595942ea25@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 21 09:06:56 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck file"}
