{"body": "\nHi!\n\nIs it possible to control the output in the holodeck file to be able to see the\nactual values? I already tried to add the following line to the .hif-file:\nrender= -faa, but unfortunately the output (=holodeck file) was not readable at\nall. Basicly it was the same as without the mentioned line or with -fdd instead\nof -faa. Maybe I am using the wrong command or just the wrong place for the\nright command? Or is the holodeck file not supposed to be viewable at all?\n\nregards,\n\nOlga\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "O Graf", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1087739284.40d595942ea25@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Jun 20 15:48:09 2004", "email": "s0343631 at sms.ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] output in holodeck file"}
