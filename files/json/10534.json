{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nGlad you found the error in your script.\n\nrtcontrib outputs an image or value for each bin starting at 0 up to the last bin that has a value.   So it could be that a the last few bins don't contribute to your scene so no image is created.  You can force rtcontrib to write all images/values using the -bn option.  Try setting -bn 146  if you're using tregenza.cal or -bn Nrbins if you're using reinhart.cal\n\nAlso, for the next step you may want the new (since July 1) version  of dctimestep.  It allows you to combine daylight coefficient images like so:\n\ngendaylit [options]    |  genskyvec -m 1   |   dctimestep myimage_%03d.hdr > output.hdr\n\nwhere the \"myimage\" bit matches the -o output specification used in rtcontrib.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Aug 31, 2010, at 1:59 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtcontrib question", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAA2459C-2C62-4DBF-960D-328F5F0C2303@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<C8A2C960.5D27%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Tue Aug 31 15:19:31 2010", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rtcontrib question"}
