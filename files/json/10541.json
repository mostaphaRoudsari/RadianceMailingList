{"body": "\nHi Ji!\n\n\nFrom my understanding: You want to calculate the sky view factor. The\nsky is the hemisphere above the horizon, and the sky view factor is the\nfraction of it visible from a given point. As the horizon does not\nchange with the tilt angle of the surface your point is located on, the\nnormal should still point up. If you would rotate the normal, the result\nwould not be the fraction of the sky visible, but include the ground.\nAnd as the ground is nothing but a given obstruction of the sky if you\ndo not consider indirect / reflected light, it should not be counted.\n\nI am not sure why the sky is not defined to produce 1 W/m2 in the first\nstep so that you could read out the SVF without any further division,\nbut this is the easiest part of the calculation.\n\nI hope my understanding of the sky view factor is correct..?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100901/81eb6311/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] the vector of sensor in SVF calculation", "sender": "Lars O.
