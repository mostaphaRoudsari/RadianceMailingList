{"body": "\nDear Radiance experts,\n\nAccording to the paper \"Compagnon, R. (2004). Solar and daylight\navailability in the urban fabric. Energy and Buildings, 36(4), 321-328\", we\ncan use Radiance to calculate Sky View Factor by \"using a uniform sky model\nof arbitrary luminance L and by computing the illuminance Ei without taking\ninto account the contribution of interreflections to ensure the integration\nis performed over the unobstructed part of the sky vault only\".\n\nThe formula is: SVF = Ei / (PI * L).\n\nWe use the following to define the uniform sky with a horizontal diffuse\nirradiation of 100 w/m^2:\n#########################################################\n!gensky 6 20 +15.0  -a 1.0 -o 103.0 -m 105 -u -B 100.0 -g 0.0\n\nskyfunc glow sky_glow 0 0 4 1.0 1.0 1.0 0\n\nskyfunc glow ground_glow 0 0 4 1.0 1.0 1.0 0\n\nsky_glow source sky 0 0 4 0 0 1 180\n\nground_glow source ground 0 0 4 0 0 -1 180\n#########################################################\n\nWe use the following specification for rtrace to calculate the irradiation\nof a sensor point:\naa=0.1, ab=1, ad=4096, ar=512, as=1024\n\nWe then divide the irradiation value of the sensor point as obtained by 100\n(the unobstructed horizontal diffuse irradiation as specified for the \"-B\"\noption of gensky) and this will give us the SVF of that sensor point.\n\n\nAccording to the way of calculating SVF as introduced by Compagnon (2004),\nmy question is:\nShould the vector of the sensor point being measured always point upward to\nthe zenith (in other words, the xyz vector for the sensor is 0 0 1) no\nmatter how the normal of that sensor point might oriented to?\n\nFor example, if we try to calculate the SVF of the centroid of a tilted\npolygon (a non-horizontal and non-vertical plane), should we specify the\nvector of the sensor as 0 0 1 or as the xyz vector values of the actual\nnormal of that polygon?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100901/b79558e1/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTik1us_dVGjtfLTw0NWuqDQXNc9yrML5v47JvUYD@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Aug 31 23:24:27 2010", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] the vector of sensor in SVF calculation"}
