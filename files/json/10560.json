{"body": "\nHello Greg:\n\nBecause there are blinds in the office and the rays are only from the\noutside sky (no light source in the office), is your approach still accurate\nenough in this case? I am not familiar with this approach. Does your book,\nRendering with Radiance, have some introductions to such options as \"lr\"\n\"lw\". I checked the last several chapters and did not find \"lr\" and \"lw\".\nThanks,\nJia\nOn Mon, Aug 30, 2010 at 9:55 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100830/354ea476/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reduce rtrace runtime", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTim29UGnWdiAZZ_B9atdMabd+qRdGHYsf1aZ+Kmd@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTikz6bGAFyeaYQ6KM2568H-7tG2ekFugZPk+fXFo@mail.gmail.com>", "<9ABD0CB5-5AE0-4F76-96CA-FD9E50D55878@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Aug 30 19:36:28 2010", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reduce rtrace runtime"}
