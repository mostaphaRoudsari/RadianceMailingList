{"body": "\nHello experts:\n\nI hope to calculate illuminance at 4 points in a office under four 100 sky\nconditions (each condition will generate four illuminance values). I run\nrtrace in a  computer with 4 processors and use: rtrace -w -h -I -ab 7 -n 4\n-af cachingFile.ca -ad 2048 -as 512 -aa 0.10 office.oct < points.inp | rcalc\n-e '$1=47.4*$1+ 120*$2+11.6*$3'>> output.out.\n\nI tried to run it but it took long time. My question is that whether there\nare ways of improving the rtrace command to reduce the runtime?\n\nCheers,\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100830/87e2e333/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikz6bGAFyeaYQ6KM2568H-7tG2ekFugZPk+fXFo@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Aug 30 18:11:15 2010", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reduce rtrace runtime"}
