Looking at the code, it would appear that the PRISM material\nsimply acts as a secondary light source -- a concept that is invalidated\nby the photon map anyway.

My guess is it simply won't work and immediately bail out\nsince there's no scattering routine for this specific material.\n\nYou'll probably have to go the hard way and model the prism explicitly\nusing instances, like the Y-glass example on the pmap webpage. This is\nextremely ugly, but it's the only solution I can envisage in your case.\n\n--Roland\n\n\n--\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\nEND OF LINE.
