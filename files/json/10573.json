{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nThe test in \"sourcehit()\" in src/rt/source.c works with the following priority for overlapping sources:\n\n1) Distant source modified by \"light\" or \"illum\" with an alternate material type.\n\n2) Distant source modified by \"illum\" with no alternate material type.\n\n3) Distant source modified by \"glow\" type.\n\nIf there are two or more sources, the first one found (in scene file order) is used.\n\nHope this clears things up!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4C71991A.8000606@gmx.net>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3CE3039B-AAA4-44B3-814B-FF95DBE1E8E5@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4C71991A.8000606@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Sun Aug 22 15:06:57 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] behaviour of multiple source objects in onescene"}
