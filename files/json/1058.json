After the split it isn't\ndifficult to write it out to a .rad format!\n\n\nGreg,\n\nThanks for the sketched out algorithm, I was hoping for that kind of\nresponse! By no means was my mail intended as criticism for the lack of\nexplicit holes, just hoping for a way to get passed the problem!\nI'm sure your suggested algorithm will be helpful in further development of\nmy project.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "datetime": "Fri Jan  7 12:25:25 2005"}
