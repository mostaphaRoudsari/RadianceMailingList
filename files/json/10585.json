{"body": "\nCould be reasonable. In a diffuse transmission situation I think it should be Luminance (cd/m2) = Back Face Incident Flux (lm/m2) * Diffuse Transmission (%) / Pi...   if your 18W CFL have degraded to 1000 lumens each then 4 * 1000 / 1 m2 * 50% / Pi = 636 cd/m2. Maybe your light box is smaller than 1 m2 but the diffusing surface is probably less than 50% transmission.\n\nIdeally you should try to find a luminance meter you can use to verify your camera calibration in photosphere.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100818/7b1b8c66/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] (no subject)", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B048665AF8BF@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<64B16658-D24E-4818-8C00-66B0DE60E9C6@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Aug 18 07:58:35 2010", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] (no subject)"}
