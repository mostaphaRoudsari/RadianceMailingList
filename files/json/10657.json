{"body": "\nI just wanted to add that LBNL is increasing its support for Radiance work, and plans to revamp the website as well as fund a number of improvements to the basic engine.  Thanks to LBNL, California Edison and HMG, we have new annual simulation capabilities for complex fenestration, and I am just finishing a new tool for computing BTDFs from geometric descriptions, which I will present at this year's workshop.\n\nThis is an ideal time for you to come and lobby for things you wish to see added to Radiance and improvements you would like to see to the website, which we finally have some budget to update over the next fiscal year.  We are also very interested in collaborations on annual energy simulation and BSDF measurement and modeling.\n\nHope to see you in Freiburg on the 20th.  If you are interested in complex fenestration systems, don't forget to sign up for the Wednesday course as well.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance/workshop-2010\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100907/4ce36891/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "<4C7E1A2A.2050101@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CCE5B11A-CBE4-4580-ACF6-15283FFE3EFC@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4C7E1A2A.2050101@ise.fraunhofer.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Sep  7 17:48:00 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: 9th International Radiance Workshop - stillneed some presenters!"}
