The only way\nto get the image is with a window capture.  Fortunately, X11 has a\nutility for this, called xwd.  If your image file were named \"35b3\",\nyou could call the following command once it was up:\n\n% xwd -name 35b3 -out 35b3.xwd\n\nThe xwd program looks up the window by name, then dumps its contents to\nthe file 35b3.xwd.  Unfortunately, none of the mainstream programs will\nrecognize the little-used \"X-window dump\" format, so you'll have to\nload it into GraphicConverter or somesuch and save it out in a more\nconventional format.\n\n-Greg\n(Definite oldbie)\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Tue Jan 11 18:02:01 2005"}
