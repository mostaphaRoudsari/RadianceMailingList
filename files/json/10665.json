{"body": "\nHi Radiance-gurus!\n\nI am trying to simulate a 'realistic' control of artificial lights. What you\ntraditionally would do is to control the lights based on illuminance levels\nat specified points on the working plane. But in reality you would have a\nsensor placed somewhere in the ceiling looking downwards or looking towards\nthe window. So, in stead of having the sensor points on the working plane I\nwould like to use the illuminance reading from my photocell placed e.g. on\nthe ceiling.\n\nI have two questions, one considering the rsensor program and one\nconsidering how to combine the rsensor output with rtcontrib.\n\n1)\nWhat I get out of rsensor can be illuminance readings for the specified\nphotocell?\nThe following command would generate the illuminance-level on the sensor,\nright?\n\nrsensor -ab XX -i [sensor view] sensor_file scene.oct > illsensor.dat\n\n2)\nilluminance readings from photocells defined as points - but how should I do\nit if I am not interested in the point illuminance reading, but interested\nin the illuminance level falling onto the sensor that doesn't see an\nhemisphere?\nCan I somehow replace the\n$ cat workingplane_photocell.pts | rtcontrib .........\n\nwith\n$ cat [sensor view] sensor_file....| rtcontrib...??\n\nHope my questions make sense!\n\nBest,\nAnne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100915/f827fdb9/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikQoyhKPquh949pneW7FfoTT=Ww8YxzMM0=7Aym@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Sep 15 11:17:33 2010", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rsensor and rtcontrib"}
