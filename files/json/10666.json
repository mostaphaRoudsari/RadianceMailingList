{"body": "\nHi Anne!\n\n\nBesides all the handy tools to support such modeling tasks, the most\ngeneric approach would be to render an image of what the sensor sees,\nand integrate the pixel values - if possible weighted with the angular\nresponse of the sensor. That way you can really work out the signal the\nsensor should give, and you can use the image both to understand why you\nget an observed reading and to debug. Provided of course that you know\nthe angular sensitivity and the exact field of view (which could be\ndetermined in lab if necessary).\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100915/9454676d/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rsensor and rtcontrib", "sender": "Lars O.
