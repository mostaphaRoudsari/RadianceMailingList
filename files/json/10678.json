{"body": "\nVery interesting threat Randolph. I have been recommending to my\nstudents to simply reduce the visible transmittance of the glazing by\n20% (assuming a 20% frame to window ratio). That way they can still work\nwith glass and have a fair chance of getting it right. What do you all\nthink of this?\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nMarija Velickovic\nSent: Friday, September 17, 2010 6:25 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHi,\n\nYou can try mixfunc and mix transparent material (for glazing) with non\ntransparent (for frames). If you want to add wall between,then use\nprevious mixture and mixfunc it with wall material.\n\nFor that you'll need some cal file with definition which material should\nbe 'active' for which position on the polygon surface.\n\nHope this idea helps,\nMarija\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Sep 17, 2010 at 2:04 AM, Randolph M.

Trans modified by a colorpict? Or...?\n\n--\nRandolph\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100917/e73ee208/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Simplifying Geometry: Current Practice?", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF07BFB116@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<i6ub9u$r9n$1@dough.gmane.org>", "<AANLkTik2YG+kHAfNpgG2XxdizEePooF20v5S7wnA9+cY@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Sep 17 07:56:13 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Simplifying Geometry: Current Practice?"}
