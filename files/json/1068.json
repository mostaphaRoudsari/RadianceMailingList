{"body": "\n\nHello all,\n\nI've been using Radiance now for a little while on a G4 at home that\nI've set up with ssh so that I can submit jobs to it while I'm at\nwork. And I've run into a very strange issue that I haven't hit using\nRadiance on any other platform, and seeing that several here use\nRadiance on OS X I figured I ask. I bet it's something obvious, but I\ndon't know enough yet about OS X's flavor of *nix to know what's going on.\n\nSo here's my problem: doesn't matter if I'm logged on local or via\nssh, when I run Rad, and it generates an Octree, everything is fine\nand works. But if I try to reuse that Octree in the future, or in a\nlater session, I get a strange error reporting that the system can't\nfind some temporary file that appears to have a machine-generated name\nthat's different every time.\n\nWhat's going on? Why would there be anything temporary about Octree\ngeneration?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] OS X - strange problem with Octrees", "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40CA148D.1040500@becausewecan.org>", "refs": ["<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C113A1F@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>"], "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 22:22:41 2004", "email": "toast at becausewecan.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OS X - strange problem with Octrees"}
