{"body": "\n\nDear Randolph,\n\nI have encountered this before with a complex Rhino model as well. Luckily\nOBJ files are plain text.\n\nIn my case, a few of the points in my obj file were given a normal of 0 0\n0 which obj2rad did not like. I fixed it by running a find and replace on\n\"vn 0 0 0\" with \"vn 0 0 1\" without any negative consequences.\n\nThe specific errors of bad face or triangle seem to come from bad vt\n(vertex texture-coordinate) data in your OBJ file, so I would start by\nlooking there.\n\nBest regards,\nAlstan\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: obj2rad: \"bad face\" and \"bad triangle\"", "sender": "J.
