{"body": "\nDear all:\n\n\n\nI am looking for an affordable (<$3000) set of devices that can measure\nthe spectral power distribution of light sources in the visible range as\nwell as wavelength dependant surface reflectances. Does something like\nthis exist? At the NRC we had a $10,000 Minolta spectrometer that\nmeasured wavelength dependant diffuse reflectances as well as overall\nspecular reflectance. Are there any more affordable devices? What are\nyou using for light sources?\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100923/8f2e6ca0/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF07CC4A84@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Sep 23 10:06:25 2010", "email": "reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] spectral measurements"}
