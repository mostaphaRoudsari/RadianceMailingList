I think something could\nbe improvised with standard filters and a moderately-priced camera, but\nit would take some expertise to design, fabricate, and calibrate.\nDesign expertise, of course, we have on this list, fabrication and\ncalibration, not so much (at least, I don't think we do.)  Have you\nthought about wandering over to your local physics department & asking\nfor help?  Or perhaps to MIT?  It might make a good student project.\n\nRandolph\n\n\nOn 2010-09-23 10:05:56 -0700, Reinhart, Christoph said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Randolph M.
