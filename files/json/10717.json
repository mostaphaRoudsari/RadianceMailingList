The Workshop has only been held once before in the UK (2006) and we had a pretty good attendance. Perhaps this might be a consideration in deciding where to have the 2011 Workshop -- opinions invited.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\nCundall Johnston & Partners LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales.Registered number OC300389.\nRegistered office: Horsley House, Regent Centre, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE3 3LU\nPrivilege and Confidentiality Notice: Use of this email and any attachments is subject to the terms on our Website at http://www.cundall.com/email.htm\nIf you cannot access these terms, please email terms@cundall.com with SEND TERMS in the subject heading or telephone +44 (0191) 213 1515 and we will send you a copy.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis email message has been scanned for viruses by Mimecast.
