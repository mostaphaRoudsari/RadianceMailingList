I'm really new to radiance and first I have to say:\n\nThank You Very Much For Developing And Supporting This Free Software!!\n\nRadiance is running fine on my system (far as i can see) with macos 10.3.7,\nblender 2.3.6, python 2.3.\n\nMy question is more about blender and brad because\n\neverything seems to work in general, but if i try the sky preview\ni get the following in the console window:\n\n\" ximage\n/Applications/Blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts/brad/tmp/\nmph.pic: cannot open display\"\n\nI've edited my bash_profile like it was explained from pillo:\n\n--------\nif someone is interested in using x11 as graphical output for the built\nin panther terminal this is what is required:\n\n1) launch x11, launch terminal (keep X11  always open when the terminal\nis open, otherwise it doesn't work!)\n\n2) edit your .bash_profile as follows, just add these lines:\n\nif [ -z \"${DISPLAY}\" ];then echo -n\nexport DISPLAY=':0'\nfi\n---------\n\nbut sadley it has not the desired (display-) effect to applications\ncontrolled via brad/blender, too.\n\nwould it be possible to open x-window-radiance-applications like ximage out\nof blender/python in a way that they use x-darwin and its display?\n\nthank you very much and all the best\n\njohannes\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<41E45859.6070306@pab-opto.de>", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
