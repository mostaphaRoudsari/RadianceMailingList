{"body": "\nHi Greg - I have it up running now. Had to install xcode. Btw: Installing\nxcode has some really nice side-effects that I wasn't aware of. Have tried\nto install e.g. convert and m4 on my mac but with no luck - have used these\nreally convenient programs on Linux. However, these programs are included in\nxcode, so now rsensor maybe does what I want it to (just need to plot the\nrays to verify that I get the right directions) and in addition I can make\nuse of the other programs. HURRAY!\nThanks again Greg. Have a great day!\n/Anne\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMessage: 1\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\nHi Anne,\n\nSorry about the missing files -- a lot of things are \"not quite right\" with\nthe website at the moment.  Soon to be fixed, hopefully.  I have restored\nthe missing files, which you could have gotten from radsite.lbl.gov.\n\nAnd as Thomas points out, you don't really need this for compiling the 4.1a\nHEAD.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\ncannot download the auxiliary files - they are not available on the server.\nDependent on the changes it isn't always necessary with new auxiliary files,\nright?? So I have tried to run ./makeall install without new auxiliary\nfiles. Unfortunately I'm getting installation errors. For all the\ndirectories in src I get the error \"exec: make: not found.\"\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100928/0aac5a5a/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "gregoryjward@gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<EE43CDE2-6AD4-4A28-B2A5-82129BD5FC91@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 28 Sep 2010 11:24:31 -0700", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Re: rsensor and rtcontribTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"}
