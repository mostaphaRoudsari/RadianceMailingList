{"body": "\nI forgot to mention that my \"cvs build\" of hdrgen is from last week, so there\ncould have been changes from the version you have.\n\nMartin\n\n----------  Forwarded Message  ----------\n\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\n\n\nI repeated the process using the manual mode of the camera rather than\naperture priority. Again 13 images (same room, scene was a bit different as I\neliminated the sky in the framing) and I was able to compute a hdr. But the\nalignment problem still persists, I use the -a switch to turn it off.\n\nLater I took a couple more images and used the calibration data to compute a\nhdr and read the luminance values off it. It turns out that those are\nsomewhat accurate so that's a good sign!\n\nHowever, I'm still not quite satisfied. Obviously, the calibration procedure\nis meant to give a most accurate static description of the camera, but I used\nthe camera's automatic whitebalance correction, so that's a variable. My\nquestion is a complete novice one: how does the whitebalance affect the\nluminance? What can I do to eliminate this variable (if it is significant).\n\n\nMartin\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "alex@juventuz.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<200406111421.55929.alex@juventuz.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 14:22:51 2004", "email": "Martin Matusiak", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgenDate: Friday 11 June 2004 14:17"}
