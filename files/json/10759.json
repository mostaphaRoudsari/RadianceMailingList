{"body": "\nThat sounds great Greg - THANKS. I'm *so* ready to give it a try.\n\nHave problems installing the HEAD though: Just downloaded the HEAD, but\ncannot download the auxiliary files - they are not available on the server.\nDependent on the changes it isn't always necessary with new auxiliary files,\nright?? So I have tried to run ./makeall install without new auxiliary\nfiles. Unfortunately I'm getting installation errors. For all the\ndirectories in src I get the error \"exec: make: not found.\"\n---------\nmake error:\n...\nIn directory util...\n/usr/local/ray/bin/rmake: line 2: exec: make: not found\n...\n---------\n\nFYI - my rmake script is as follows:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec make \"SPECIAL=ogl\" \\\n\"OPT=-O2\" \\\n\"MACH=-DBSD -DNOSTEREO -Dfreebsd -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib\"\n\\\nARCH=Intel \"COMPAT=\" \\\nINSTDIR=/usr/local/ray/bin \\\nLIBDIR=/usr/local/ray/lib \\\nESUFFIX= \\\nCC=cc CONFIGURE_ARCH=i386 \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\n\nWhen searching the archives I can see that some of the installation errors\nmight be due to the dev tools not being installed, so I have checked this,\nand found that in my existing dev directory, /usr/local/ray/bin/dev, the dev\n.hdi-tools are: glx1, glx1h, ogl, oglh, oglo, ogloh, ogls, oglsh, oglso,\noglsoh, x11 and x11h.\n\nAnyone know what is going wrong here??\nBest,\nAnne\n\n-----------------------\n-----------------------\nJust a quick follow-up on this.  There was some talk about the need for ray\nsample directions out of rsensor, so I added this feature to the current\nHEAD.  You simply specify a dot ('.') rather than an octree to get a set of\nsample rays instead of a summed result.  Give it a try!\n\n-Greg\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100928/8ac12d87/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTinXGby1u+T7Rm+05mMJ0rEmayJZzgDGnZ+02Zh1@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Sep 28 06:39:53 2010", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: rsensor and rtcontrib"}
