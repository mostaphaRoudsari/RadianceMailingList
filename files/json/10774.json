{"body": "\nHi John and all other members,\n\nMust say that Workshop was really nice!\nI would like to thank again to Jan and Sandra for excellent organization,\nand to Greg for making such good software as Radiance. And, of course thanks\nto all other people who were able to attend Radiance Workshop this year, and\nwho made it really interesting and useful for Radiance users.\n\nI'm also impatient to see presentations online, and try some of the things\nrelated to complex fenestration :)\n\nAlso if some photos are available from the workshop (Greg, Chang, Axel?)\nplease put them somewhere on web!\nI'll put mine photos in a few days, and send the link on the list.\n\nThanks again for wonderful time in Freiburg,\nMarija\n\n\nOn Mon, Sep 27, 2010 at 3:11 PM, John Mardaljevic <jm@dmu.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100927/be906383/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 2010 Workshop presentations, soon?", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTi=rPGABWozBXCspRgu31MJZawjxyy_T4uRtQXDK@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<63601279-B87E-4EC1-907E-45AF54086754@dmu.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Sep 27 06:26:30 2010", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 2010 Workshop presentations, soon?"}
