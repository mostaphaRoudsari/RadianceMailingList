{"body": "\nMartin,\n\nI hdr'ed all ouf the 13 images in one go, and apart for some 'poor\nconvergence' (orders 1, 3, 4 and 5) warnings, it worked fine. There is\nno apparent distortion.\n\nAs you say, the indoor scene is a bit greenish, but outdoors is fine.\nThere seems to be a lot of brown in the room (table, wall panelling). I\ndon't know if this could cause the prob.\n\nAxel\n\nPS: I don't know if Greg has recently updated hdrgen. My copy is >6\nmonths old (LINUX).\n\nPPS: With the two darkest and the two brightest images excluded, there\nis a poor convergence for orders 1 and 5 fit, but still no distortions.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgen", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40C97EAB.4000405@londonmet.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<200406101420.10983.alex@juventuz.net>\t<1DC88052-BAF2-11D8-89E2-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "<200406111113.43395.alex@juventuz.net>"], "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 11:50:25 2004", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgen"}
