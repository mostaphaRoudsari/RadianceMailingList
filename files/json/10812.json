{"body": "\nHi Lars,\nThanks for your VERY quick reply!\nYes - that was also my initial approach. But in order to get the illuminance\nfalling on the sensor I need to know the reflectances of the surfaces in the\nimage in order to convert from luminance to illuminance. And the\nreflectances might vary, so I was wondering if I could use another approach.\n..hmm..and I am not that familiar with all the handy tools ;o)...but maybe\nthere is a chance that we can discuss this at the workshop next week.\n\nAnne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100915/a23617fb/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikm7r07qACBz9_9D4xaGwwFGhTj+X+_Eq3hSbN3@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Sep 15 12:28:10 2010", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] vs: rsensor and rtcontrib"}
