{"body": "\nHi Andrew,\n\nyes, evalglare needs a 180? fish-eye(-vta)- LUMINANCE image. Internally\nit calculates the vertical illuminance as Greg mentioned before.\n\nA value of 0.4756 is a rather high value (-> 48% are disturbed by glare).\n\nAt the last building simulation conference, I suggested some \"glare\nclasses\" based on user assessments, which may help to interpret the DGP\nvalues.\n(table 5 in http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0944_951.pdf ).\nFurther details can be found also in my dissertation \"Daylight Glare in\nOffices\", which will be available in some days as pdf on our web-site.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nJan\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
