{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nThank you very much for your helpful response.\n\nRegarding the gendaylit, I use the Radiance 3R9 for CYGwin. My environment variable RAYPATH is .:/opt/radiance/lib.\nDo you mean I have to change the direction of the RAYPATH to execute the gendaylit command successfully?\n\nAlso I'm not sure which parameter I have to use for the -W parameter. I used -W 280 280, but maybe this is my mistake.\nCan you explain me what is the meaning of these two values?\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nMarion\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 2010 3:01 PM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner@radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1. gensky and gendaylit (Kerl, Marion (SCR US EXT))\n2.

You further specify the location's latitude and longitude with '-a' and '-o'. The sun position and altitude are calculated from these values.\n\n\nThe output of gensky is basically a brightness distribution definition for a sky dome. The brightness is defined by a function in the file 'skybright.cal'.\n\n\nThat's the standard notation for Radiance materials (and other objects). You have a base definition (like in 'solar' above) which does not need any advanced options or parameters. Then there is advanced definition of 'skyfunc' which adds two parameters on the second line - that's why it starts with a '2'. I don't know if the third line is used at all in Radiance but I expect they had plans for it back in the days when it was defined. For now it just says '0' to indicate that there are no further arguments on this line.\n\n\nDo you have a file called 'C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance\\lib\\coeff_perez.dat' ?\nDo you have an environment variable called 'RAYPATH' in your Cygwin environment?\nWhich version of Radiance are you using?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 80, Issue 3\n***********************************************\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 80, Issue 3", "sender": "tbleicher@googlemail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1F994EE20CC4154DBB59DDE3100F906B0474BEDB@USNWK102MSX.ww017.siemens.net>", "refs": ["<20101006190056.2AFB1E28064@hylas.siemens.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 6 Oct 2010 09:32:40 -0500", "email": "Thomas Bleicher", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] gensky and gendaylitTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"}
