{"body": "\nHi Apiparn,\n\nthe main thing is, that for the DGP the vertical illuminance at eye\nlevel is needed. Evalglare calculates this value from the given image\nand needs therefore the full 180?!\n\nIn case you are using a camera, which does not cover the full 180?, you\ncan also measure the vertical illuminance and feed this illuminance\nvalue by using the -i option. In case you are using a non-fish-eye lens\nand evalglare is blocking another view than -vta, I could send you\nanother version until the next release will be put online. Within the\nnext release, all view types will be allowed.\n\nCheers,\n\nJan\n\n\nBorisuit Apiparn wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
