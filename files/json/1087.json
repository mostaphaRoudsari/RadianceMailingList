Also, I am wondering what values would be considered acceptable for\neach of these 3 methods of determining glare (ie. VCP > 70% or 50% ??? .. what\nis generally considered acceptable?).\n\nThanks for your help,\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "furry@ihug.com.au", "datetime": "Tue Jan 18 23:26:59 2005"}
