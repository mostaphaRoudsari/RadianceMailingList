It would be appropriate for small skylights.\nThe Glare Index System was used in Great Britain, Belgium, South Africa and (slightly modified) in Scandinavia. As a recommendation, nowhere in the visual field should the luminance of any bright area exceed 40 times the luminance of  the visual task.\n\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom:\tfurry@ihug.com.au [mailto:furry@ihug.com.au]\nSent:\tTue 1/18/2005 5:26 PM\nTo:\tradiance-general@radiance-online.org\nCc:\nSubject:\t[Radiance-general] Discomfort Glare - How do I evaluate\nHi all,\n\nI working on a glare study with reflected sunlight through a skylight causing\nglare and we are evaluating different glass, laminates and meshes to mitigate\nproblems from the glare.\n\nWhen I use Radiance to evaluate each view, I can get the results for:\n- Guth Visual Comfort Probability,\n- CIE Glare Index (Einhorn)\n- Unified Glare Rating.\n\nWhat I would appreciate some advice on is which is the most appropriate in this\ncase for determining when glare has been reduced to a generally acceptable\nlevel.  Also, I am wondering what values would be considered acceptable for\neach of these 3 methods of determining glare (ie. VCP > 70% or 50% ??? .. what\nis generally considered acceptable?).\n\nThanks for your help,\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 3348 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050118/41dc977c/attachment-0001.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Martin Moeck", "datetime": "Tue Jan 18 23:59:15 2005"}
