This gives about 10 % performance when I try the benchmark\nfiles provided on Mark Stock's pages. I also submitted the result to\nhim. The opt-line in the makeall script here is as follows:\n\nset opt=\"-O2 -DSPEED=200 -mcpu=7400 -mtune=7400 -malign-natural\n-funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing -fsched-interblock -falign-loops=16\n-falign-jumps=16 -falign-functions=16 -falign-jumps-max-skip=15\n-falign-loops-max-skip=15 -ffast-math -mpowerpc-gpopt\n-fstrict-aliasing\"\n\nThose who want to try my binaries can get them directly from the\nfollowing address:\n\n3.6 patch 1 release:\nhttp://130.83.168.34/lars/rad/bin/Radiance-Darwin-PPCG4-3.6.1.tar.bz2\n\nHEAD release from 18th january:\nhttp://130.83.168.34/lars/rad/bin/Radiance-Darwin-PPCG4-\nhead20050118.tar.bz2\n\nThe files will be linked on the binary-pages I maintain on\nlgrobe.port5.com (those are linked from radiance-online.org), but the\nhost is currently down and I have to wait that my provider brings it\nback ;-)\n\nCU, and have fun, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
