{"body": "\nHi Claus,\n\nThe errors for ezxml are preventing librtrad.a from being made.  Missing librtrad causes all the subsequent errors (ld missing -lrtrad).\n\nThe part of ezxml_parse_fd that uses MADV_SEQUENTIAL is supposed to be left out when compiled on CYGWIN.\n\nFrom ezxml.h:\n/* disable MMAP on CYGWIN, seems to cause problems... */\n#ifdef CYGWIN\n#define EZXML_NOMMAP\n#endif\nI'd suggest changing those lines in ezxml.h to:\n/* disable MMAP on CYGWIN, seems to cause problems... */\n#define EZXML_NOMMAP\nSo that EZXML_NOMMAP is defined.  ezxml.h can be found in ray/src/common/\n\nI can't test this myself, so no promises that it'll work.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Oct 21, 2010, at 12:04 PM, Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101021/e0617ca0/attachment-0001.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems compiling latest release under Cygwin", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<09089BEE-74FA-4DBD-8921-9DA9D7D01C90@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DA33364@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Thu Oct 21 12:50:24 2010", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems compiling latest release under Cygwin"}
