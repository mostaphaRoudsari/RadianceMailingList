{"body": "\nHi Claus\n\nYou can find the same error report for the 3R9 release here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000870.html\n\nGrep posted a solution back then as a reply to the email which is also in\nthe archive:\n\nTry adding \"-DEZXML_NOMMAP\" to the rmake script and rerunning\n\"makeall install\" in the main directory or \"rmake install\" in the src/\ngen directory.  Th ezxml.c module is new with this release and was\nprovided by a third party, so I'm not well familiar with its\nportability issues.  So far, it seems quite robust.\n\n\nCygwin is not very popular since precompiled MinGW binaries are available or\nthe Cygwin users a quiet bunch here on the list.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n2010/10/21 Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen <cbm@create.aau.dk>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101021/2890d5e1/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems compiling latest release under Cygwin", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTik_Kub2pjKk5i5fE_QXMhdJeESvLL1OHF1Led7N@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DA33364@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Thu Oct 21 12:51:59 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems compiling latest release under Cygwin"}
