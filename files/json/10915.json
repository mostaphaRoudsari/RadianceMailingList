{"body": "\nSorry to double-post, but I almost forgot, the vh and vv horizontal and\nvertical angle parameters can be roughly determined based on the viewport\nlens length, since Rhino uses a 35mm camera. If you're always using a the\nsame length camera lens, this only needs to be done once.\n\nVH = 2.75*(180/pi) * atan[(36 / (2 * lenslength))]\nVV = 2.75*(180/pi) * atan[(24 / (2 * lenslength))]\n\nThe 2.75 is a correction factor that I found from experience approximates\nthe rhino viewport quite closely. Its probably also good practice to take\nthe floor of these values.\n\nAlstan\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rhino cameras", "sender": "J.
