I understand, you simulate your buildings\nand assess various lighting-related factors.\n\na) how do you know that the results you come up with 'reflect the true\nvalues' (I assume 'true' is +/- an error)? I agree the simulation\nresults are not completely out of order in terms of luminance, otherwise\npeople wouldn't use RADIANCE.\n\nb) once a buliding has been built, has anyone gone back inside the\noffice they simulated and obtained measurements to compare with their\nsimulation results?\n\nc) what magnitude of error is acceptable for your work?\n\nd) I've come across two opposing views on the accuracy of lumenaire\ndescriptor files provided by manufacturers. One states that these can be\noff quite a bit (I think I read that in the 'Rendering with Radiance'\nbook) and other authors strut how careful and accurate their simulation\nis by using manufacturer-provided lumenaire descriptors.\n\nSorry, if these questions sound rather trivial, but answers are highly\nappreciated.\n\nCheers,\nAlexa\n\nJan Wienold wrote:\n\n--\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDr. Alexa I.
