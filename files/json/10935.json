{"body": "\nThanks Thomas,\n\nI was missing the .; and now it finds the 3mmClear.xml file.  Sorry about such a basic error, and to think I have fallen over with that one before.  It now can't find reinhart.cal, I will dig around and sort out exactly how my .profile RAYPATH should be written, It clearly must be the way I have written that.\n\nThanks again.\n\nRegards\n\nAndrew\n__________________________\nAndrew Bissell\nB.Eng(Hons) C.Eng MSLL MCIBSE MIET\nAssociate Lighting Designer\nCundall Light4\nDirect: 0161 200 1235\nMobile: 07899 907 978\nOffice: 0161 244 5660\n?

If so\nremove it. That can make many scripts happy.\n\n2) Do you have RAYPATH set and does it include the current directory\n(single dot as in RAYPATH=\".;/usr/local/lib/ray\")\n\n3) Have you tried to specify the file name with a leading \"./\"\n(\"./3mmClear.xml\")?\n\nJust a few ideas.\n\nThomas\n\nOn Sun, Oct 24, 2010 at 2:17 AM, Bissell, Andrew <a.bissell@cundall.com> wrote:\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\nCundall Johnston & Partners LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales.Registered number OC300389.\nRegistered office: Horsley House, Regent Centre, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE3 3LU\nPrivilege and Confidentiality Notice: Use of this email and any attachments is subject to the terms on our Website at http://www.cundall.com/email.htm\nIf you cannot access these terms, please email terms@cundall.com with SEND TERMS in the subject heading or telephone +44 (0191) 213 1515 and we will send you a copy.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis email message has been scanned for viruses by Mimecast.
