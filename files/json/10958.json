Try to enclose\nyour box in another larger box and do your tests again.\n\nWhen you model a real test scene try to model the inside and outside\nof a wall separately. That should avoid errors due to interpolation in\nyour results.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "<AANLkTikNAavzdGXyWqyKMW5h0Gd-WBhQDyonJRJW9Kin@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTi=zeYGNK=qeVhZzZb9epYe-x99szbZdER9G-yit@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTikNAavzdGXyWqyKMW5h0Gd-WBhQDyonJRJW9Kin@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct 20 07:05:25 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] why sensor inside a closed box still gotirradiance reading?"}
