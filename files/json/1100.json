It will come out uncompressed, as the RLE algorithm in Radiance\ndoesn't work for scanlines longer than 32K, but otherwise everything\nshould work.  Are you getting some error along the way?  I just ran a\ntest with pcompos, creating a 50K by 50K image.  It took 9 GBytes of\ndisk space and took a few minutes to write out, but seemed OK\notherwise.\n\nCompositing tiles after filtering them separately will result in\nvisible lines at the tile boundaries in some cases.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] super high res images", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jan 20 20:07:55 2005"}
