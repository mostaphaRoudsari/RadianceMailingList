{"body": "\nWhen you say \"the sky patches' contributions to the same direction in\ndifferent positions of window are different\", are you referring to the\neffect of shading elements on the window, making those contributions\ndifferent? Because in order to model this accurately, you are correct in\nthat you need more daylight matrices (i.e. need to subdivide the window).\nAndy covers this really well in his (fabulous) tutorial (see the Appendix,\n\"Additional Considerations\").\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd, MS-5202\nGolden, CO 80401-3393\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.384.7540\nE. robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov\n\n\n\nOn 11/3/10 4:47 PM, \"Jia Hu\" <hujia06@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylighting matrix", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C8F74627.6CF9%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Nov  3 16:02:18 2010", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] daylighting matrix"}
