My understanding was that at first it would be only\na wrapper for the Radiance binaries that would provide a\nless complicated way of accessing their features from\nPython.\n\nYour idea of an enhanced 'rad' is interesting but I don't feel\nthat this is the main goal here. However, the Python package\nshould allow anyone inclined to do so to write an enhanced\n'rad' without having to deal with all the gritty details of file\nhandling and process control.\n\n\nFor a start it should be very 'generic' because it only exposes\nthe Radiance features on a Python level. I doubt that we\ncan achieve all the flexibility of Radiance on a Unix shell\nbecause that's what all the binaries are designed for. But\nwithin a Python script you can achieve the same results\nwith a few more Python commands. In most cases this\nwill also improve the readability of the script.\n\n\nKnowledge of Python will definitely be required. It's a\nPython module after all. However, all of those who have\nshown an interest in the project already have done some\nprogramming in Python and I expect that we have a fair\namount of duplicated features in our common code base.\n\nIf nothing else this project could help the known Python\nenthusiasts to share parts of their code.\n\n\nUnfortunately even within the official distribution there\nis already quite a spread of scripting languages:\nPython/CSH for building\nCSH for some scripts\nPerl for other scripts\nTCL/Tk for trad\n\nI expect that it will always be true that on Unix you are\nspoiled for choice of scripting environments and on Windows\nmost users rely on a graphical frontend like Ecotect.\n\n\nThat's because you haven't discovered the beauty of\nPython OO code yet. I agree that there is little benefit\nin rewriting shell scripts in Python unless you do\nsomething more with it (or you are not that familiar\nwith CSH/Bash programming).\n\nPython has it's strength where you extend the basic\nRadiance tools to a more complex application. That\ncould be an image manipulation app that combines\nthe various p-something tools or a script that automats\nrendering and analysis of a scene with variations.\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Python Radiance Package", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTimDJXErcAjWsGqbxbZbrCN5N4X+uXdDPdXx7a6T@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTimwYfk4rFE6p+xsKgkX8kv1s_rKVHp0R3+k0JwW@mail.gmail.com>", "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B04876C57B92@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Nov  9 08:35:18 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Python Radiance Package"}
