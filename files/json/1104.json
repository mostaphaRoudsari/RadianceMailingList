I typically have 2 to 10\nmachines that I can render on (depending on whether work needs\nthe 8-proc Opteron cluster). I'll write the rpict commands by\nhand, and \"nohup ... -t 600 ... &\" each command. Keep in mind\nthat I don't use a global ambient cache. I do the \"-aa 0 -ab\n[low] -ad [low] -as 0\" trick to prevent the RAM requirements from\ngetting too high (and to avoid having to deal with NFS).\n\nThen I just use rsync/scp to put the completed portions on one\nmachine, and pfilt there. pfilt uses only a very little bit of\nmemory, but it can be slow on massive images, especially with -r\nand decent downsampling. Compared to the rendering, though, I'll\nsit around and wait for the pfilt.\n\nM\n\nOn Thu, 20 Jan 2005, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] super high res images", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Thu Jan 20 20:27:56 2005"}
