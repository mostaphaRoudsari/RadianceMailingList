{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nOne note on the terminology, as this causes confusion often. Evalglare\nintruduces illuminance on the eye plane (if you think of a human eye as\na flat sensor) into the calculation, which stabilizes results for\nextended, non-uniform sources (window seen from close with a lot of\ndetail behind). This is referred to as vertical illuminance (as\nilluminance on a vertical plane). And completely different from the\ntypically workplane illuminance, which would be referred to as\nhorizontal illuminance or illuminance that a infinitely small imaginary\nhorizontal surface at e.g. 0.9m heigth would receive.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101118/95f80529/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glare Calculation", "sender": "Lars O.
