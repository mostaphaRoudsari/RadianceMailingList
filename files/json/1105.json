Are there any other softwares doing this? If they are many, is there anywhere that I can find some information for their differences?\n\nDoes Radiance compute light sources from hdr images?\nThe only software I know doing this is lightgen, a plugin for hdrshop.\n\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n\np.s. By the way, is there a known problem with hdrgen (for linux) alignment algorithm? I captured perfectly aligned photos (using remote capturing - connect camera with computer) and using alignement with hdrgen (not use of -a option) results very bad hdr image. Althought when alignement was disable, the result was perfect!\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050121/f02f1b7f/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Despina Michael", "datetime": "Fri Jan 21 14:28:31 2005"}
