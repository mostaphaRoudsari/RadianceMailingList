{"body": "\nDear Kam,\n\n\n\nThis posting might be better suited for the DIVA-for-Rhino forum\n(http://groups.google.com/group/diva-for-rhino) but maybe\nGenCumulativeSky is also of interest to some on the general Radiance\nlist. The program was written by Darren Robinson and generated a\ncumulative sky for annual or monthly radiation maps . There are similar\nmethods available by Francesco Anselmo and John Mardaljevic.\n\n\n\nThe program is started with:\n\n\n\nGenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 45 -o 76 -m 75 -r -E -time 0 24 -date 1 1 12 31\nepw_file > Gund_111.cal\n\n\n\nYou could try to debug your epw file from Singapore using the command\nline. We are actually working on a project in Singapore right now and\nthe local file worked for us.\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Kam\nShing Leung\nSent: Monday, November 29, 2010 5:58 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI have tried to use the GenCumulativeSky.exe programme made available\nthrough Diva for Rhino v1.1f.\n\n\n\nWhen I ran the programme on a DOS command line, it said:\n\n\n\n**\n\nError opening: SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw\n\nGenCumulativeSky: Error reading climate file\nSGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw\n\n**\n\n\n\nI tried it with the San Francisco .epw file as well but it also didn't\nwork.\n\n\n\nCould anyone advise how it can be solved?\n\n\n\nAlso, may I know what it means by \"hourshift\" in the -h entry?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nKam\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101129/565fb900/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky - problem of reading .epw file", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF0822C806@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<539219.64005.qm@web113502.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov 29 05:20:22 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky - problem of reading .epwfile"}
