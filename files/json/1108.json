{"body": "\nModel comparisons are tricky. All sorts of calibration and measurement error5s occur.  Do not use a 0.5 m box because it is too small (near field photometry problems). In addition, black has a reflectance of 5% unless you have a heavy sand texture, which gets it down to 2%.\n\nA comparison between radiosity code and radiance code is at\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/agi_rad.pdf\n\n\nThe reflectance is 50% diffuse.\n\nMartin, Penn State\n\nP.S. I would have to run point by point values to do a complete error analysis, but either Radiance or AGI32 1.7 draws the PAR beam not right. The Radiance beam looks a little bit too soft.\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi Martin,\n\nThanks for the reference file.\n\nHave you published any comparison or know of any comparison for lamps and\nenclosures such as a black box?\n\nI have constructed a simple 0.5 cube with black walls and lamp socket\ncentral to the ceiling. Should I replace my GE lamp with the PAR lamp?\n\nWith the par lamp file you sent me, do I simple draw the lamp as per its\nactual dimensions, and assign the rad file to it?\n\nRegards, and thanks for the help,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Thu 7/1/2004 10:29 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nCc:\n\n\nYou can find prepared files for incandescent lamp with clear bulb. The\nonly thing you should change is luminous flux in klm, because these\nfiles are prepared for 100W lamp. Change the line \"3 1.35 1.35 1.35\" in\nz100p.rad file for \"3 0.71 0.71 0.71\".\n\nYou can find these files at:\nhttp://lumen.iee.put.poznan.pl/kw/oprawy/z100p.rad\nhttp://lumen.iee.put.poznan.pl/kw/oprawy/z100p.dat\n\nDescriptions are in polish because these materials I've prepared are for\nmy students.\nz100p.rad includes all information about lamp, this lamp is assumed as\nsmall sphere 0.01 radius.\nz100p.dat includes information about light distribution of 100W\nincandescent lamp.\n\nYou have to use Radiance instead of Desktop Radiance to prepare\ncalculation.\n\nGood luck!\n\nKrzysztof.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nTo: <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 2004 1:42 PM\n\n(even\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 8118 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040701/97b5575c/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "anthony.farrell@dit.ie", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C113AEB@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jul  1 17:47:20 2004", "email": "\"Anthony J.
