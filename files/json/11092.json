{"body": "\nHi Lucio!\n\n\nThe difference between a frozen octree and a \"regular\" octree is, that\nthe frozen one contains all geometry that is only referenced by a\nregular octree. Thus if you compile a scene before running rtrace or\nrpict on it, a regular octree is fine, while, if you want to build up a\nlibrary of octree-objects, you would probably prefer this library to be\nindependent of any other files and thus use frozen octrees. Another\nadvantage of frozen octrees here is that speed.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101124/de68c20a/smime-0001.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Instances", "sender": "Lars O.
