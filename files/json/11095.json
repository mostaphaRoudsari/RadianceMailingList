{"body": "\nHi Roberto,\n\nI do not think that you can do that. Here is one approach that would work:\n\nassume an octree of material/geometry that is to be used as an\ninstance: object.oct\nNOTE this probably should be a \"frozen\" octree\n\ndefine: instance.rad\n\nvoid instance object\n4 object.oct -t 0 0 0\n0\n0\n\nthen you can do one of the following:\n\ndefine: array.rad\n\n!xform -a 10 -t 1 0 0 -a 10 -t 0 1 0 instance.rad\n\nOR\n\ndo: xform -a 10 -t 1 0 0 -a 10 -t 0 1 0 instance.rad > array.rad\n\n\nNote also that you could use markers and replmarks to achieve deploying\nan instance object repeatedly.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 11/23/2010 3:03 PM, caria.roberto@tiscali.it wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101123/49ebeab0/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Instances", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4CEC21B0.6060103@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<1773335.454131290542592530.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>"], "datetime": "Tue Nov 23 12:18:50 2010", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Instances"}
