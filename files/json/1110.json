You don't have to worry about\nwhat happens when one window sees another, but if you want to know what\nhappens in such cases, check out section 13.1.3 in \"Rendering with\nRadiance\" starting on page 572.\n\nIf you still have questions, maybe you could be a little more specific\nabout your concerns.\n-Greg\n\nHi,\n\n?I am calculating Average Daylight Factors by sampling the illuminance\non a grid within the room.\n\nI frequently come across situations where there are two completely\nseparate layers of glazing serving a room.? One example is for a room\nlooking into an?atrium with a glazed roof.?There is one layer of\nglazing in the window in the room, and a second in the roof.? I am not\nsure how best to treat this.???Normally I would use mkillum on the room\nglazing, and allow daylight to penetrate through the atrium roof.? Does\nanyone know if there is possibly a 2 stage procedure so that the atrium\nroof is treated as a secondary source as well as the room window?\n\nAnother example, this time with 3 layers of separate glazing, is\nwhere?there is a corridor between the?room in the above example and the\nglazed atrium, and the corridor has windows looking into the atrium.\n\nI would be glad of anyone's thoughts on this.\n\nMalcolm\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] One (or more) window behind another", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Jan 22 02:48:05 2005"}
