{"body": "\nHi Alexis,\n\nEcotect uses an entirely different method for calculating daylight\nfactors than Radiance. If I recall correctly, it uses a split flux\nmethod with relatively coarse sampling. So at best this might be useful\nfor a very very simple room (and perhaps even then for an initial\napproximation). Radiance on the other hand uses much more sophisticated\nmethods and is capable of dealing with very complicated geometry.\nChristoph Reinhart at Harvard has done some work on this.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 11/22/2010 8:56 AM, alexis Loubeyre wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101122/c315d0d5/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Ecotect 2011 and Ecote'ct v5", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4CEA857B.9080909@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTiki4EJJxPYL5aj3PA4u242VPw3OXWUFDT6tag-h@mail.gmail.com>,", "<AANLkTi=7x2FTmN5FwUcnHCwYhgBTmEqT2u31FqSbW56S@mail.gmail.com>", "<BAY158-w435F075E18A731A5715D68833D0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov 22 07:00:55 2010", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Ecotect 2011 and Ecote'ct v5"}
