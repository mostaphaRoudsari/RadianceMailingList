{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nHm, that may be to easy... e.g. if your office is on the West facade and\nyou directly look into the sun, it may be even worse at 9m distance...\n\n\nEvalglare includes the vertical illuminance into its glare predictions,\nand (Jan can tell more about this) has been developed under conditions\nwith higher vertical illuminance. So look at all the 9m, but be careful\nwith those low-illuminance-locations.\n\n\nNo way to fix, it is a warning to catch your attention, not a bug to fix ;-)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101118/3fbd1d00/smime-0001.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glare Calculation", "sender": "Lars O.
