{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nI recommend your \"choice a)\", and suggest you first try creating a\nrectangle that just covers the opening from the inside, then use\nmkillum to average it's output.  Keep your gensky command in the scene\n(let \"rad\" automate things for you if you like), whether you want to\nlook out the window or not.  The largest source of error from applying\nskyfunc directly to fenestration is the lack of the building shadow on\nthe ground plane, leading to overestimation of the upward component\nfrom the window in cases where the sun is on the other side of the\nbuilding.  Applying mkillum avoids this error, besides accounting for\nthe framing of the window panes and the circular shape of the opening.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] windows: illum useage?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E6D37F2E-CBD6-11D8-BF6D-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<66D4238C-CB4C-11D8-8841-000A959DDB22@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Fri Jul  2 05:22:12 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] windows: illum useage?"}
