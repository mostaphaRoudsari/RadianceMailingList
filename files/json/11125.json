{"body": "\nHi Randolph,\n\nIt's a bit tricky to modify skybright.cal to account for an elevation causing the horizon to be below a 0-degree altitude, but it's possible.  First, you should check that it's necessary.  The formula you want for the angle below the horizon is:\n\ntheta = acos(R/(h+R))\n\nwhere R is the radius of the Earth (about 6360 km) and h is the distance above the horizon (sea level, presumably).  Even from the top of Mt. Everest, the change in the horizon is only about 3 degrees, assuming you could see something at sea level from there, which I'm not sure you could.  (Anyone who's been to the top of Everest, please pipe in.)\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Building on a hillside", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F2D6614E-6A43-4F1C-9217-11F8105743C5@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<ibs9mi$f7h$1@dough.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov 15 14:18:24 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Building on a hillside"}
