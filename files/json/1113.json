The downside to this (other than figuring out what\nthe heck to set the parameters to) is it won't account for variations\nin reflectance with incident angle.  For this, you would have to use\nthe glaze script if you have something other than a piece of clear or\nabsorbing glass.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  If you are stuck with Desktop Radiance, you're out of luck with\nregards to glaze.  But, you could use Francesco Anselmo's Cygwin\nversion:\n\nhttp://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/cygwin/\nradiance_cygwin_3R6P1.tar.gz\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glass reflectanc", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
