{"body": "\nWell, it sounds like there is significant groundswell around this idea.  I suggest that interested parties/developers organize a host site for this effort and someone (Dave?) take charge of the project.  It's not something I can personally help with, and there aren't enough spare resources or Python experts at LBNL to manage such a project as far as I know.  Ongoing maintenance is something to think about as well, as new Radiance releases will likely continue to have some minor changes and some major additions.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Python Radiance Package", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C9FC79B1-1499-437F-A9BD-F750CC1C6FB5@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<AANLkTimwYfk4rFE6p+xsKgkX8kv1s_rKVHp0R3+k0JwW@mail.gmail.com>", "<loom.20101108T145929-866@post.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov  8 08:36:06 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Python Radiance Package"}
