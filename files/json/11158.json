{"body": "\nHello experts:\n\nI am learning the tutorial \"The Three-Phase Daylight Coefficient Method for\nSimulating Complex Fenestration with Radiance\". I am very confused with the\ndaylighting matrix.  Daylighting matrix should be a matrix with size of\nKlemsDivision* SkyPatches. Is that right D-matrix tells me\nthe contributions of  each sky patch to each Klems division (each angle?)?\nIf so, different point in the window area should have different D-matrix\nbecause the sky patches' contributions to the same direction in different\npositions of window are different, in other words, the D matrix is\ndifferent. But in fact, there is only one D matrix for a window. Could\nsomeone explain how daylighting matrix works?\n\nThank you,\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101103/3c70137e/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTi=LCGt-MjLbr=9CkBEMmdtK4wtkYLffLsC692w8@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Nov  3 15:47:19 2010", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] daylighting matrix"}
