{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm working through Axel Jacobs rtcontrib tutorial (on OSX). I'm up to the first use of tregenza.cal to generate sky patches (command below) and finding that the first image, p000.hdr, is corrupted somehow. Preview crashes when I try to open the image and when I even select it in the Finder, the Finder behaves very strangely (I think it's crashing and restarting all in the space of about two seconds). Getinfo reports what looks like a correct header, comparing the headers of p000.hdr and p001.hdr. The files are all the same size. The other images, p001.hdr to p145.hdr all open fine.\n\n$vwrays -ff $vw |rtcontrib @rtc.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d $vw) -V+ -f tregenza.cal -b tbin -o images/patches/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow testroom_whitesky.oct\n\nAny hints?\n\nJohn Ford.\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Ford", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A7782C40-C0E9-42AB-A089-F9DEEEDF211D@bb3.net.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 13:07:20 +1100", "email": "johnford at bb3.net.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib output crashes preview, finder"}
