{"body": "\nHallo.\n\nwxfalsecolor does not calculate values for luminance or illuminance.\nInstead it uses the Radiance tool pvalue to extract this information\nfrom the image. I am surprised that pvalue and Photosphere come up\nwith different values, though. Greg is probably the best to comment\non this. I myself have never used Photosphere.\n\nThe size related popup is just gives you the option to skip the pvalue\nstep when the image is loaded. It can take a while (especially for large\nimage) and for most of the features it is not necessary.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Sun, Dec 12, 2010 at 11:36 PM, Mehmedalp Tural <mtural at asu.edu> wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] about wxfalsecolor problem", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTi=bbUufw6ysbyThiCxaTozPasv=Rvd10ofHS-qo@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTinpbjekH0NQ35mbsduOHKwxT6MAe563fiOCmSXC@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 00:15:05 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] about wxfalsecolor problem"}
