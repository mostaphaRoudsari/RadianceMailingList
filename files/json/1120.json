How does one pick\nthe common exponent? How does one deal with extrem intensity values in\nthe different color channels?\nI am writing the program in C.\nCan anyone help?\n\nTHANKS\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Katja Doerschner", "datetime": "Tue Jan 25 23:07:53 2005"}
