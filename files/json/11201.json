{"body": "\nHi Mark,\nI ?resolved? the sighandler issue by applying the fix I found at:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000676.html\nQuoting:\nI came across this problem when compiling Radiance under Interix.  I\nresolved it by commenting out these three lines near the top of the file\npersist.c:\n\ntypedef void (sighandler_t)(int);\nstatic sighandler_t sig_io;\nstatic sighandler_t sig_alrm;\n\nI should warn you that I didn't look into the problem too deeply, so\nthat may or may not be the best solution!\n\nDoing exactly ?as I was told? I arrived at error free compilation, and I have had no problems running RADIANCE programs since.\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg at 01CB9C33.4B597490]\n\nSent: 15. december 2010 00:30\nTo: Radiance\nRadiance group,\n\nI tried to compile rad4Rall on a Windows 7 64 Bit Cygwin system. After making this change to ezxml.h: http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_mailinglists/general/2010-October/007397.html it compiled but with errors.\n\nThe first error I could find was:\n\npersist.c:42: error: conflicting types for ?sighandler_t?\n/usr/include/signal.h:11: error: previous declaration of ?sighandler_t? was here\nmake: *** [persist.o] Error 1\n\nSame as Claus had here http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_mailinglists/general/2010-October/007402.html\n\nWas there ever a resolution?\n\nAs a fix, would it be reasonable to merge a full set of Cygwin Radiance 3R7 bin and lib files with a partial set of 4.0 files, and just keep the 4.0 files where duplicates occur? Looks like the non-duplicates were lookamb, rpict, rtrace, rview, and rvu. Also, rayinit.cal and glazing.cal were not in the lib directory. Although, these are some pretty major files not to have compile, I just ran oconv and rpict on an old project and it seemed to work fine.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nMark de la Fuente\n\n________________________________\n\nNo virus found in this message.\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com<http://www.avg.com>\nVersion: 10.0.1170 / Virus Database: 426/3315 - Release Date: 12/14/10\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101215/c3e23a2e/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 12406 bytes\nDesc: image001.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101215/c3e23a2e/attachment-0001.jpg>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 6218 bytes\nDesc: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101215/c3e23a2e/attachment-0001.vcf>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Compiling rad4Rall on W7 64 bit Cygwin", "sender": "MdelaFuente at wmtao.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DDD8F2B@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": ["<4D07A29F0200004900013F08@mail.wmtao.com>", "<4D07A97E0200004900013F0C@mail.wmtao.com>", "<4D07A97E0200004900013F0C@mail.wmtao.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 08:41:00 +0100", "email": "Mark de la Fuente", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Compiling rad4Rall on W7 64 bit Cygwin"}
