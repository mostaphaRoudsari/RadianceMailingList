{"body": "\nHi all!\n\n\nA related question... is anyone aware of tools compareable to Optics and\nWindow that follow a more open approach of software? I have to boot into\na Windows installation (and Windows does not easily boot in virtual\nmachines any more since Vista) each time I want to start one of these\ntools, which even require administrator rights to install on a Windows\nmachine. Unfortunately it looks as no attempt had been made at all\nduring development to separate the database, calculation and\nGUI/controller code, so I do not expect these tools to become more open\nor platform independent. So did you ever come accross any development in\nthese fields?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101215/a218a221/attachment.bin>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glaze script limitation", "sender": "Lars O.
