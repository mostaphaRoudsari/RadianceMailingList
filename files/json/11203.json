{"body": "\nDear Lars\n\none tool that may possibly be a bit more open is WIS. In any case, off and\non there is an error message from a \"solver\". However, I have no idea if the\ncode would be accessible. WIS originated from a european project and so the\ncode may be available to people affiliated to european research institutes.\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n--------- Original-Nachricht --------\nVon: \"Radiance general discussion\"\nAn: \"Radiance general discussion\"\nBetreff: Re: [Radiance-general] glaze script limitation\nDatum: 15/12/10 13:15\n\nHi all!\n\n\nA related question... is anyone aware of tools compareable to Optics and\nWindow that follow a more open approach of software? I have to boot into\na Windows installation (and Windows does not easily boot in virtual\nmachines any more since Vista) each time I want to start one of these\ntools, which even require administrator rights to install on a Windows\nmachine. Unfortunately it looks as no attempt had been made at all\nduring development to separate the database, calculation and\nGUI/controller code, so I do not expect these tools to become more open\nor platform independent. So did you ever come accross any development in\nthese fields?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n(mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\" class=\"autolink)\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n(http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\"\ntarget=\"_blank\" class=\"autolink)\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101215/b48e4c04/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Achim.geissler", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<bf03e22597ff415837d397a0ccefcdee@212.203.77.242>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 15:43:18 +0100", "email": "achim.geissler at intergga.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glaze script limitation"}
