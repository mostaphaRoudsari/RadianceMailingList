{"body": "\nHi Francois,\n\nAs Greg pointed out, using different clear glass specifications for each\nlayer would really complicate things. Note the \"clear\" glass\nspecification is really to establish a default reflectance and\ntransmittance for the uncoated faced in the system. Color, Rf, Rb and\nTransmittance are derived from the other specifications (eg for SunGuard\nAg 43 or SunGuard SN 62) in this case. Have you tried defining a\nmaterial based on the exported data from Optics?\n\nHere is what I did:\n\nExport individually from Optics:\n\nSGAG43Y6.grd (3156)\nSGSN62C6.grd (3116)\nClear_60.GRD (3016)\n\nThen get photopic T, Rf and Rb for reference from Optics 5 for the whole\nIGU:\n\nRf = .178\nRb = .107\nT = .228\n\nNote that the script (optics2glazedb) is very strict on formatting. So\nthe naming in Clear_60.rad:\n\nClear_60_glass\nClear_60_front\nClear_60_back\n\nneeds to have the first \"_\" removed to result in:\n\nClear60_glass\nClear60_front\nClear60_back\n\nI suppose this could easily enough be fixed with a call to awk or perl\nto fix this type of thing on the fly.\n\nNow with Clear_60 fixed do:\n\noptics2glazedb Clear_60.rad SGAG43Y6.rad SGSN62C6.rad > francois.db\n\nNow run glaze:\n\nglaze -f francois.db\n\nbuild a 2 pane system as follows:\n\n1. Clear60\n2. SGAG43Y6\n3. SGSN62C6\n4. Clear60\n\nThis results in the following definition:\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision: 2.8 $\n# Loaded: francois.db\n# Wed Dec 15 11:14:23 EST 2010\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 2\n# Exterior surface s1 type: Clear60\n# Inner surface s2 type: SGAG43Y6\n# Inner surface s3 type: SGSN62C6\n# Interior surface s4 type: Clear60\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.177978104\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.108662425\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.225458181\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc francois\n10\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.052),ft(0.664),fr(0.083)),cr(fr(0.145),ft(0.295),fr(0.036)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.076),ft(0.708),fr(0.067)),cr(fr(0.177),ft(0.339),fr(0.076)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.11),ft(0.604),fr(0.162)),cr(fr(0.211),ft(0.333),fr(0.113)))\nft(0.664)*ft(0.295)\nft(0.708)*ft(0.339)\nft(0.604)*ft(0.333)\n0 0 0\nglaze2.cal\n0\n9\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nAlthough I am not sure what kind of rounding error is acceptable in this\ncase, the hemispherical front/back reflectances and transmittance seem\nto be well in the ballpark. If you want to go further you can look at\ncolor, reflectance, and transmittance with a simple scene using a glow\nsource with unit radiance (eg 1 1 1). Doing this yields measures  as\nfollows:\n\nRf = .181\nRb = .109\nT = .227\n\nSo here is what we get in summary:\n\n\nOptics Calculated\nRadiance Glaze Calculated\nRadiance Rpict Measured\nRf\n.178\n.178\n.181\nRb\n.107\n.109\n.109\nT\n.228\n.225\n.227\n\n\nA further piece of information that might be interesting is to obtain\nthe manufacturers calculated photopic Rf, Rb, and T for the system. I\nhave noticed that there can be small discrepancies between performance\ndata on sites and what Optics calculates.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 12/14/2010 5:47 PM, Fran?ois Cantin wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101215/0c8c58a5/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glaze script limitation", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4D08F3F7.3060804@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<F26BAA4A842DD94083472A0D31EBBB99273E5188D3@SRVHJA02.hja.local>"], "datetime": "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 11:59:35 -0500", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glaze script limitation"}
