{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nWould this really solve the problem?  Logically, it makes sense to allow the \"clear\" glass to be any uncoated glazing, but the way it's currently used in the script, it only serves as a reference point.  In fact, the first entry isn't used unless both surfaces of a pane are given as \"clear\".  The trouble, as I said, is that any coating on a different sort of glazing requires measurements of that _combination_.  I don't know how to compute the combined effect in the original example, below:\n\n\nFor this, we need to employ Optics or Window 6 or extract their simulation engine.  What I was suggesting instead is that we permit the user to enter the transmittance and reflectances from Optics for the desired pane, substituting this for the database values we would normally use.  It sort of breaks the current interaction model for the user interface, but it would allow a little more flexibility as a benefit.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  We can take this conversation offline or move it to dev if you like -- I'm not sure if it's of general interest to others on the list.\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glaze script limitation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EEF3499B-F018-40DE-BE0D-0196311A70BF@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<F26BAA4A842DD94083472A0D31EBBB99273E5188D3@SRVHJA02.hja.local>\t<F7B3FE69-6AE4-4B66-8C8A-280DAE2C43F7@lmi.net>\t<F26BAA4A842DD94083472A0D31EBBB992747C6D0D7@SRVHJA02.hja.local>", "<B52770AD-92BA-4DE5-8F5A-D9062FBBD8AC@gmail.com>", "<4D0A3BB0.8080706@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 16 Dec 2010 08:57:35 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glaze script limitation"}
