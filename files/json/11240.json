From what you have\nwritten so far you have an empty room with one window and\nexterior blinds. I assume there is no outside obstruction to the\nwindow.\n\nWithout the blinds you can cover the light distribution within the\nroom accurately with an -ab value of 3 or 4. If you add the blinds\nyou will need additional \"bounces\" to account for the light reflected\nfrom the blinds. I assume you will need at least a value of 6 to\nachieve reasonable accurate results.\n\nBefore you do your evaluation calculations you should do some\ntests to find parameters which are accurate enough for your situation:\n\n1) Use one typical scene setup and a sky definition without sun (only\nskylight and ground) and calculate the illuminance on one point with\nincreasing values for -ab. You can use the other parameters as given\nby Marija in her email; it's a good start.\nYour results should show smaller variations the higher -ab is set.\n\n2) With a reasonably accurate setting for -ab use the same scene and\nsky but define a sequence of 10 or more points from the window to\nthe back of the room. Calculate these points and make a diagram\nof the results with the distance to the window on the x-axis and the\nilluminance on the y-axis.\nYour graph should show a smooth curve falling in illuminance with\nincreasing distance from the window. If you can't make out a clean\ncurve in your plot your \"-ab\" value is too low (or other values need\nadjusting).\n\n\nYour main concern about using multiple points is the processing time.\nHowever, if you pass all the points to rtrace in one call rtrace will cache\nintermediate results from the first point to calculate the next. This will\nspeed up your calculation time so you won't spend four times as much\ntime calculating four points. If you call a separate rtrace process for\neach individual point you will see no speed up, though.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] window glass modeling", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTi=PnBiKh2u808EgDFxJ3sbUUN26GbfwQoMZvV4b@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<loom.20101228T160819-777@post.gmane.org>", "<4D1A321A.9090809@gmx.net>", "<loom.20101229T033010-194@post.gmane.org>", "<AANLkTi=R8607+ZdbE85TXgzenfJVvffXH5i8uG9k3r21@mail.gmail.com>", "<loom.20101229T161701-263@post.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 10:57:38 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] window glass modeling"}
