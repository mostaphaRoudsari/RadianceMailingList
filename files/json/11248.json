Is it right to use this set to ab (-ab 8) for the open blinds, or I\nhave to adapt (decrease) value for -ab?  I know that high value for -ab leads to\nthe longer time of calculation.\n\n\nI think that I understood this: If I use an appropriate high value of -ab for\nmkillum, after that, I can use an appropriate low value of -ab for rtrace, and\nthus, reduce a calculation time.\nI have done some preliminary calculations for an empty room with completely\nclosed blinds, four luminaires turned on, and when I used rtrace with -ab 0 to\n-ab 8 (for more accuracy), I got higher and higher values for an illuminance in\none sensor point (for -ab 0, illuminance~500 lux; for -ab 8 illuminance~800). I\nassume that the higher value for an illuminance (-ab 8) is close to correct\nvalue? (Similar situation is explained on p.43, figure 33, Basic Radiance\nTutorial, Axel Jacobs).\n\n\nMaterial for the slats is define:\n\nvoid plastic whit_0.9\n0\n0\n5  .9 .9 .9  .015 .02\n\nSpecularity :  0 - matte;      0.07 - satin\nRoughness :  0 - polished; 0.2   - low gloss\nI used a value of .015 for specularity, but if you think that I need to use a\nlower value, I will do that. Maybe a value of 0?\n\nCheers, Milan\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Milan Cakanovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<loom.20101230T172438-726@post.gmane.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 16:32:40 +0000 (UTC)", "email": "milan.cakanovic at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] window glass modelingReferences: <loom.20101228T160819-777@post.gmane.org>\t<4D1A321A.9090809@gmx.net>\t<loom.20101229T033010-194@post.gmane.org>\t<4D1B3B84.9040506@gmx.net>\t<loom.20101229T204943-444@post.gmane.org>\t<9BC1DFF4-FF71-4F34-815E-7BB7FCE49E07@gmx.net>"}
