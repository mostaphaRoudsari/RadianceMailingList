I still wrestling with\nBasic Radiance, and at this moment, I have no strength for stencil. I am a\nbeginner and too far away guru.\n\n\nThere is no outside obstruction to the window. I have an empty room with one\nwindow and exterior blinds, plus four luminaires (but I think that they do not\naffect to the complexity).\n\n\nI have done some preliminary calculations for an empty room with blinds, but\nwithout a window model, and when I use rtrace with -ab 1 to -ab 8 (for more\naccuracy), I get larger and larger values for an illuminance. I assume that the\nlargest value for an illuminance (-ab 8) is close to correct value. (Similar\nsituation is explained on p.43, figure 33, Basic Radiance Tutorial, Axel Jacobs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are useful advices. I will do what did you say, but after a holiday.\n\nRegards, Milan\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Milan Cakanovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<loom.20101230T001104-875@post.gmane.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 23:23:35 +0000 (UTC)", "email": "milan.cakanovic at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] window glass modelingReferences: <loom.20101228T160819-777@post.gmane.org>"}
