I do not plan to add a furniture.\n\n\nMy first plan was to define a few sensor points, but when I use rtrace with -ab\n6 or 8 (for more accuracy), calculation takes a long time. For now, I will\ndefine just one sensor point.\n\n\nEverything you've written here is useful, and I think it will help me.\n\nI am from Serbia. Where are you from? Because of your name and surname, I guess\nthat you are from Serbia, B&H or Croatia.\nIf I am right,\nthen Hvala i pozdrav,\nif I wrong,\nthen Thanks and regards.\n\nMilan\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Milan Cakanovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<loom.20101229T161701-263@post.gmane.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 15:23:47 +0000 (UTC)", "email": "milan.cakanovic at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] window glass modelingReferences: <loom.20101228T160819-777@post.gmane.org>"}
