{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\nTo render illuminance on a work plane, no need to input additional desk\ngeometry into the scene. Everything you add in the scene has influence on\nlight distribution and calculation time, so it is better to avoid adding of\nfurniture geometry.\nYou can define sensor point on the workplane area  (for example on height\n0.8m from the floor level), and all points should be oriented towards up in\nformat: xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir, one point per line. Example:\n0 0 0.8 0 0 1\n0 1 0.8 0 0 1\n...\n\nThen for created octree and these set of points (save points in some file),\nyou use rtrace -I option to calculate illuminance.\nHere is example command\nrtrace -I+ -h- -oov -ab 3 -ad 2048 -as 512 -aa 0.05 -av 0 0 0 -ar 100\nroom.oct < sensors.txt | rcalc -e \"$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=$3;\n$4=(0.67*$4+0.265*$5+0.065*$6)*179\"  >illuminance.txt\n\nSo rtrace command above calculates irradiance for sensor points defined in\n\"sensors.txt\". Then you pipe it to rcalc to convert it to illuminance.\n\nYou have similar method in dayfact.csh script (included in Radiance\ndistribution), so you can explore it.\n\nHope this helps,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101229/6ff49518/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] window glass modeling", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTi=R8607+ZdbE85TXgzenfJVvffXH5i8uG9k3r21@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<loom.20101228T160819-777@post.gmane.org>", "<4D1A321A.9090809@gmx.net>", "<loom.20101229T033010-194@post.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 09:32:09 +0100", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] window glass modeling"}
