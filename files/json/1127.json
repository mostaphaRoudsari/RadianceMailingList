{"body": "\nHi Charles,\n\nthank You very much for this information. It seams to be a bit like the\ndistilled information about oconv, octrees and instances over the years\n;-), and that was just what I need... Maybe one should start a\nRadiance-FAQ on radiance-online.org...\n\nI will try to use the nested-instances method you describes. Is the\nnumber of sub-instances fixed or just resulting from the -n 8 option?\nNested instances represent very well the hierarchic structure of my\nmodel. So far, I used instances for the smaller elements (with\nreplmarks)  and xformed whole building blocks containg all the\ninstances. If I replace the xform transformations by the useage of\n\"super-instances\", I arrive at the nested instance model, however, I\nwould have about 40 instances in a typical \"super-instance\". So should\nI change the -n to 40?\n\nSo far, I could not see any errors cause by the -r 256 option, I just\nguessed that I could reduce memory needs by reducing -r, as the default\nwas much lower in old versions of radiance and I remember quite well\nwhat happened when I had to increase -r some time ago...\n\nAnyway... in the worst case, I will have to give up instancing and do\nthe brute-force method with a lot of geometry, a very large octree and\nhigh memory needs. I just don't want to as I don't know how much\ngeometry will be added in the future, and also the excessive\napplication of colorpicts makes me think about memory...\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
