{"body": "\nHi Lucio,\n\nIf you are executing in parallel on a shared memory machine, are you using the -PP option to rtrace (or rpict)?  This can help to reduce memory, especially on jobs where you are loading in a substantial ambient file to start.\n\nAnother approach is to abandon ambient caching entirely, which makes sense in scenes where you have a lot of important detail, but what's most important about it is the aggregate behavior.  I think your problem falls into that category.  Unfortunately, whatever -a* settings you have worked out will have to be rethought when you do this.  I should have a good guide for how to set these parameters, but you basically start by setting -aa 0, at which point -af, -ar, and -aw settings become irrelevant (no caching), and the -ad and -as settings should be changed.  You also should look at the -lw and -lr settings, because they will have a strong influence over how deep the ray tree is explored.\n\nAxel Jacobs offers a brief treatment of these settings on page 12 of his rtcontrib tutorial, currently linked at:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf\n\nIt's probably worth a try.  I use -aa 0 routinely when modeling blind systems in mkillum, for example.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Instances", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C43A7C7D-072A-469E-A5BE-8BA6FAC32AF3@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1773335.454131290542592530.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>", "<4CEC21B0.6060103@visarc.com>", "<CC7B52EF0E443D45B11162FB554D97DF06B915F81C@EURXMBC02.global.arup.com>", "<4CED0866.2080807@visarc.com>", "<CC7B52EF0E443D45B11162FB554D97DF06B935FE90@EURXMBC02.global.arup.com>", "<4D05F826.5060009@gmx.net>", "<CC7B52EF0E443D45B11162FB554D97DF06B947B2E3@EURXMBC02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 23 Dec 2010 09:33:03 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Instances"}
