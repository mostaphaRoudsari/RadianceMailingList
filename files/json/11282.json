{"body": "\nJack, Greg,\n\nMany thanks for your help with the scripts.\n\nYour countless hours of devotion to the Radiance community and your advices are more than appreciated...... !!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nFran?ois\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 2010 7:08 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Fran?ois,\n\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way to change the way the glaze script works regarding its requirement that one surface be uncoated glass.\n\nThe trouble is one of combinatorics.  Unless we incorporate a database containing all the possible front and back coating combinations, or a model like Optics has for computing the combined effect, we can't produce the correct output.  What we really need is a more general glazing modeler that can account for every possible configuration and produces a reliable Radiance material.  Maybe Window6 will provide this at some point, but we aren't there, yet.\n\nAs you suggest, it would be nice to have at least the ability to give a single-pane glazing as part of a dual-paned system as something precomputed by Optics, but I don't think you can just substitute values in the database and get it to work.  You'd have to reprogram the script a bit, and that's not a very inviting prospect....\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glaze script limitation", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F26BAA4A842DD94083472A0D31EBBB992747C6D0D7@SRVHJA02.hja.local>", "refs": ["<F26BAA4A842DD94083472A0D31EBBB99273E5188D3@SRVHJA02.hja.local>", "<F7B3FE69-6AE4-4B66-8C8A-280DAE2C43F7@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 16 Dec 2010 10:40:06 -0500", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] glaze script limitation"}
