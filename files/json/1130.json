There are also matting issues in the final combine\nstage.  Are you working from Debevec's tutorial, which was published in\nIEEE CG&A?  See also the thread from November on this list under the\nheading \"Alpha channel/object matte\".  There are some scripts and tips\nin there.\n\nThere are a lot of hurdles to jump in getting image-based lighting to\nwork.  A lot of it, you're just going to have to figure out on your\nown, I'm afraid.\n\nGood luck!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lighting from a light prob", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jan 27 17:59:20 2005"}
