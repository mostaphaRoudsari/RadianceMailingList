{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nI find that completely black hdr images consistently crash preview.  It will also crash finder if you use finder in one of the modes that show a preview of the image like cover flow or the columns.\n\nAlso, I've never been able to get Axel's command for random color images to work on a mac the way it is written in the tutorial.  When I try it rcalc waits patiently for input that doesn't exist.  But you can't add -n because then recno is invalid.  If you give it simple input using cnt (ie. cnt 1 | rcalc ) it doesn't work because all the values are seeded with the same number (recno is 1 every time).  Instead I used the $RANDOM variable to seed rcalc's rand function like so:\n\npcomb $(for i in {000..145}; do \\\necho \"-c $(echo $RANDOM | rcalc -e '$1=rand($1);$2=rand($1+.3);$3=rand($1+.7)') \\\nimages/patches/p$(printf \"%03d\" $i).hdr\"; done)>  images/sky_colourcomb.hdr\n\n\nAdmittedly this solution is not elegant.  If it's elegance we're after we could use the new capability in dctimestep (which wasn't available when Axel wrote his tutorial):\ncnt 145 | rcalc -e '$1=rand(recno);$2=rand(recno+.3);$3=rand(recno+.7)' | dctimestep images/patches/p%03d.hdr >  images/sky_colourcomb.hdr\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\nOn Dec 9, 2010, at 11:24 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib output crashes preview, finder", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CDB497B8-3402-45AD-9116-0BB64A22D22D@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<A7782C40-C0E9-42AB-A089-F9DEEEDF211D@bb3.net.au>", "<AANLkTikzSrYKpe9tJStm3nJ8Eqy-30kGHit1X=0CJ=BL@mail.gmail.com>", "<80A5B8D4-3318-4709-ACA6-79A9C4BCDEA7@bb3.net.au>", "<AANLkTim8bib=pNun6q7y+sZ0EdszqW523hPbda5dXdHu@mail.gmail.com>", "<04334F48-E2D0-4A21-B357-B552F03982E2@bb3.net.au>", "<642E5551-A603-4897-80E7-9059AAFD22DE@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 15:13:21 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib output crashes preview, finder"}
