Why would you synthesize a\nlight probe?  The whole point is to use a captured environment, isn't\nit?  If you had a good synthetic environment, you would just render\nyour synthetic object(s) into it directly.  Or are you doing this as a\ntest?  I would be surprised if HDRShop paid attention to the Radiance\nview parameters in the .pic file, as it's not expecting to read a\nRadiance rendering as a light probe.\n\nBy the way, there are two types of spherical projections used in\nHDRShop -- an angular projection and a spherical projection.
