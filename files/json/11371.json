{"body": "\n\n\nHi Lars,\n\nThanks! That was also my immediate idea ... then I read the man-page and saw that when using -x xres, xres has to be less than or equal to the target device. And when I read that I was reading it too quickly and simply \"reading\" (or getting the understanding) that xres needs to be less than or equal to the input resolution.\n\nSorry. One can say I was not reading what was written, but rather what I was fearing to read.\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 12. januar 2011 13:56\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Claus,\n\nyou can use pfilt to do that. The -x and -y parameters allow to set a target resolution. Many use them like -x /2 -y /2 to downsample, but you can also do the opposite by setting -x /.5 -y /.5 and achieve upsampling.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 6218 bytes\nDesc: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110112/c092627d/attachment.vcf>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Up-sampling a radiance picture?", "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DF2A080@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": ["<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DE76C85@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "<4D2DA4DE.8090102@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 14:24:44 +0100", "email": "Lars O.
