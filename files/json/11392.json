{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\nSorry for ambiguity. I need shadow pixel ids of the scene.\nI am wondering if i can disable or enable the shadow casting feature of a\nparticular object or scene ( like any other 3D packages). Then i can\nhave rendered image with and without shadow. Their difference can give me shadow\npixels.\nOr\nIf i can render the scene with some constant background color, then i can read\nthe shadows pixel ids (low pixel value) in matlab.\n\nmy scene has only diffuse objects  ( diffuse reflectance can be of any value, no\nblack object) and a single direct light.\n\nBest Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nSent: Thu, January 20, 2011 4:00:00 PM\nBrajesh.\n\nYour problem description is a bit cryptic. Could you please clarify\nwhat your problem exactly is and add a few details about your scene\nand the exact command you  used to render your picture.\n\nOn Thu, Jan 20, 2011 at 2:58 AM, Brajesh Lal <brajeshlal at yahoo.com> wrote:\n\n\nRendering a scene completely without shadow is probably possible but\nit would not look good. You need shadows to see the shape of objects.\n\nYou seem to be new to Radiance so I am speculating a bit about your\nproblem: Your rendered an image but everything that is not in direct\n(sun)light is totally black?\n\nIf this is the case you have to add the option \"-ab 2\" to your rpict\ncommand line to calculate the light in areas that only receive\nreflected light. Depending on your scene you should increase the \"-ab\n2\" to \"-ab 5\" or \"-ab 6\" to capture the ambient light more accurately.\nHowever, I assume that you also need to set other parameters to\nimprove the quality of your rendering/calculation.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110120/2e80ca3a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering without shadow", "sender": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<534476.11642.qm@web57309.mail.re1.yahoo.com>", "refs": ["<4D336645.1060100@gmail.com>", "<9E92F262-8FAB-415C-B3DA-FD7B01BB4D59@lmi.net>", "<329674.31822.qm@web57309.mail.re1.yahoo.com>", "<AANLkTimgV5nuDFVJyH87UiZ=Jfp=wTo7cDokpZjK+9EL@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 07:39:47 -0800 (PST)", "email": "Thomas Bleicher", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] rendering without shadow"}
