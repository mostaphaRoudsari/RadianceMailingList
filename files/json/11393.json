In Radiance you have some \"physical\"\nrestrictions for what you can model and render. However, Radiance is\nalso very flexible so that with some extra effort you may be able to\nachieve your desired result.\n\n\nYou can render one image with only the direct light visible (no\nambient light). Everything that lies in shadow will be black. Try to\nrender an image with the option \"-ab 0\" and see if the dark areas are\nwhat you expected your shadows to look like.\n\nYou can then render a second image with indirect contribution and\nsubtract the two images. But the result will not be limited to the\nshadows but will also show the difference in the lighting levels of\nlit areas. To render the second image use \"-ab 1\" or \"-ab 2\".\n\nTo calculate the difference of the images use this command:\n\npcomb -e 'ro=ri(1)-ri(2);go=gi(1)-gi(2);bo=bi(1)-bi(2)' -o\nno_shadow.hdr -o shadow.hdr > diff.hdr\n\nYou can modify this calculation to introduce a threshold which will\nclean up the shadow image a bit. But first you have to see if this is\nin principle the right way to go.\n\n\nYou can also define a coloured \"ambient light\" to give the shadow a\nred or green tint.\n\n\nLight sources in Radiance are not point lights but need a physical\nsurface area to attache to. You should use a small object here and set\nthe rendering parameters right to avoid a subdivision of the surface\nduring the rendering process which would result in fuzzy shadow edges.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering without shadow", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTimfiy-7PbNGjjNh_5EdkcgB8H9mEMuG0jMLDmBw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4D336645.1060100@gmail.com>", "<9E92F262-8FAB-415C-B3DA-FD7B01BB4D59@lmi.net>", "<329674.31822.qm@web57309.mail.re1.yahoo.com>", "<AANLkTimgV5nuDFVJyH87UiZ=Jfp=wTo7cDokpZjK+9EL@mail.gmail.com>", "<534476.11642.qm@web57309.mail.re1.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 11:59:14 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rendering without shadow"}
