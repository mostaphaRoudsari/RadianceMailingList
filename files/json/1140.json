{"body": "\nHi,\n\njust to add... there is a Blender extension for Radiance export in\ndevelopment, which will offer a preview, there is rshow (the radiance\nfrontend-tools except trad have already been mentioned as well as\nrayfront)... Why not continuing one of the existing projects? And,\nfirst, define the project's goal...!\n\n- rad-frontend (just like trad)? Setting rendering parameters and\nstart? Sounds a bit like the renderpark-design...\n- scene-viewer with real-time ability (radiance has rholo...)? Sounds\nlike rshow for the Mac, which has (and needs, if you want to set\nview-parameters real-time) OpenGL support...\n- project management (like rayfront)?\n- frontend just to avoid the command-line (drag the .rif-file onto the\nmyradiancerenderer-Icon)?\n\nI personally would only need something like rshow on the Mac, as\nOpenGL-performance with support of textures etc is not available so\nfar. Previewing is ok with rview. And one feature is really missing -\nand was afaik available in rshow: camera path generation. The bigger\napproach would be to integrate all the above into one project, like\nrayfront with OpenGL-preview...\n\nBTW, to throw one more into the language-box, many Mac OS X apps use\nJava for the GUI... which would help to keep things portable... and\nthere are even 3d-classes for Java... ;-)\n\nCU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
