{"body": "\nClaus.\n\nI just downloaded your file and opened it in SketchUp. I had to update\nto the newest version of SU (released last week) but I think that's the\nsame version you have.\n\nI then installed su2rad from a fresh download from the project site.\nHowever, I had no problems exporting the scene in any mode.\n\nThe import from 3DMax creates a SketchUp component which\ncontains another component with the geometry (12 triangles).\nsu2rad can handle this structure.\n\nI have checked the code again and I don't know why it would\ntry to replace the component with an IES file. This should only\nhappen if the component is created from a *.skp file and a *.ies\nfile with the same name exists next to *.skp file.\n\nTo debug this please open the Ruby console window in SketchUp\nand type:\n\n$SU2RAD_LOGLEVEL = 4\n\nThen start the su2rad export function. You should see a number\nof messages printed to the Ruby console. If the export finishes\nwithout error it should also create a log file of the export in the\n\"logfiles\" directory. If you can send me the text from the console\nor the file I might be able to see what's going on on your machine.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTik4bXNOWnx4VixkM7wQMDTqsHJMoRZH13JJ86FG@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DF2A6C1@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "<AANLkTikDfEOvK5ODfZg4u17m94a_GSKuxG+K79e5KUND@mail.gmail.com>", "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DF2A6D1@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:34:24 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?"}
