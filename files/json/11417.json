{"body": "\nHi Claus\n\nWhich version of the su2rad plugin did you install?\n\nSince you can export geometry created in SketchUp I would\nassume that the import from 3DMax creates an odd scene\nstructure that su2rad can't handle properly. You can send me\nthe *.skp file with the imported geometry and I'll poke around\na bit.\n\n2011/1/17 Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk>:\n\nThe basic SketchUp unit is 1 inch. So if you import something\nwith 1x1 units size it turns into roughly 0.025 meters.\n\n\n[...]\n\n\nMost directories are empty at this stage because they are used\nfor the rendering process. However, you are missing a *.rif file\nand an \"objects\" directory, which tells me that there must have\nbeen a problem during the export.\n\nYou can open the Ruby console window before you start the\nexport. This will show any script errors in the console and\nhelps to see if the export finishes successfully.\n\nI am very surprised that the \"luminaires\" directory is created\nand that there is an *.ies file that's supposed to be converted.\nI thought I had disabled this feature in the official versions\nso far.\n\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikDfEOvK5ODfZg4u17m94a_GSKuxG+K79e5KUND@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DF2A6C1@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 16:26:57 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?"}
