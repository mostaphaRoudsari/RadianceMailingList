{"body": "\n\nHi y'all,\n\nI've grown tired of looking at boxes and spheres as test objects in my renderings ... so I wish to model in 3ds Max, import into SketchUp, and export from there to radiance format using the su2rad plugin.\n\nAt first I was ambitious and tested with a complicated sculpture I had in .max format, but soon I started testing with a simple 1x1x2 meter box. I model it in Max, save it in .3ds format, and import into SketchUp. The import works although there is a scale issue ... once imported the box is 0.025x0.025x0.05 meters, but that is easy to fix.\n\nWhen I use the su2rad plugin to export to radiance files I get an xform error unless I use the \"by group\" mode and tick the \"global coords\" option. On the other hand, if I use the global cords option I don't get any geometry exported. After export the export directory looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nAmbfiles\nImages\nLogfiles\nLuminaires\nOctrees\nSkies\nViews\n\n(those are all directories, of which Views contain a valid .vf file with correct info, and luminaires contain a .ies file which I am not going to need ... all other directories are empty)\n\n... and then two files:\nBox.rad\nMaterials.rad\n\nMaterials.rad contain a generic plastic material (diffuse, reflectance 0.4 0.4 0.4).\n\nBox.rad looks like this:\n\n!xform skies/Boulder_CO_1108_1330.sky\n!xform ./materials.rad\n!ies2rad -s -m 0.800000 -t default -o luminaires/skp5030 luminaires/skp5030.ies | xform -n group\n\nThat's it.\n\nIf I model something (e.g., a box) directly in SketchUp the export seems to work fine.\n\nAnyone else having experiences with something like this?\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110117/4143e04b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Claus_Br=F8ndgaard_Madsen?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DF2A6C1@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 22:07:27 +0100", "email": "cbm at create.aau.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?"}
