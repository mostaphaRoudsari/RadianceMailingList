{"body": "\n\n\n\nDear list\n\nI have a weird question. How can I upsample a radiance image with a factor of 2 (or 4 or 8 ...) on the command line? It is easy to do in HDRShop but I need the functionality embedded in a large script.\n\nI don't any fancy bi-linear interpolation ... simply nearest neighbour will do (i.e., repeating the same pixel four times in the upsampled output image).\n\nI am doing compositing and I wish to composite a high res render with a low res real image. I want to do the compositing in high res, and subsample (using pfilt) afterwards to achieve a little blurring at the edges of the rendered objects ... sort of to feather them into the  image.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110112/fa814581/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Claus_Br=F8ndgaard_Madsen?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DE76C85@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 09:39:18 +0100", "email": "cbm at create.aau.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Up-sampling a radiance picture?"}
