{"body": "\n\n\nDear List,\n\n\nSimple question: I need to divide one image with another ... pixel by pixel, channel by channel. I.e., IM1(x,y,C) / IM2(x,y,C) for all x,y and for all channels RGB and have the result ordered as a new image.\n\nI am messing around with some rlam & pvalue combinations, but there must be some elegant way :)\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110105/54485dcb/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 6218 bytes\nDesc: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110105/54485dcb/attachment.vcf>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Claus_Br=F8ndgaard_Madsen?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DE76284@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Jan 2011 09:41:22 +0100", "email": "cbm at create.aau.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Image calculations"}
