{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nJust a quick question.  How does time work in gensky? It seems to accept\nvalues which are not realistic. For example\n\ngensky 3 20 14.8 -a 40 -o 98 -m 105 > sky.rad\n\nIf I assign the time as 14.8 it produces a sky for that particular time\nwhich of course is not possible. I need to know because I'm writing a\nscript to produce a sun animation (1 frame = 1 minute) and I need to\nknow whether values such as above are meaningful or if I should set the\nscript so that values for minutes are allowed only between 0-60.\n\nThe same goes for the hours.. It accepts any value larger than 24!\n\nCheers,\nPatrick\n\n\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.715 / Virus Database: 471 - Release Date: 04/07/2004\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gensky time", "sender": "Patrick Ledda", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<005a01c465c2$f29e54e0$0100a8c0@patrick>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jul  9 16:42:37 2004", "email": "ledda at cs.bris.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gensky time"}
