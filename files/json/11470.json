{"body": "\nHi Randolph,\n\nWe probably shouldn't jump to conclusions about CPU utilization based on how much time is attributed to each rtrace process.  Due to the way rays get assigned to processes as they finish what they've got, one rtrace process might end up using more time than another that had to wait a longer for its assignment.\n\nOne thing is certain:  you should be sharing an ambient file via the -af option if -aa is non-zero and -ab is positive.  Otherwise, your process are mostly wasting time computing values that other processes have already computed.  Rob found the same thing in the stats Jack pointed out.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fun with multiple cores and rtrace", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FC14808F-2614-40A5-BD25-AED423699882@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<loom.20110203T061841-658@post.gmane.org>", "<99643A19-A624-41F5-AC3B-5AC3DF0FBF63@lmi.net>", "<iiemap$nib$1@dough.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Thu, 3 Feb 2011 09:18:30 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fun with multiple cores and rtrace"}
