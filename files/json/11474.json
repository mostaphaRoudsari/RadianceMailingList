The output will\ntypically be a .rad-file, containing a light material, with its angular\ndistribution modified by a brightfunc modifier, plus a surface that this\nlight material will be applied to. The second file written by ies2rad\nwill have a .dat-extension, and it contains the candela distribution a\nthe input file.\n\nIt is somehow easy to introduce errors when working with ies files. Be\nespecially  careful about:\n\n- units(!!)\n- about wether your ies file contains absolute values or relative to a\ngiven luminous flux of the source,\n- in most cases you want to go with white sources, unless e.g. you\ncombine different lamps with different color temperatures,\n- the coordinate systems in the ies specifications are not all that\nobvious, and it is always a good idea to put the source into a simple\nscene and look at the illuminance on a plane below and besides for\nplausibility checks...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Stadium light", "sender": "Lars O.
