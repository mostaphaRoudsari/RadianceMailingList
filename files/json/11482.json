{"body": "\nHi Roberto!\n\n\nYou can pass the image data to be used as value input by falsecolor using\n\n\"falsecolor -i filename.hdr > output.hdr\"\n\nor by sending to to stdin, e.g.\n\n\"cat filename.hdr | falsecolor > output.hdr\"\n\nSo just add a \"-i\" in front of the input filename in your script.\n\nBesides that, I would recommend not to use the outdated pic-extension,\nbut the officially registred hdr-extension. But that is a side-not.\n\n\nDoes this work up to here?\n\n\nI have to admit that I do not like bash when working on strings and\narrays too much. I usually switch to perl whenever I need to process\nstrings, even if it is just splitting a record.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110210/00b5a6cc/attachment.bin>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Falsecolor and script by csh", "sender": "Lars O.
