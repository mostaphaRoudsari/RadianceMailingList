{"body": "\nHi Krystyna,\n\nDid you use any of the calibration options to gensky (-r, -R, -b, or -B)?  If not, then it's surprising that your results are as close as this.  If you did use these options, then we should check the conversion factors and what measurements you based them on.  Provided you have a separate measure of sun and sky and the rest of the parameters are correct, you should get good agreement with the open-sky test case.\n\nSome good tips on setting gensky parameters may be found in Axel Jacob's Radiance tutorial, which is currently linked at:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/radiance_tutorial.pdf\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<AANLkTik9DO1qNL3sggYdUD4+6BGjuTBqOQkWW1E0bhW4@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<98EC0CDF-0531-40A6-A94A-367A5724EB4C@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<AANLkTik9DO1qNL3sggYdUD4+6BGjuTBqOQkWW1E0bhW4@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 16:02:11 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Low simulated illuminance levels underdirect sun"}
