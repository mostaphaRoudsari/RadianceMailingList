{"body": "\nHi Giovanni and Lars!\nI think you guys have some good approaches.\nIf # of images it produces is an issue for the original \"brute force\"\nmethod you proposed for checking direct sun exposure on clear days, you\ncan overwrite the same image every-time after doing an image check and\nincrementing a variable.  Below is pseudo-code:\n\n[loop over timebounds (can have a sun above horizon check here too)]\n[create/overwrite image SunCheckImage]\n[if (pixel value of representative point in SunCheckImage > threshold)\nnum_timesteps_in_sun++]\n[print \"I've been in the sun for \" + num_timesteps_in_sun + \" time steps\"]\n[delete SunCheckImage]\n\nSorry, I do not know off-hand an easy command for reading pixel\nvalues of .hdr images with Radiance (pcomb ?...), but this can be done\nelsewhere (e.g. ImageMagick...).\nThresholds can be tricky, so take into account reflected, ambient,\nlow angle, etc light (which is what you are doing with -ab...).\nYou can also try intersecting the line between the surface and sun\nwith the model geometry for each time-step...\nGood luck!\n\n- Dan\n\n\nOn 2/15/2011 5:28 AM, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n\n\n--\nLF logo \tDaniel C.
