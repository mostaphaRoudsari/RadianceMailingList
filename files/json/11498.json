{"body": "\nHi Krystyna,\n\nI haven't had a chance to play around with DIVA myself, but it sounds like an amazing tool!  I'm sure the authors will add in some workarounds in future releases for users who need a little more control over their simulations, but in the meanwhile, the gendaylit option Alstan mentions seems like a good one.  Let us know how it all turns out.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<AANLkTinunUUG5yNWncAY1K1=Jn7UTP793r5bWDH+0ZN2@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1322AA58-DC93-40DF-AC89-4E55F8F24790@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<AANLkTik9DO1qNL3sggYdUD4+6BGjuTBqOQkWW1E0bhW4@mail.gmail.com>", "<98EC0CDF-0531-40A6-A94A-367A5724EB4C@lmi.net>", "<AANLkTinunUUG5yNWncAY1K1=Jn7UTP793r5bWDH+0ZN2@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 15 Feb 2011 09:04:43 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Low simulated illuminance levels underdirect sun"}
