{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nI got a response from the DIVA mailing list - the program does not\nallow the user to input calibration factors (-r -R -b or -B) for the\ngensky command (I chose to use Rhino in combination w/ the plugin\nDIVA-for-Rhino since I do not have access to a Unix machine and\nbecause of its user-friendly interface). Will see if I can workaround\nthis problem as described below.\n\nThank you,\n\nKrystyna\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 14, 2011 at 7:09 PM, J.

It is called as in the below example,\n!gensky 09 21 09 +s -a -16 -o 48 -m 45\n\nYou can't put in the calibration factors using -r -R -b or -B as Greg\nsuggests via the DIVA GUI. However, by editing the filename_sky.rad in\nyour DIVA temp folder and by running the simulation using\nfilenameimg.bat you could short-circuit the GUI and add a calibration\nflag to the gensky command. Note that every time you run a\nvisualization from the GUI, you'll need to re-edit the sky.rad file if\nyou decide to do this.\n\nThe other option, if you have direct and diffuse radiation data, is to\nuse the Perez sky distribution via gendaylit. DIVA has a gui frontend\nto this which you can choose by selecting the Perez Sky option under\nsky condition in the metrics dialog.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 14, 2011 at 4:02 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<98EC0CDF-0531-40A6-A94A-367A5724EB4C@lmi.net>", "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTinunUUG5yNWncAY1K1=Jn7UTP793r5bWDH+0ZN2@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTik9DO1qNL3sggYdUD4+6BGjuTBqOQkWW1E0bhW4@mail.gmail.com>", "<98EC0CDF-0531-40A6-A94A-367A5724EB4C@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 20:02:33 -0800", "email": "kzelenay at berkeley.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Low simulated illuminance levels underdirect sun"}
