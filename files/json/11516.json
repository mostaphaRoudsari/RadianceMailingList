{"body": "\nHello Everyone,\n\nI wanted to let you know that we've settled on a date for the Radiance workshop.  The main workshop will be Aug. 25th and 26th.  A pre-workshop seminar day will occur on Aug. 24th.\n\nWe've decided to hold the workshop in August to allow more participation from academic institutions.  I hope the date is suitable for everyone.  I know August is a common time for family vacations, so I'll also mention that the Northern California is a common vacation destination.\n\nAndy\n\n\nAndy McNeil\nWindows & Daylighting Research Group\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110214/5374b7ea/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43793542-D316-48F7-AB27-40929618E39C@lbl.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 10:52:25 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Save The Date - Radiance Workshop"}
