If you want to specify a filename as input you have\nto use the '-i' option.\n\nWriting programs like filters allows you to combine the output of one\nprogram to connect directly with the input of the next without intermediate\n(potentially large) files.\n\nAnother question is about a script and the \"if\" function; the script\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nendif\n\necho $sky\n\nWhen you specified your array in the first example the numbers were\ninterpreted as numbers. When you read from a file they are at first just\nstrings. The syntax error is raised because CSH recognises the variable as a\nstring and wants quotes around the left side of the test ( if ( \"$value\" <=\n3 ) ... ). However, that's not your problem. You have to convert the strings\nto numbers to compare against another number in the if condition. Here is a\n(slightly cleaned up) version. Note the line with the `expr ...` in it.\n\nset cloud = `cat cloud_cover.dat`\nset i = 1\nwhile ($i<10)\necho \"cloud cover for index $i is $cloud[$i]\"\nset value_s = `echo $cloud[$i] | cut -d '.' -f 1`\nset value = `expr $value_s`\n\nif ( $value <= 3 ) then\nset sky = \"+s\"\nelse if ( $value <= 7 ) then\nset sky = \"+i\"\nelse\nset sky = \"-c\"\nendif\n\necho \"cloud: $cloud[$i]   sky: $sky\"\n@ i++\nend\n\n\nPS: If you are new to shell scripting you should consider switching to bash.\nIt's more popular and doesn't have as many syntax oddities as CSH.\n\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110210/544827d9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Falsecolor and script by csh", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTikgTBBk-z__g6hZ=5XU0eXkOF1EoHH8Fw+oZ4YG@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<32770492.447841297332439047.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>"], "datetime": "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 09:08:56 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Falsecolor and script by csh"}
