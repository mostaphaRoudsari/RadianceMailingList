{"body": "\nI am in the process of implementing Preetham's \"A Practical Analytic\nModel for Daylight\" into Radiance. I have some questions regarding\nRadiance units, which I understand are radiometric units.  Here are some\nquestions I came up with. My biggest confusion relates to luminous\nefficacy, and when to apply it.\n\n1) If I have a spectral distribution of the sun in wavelength increments\nfrom 380 to 780, and apply cieresp.cal to obtain the XYZ CIE values,\nwhat units is Y in? When I convert to RGB using something like\nxyz_rgb.cal, should I divide by the luminous efficacy 179 or not?\nReading Chapter 5 of Rendering with Radiance (pages 305-307), it seems I\nshould just take the RGB values and use them.\n\n2) If I have data in CIE XYZ, with Y in cd/m^2. Should I convert to RGB\nand divide by 179?\n\n3) When using skygen, what units is the solar intensity in? What units\ndoes skyfunc return?\n\nThanks a lot for your time,\nAlejandro\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Alejandro Troccoli", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<40F719A1.6040208@cs.columbia.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jul 16 01:56:29 2004", "email": "atroccol at cs.columbia.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Units"}
