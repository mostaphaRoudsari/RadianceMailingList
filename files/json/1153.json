Now, parallel processing has been a topic here for some time, and\nI am wondering about the changes in the recent developments.\n\nI know there is the new -N switch of rad, which will distribute\nrenderings to multiple processes, right? So this seams to be the\nfrontend to use, maybe better than starting all the rpict & Co.s\nmanually. What I would really like to know what file sharing mechanism\nshould I use for indirect values? It used to be nfs, and the\ndocumentation in the radiance distribution still reflects how to use\nnfs and lcking to share data between processes. Would the same be\npossible e.g. with samba? I am asking because I have a working samba 3\nserver available, offering enough space and lots of bandwidth. If samba\nis not supported, I could still install a nfs server, however, I\nremember some trouble with different nfs-locking mechanisms and the\nos-dependance of nfs implementations (we use OS X, Linux and Solaris\nhere...;-).\n\nSo if there is any news about this topic, maybe some reports from\npeople who use radiance in parallel environments, it would be of great\nhelp.\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
