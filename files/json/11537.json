{"body": "\nSame for me, everytime I hear about any important improvement, I update head, typically 2,3 times a year. Plus keeping installed some old versions for specific needs. My /opt contains usually head, stable, pmap releases.\n\nBesides guru or not:\n\n1) Radiance ecosystem keeps users informed on bugfixes at almost real-time, making them want to update and not wait for releases.\n\n2) There are no pure bugfixes for a release, so it is not possible to avoid version changes anyways. That makes it little attractive to follow conservative strategies such as keeping a stable release updated only with bugfixes and wait with feature updates - the bugfixes come with updates only. And then, why wait for a release tag...\n\n3) Binaries on my 64bit ubuntu kept surprising me, and if I have to compile myself, I cannot keep away from fresh sources :-)\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
