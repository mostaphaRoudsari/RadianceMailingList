People on this list can tell you better than I what versions\nof Linux or NFS you need to look out for.  In general, I think OS X and\nFreeBSD are solid with respect to NFS file locking.  Solaris might be\ngood as well.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<B5C4B063-7530-11D9-8104-000A959DDB22@gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
