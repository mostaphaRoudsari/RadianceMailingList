{"body": "\nHi Krystyna,\n\nI suggest having a look at at Axel Jacobs document on \"Understanding\nrtcontrib\":\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf\n\nOn pages 30-32 he provide some excellent explanation of processing\nweather data for Radiance and gendaylit. According to this, the best\ndata points to use are direct normal and diffuse horizontal irradiance\n(W/m^2) which should be provided to gendaylit AS IS (eg without any\nadditional factoring for Radiance). Irradiance data points are suggested\nas the best option as apparently not all weather stations actually\nmeasure photometric data, meaning that such values if not measured are\nderived from the radiometric data points.\n\nNote reading further will provide some potential cautions on gendaylit\nas well....\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 3/16/2011 3:11 AM, Krystyna Zelenay wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110317/000ebc8c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit command", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4D820C9A.70802@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<AANLkTimgV9x3tQ-vpF5WWNqf3KYM5KRDPb+w9UbjX7BN@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 17 Mar 2011 09:28:58 -0400", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Gendaylit command"}
