{"body": "\nHi Lars and David,\n\nFor the glaze script what is needed for the frit material is T (rgb),\nRcoated side (rgb) and R glass side (rgb) all measured at 100% coverage\nwith the frit material. In the past I have been able to get this\ninformation from glazing manufacturers. It does necessitate a call to\nthe manufacturer and speaking to someone on the technical side who can\nget the information.\n\nNot sure what the system is that you are simulating. Have you taken a\nlook at what Window 6 can provide?\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 3/19/2011 10:18 AM, Lars O.
