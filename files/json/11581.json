{"body": "\nHi David!\n\n\nIs the print translucent? For transmittance, it makes a difference\nwhether you have a translucent print (resulting in reduced direct\ntransmittance + scatter) or an opaque, purely reflective print\n(resulting in only reduced direct transmittance).\n\n\nMy guess it that you may be able to approximate these, but I would not\nreally believe in the results of such a complex system without being\nable to compare to a measurement.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling glass louvres with frit in GLAZE", "sender": "Lars O.
