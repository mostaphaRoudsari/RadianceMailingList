{"body": "\nDear Radience experts,\n\nsuppose I have a formular which defines the luminance of a point (L) in the\nsky according to it's solar altitude and solar azimuth:\n\nL = f(altitude, azimuth)\n\nhow to generate a sky file which describes the cumulative sky brightness\ndistribution pattern based on this formular.\n\nI roughly know that gencumulativesky.exe can only take weather file as input\nto create a .cal file which will be cited in the .sky file to generate the\ncumulative diffuse radiation distribution pattern.\n\nBut can we write our own sky.cal file to define the rationle to determine\nsky radiance or luminace distribution pattern? and How to do that?\n\ne.g. what if the sky brightness pattern is something like a checkerboard\npattern with black and white patches arranged in alternating way?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110316/599ac609/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AANLkTimM39QHa_37H6sq277hkeUX0Jg_ZFs_fmadbKjX@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 02:13:21 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] how to generate a customized cumulative skybased on an arbitrarily defined sky brightness formular?"}
