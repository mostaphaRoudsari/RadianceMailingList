But nevertheless\nI'd  like to know whether somebody already did this before\nI waste time on re-doing it.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nVolker\n\n--\nVolker Hilsenstein                      phone: +49 6221 546542\nInstitute for Environmental Physics                     546628\nUniversity of Heidelberg\nINF 229 Room 116\n69120 Heidelberg\nGermany                 vhilsens@freitag.iup.uni-heidelberg.de\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Volker Hilsenstein", "datetime": "Fri, 01 Feb 2002 14:59:16 +0100"}
