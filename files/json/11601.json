{"body": "\nHi Kevin!\n\n(...)\n\nI am just following your textual description as such:\n\n1) direct sunlight gets specularly reflected from louvers to ceiling\n\n2) light gets reflected from ceiling to sensor (and you have a very high\nspecular reflectance of .95)\n\nAs long as the sun is not perfectly aligned perpendicular with your\nfacade, you will probably also have some diffuse reflection over the\nwall, but that should not cause these effects.\n\nIs it that surprising?\n\nIn case of zero roughness, all light reflected by the ceiling probably\nhits the back wall. Your sensor should probably only get hit by light\nreflected of the back wall (if there is any), light from the sky and\nmaybe scattered light from the louvers.\n\nIn case of higher roughnesses, the distribution after the reflection on\nthe ceiling gets wider - less light reaches the back wall, more light\nreaches the sensor. Seen from below, the ceiling would appear brighter\n(unless you are at the exact sun position where the sun would get\nreflected at by a mirror-like ceiling).\n\nAll this can be visualized by holding a mirror, a scattering mirror and\na piece of paper in front of a (small) lamp in a dark room. The mirror\nwill appear black - unless you find the exact one position where light\ngets reflected straight into your eyes. The scatter mirror will appear\nbrighter when seen close to the mirror angle, paper will appear bright\nat any angle.\n\nMy guess that this is all the reason for your observation. Am I right?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem with Metal Roughness Parameter", "sender": "Lars O.
