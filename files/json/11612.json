{"body": "\nHello Radiance users,\n\nChristoph Reinhart asked me to give a talk at the Harvard\nUniversity Graduate School of Design to help his students better\nunderstand the complexities and capabilities of Radiance. I took\nit as an opportunity to dig deep into my archives and share some\nof the tricks and techniques that I've learned over the last ~14\nyears of using Radiance (and reading this list).\n\nThe talk was today, and for the benefit of his students and you,\nhere are the slides and my speaking notes. I hope you can all\nlearn at least a little something from this, if only what *not*\nto do.\n\nhttp://markjstock.com/gsd_talk_11_notes.pdf\n(93 slides, 26 MB)\n\nMark\nmstock at umich.edu\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.1104071543140.18898@goldenaxe.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 15:55:21 -0400 (EDT)", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Talk: \"A Decade of Radiance Tricks\""}
