{"body": "\n\nHi,\n\nI pointed out that it is not clear to me yet what you are actually trying to calculate. Still I would propose not to worry about color unless it is of importance in your results. Typical studies of daylight availability, glare, ... are all based on integrated units such as lux and nits (or their radiometric counterparts). For these you need reflectance, not color values.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110411/e805d736/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ecotect to radiance simulation", "sender": "Lars O.
