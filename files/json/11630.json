{"body": "\nHi,\n\nHere's a helpful tutorial for using Ecotect in conjunction with DAYSIM/Radiance:\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf\n\nHere's another tutorial, but it is geared specifically towards DAYSIM:\nhttp://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/daysim-tutorial.pdf\n\nThe Ecotect square 1 website used to have quite a bit of useful\ninformation, including how to position a camera but am not sure where\nand if this information was moved after the merger with Autodesk. I\nthink it may have been moved here: http://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 13, 2011 at 10:36 AM, dharam <dharmesh.124 at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HELP", "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTim4==XCLWVvVfXqi6aowmCYvZKmwA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4da5df15.015de70a.0cc3.29ac@mx.google.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 10:58:37 -0700", "email": "kzelenay at berkeley.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HELP"}
