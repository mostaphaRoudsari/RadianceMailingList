{"body": "\nHello Claus\n\nUnfortunately the texture export in su2rad is not very sophisticated. It's\nnot a good way to produce Radiance textures anyway.\n\nTo solve your problem you can try one of the two options:\n\n1) Select all the textured faces, right click and choose \"texture -> make\nunique\" from the context menu. This will create six identical materials with\na uniform mapping for each face.\n\nor 2) Use the attached script to export the cube to *.obj and then use\nobj2mesh to convert the *.obj file to a Radiance mesh with textures. The\nauthor of this OBJ exporter says it does the \"make unique\" step during the\nexport. Please note that I have not used this script myself and I don't know\nif it modifies your  materials during the export.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n2011/4/18 Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110418/10e7ada5/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: OBJexporter.rb\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 27530 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110418/10e7ada5/attachment-0001.obj>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] su2rad: problems with texture mapping", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTimeyD2fKoG=rN4a2xjOuXY2uoAO0g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C0E2B0FE224@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Mon, 18 Apr 2011 07:57:07 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad: problems with texture mapping"}
