{"body": "\nHi Greg, hi list!\n\n\nSorry, first thank you for the reply, but I had better changed the\nsubject line (I didn't because I wanted to add to the old thread, which\nwas about transparency and mixpict, showing mixpict useage by an\nexample). I don't want to map on a transparent surface, but an opaque\none, to describe a mosaic. If I used the void modifier, I think I would\nhave to model three surfaces, so that each surface takes one material\nmodified by the mixpict \"mask\" - that doesn't sound very reasonable to\nme. So the question is still if I can use a mixpict-modified material\nas background in a mixpict modifier's definition, some kind of nested\nmixpict modifier.\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
