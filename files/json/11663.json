{"body": "\nDear Radiance experts,\n\nI'm testing rendering radiance scene using rpict with Radiance 4.0 in Mac OS\n10.6.7\n\nProblem A:\nI'm using the following rpict command:\nrpict  -vf /test/view.vf -w  -aa 0.2 -ab 3 -ad 2048 -ar 128 -as 512 -x 500\n-y 500 /test/scene.oct > /Users/oat/Desktop/image.jpg\n\nHowever, I have the following problem with the png file generated:\n1. the surfaces not facing the sun directly looks like being burnt\n2. there're a lot of black splotches along the edges and corners of the wall\n3. the image has a lot of jagged edges\n4. it cannot be open in photoshop but it can be previewed in Mac OS\n\nthe preview of this png file as screen-captured is like:\nhttps://2omvuw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p8T69Ib9EOtRETgqUwtZrJ_hfoKx1uDj4hkHKIFICcIAZ17CFilr8bRaY0n6zURTGQpmdYWRALT2rnvmiz3cUmUDR8IG_-xBd/Mac%20OS%20png.png?psid=1\n\n\nProblem B:\nIf I render the image as .hdr file it still have the same problem 1 to 3 as\nmentioned above when I preview it in Mac OS. But the hdr image can be open\nin Photoshop and appears quite right with less severe splotch problem.\n\nThe rpict command:\nrpict  -vf /test/view.vf -w  -aa 0.2 -ab 3 -ad 2048 -ar 128 -as 512 -x 500\n-y 500 /test/scene.oct > /Users/oat/Desktop/image.hdr\n\nThe hdr image as opened in Photoshop is:\nhttps://2omvuw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p5J22wHNNnuKciUzj5slOchjNGAKcZ7NclFvCojDvwVmrgoglis8BQt4RB9BTaPLpbk3_3sjaJ11-TSpsM6ndEVuA5FKwZp3Y/Mac%20OS%20hdr.png?psid=1\n\n\n\nProblem C:\nif I add a ground surface into the scene, the hdr image as rendered will\nhave a lot of bright splotches along the bottom of the wall surfaces (the\nground surface is positioned 0.3m lower than the floor surface of the room):\nhttps://2omvuw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1perNd2uKYSrsH2hXoIZqyVynQkw1Eid2ULgDb-gY3VJ-Cb9ANIhZ1ZucPz7rZQynAypp_Fjskp1gN9pbgNneAp7A7Hbxzwa0B/Mac%20Os%20hdr%20_with_ground.png?psid=1\n\nThe maximum dimension of the scene is around 100m after adding the ground\nsurface.\n\n\nI'd like to ask:\n1. why the png or jpg file generated using rpict in Mac OS can be previewed\nbut cannot be open in Photoshop?\n2. why the png, jpg or hdr image generated using rpict in Mac OS looks\n\"burnt out\" when previewed?\n3. why only the hdr image file can be opened in Photoshop and appears\nnormal?\n4. why does the additional ground surface cause the splotches? and how to\ncorrect it?\n5. how to get a clean hdr image with smooth surfaces that have no splotches\nand jagged edges?\n6. What are the key rpict parameters to control the image quality?\n\n\nCan you kindly help to take a look and advise me the source of problem and\nthe solutions?\n\nThank you!\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110426/3d056202/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTinH5PhKwxKW32h1sLfCC6QtgoQ3DA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 21:57:11 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict image rendering problem"}
