{"body": "\nThe ambient resolution affects the image quality depending on the size of the scene relative to the size of the area of interest (for example the size of the ground plane relative to the size of an interior room). So if you have a 10m scene, and add a ground plane to make it 100m total, the -ar setting should be raised just to keep image quality the same as it was without the ground plane. If the image wasn't very smooth to start, then raising -ar even further may help.\n\n\n\n4. why does the additional ground surface cause the splotches? and how to correct it?\n5. how to get a clean hdr image with smooth surfaces that have no splotches and jagged edges?\n6. What are the key rpict parameters to control the image quality?\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110426/864ca462/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict image rendering problem", "sender": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B04A027FD6CF@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTinH5PhKwxKW32h1sLfCC6QtgoQ3DA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 11:59:39 -0400", "email": "Ji Zhang", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict image rendering problem"}
