{"body": "\nHi Anne,\n\ngive Andy's suggestion using the glow material a try - I usually do that\nfor large windows (i.e. in most cases) to avoid the\nsubsampling problem of the \"window lights\". Even if you do not put\nsensors close to the window, you mostly have walls\nsomewhere close to the window where the same issue arises.\nManually subdividing is only necessary - as Andy states - if it's needed\nbecause of changes in the exterior illumination.\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\nAm 28.04.2011 19:38, schrieb Andy McNeil:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110428/e8551f26/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<5A74C8A7-5C51-43A2-A5AB-0806E28E5ED1@lbl.gov>", "sender": "David Geisler-Moroder", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4DB9B0D1.9000002@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>", "<5A74C8A7-5C51-43A2-A5AB-0806E28E5ED1@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 20:24:17 +0200", "email": "david.moroder at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of windowwith sensor located close to the window"}
