{"body": "\nThanks Greg, David and Andy for your replies.\nHave run simulations with the glow material and find no significant\ndifferences in sensor signal when having no subdivision compared to\ndifferent subdivisions. So I'll stick to the glow material for my window and\nsimulate without any window subdivision. Elegant ;-).\n\nI have simply changed the window material from light to glow and set the\nsettings as recommended by Andy.\n\nvoid glow windowlight\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nBest,\nAnne\n\n\nOn Thu, Apr 28, 2011 at 9:00 PM, <\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110429/285659c4/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTimQq7WLGha-cJGJuX5tuT2KJW581Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 14:32:23 +0200", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of windowwith sensor located close to the window"}
