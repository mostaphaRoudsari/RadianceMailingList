Measuring materials and getting them right in Radiance is time-consuming, and usually tackled on a per-model basis.  As an architect, I'm sure you appreciate how variable even something as basic as gray masonry blocks can be.  Even if manufacturers produced to a uniform reflectance, the material pattern and scale can vary significantly.  Nevertheless, it would be a big help to just have a comprehensive set of generic materials.\n\nWe should probably link the above in Francesco Anselmo's wiki site, which is also worth a look\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=material_collections\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sources for material reflectances", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B04A026C1310@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=hVeET=YqB1o-FSODzGh6xGaynog@mail.gmail.com>", "<80360B44-40B7-43FE-A482-A8F08D5F4D53@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Fri, 22 Apr 2011 10:04:28 -0400", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Sources for material reflectances"}
