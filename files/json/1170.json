{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nBecause (again, I had to explain that in a different thread before) I\nhave material values for the stones the mosaic is made of, but no\ncalibrated picture of the whole that I could simply use as a colorpict.\nHowever, I can \"draw\" the mosaic using the known values, than map that\ndrawing. However, as I never used the mixpict, which seams to be a\nquite powerful tool, I was quite interested in its limitations, and I\nfound very few documentation on it.\n\nSo thank you all who answered, I got an idea now what I can do with\nthat mod, CU, Lars.\n--\nLars O.
