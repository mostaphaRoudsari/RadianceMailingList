{"body": "\nHi Ignacio!\n\nIt is always a bit confusing when folks think they ask about Radiance,\nbut actually have questions related to Ecotect's user interface. So\nwithout knowing Ecotect, I try to help a bit:\n\n\nProbably the blank is because \"-I\" is a switch to get irradiance instead\nof radiance as output. So you do not pass any value (and thus there also\ncannot be a default). Basically rtrace -I interpretes input\ncoordinates/directions as sensor locations (coordinate) and sensor view\ndirections (directions). So 0 0 0 0 0 1 would be location (0,0,0)\npointing up (0,0,1).\n\n\nNo idea, usually you need to weigh the RGB (unless you do everything\nwith grey values) and multiply with the luminous efficacy in Radiance to\nget from radiometric to photometric units, but I have no clue where this\nis hidden in Ecotect.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Help - Radiance / LEED", "sender": "Lars O.
