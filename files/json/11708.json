{"body": "\n\n\nDear List (Thomas ?)\n\n\nI have been experimenting a little with getting geometry into RADIANCE by exporting to 3ds formation from 3ds Max, importing into SketchUp, and then exporting to RADIANCE using su2rad.\n\nSo far I have only tested simple models, for example a 1x1x1 meter cube, with all six faces textured with the same square image.\n\nI export in \"by color\" mode, as that has been most successful thus far.\n\nI attach a .jpg of the result. I have tried a million different things in SketchUp to try to get rid of the uv-mapping problem which is very evident in the attach render.\n\nAny suggestions? When exporting a more complicated (sculpture) model, textured with a single \"marble\" albedo map, the same uv-mapping problem is experienced.\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg at 01CBFDC8.9A35E160]\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110418/085fb106/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 12417 bytes\nDesc: image001.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110418/085fb106/attachment-0002.jpg>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: myboxquick.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 10960 bytes\nDesc: myboxquick.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110418/085fb106/attachment-0003.jpg>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Claus_Br=F8ndgaard_Madsen?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C0E2B0FE224@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 18 Apr 2011 13:02:58 +0200", "email": "cbm at create.aau.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad: problems with texture mapping"}
