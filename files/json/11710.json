{"body": "\nHi Krystyna,\n\nGoogle led me straight to a little Radiance material collection at the BPS wiki site:\n\nhttp://archbps1.campus.tue.nl/bpswiki/index.php/Radiance\n\nI wish there were more there, but the nice thing about a wiki is that everyone can contribute.  Measuring materials and getting them right in Radiance is time-consuming, and usually tackled on a per-model basis.  As an architect, I'm sure you appreciate how variable even something as basic as gray masonry blocks can be.  Even if manufacturers produced to a uniform reflectance, the material pattern and scale can vary significantly.  Nevertheless, it would be a big help to just have a comprehensive set of generic materials.\n\nWe should probably link the above in Francesco Anselmo's wiki site, which is also worth a look\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=material_collections\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sources for material reflectances", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<80360B44-40B7-43FE-A482-A8F08D5F4D53@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=hVeET=YqB1o-FSODzGh6xGaynog@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Apr 2011 18:48:08 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sources for material reflectances"}
