{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI was wondering whether there are any comprehensive sources with\nmaterial visible light reflectances (for a range of construction\nmaterials)? I have come across publications that have some information\nbut they typically contain only a few material reflectances, rarely\nmore than 20 and do not go into much detail about anticipated\nvariations in material reflectances. I often I have to look up one\nmaterial reflectance in one source and then look for another material\nin another source.\n\nI looked through the Radiance archives and while the question of a\ndatabase has come up before, it sounds like there is no such database?\nIs there at least a relatively comprehensive source one could\nreference for architectural lighting analyses?\n\nThank you,\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTi=hVeET=YqB1o-FSODzGh6xGaynog@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Apr 2011 16:19:10 -0700", "email": "kzelenay at berkeley.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sources for material reflectances"}
