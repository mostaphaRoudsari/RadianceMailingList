Even\nthough you would have some notion on how it operates, some examples would\ngive quite some insight in the matter. How about a .cal repository, linked\nfrom the Radiance Wiki, explaining would they actually do? That could give\nsome insight into the bowels of Radiance?\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n\n//Cool to see xshowtrace & related issues coming by this list again, its\nreally a insightful!\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "datetime": "Thu Feb  3 21:05:27 2005"}
