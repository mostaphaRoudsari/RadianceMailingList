{"body": "\nHi Ignacio,\n\nYou can indeed calculate the values you need for the LEED daylight credit documentation with Radiance. To be clear, Radiance by default calculates, well, radiance, in w/sr/m^2. This can be converted to luminance (cd/m^2). Now, to get the info you need for LEED, you need to tell Radiance to calculate irradiance instead of radiance, and convert that to lux or footcandles as needed. To do this you would specify the ?I (capitol i) option to rtrace, which is the Radiance tool you'd use to calculate values for a grid of points, and then multiply the rgb irradiance values by V lambda. There are plenty of examples in the list archives of little scripts and commands to send Radiance a grid of points and do these calculations and make the proper conversions to the photometric values.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\nReply-To: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nTo: \"radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\" <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nHi everyone\n\nI need feedback or help to calculate daylight for LEED using Radiance.\nHave anyone here acomplished this calculations before? I know  that I have to use footcandles for LEED and radiance use cd/m2. I have to convert each grid point and the scale to footcandle?\n\nBest regards\n\n--\nJorge Ignacio Fajardo F-A\nArquitecto MDCS\n\niBSA - Ingenier?a Blanda S.A\nUSGBC Member\nJean Mermoz 12, of.
