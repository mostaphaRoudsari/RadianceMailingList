{"body": "\nThanks a lot Mark for today's wonderful presentation and for posting the\nslides online! I highly recommend them to everybody on this list.\n\nChristoph\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Thursday, April 07, 2011 3:55 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHello Radiance users,\n\nChristoph Reinhart asked me to give a talk at the Harvard\nUniversity Graduate School of Design to help his students better\nunderstand the complexities and capabilities of Radiance. I took\nit as an opportunity to dig deep into my archives and share some\nof the tricks and techniques that I've learned over the last ~14\nyears of using Radiance (and reading this list).\n\nThe talk was today, and for the benefit of his students and you,\nhere are the slides and my speaking notes. I hope you can all\nlearn at least a little something from this, if only what *not*\nto do.\n\nhttp://markjstock.com/gsd_talk_11_notes.pdf\n(93 slides, 26 MB)\n\nMark\nmstock at umich.edu\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Talk: \"A Decade of Radiance Tricks\"", "sender": "mstock at umich.edu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF08C1FA50@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<Pine.LNX.4.64.1104071543140.18898@goldenaxe.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>"], "datetime": "Fri, 8 Apr 2011 10:53:47 -0400", "email": "Mark Stock", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Talk: \"A Decade of Radiance Tricks\""}
