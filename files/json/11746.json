{"body": "\nHi Anne,\n\nI believe David is correct.  I should have looked at your command more closely.  The -I+ switch does not belong.  If you remove it (or set -I-), then the computed radiance values will be accumulated according to the distributed rays out of rsensor, then split again into Klems direction bins by rtcontrib.  The *.vmx files will each contain a single row of 145 RGB coefficients, which processed through dctimestep with the window's BTDF file will ultimately yield a single sensor value at each time step.\n\nI hope this makes sense.  I find it a bit confusing, myself!\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<BANLkTi=tG6Ndz-tKXk=_e49raaxwLaeJAA@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CDF2C1A4-D5B1-42E2-AAF6-604AB5EFAB5D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTimQq7WLGha-cJGJuX5tuT2KJW581Q@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTimtdywSK3JX4QxS04+zqZZ_pzCXTg@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTi=tG6Ndz-tKXk=_e49raaxwLaeJAA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 2 May 2011 09:14:35 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of windowwith sensor located close to the window"}
