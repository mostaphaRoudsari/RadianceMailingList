{"body": "\nHi Sotiris.\n\nHow did you install Radiance/gendaylit?\n\nIf you are on Linux and used a recent Debian package then see here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-January/001093.html\n\nThe package maintainer forgot to include the file in the package. You can\ntry to install an older package or use the source from the official website\n(see below).\n\nIf you use another system (OS X or Windows) you should check that your\nRAYPATH environment variable is set. Then check that the file is not in the\nfolders listed in RAYPATH.\n\nIf you are sure that you don't have the file grab the Radiance source code\nfrom here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/rad4R0all.tar.gz\n\nExtract the archive, search for the file and place it in one of the folders\nlisted in your RAYPATH. That should do it.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n2011/5/4 ??????? ??????????? <sotos.enveng at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110504/50f013c1/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTi=zgBdp2XkN1-R5=UJq_ypvq_fJkA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 4 May 2011 17:04:29 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] error message \"file coeff_perez.dat cannotbe opened\""}
