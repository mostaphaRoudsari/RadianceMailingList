{"body": "\n\n\nHi,\n\nI wish to compile the HEAD version of RADIANCE under Cygwin. To save disk space (I have a solid state disk) I have opted not to install X11 for Cygwin, since I will not need ximage or any other X related feature.\n\nI am going through the noX11.help file and applying the \"fixes\". Ran into problems (the noX11.help is not quite up to date with the actual line numbers of the Rmakefiles etc. but I can abstract from that) ... concerning the fix I need to apply to src/rt/devtable.c\n\nI need to make minor modifications to the code, but I do know what to write instead of \"x11\" when I do not have a Sun nor an SGI machine.\n\nBest\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110510/77728d9a/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 6224 bytes\nDesc: Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen.vcf\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110510/77728d9a/attachment.vcf>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Claus_Br=F8ndgaard_Madsen?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C0E2C11E28F@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 10 May 2011 22:13:29 +0200", "email": "cbm at create.aau.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Compiling RADIANCE under Cygwin with no X11support"}
