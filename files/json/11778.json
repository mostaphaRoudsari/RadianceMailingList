Since what the rendering shows is the false luminaire geometry,\nthat's what a direct view of the luminaire will show.  So you would\nhave to use a straight \"light,\" not an \"illum,\" to get a calculation of\nglare looking into the luminaire.  This will not produce a realistic\nimage, but I expect that, for a T5 fluorescent, it would produce a\nuseful glare calcuation.  As Lars points out, it probably won't be as\nuseful for LEDs fixture that allows for a direct view of many small\npoints of light.\n\nI wonder if HDR images of an LED fixture would provide a useful basis\nfor glare calculation.  I suppose one could, if one had the resources,\nmove the camera around the luminaire, the way a photometer does, and\ncreate multiple images which, if we had a way of getting those images\ninto Radiance, might provide a fairly accurate basis for glare\ncomputation.\n\nRandolph\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Randolph M.
