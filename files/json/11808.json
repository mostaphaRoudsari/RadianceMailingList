We haven't planned a beginners tutorial during the seminars but  beginners will probably find John's seminar presentation on the ambient calculation parameters (-ab -ad -ar -aa etc) to be helpful.\n\nThe presentations during the workshop are given by attendees.  At this point there is no way to know what they will be.  Presentations at past workshops have cover a range of topics.\n\nWhen I was a beginner I found the workshop to be inspiring.  While much of the detail was beyond my capability, conceptually it was all very interesting.  I also found the time between presentations, (coffee breaks, lunch and workshop dinner) when I had the opportunity to talk with more experienced users to be particularly valuable for beg.  The workshops provided the motivation I needed persevere.\n\nIf you are a complete beginner I'd suggest working through tutorials before the workshop.  But if your using Radiance now, you're probably know enough to find value in the workshop.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\nPS - Here's a great presentation from Rob at his second workshop (after attending the workshop a year before as self-described newbie).   http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop2/cd/Guglielmetti/abstract.html  Hopefully well have some presentations from relatively new users this year too.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 19, 2011, at 12:18 PM, Sandy Houck wrote:\n\n\nIs there any chance that there will be beginner level classes/workshops available?\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates Inc\n2171 India Street, Suite B\nSan Diego, CA  92101\n619-531-1126 phone,  619-531-1101 fax\nshouck at brummitt.com<http://www.brummitt.com/>\nwww.brummitt.com<http://www.brummitt.com/>\n\nSent: Monday, May 16, 2011 9:59 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nCc: Dane Lay\nAnnouncing the 2011 International Radiance Workshop\n\nWe are still working on the details, and to get a website up for registration.   In the meantime, I want to share what details we have so everyone can start to arrange travel.  I will send another notification when the registration website is ready to accept registration & payment.\n\nDates\nWednesday, August 24 - Seminar day\nThursday, August 25 - Workshop Day 1\nFriday, August 26 - Workshop Day 2\n\nWe're still planning the seminar day, though I can fill you in on some specifics.  John Mardaljevic will present a crash course on the Radiance ambient calculation.  We will also have a few presentations covering measurement and simulation of complex fenestration from Greg Ward, Jacob Jonsson and Peter Apian-Bennewitz.  Someone from LBNL will present a preview of the complex glazing database (database for optical properties of non-specular fenestration).  There will also be a presentation covering a new Radiance material primitive!\n\nCall for Presenters\nAs always, we rely on attendees to present their own work during the two-day workshop.  We are now officially opening the call for presenters.  Please email presentation abstracts to Andy McNeil (amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:amcneil at lbl.gov>) by Wednesday August 3.\n\nRegistration Fee\nWe are working to get prices for everything.  In the meantime, I can tell you that the fee will be less than $300 for all three days.  Presenters will receive a small discount.  We'll announce the official cost probably when the registration website is launched.\n\nHousing\nWe've reserved a small block of rooms at the Berkeley Lab Guest House (http://www.berkeleylabguesthouse.berkeley.edu/).  The guest house is located on the lab property and is conveniently located for the workshop.  However it is a bit removed from restaurants and nightlife of Berkeley.  The lab provides a shuttle bus to downtown Berkeley during normal lab hours.  A taxi service is available after lab hours.\n\nWe also recommend the following two hotels:\n- Hotel Shattuck Plaza - 1 block from the BART and 3 blocks away from the shuttle up to the lab, a short walk to the restaurants of gourmet ghetto.  http://www.hotelshattuckplaza.com/index.cfm\n- Hotel Durant - a 20 minute a walk from BART.  A 12 minute walk across UC campus to the LBL shuttle bus.    http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/sanfranciscoeastbay/durant\n\nWe look forward to hosting everyone here in Berkeley!\n\nAndy\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/1af945d7/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 2011 International Radiance Workshop", "sender": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2BC45EBFC3EB9F45BF5F860C7751088D115A615DBC@VA3DIAXVS551.RED001.local>", "refs": ["<39E82ED1-BCF3-41F6-BFB9-1D795B6F1713@lbl.gov>", "<2BC45EBFC3EB9F45BF5F860C7751088D115A615B32@VA3DIAXVS551.RED001.local>", "<C66715D2-10DA-4FDA-9EEA-F9E2066D80C5@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 16:57:39 -0700", "email": "Andy McNeil", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 2011 International Radiance Workshop"}
