{"body": "\nStrange error.  Out of curiosity, what happens if you use \"-t default\" instead of \"-t white\"?  Also try giving the file as \"./LLM154T5.ies\" instead.\n\nUnfortunately, the error message doesn't give much clue about where it's happening or why.  It could even be an error in the IES file.  If there's a tilt data file that's missing or contains a nul byte, that might cause it as well.  You could try e-mailing me your file off-list as an attachment.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems with impostor surface creation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<75B01EC4-6777-443B-B7EC-283A262966D6@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<mailman.1.1305572400.71143.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<AE3526189BB78143B795EF9C45CB8CBB02F1C7FC@gbsbs.GB-Eng.local>"], "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 22:24:55 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems with impostor surface creation"}
