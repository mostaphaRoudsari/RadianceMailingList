{"body": "\nHi...\n\nit is slightly off-topic if we start to list all software able to export\nobj, dxf, 3ds, or any of the formats supported by Radiance ;-)\n\n\nTakes a while to learn, but the UI is just brandnew...\n\n\nIMHO the main problem of most Autodesk products is that the company\ndistributing these spends more time in locking export features then\ndeveloping new ones. I remember the days when obj, 3ds, ... export was\nstandard in Autocad. Today, you cannot export anything except propietary\nformats as far as I know.\n\n\nMicrostation (which is by Bentley) a long time ago. My favourite for a\nlong time has been formZ, as it combines CAD and modelling capabilities\nplus is strong in export. Besides, of course, you can use Maya, Houdini,\nArchicad, Vectorworks, any tool out there offering just the most basic\nexport features for 3d.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modelling software", "sender": "Lars O.
