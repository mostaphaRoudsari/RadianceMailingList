{"body": "\nSpeaking of free, and SketchUp, NERL has been hard at work for the last year on an entirely new version of OpenStudio. OpenStudio was originally just a SketchUp plugin for the creation of EnergyPlus models, but we have rebuilt it from the ground up as an \"analysis platform\" for doing parametric analysis of whole building energy models.\n\nFor more information visit http://openstudio.nrel.gov, and for Radiance-specific info see this post:\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/forums/openstudio-plug-google-sketchup/help-desk/it-possible-connect-radiance-open-studio-if-it-yes-\n\nIt's very much in alpha phase at this point, but we are planning to get more of the Radiance functionality wired up in the coming months.\n\n- Rob\n\n________________________________________\nSent: Friday, May 20, 2011 10:15 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nDepends a lot on your goals and budget, as well as personal\npreferences.  As Guigi says, obj2rad is your friend.  If you are\nprimarily an architectural designer and already have a preferred\nmodeling tool, I would say stick with it if at all possible.  If your\ninterest is simulation design and you have a budget I'd pick up\nAutodesk Ecotect, which has some nice tools for setting up simulations\nand processing the results, but is a rather difficult modeling tool.\n\nIf you're starting out and have a modest budget, try Rhino.  If you're\nstarting out and have no budget, try SketchUp.\n\nOther tools: Free - Blender, but the UI is 20 years old and it takes a\nlong time to learn.  AutoCAD is widely used in architectural practice,\nbut the full version is expensive, the 3D modeling capabilities are\ncranky, and the student versions are limited in ways that may interfere\nwith simulation work.  Still, if you have it, you might give it a try.\n\nAnyone used Revit, Microstation, or Bentley with Radiance?\n\n--\nRandolph M. Fritz ?
