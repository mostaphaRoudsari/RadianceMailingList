{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nYes, you understand my email correctly.\nI have just find that the material is probably not only the reason. I have\nthe window split into parts parts and only BSDF for bottom part (down)\ngenerate this warning. Here is the command for both parts of window, and\nonly difference is the bounding box, which I assume is correct.\n\n### this one produce the warning\ngenBSDF -c 1000 -n 8 -r @BSDFparameters.opt +forward -backward -geom -dim 0\n1.98 0 1.13 -0.01 0 \\\ngeometry/materialNew.mat geometry/30_geometry.rad >\nresults/BSDFdown_30_new.xml\n\ngenBSDF -c 1000 -n 8 -r @BSDFparameters.opt +forward -backward -geom -dim 0\n1.98 1.13 2.26 -0.01 0 \\\ngeometry/materialNew.mat geometry/30_geometry.rad >\nresults/BSDFup_30_new.xml\n\n\n\nI am actually using dctimestepcpu instead of dctimestep because it is much\nfaster, but I guess it is updated too.\n\nI have got this message before but with dctimestep and not dctimestepcpu. I\nfixed that in that time but I am not sure what was wrong, I guess it was\nsomething with wrong geometry and there were many more dirrection which\ncollected higher %.\n\nMy question could be also understand as: Would this error also appear when\nthere is light concentration in one spot after it is reflected?\n\nThank you\nDavid\n\n\nOn 23 May 2011 08:32, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110523/3ce86190/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<079065AA-B009-47E1-8173-BBA61294EA50@lmi.net>", "sender": "David Appelfeld", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTik-b5OKBYSOvM4Okfv8rG08D+9=PQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTimLsTy=jnc48jTfAQ9OGMXCRbAmRg@mail.gmail.com>", "<079065AA-B009-47E1-8173-BBA61294EA50@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon, 23 May 2011 08:53:33 -0700", "email": "d.appelfeld at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] warning - outgoing BSDF direction 142collects 107.4% of light"}
