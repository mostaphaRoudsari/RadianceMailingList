I assume from your earlier e-mails that you are using the latest HEAD of Radiance.  You should make sure that everything is up-to-date and try it again.  In particular, we fixed some problems last December in the normalization of results.  The dctimestep program has also been improved and corrected.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110523/154923c2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<BANLkTimLsTy=jnc48jTfAQ9OGMXCRbAmRg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<079065AA-B009-47E1-8173-BBA61294EA50@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<BANLkTimLsTy=jnc48jTfAQ9OGMXCRbAmRg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 23 May 2011 08:32:59 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] warning - outgoing BSDF direction 142collects 107.4% of light"}
