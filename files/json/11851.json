{"body": "\nYeah, your parameters are set really high.  Setting -lw 1e-12 means that in the limit, you will trace a trillion rays for every input ray, and these trillion rays will have to be summed up by rtcontrib.  You're probably running out of RAM in your rtcontrib process.  I wouldn't bother with the -n 4 -- it won't speed things up and it makes your memory problem worse.  Try using -n 1 and -lw 1e-9 or greater.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/1ecdedf1/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<BANLkTikR6MfQdK5G-QZgUH3hQ=LO+eN57w@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B3A4D25E-C699-46CE-9E70-58DCBA6BAE92@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<BANLkTinV=7tVgV061N_9WPdNNNOqWxM+Ew@mail.gmail.com>", "<7333FB90-408B-4A10-8219-5C09E4A76CCE@lmi.net>", "<BANLkTik7a6+Y8_E_WONSpXgKDh8HV3NTzg@mail.gmail.com>", "<7B80B5E8-C780-4A48-8894-7F9455CC705C@lmi.net>", "<BANLkTikR6MfQdK5G-QZgUH3hQ=LO+eN57w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 19:32:06 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Error: rtcontrib: fatal - incomplete rayvalue from rtrace"}
