In the meantime, I want to share what details we have so everyone can start to arrange travel.  I will send another notification when the registration website is ready to accept registration & payment.\n\nDates\nWednesday, August 24 - Seminar day\nThursday, August 25 - Workshop Day 1\nFriday, August 26 - Workshop Day 2\n\nWe're still planning the seminar day, though I can fill you in on some specifics.  John Mardaljevic will present a crash course on the Radiance ambient calculation.  We will also have a few presentations covering measurement and simulation of complex fenestration from Greg Ward, Jacob Jonsson and Peter Apian-Bennewitz.  Someone from LBNL will present a preview of the complex glazing database (database for optical properties of non-specular fenestration).  There will also be a presentation covering a new Radiance material primitive!\n\nCall for Presenters\nAs always, we rely on attendees to present their own work during the two-day workshop.  We are now officially opening the call for presenters.  Please email presentation abstracts to Andy McNeil (amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:amcneil at lbl.gov>) by Wednesday August 3.\n\nRegistration Fee\nWe are working to get prices for everything.  In the meantime, I can tell you that the fee will be less than $300 for all three days.  Presenters will receive a small discount.  We'll announce the official cost probably when the registration website is launched.\n\nHousing\nWe've reserved a small block of rooms at the Berkeley Lab Guest House (http://www.berkeleylabguesthouse.berkeley.edu/).  The guest house is located on the lab property and is conveniently located for the workshop.  However it is a bit removed from restaurants and nightlife of Berkeley.  The lab provides a shuttle bus to downtown Berkeley during normal lab hours.  A taxi service is available after lab hours.\n\nWe also recommend the following two hotels:\n- Hotel Shattuck Plaza - 1 block from the BART and 3 blocks away from the shuttle up to the lab, a short walk to the restaurants of gourmet ghetto.  http://www.hotelshattuckplaza.com/index.cfm\n- Hotel Durant - a 20 minute a walk from BART.  A 12 minute walk across UC campus to the LBL shuttle bus.    http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/sanfranciscoeastbay/durant\n\nWe look forward to hosting everyone here in Berkeley!\n\nAndy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/87bac6ef/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 2011 International Radiance Workshop", "sender": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2BC45EBFC3EB9F45BF5F860C7751088D115A615B32@VA3DIAXVS551.RED001.local>", "refs": ["<39E82ED1-BCF3-41F6-BFB9-1D795B6F1713@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 12:18:11 -0700", "email": "Andy McNeil", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 2011 International Radiance Workshop"}
