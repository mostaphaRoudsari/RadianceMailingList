{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI have one simple question : how can I know which -av parameter value is most\naccurate for a scene.\n\nI am rendering scene inside museum building, and I tried to follow procedure\nfor -av and EXPOSURE setting from RWR book. Resulting ambient values are\nsomething around 5, but I think it is too high for interior.\n\nSince I have to compare real and simulated values how can I know which -av\nvalue is good enough?\n\nThanks,\nMarija Cvetkovic\ncveleglg@bankerinter.net\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "marija cvetkovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<200408071446.59736.marica@elfak.ni.ac.yu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Aug  7 14:46:51 2004", "email": "marica at elfak.ni.ac.yu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question about -av parameter"}
