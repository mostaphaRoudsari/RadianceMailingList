{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am using Ecotect export to Radiance. In Ecotect, I placed camera to get\nilluminance image, but it seems that the output image shows lux levels on\nground level. It doesn't give lux contours on a task plane (at any level).\nCan anyone help me out in getting lux levels on a certain height.\n\nThanks!\nDharam\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/26bd2a26/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "dharam", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTikRXs+XhcSfPH+vpCdd8Y2X_UsAFA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 00:17:10 +0530", "email": "dharmesh.124 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendered illuminance image on task plane (at acertain height)"}
