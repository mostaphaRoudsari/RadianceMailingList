{"body": "\nHello again Lars,\n\nI have a script already working and giving results but, it is slow, taking\nunder consideration that is using only 1 core. The script, made in Matlab,\nworks in the following way\n\n1) 5 embedded for (degrees of each blind and sun position)\n2) creates a new folder\n3) copying necessary 5 files to make the combination (1 of 1280)\n4) copies the standard files (materials, geometry, view)\n5) Oconv the files\n6) rpict is creating the image and stores it to a standard folder with all\nthe results\n7) go to number (1)\n\nThis is in general my script. It works but 7 minutes per simulation for 1280\nsimulation, equals...  90 hours.\n\nThis is why I need the grid, and apart from that since I can run the\nsimulations in parallel (thank you for the info), I can save some time until\nRadiance is installed, setup and test for many simulations.\n\nOnce again thank you for your time\n\nSotiris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wednesday, May 18, 2011 2:06 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi!\n\n\nTwo options:\n\nA) Create your scene octrees, name them according to your parameters.\nCreate a rif-file with the settings you use. In this rif-file, you use\ndummies names for the critical parameters that should not be shared\n(e.g. all file names including the ambient file). Write a script that\nloops through all the possible names (and thus setups), replaces the\ndummy by the current scene name, runs rad on the rif file. sed is a very\nuseful command for doing so.\n\nB) Create one rif file, and replace the varying parts of your scene (can\nbe material definitions, geometry, ...) by shell commands (preceded by\n!) that produce the output. In the simplest way, this command can just\nreturn the value of an environment variable that is altered by your\nscript. E.g. in your script, you set the variable myVariableMat=\"void\nplastic thisTimeItsWhite 0 0 5 1 1 1 0 0\", and in your material\ndefinition file, you reference it by adding a line !echo $myVariableMat.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-----\nNo virus found in this message.\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com\nVersion: 10.0.1375 / Virus Database: 1509/3644 - Release Date: 05/17/11\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4DD3A7FE.6090400@gmx.net>", "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4dd3c3ca.ca97cc0a.64e2.6659@mx.google.com>", "refs": ["<4dd37f3a.d94fcc0a.6514.5074@mx.google.com>\t<A5763843-F697-4B6C-B016-7D652BC852C4@gmx.net>\t<4dd39f9d.d94fcc0a.43c5.5c8c@mx.google.com>", "<4DD3A7FE.6090400@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 18 May 2011 16:04:12 +0300", "email": "Lars O.
