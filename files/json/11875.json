{"body": "\nHello Lars and Christopher,\n\n\n\nMy idea is to run many simulations, for now up to 1200, in order to create data for a fuzzy system.  I have many simulations because I have a glass part of a building which has 4 sets of blinds which are autonomously controlled. If I am thinking correctly when the angle of each blind changes we have a new scene, which is separately simulated. For each scene I am running a new rpict command to see the result. I found out that in the University we have a grid-computer which is working on Linux. From the grid-computer web-site I read the following:\n\n\n\nTranslators\n\n*\tC (gcc 4.1.2 <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/>   gcc44  4.4.0)\n*\tFortran77  <http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/languages/fortran/> & 98 (gfortran 4.1.2 gfortan44 4.4.0)\n*\tC++ <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/>   (g++  4.1.2  g++44 4.4.0)\n*\tJava <http://java.sun.com/>   (jdk 1.6.0  gcj   4.1.2)\n*\tPython <http://www.python.org/>   2.4.3\n\nData bases\n\n*\tMySQL 5.0.77 <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/>\n\nComputational Systems\n\n*\tMatlab 7.9.0 <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>\n*\tOctave 3.0.5 <http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/about.html>\n*\tR-2.12.2 <http://www.r-project.org/>\n\n*\tManagement systems and grid operations\n*\tTORQUE 2.3.6 <http://www.clusterresources.com/products/torque-resource-manager.php>\n*\topenMPI 1.4.1 <http://www.open-mpi.org/>\n*\tmaui 3.2 <http://www.clusterresources.com/products/maui/>\n\nThis is the software of the grid. So I was thinking, to install Radiance on the grid and run the commands from it. So my main question is if I can use radiance on a grid-computer, and If I use the advantage of the grid by running in parallel the same command.\n\n\n\nFor now, since I was in a hurry to get some results, I am creating the combinations in Matlab and I am running rpict from DOS. I know it is old but I for now I have in the University only an Win OS computer.\n\n\n\nI hope I managed to give you some details. If not please tell me so, in order to reply again.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your time\n\n\n\nSotiris\n\n\n\nSent: Wednesday, May 18, 2011 12:14 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nWhat exactly is your question? Of course you can start multiple rtrace or whatever processes, they will not care about each other. If you run more processes then CPUs, they will slow down, same is true (even worse) if you exceed available memory. If you have lots of scenes, you can write a script to automate the handling. You may also like batch processing queues if you have a lot of processes to distribute. Still, it is impossible to answer your question if it is that general.\n\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n--\n\nDipl.-Ing.

I would run the same command (rpict, rtrace, rad) many times but for different scenes.oct. Do you know if this is possible?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\n\n\nSotiris\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_____\n\nNo virus found in this message.\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com\nVersion: 10.0.1375 / Virus Database: 1509/3644 - Release Date: 05/17/11\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110518/926b5daf/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<A5763843-F697-4B6C-B016-7D652BC852C4@gmx.net>", "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4dd39f9d.d94fcc0a.43c5.5c8c@mx.google.com>", "refs": ["<4dd37f3a.d94fcc0a.6514.5074@mx.google.com>", "<A5763843-F697-4B6C-B016-7D652BC852C4@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 18 May 2011 13:29:50 +0300", "email": "Lars O.
