{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\nIf the ambient value looks too high, then it probably is too high.  If\nyou need an ambient value for the interior, the procedure in the book\nshould be followed on an interior view.\n\nYou should also investigate the \"compamb\" script:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/compamb.1.html\n\nThis script relies on an operational rad input file, which it uses to\ngenerate the ambient values for several views, setting -av 0 0 0.  It\nthen averages the ambient values computed by rpict into a suitable -av\nsetting, which it appends to your rad input file.  This is the\n\"scientific\" way to set -av properly.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Question about -av parameter", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AE10DF80-E87D-11D8-9775-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<200408071446.59736.marica@elfak.ni.ac.yu>"], "datetime": "Sat Aug  7 16:28:03 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question about -av parameter"}
