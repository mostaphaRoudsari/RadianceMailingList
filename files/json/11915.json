And they should just cause noise that is a fraction of the values from the direct sampling of the window by rsensor.  So the only way I can think that glow vs. light would make a sizable difference is if your sensor is somewhat shielded from the window (by sensitivity or by placement) and/or most of the rsensor samples a sent to surfaces near the window ( ie focused sensitivity).  Neither of these seem to be the cause though using -I+ would have had the effect of masking the direct contribution from the window in a similar way because rsensor rays that hit the window don't return a direct value but instead start an iluminance calculation on the window.\n\nI'd suggest that while you are running everything again without -I that you also simulate using classic Radiance techniques (ie not the three-phase method).\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<BANLkTimtdywSK3JX4QxS04+zqZZ_pzCXTg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D7FA3DC1-A078-4A04-9615-AC057B36843E@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTimQq7WLGha-cJGJuX5tuT2KJW581Q@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTimtdywSK3JX4QxS04+zqZZ_pzCXTg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 2 May 2011 10:07:55 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of windowwith sensor located close to the window"}
