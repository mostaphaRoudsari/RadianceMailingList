{"body": "\nHi Anne,\n\nanother thing that came to my mind...\n\nYou are calling rtcontrib for the VMX using rsensor in your script like\nthat:\nrsensor -h -rd 1000 -vf views/luxstat.vf sensors/WattStopper_LS-290C.dat\n. |\\\nrtcontrib -c 1000 -f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -fo -o\nresults/\"$vmxname\"_%s.vmx \\\n-b kbinS -m windowlight -b kbinS -m windowlightsens \\\n-I+ -ab 3 -ad 2000 -ds .15 -lw 1e-4 model_vmx.oct\n\nDo you want to obtain the sensor signal split up into the Klems bins?\nIf yes, I'm not sure if it works like that...\n\nYou are using rsensor to generate 1000 rays (i.e. origin and direction)\naccording to the sensor-file.\nThese points and directions are then given to rtcontrib, where you use -c\n1000 to accumulate all\n1000 results and -I+ to switch to irradiances.\nHowever, this means that rtcontrib calculates irradiances for 1000 pairs of\npoints and directions as\nif it was e.g. a grid for illuminance calculations. So you do not obtain the\nsensor signal, but a mean\nof the 1000 calculated irradiances.\n\nI hope I'm not missing anything...\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n2011/4/30 Anne Iversen <iversen.anne at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110502/964c69d2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<BANLkTimtdywSK3JX4QxS04+zqZZ_pzCXTg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "David Geisler-Moroder", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTi=tG6Ndz-tKXk=_e49raaxwLaeJAA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTimQq7WLGha-cJGJuX5tuT2KJW581Q@mail.gmail.com>", "<BANLkTimtdywSK3JX4QxS04+zqZZ_pzCXTg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 2 May 2011 11:41:44 +0200", "email": "david.moroder at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of windowwith sensor located close to the window"}
