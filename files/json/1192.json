This will make you a nice AVI file using a\nvariety of codecs, but it's a Windows program:\nhttp://makeavi.sourceforge.net/\n\nThese are quick & dirty, but easy.  The animated gif is nice because\n*everyone* has something to play those back, but you have no control over\nthe playback process.  An mpeg or something would be better because of the\nbetter playback control.  For this you need mencoder or something Jack\nuses and I forgot the name.  I never did figure out how to use mencoder,\nbut I'd like to.  I think Jack and Francesco have some experience with\nthis stuff...\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Creating movie from still images", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri Feb  4 22:14:01 2005"}
