{"body": "\nHi George,\n\nThis is an intelligent and well-written question.  Thank you for taking the time to construct such a nice posting.\n\nSetting -aa 0 makes the calculation very sensitive to settings of -lw and -lr.  You should make sure that -lr is negative to enable Russian roulette sampling -- try \"-lr -8\" for starters.  If this doesn't fix the problem, try reducing the -lw parameter setting by powers of 10 until the discrepancy goes away or become acceptable.\n\nBest of luck,\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  You may find my 2005 presentation on new Radiance features illustrative:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop4/cd/website/PDF/Ward_talk1.pdf\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4DEF4B1B.60406@st-andrews.ac.uk>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DBA87AC7-F215-4F04-BC96-1C8275FE883A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4DEF4B1B.60406@st-andrews.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Wed, 8 Jun 2011 03:55:18 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Odd values when using gensky and ambientaccuracy is zero..."}
