{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nSure, that is the preferred way. However, I would consider how much\nrendering work you expect. If it justifies setting up a dedicated\nmachine - do it unix-like. If it is not that much rendering time, you\nare still free to\n\na) wait and have rad sequentially render images using one core\n\nb) split your renderings and manually start processes - as long as they\ndo not need to share data, you do not need locking\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rad -n and -N parameters / switches", "sender": "Lars O.
