{"body": "\nDear Radiance experts,\n\nSuppose you want to use Python to call rad command and render an image using\nthe following script:\n\n################################\nimport os\nrad_command = \"rad -e -v vw1 /test.rif\"\nos.system(rad_command)\n################################\n\nPython will hang there until the rad command running in background is\nfinished. During this period, you can do nothing in the Python Shell...\n\nSo, is there a way to use Python to call the Terminal and \"paste\" the rad\ncommand string into the Terminal and then run rad? In this way, Python is\nfreed from the rad rendering process once it's be activated in the Terminal.\n\n\nAppreciate your advices!\n\n(using Mac OS 10.6.7, Radiance 4, and Python 2.6.5)\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110619/86994ab4/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTimYDcdBkFeLtttCjBSayb6bd4wSYg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 19 Jun 2011 20:48:30 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Use Python to execute Radiance command"}
