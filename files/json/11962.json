{"body": "\nDear Greg, Thanks for you reply!\n\nActually, I was asking whether we can specify the directory where the .hdr\nimage generated by rad will be saved.\n\nI just found out that it can be done, and the \"root name\" for the PICTURE\nvariable of rad can include the path where the image file will be placed\nonce it's generated.\n\ne.g.\n\"PICTURE = /Volumes/ZJ_1TB/test/rad_image\" will save the \"rad_image_vw1.hdr\"\nfile in the following place: \"/Volumes/ZJ_1TB/test\".\n\nAnyway, thanks for the clarification!\n\n- Ji\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 20, 2011 at 1:00 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110621/c4c91dc5/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<8043CFD1-2C0D-43A3-A89E-82570129F3E1@lmi.net>", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTikpngP3Dav+d5WZCWsz0CJyfumNiQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTimmsu+4ox0wYdS9VZoqBdYwY8fvmg@mail.gmail.com>", "<8043CFD1-2C0D-43A3-A89E-82570129F3E1@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 00:21:08 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] [?] how to define the path and name of the.hdr file generated by rad"}
