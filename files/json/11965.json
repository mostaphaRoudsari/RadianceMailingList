{"body": "\nJi\n\nThe \"&\" is a standard Unix shell control character and as such can be\napplied to any process, not only those related to Radiance.\n\nSometimes it is tricky to find the right place for it, though, especially if\nyou have multiple redirections in your command line. You should always test\nyour commands manually before you use them in a Python \"os.system()\" call.\n\nNote 1: If you use the return value of the os.system() call to check if the\ncommand was successful you will get a \"0\" (=success) if the command with \"&\"\nwas started successfully, not if it actually run without errors.\n\nNote 2: \"os.system()\" was replaced by \"Popen()\" in the \"subprocess\" module.\n\nNote 3: If you use your Python script only to automate a simple sequence of\ntasks you should be fine with using rad directly in the script. For more\ncontrol over the processes and their success/failure you should use the\nunderlying programs \"oconv\", \"rpict\", \"pfilt\" etc. directly. Unfortunately\nthe project to write a nice little Python wrapper library for Radiance\ndidn't really get of the ground ...\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 20, 2011 at 11:16 AM, Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110620/d26af28a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Use Python to execute Radiance command", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTi=JkY-arNrzBK1zKL6KXhO_xzL9Tw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BANLkTimYDcdBkFeLtttCjBSayb6bd4wSYg@mail.gmail.com>", "<E13D6120-8E8B-4144-98AC-A6E36CC3906C@lmi.net>", "<BANLkTinTUUQ=cf+ByRgMAaq=7AHOf7jrPg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 20 Jun 2011 12:14:22 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Use Python to execute Radiance command"}
