{"body": "\nHi Randolph,\n\nGreat thinking! I like the idea already!\n\nBut could you give a bit more information?\n\n\nAre you referring to SFU (Windows Services for Unix, or SUA or Interix, or\nhow its called now)?\nSFU has an (old) gcc compiler. (See: http://suacommunity.com/SUA.aspx)\n(other tools are in the warehouse or developer packages).\n\n\nWhy would you need MSVC? As far as I know MSVC only compiles win32 (or\nwin64) code, so no Unix, no fork and no NSF.\n\nOh, and one more thing, if it is SFU you are referring to, then it is also\navailable for Vista, (and XP with an hack).\n\nRegards,\n\nGuy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110627/e5d70102/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Guy Vaessen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BANLkTin+1m7R3V+jdS=4VY+B0_Goqm08Fw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 21:27:55 +0200", "email": "guy.vaessen at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OS Compariton (WAS:Re: rad -n and -N parameters/ switches)"}
