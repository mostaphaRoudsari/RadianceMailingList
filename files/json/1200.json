{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nthe CD of the 2004 Radiance workshop that ended yesterday in Fribourg\n(in the heart of Switzerland) is now available online.  It was good fun\nand highly informative - thanks to Greg, Raphael and all speakers.\n\nregards\nPeter Apian-Bennewitz\n\nPS: I took the liberty of removing the list of participants from the\nonline version. Such a nicely grouped, unprotected, online list of valid\nemails is just too easy for spam generators.\nThe downloadable ISO images of the CD are left in the original state, so\nyou can burn the CD yourself, which is nearly as good as having been\nthere.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20041013120317.GA3051@www.radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Oct 13 14:06:20 2004", "email": "apian at www.radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] CD of 2004 workshop now online"}
