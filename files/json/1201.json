Daysim is based on LBNL's Radiance software and combines the Perez sky\nmodel with a daylight coefficient approach to effectively predict the annual\ndaylight availability (daylight factor and daylight autonomy) in buildings\nfor multiple sites worldwide (you can import EnergyPlus epw climate files).\nDaysim further features a user behavior model which allows to compare the\nelectric lighting use for manual and automated controls (occupancy sensor,\nphotocell control). The software runs under Windows and Linux OS and can be\ndownloaded from  <http://www.daysim.com/> www.daysim.com. The following new\nfeatures have been added since version 2.0:\n\n*\textended tutorial: an extensive document to help newcomers to get\nstarted with daylight simulations\n\n*\tstep-by-step instructions of how to import building scenes from\nAutoCAD, SketchUp, and Ecotect into Daysim\n\n*\ta list of case studies of how your colleagues have used Daysim in\nactual building projects\n\n*\timproved simulation output in html-format\n\n*\timproved JAVA GUI with an extensive help file system\n\n*\tbased on Radiance version 3R6P1(latest version)\n\n*\tthe new version allows to model Radiance function file materials\n(transdata, etc.)\n\nYour comments/suggestions are appreciated. Best regards,\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Ph.D.                        Associate Research Officer\nNational Research Council Canada         NRC Construction\n1200 Montreal Road M-24, Ottawa          Ontario K1A 0R6 Canada\ntel: (613) 993-9703                                  fax: (613) 954 3733\n\ne-mail:  <blocked::mailto:christoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>\nchristoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\n\nThe Lightswitch Wizard (initial design)\n<blocked::http://www.buildwiz.com/> www.buildwiz.com\nDAYSIM (expert software)\n<blocked::http://www.daysim.com/> www.daysim.com\nRadiance Workshop 2005\n<blocked::http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005>\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050208/ca58480b/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "datetime": "Tue Feb  8 23:28:44 2005"}
