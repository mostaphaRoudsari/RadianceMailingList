I need to get rid of those. First I tried the most\nsimple approach, setting the viewfile such that the sky isn?t included, et\nvoila, openings are black. This approach seems oversimplistic, since it\nyields a complete different rendering, looks like any source outside of the\nclipping plane isn?t included (I suppose this is the expected behaviour). So\nI need to do this in a smarter manner. Has anyone run into this before? The\nbest would be to render the mask as a separated image, such that they can be\ncombined using pcomb.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050209/182fddea/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "datetime": "Wed Feb  9 15:02:13 2005"}
