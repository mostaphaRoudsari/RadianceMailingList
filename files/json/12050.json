{"body": "\nHi Judhajit!\n\nIn addition to previous replies, I would recommend these two:\n\n1) study how rad is setting the ambient settings based on the\ninformation given in the rif-file - it is usually quite successful doing\nso. Code is open source...\n\n2) Mark Stock did a lot of experimentation, especially focusing on\nscenes with large amounts of geometry objects which tend to stretch the\nambient cache's efficiency. He was especially interested in rendering\ntimes and the visual appearance, still a great documentation by Mark at\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html\n\nBesides that - it is good practice to do some work on finding out when\nyou settings lead to \"stable\" results. So for each scene type, it may be\nwise to vary ambient settings from \"high performance\" to \"high accuracy\"\nfor different ambient bounces (-ab), at least once for sunny and once\nfor cloudy skies. You can do so e.g. by rendering illuminance on the\nfloor plane one pixel wide perpendicular to the facade. Plot the\nresults, and you will find\n\na) at which number of ambient bounces increasing -ab does not lead to\nsignificant increase in recorded illuminance\n\nb) at which \"accuracy\" you get a reasonable (usually rather smooth) plot\n- very low accuracy tends to give a lot of spikes in such a plot, even\nif the average may be acceptable\n\nHaving these tests done will probably give you a much better feeling\nabout the parameters in your rpict/rtrace command line and should be\nkept with the results :-)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<DE48760D34B3BC47BCBCDD005AF55828017C6104@exc02sfo1us.us.wspgroup.com>", "sender": "Lars O.
