{"body": "\nHi Julitta!\n\n\nThe last command, \"which rtrace\". should tell you where the binary file\nrtrace is located that gets executed when you simply type \"rtrace\". That\nassumes that it is actually in one of the directories in your path\nvariable. In your case, that seams not to be the case, as the\nwhich-command did not give any output.\n\nCan you verify that your Radiance-binaries (the bin-subdirectory of the\nRadiance installation) is included in your Path variable?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION", "sender": "Lars O.
