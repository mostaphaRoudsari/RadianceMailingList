I did a\nquick search and found the following webpage:\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/quicktime/quicktimeintro/tools/\n\nOn there is a link to \"QTVR Make Panorama 2\", which does exactly this.\nI haven't tried it, but I recall it used to be necessary to first rotate\nthe image, using protate to go to ra_pict, then to this tool.\nUnfortunately, they only have a Mac OS version, but with a little more\nsearching, you might find a Windows edition somewhere....\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: QTVR panoramas", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat, 2 Feb 2002 09:17:59 -0800"}
