To be clear: This message means that you can now use the Radiance\ncommands/applications without using their full path and name.

You\ndownloaded the rad4R0supp.tar.gz archive because it contains a few  files\nthat are essential for the more advanced calculations in Radiance. You moved\nthese to /usr/local/lib/ray because that's where Radiance will look for them\nby default.\n\nNow you are all set to use Radiance on your Mac. Radiance is all about\nwriting text files and typing commands in Terminal. You should get used to a\ngood text editor on the Mac (TextEdit will do but others like TextMate have\nmore features). Also search the net for tutorials on using the Bash. This is\nthe environment you are in when you type a command in Terminal. There are\nmany features of Bash which make your live easier (example: the up-arrow key\nrecalls the last command you typed, press it again and you go further back\nin your command history).\n\nTo actually learn Radiance start with the excellent tutorials by Axel\nJacobs:\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/index.shtml\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110721/1f9d8e34/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k38RtBPdc7s+mBVi6-KtGDKmwJeTzKRNTGMdu+hRStqxA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<mailman.102.1311130627.1283.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<SNT105-W291D50F263DC6814D8AB41BC4F0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Thu, 21 Jul 2011 06:55:59 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION"}
