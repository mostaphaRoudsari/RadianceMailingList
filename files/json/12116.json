{"body": "\nDear colleague Radiance modelers,\n\nMy research group seeks  Radiance  models of architectural spaces for experiments related to Designing Visually Accessible Spaces, particularly focusing on low vision issues.  We are developing a   ?hazard  detection? module,  for use by designers and architects, which is now in the validation phase.  Automated results, based on Radiance renderings and data sets, are being correlated with live subject experiments.\nI have exhausted the modest sized, detailed models which I have built over the past decades and seek additional models which include features such as arches, columns, steps, ramps, furniture,  interesting patterns, etc. Images will be produced for presentation to subjects and for analysis. These will remain in-house unless we request permission for publication.\n\nPlease contact me directly if you are able to contribute to the project. Ideally a data set includes all scene and lighting descriptions,  a RIF file,   a few images of the environment and an overview to your data structure.\n\nshakespe at indiana.edu\n\nThis work is supported by the National Eye Institute of the NIH 1 R01 EY017835-01.\n\nThanks! See you at the 2011 workshop.\n\nRob\n\nRob Shakespeare, Professor of Lighting Design\nHead of Design and Technology\nDepartment of Theatre and Drama\nIndiana University\n275 North Jordan Avenue\nBloomington, IN 47405\n\nshakespe at indiana.edu\n812-855-4367\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110721/8fe21913/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<4E2784FC.1090407@curtin.edu.au>", "sender": "Shakespeare, Robert A.", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CA4D871E.BA5F%shakespe@indiana.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 21 Jul 2011 12:09:16 +0000", "email": "shakespe at indiana.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Seeking modest size,detailed interior environments."}
