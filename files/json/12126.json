Please see bellow, sorry for so many questions...\n\nOn Sun, Jul 24, 2011 at 3:28 AM, Lars O. Grobe <grobe at gmx.net> wrote:\n\n\nHow about the accuracy of calculated illuminance?

It seems not updated for\nseveral years. Is that suitable for annual simulation?\n\n\n\nI know little about these tools. Is the optical modeling tool capable of\ndoing annual simulation? Could you recommend some tools? I just heart about\nPhotopia and only tried once.  It would be better if the tool is free, but\nthis does not matter.\n\n\n\nDo you mean I separate direct and ambient calculations? Could you tell me\nhow to do direct calculation only? If I set ab =0, it underestimates the\ndirect sunlight illuminance. I do not know how to let the direct sunlight\nenter in to the space through the tubular light pipe. What materials should\nI have to use for the light pipe?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110724/96990ca7/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Simulating light pipe performance", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwpH3TspoFvpfD92vmr527sRfgbq71QXNKkWy0x2tqcUcg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CABzgtwrN-RvXdnzCDyf9ry=Pf0B-nTZ927FkwOsRfKQZKNS-zg@mail.gmail.com>", "<4E2BC990.2050109@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Sun, 24 Jul 2011 14:23:06 -0400", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Simulating light pipe performance"}
