In this case acos() is probably being fed a value\noutside the bounds -1 to 1, acos() is defined to return an error outside\nthese bounds (man acos). An alternative is to use Acos() (see\nrayinit.cal), which I believe forces the boundary condition. It is\nlikely that the subsequent divide by zero error is related to the domain\nerror with acos(). Of course this is largely a guess based on the error\noutput you indicated. If we had the cal to lookout then this might\nprovide more information.\n\n-Jack\n\nKirk Thibault wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Divide by zero with colorpict", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Fri Feb 11 20:26:33 2005"}
