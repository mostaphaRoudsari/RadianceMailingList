There are tons of other\ninteresting links included in the article, all about colour calibration of\nmonitors and printers.\n\nSomewhere on the RADIANCE web site there is a test chart with some\ninstructions to go with it, but I doubt anybody has ever taken a look at\nthem.\n\nIf you have no idea what Gamma calibration means, then DO read the article\nand follow some links, no matter what system you use!\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daysim 2.1", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Mon Feb 14 12:28:16 2005"}
