Here we go\nagain...\n\nHi list,\n\nfor all LINUX users out there that used to think gamma calibrating was for\nwimps, just because they couldt do it under X, I thought I send you this\nlink\nhttp://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/02/07/2244242&from=rss to\nan article titled\n\"Looking good: Monitor calibration under X\". There are tons of other\ninteresting links included in the article, all about colour calibration of\nmonitors and printers.\n\nSomewhere on the RADIANCE web site there is a test chart with some\ninstructions to go with it, but I doubt anybody has ever taken a look at\nthem.\n\nIf you have no idea what Gamma calibration means, then DO read the article\nand follow some links, no matter what system you use!\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Mon Feb 14 12:35:38 2005"}
