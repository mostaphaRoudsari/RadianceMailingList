{"body": "\nGeorg,\n\nYou have eased my mind a whole heap.  After giving it a try for myself, i\nam now agreeing with you that the -i option of rpict does produce incident\nirradiance values.  I haven't yet tried this out on a visualisation\nincluding specular highlights, but have no reason to believe that the\nspecular highlights will appear and make the results meaningless.\n\nSeems that, without looking into the source code, i was mislead by the\n(all-too-brief) explanation in the Radiance manual.\n\nThanks again,\nPhil G.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] re: trans material with sunless sky", "sender": "Phillip Greenup", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4.3.2.7.2.20011219143345.00b09bd0@pop.qut.edu.au>", "refs": ["<4.3.2.7.2.20011213141507.00aebef0@pop.qut.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Wed, 19 Dec 2001 14:38:59 +1000", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] re: trans material with sunless sky"}
