{"body": "\nWelcome Julitta.\n\nRadiance is a bit tricky to install because it used to be an old fashioned\nsource only distribution. To install it you had to have a C-compiler\ninstalled (and you had to know how to use it). Things are a bit easier these\ndays but you still need to change a lot of system related settings on a Mac\nto get it running.\n\nOn Mon, Jul 18, 2011 at 2:38 AM, Julitta Yunus <julittayunus at live.com>wrote:\n\n\nYes, these instructions are for the source code installation. For the most\npart you can ignore these.\n\n\n\nXAMPP has nothing to do with Radiance. Forget about it.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the source code that needs to be compiled first. You should download\nthe following package:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad4R0_macosx.tar.gz\n\nIt contains binaries which can be executed immediately. Unpack the archive\n(\"double click\") until you can browse the contents in Finder.\n\nTo \"install\" the programs pick a folder called \"Radiance\" in your own\n\"Library\" folder or in the \"Applications\" folder. Copy the \"bin\" folder from\nthe downloaded archive into the \"Radiance\" folder.\n\nNow download the \"auxiliary files\" archive\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R0supp.tar.gz and unpack\nit. Copy the \"lib\" folder in this archive into the \"Radiance\" folder as\nwell.\n\n\nNow you have to set environment variables which allow your Terminal shell to\nfind the binaries and supporting files. Open TextEdit.app and type (or copy\nand paste) the following content:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>PATH</key>\n<string>/Users/julitta/Library/Radiance/bin</string>\n<key>RAYPATH</key>\n<string>/Users/julitta/Library/Radiance/lib</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIf your home directory is not called \"julitta\" or you have chosen the\n\"Applications\" folder adjust the paths in the file accordingly. Make sure it\nis a \"plain text\" document (shift-cmd-T) and save it as \"environment.plist\"\nin your home directory. There is no \".txt\" after the \".plist\"!\n\nOpen the Terminal.app application (in \"Applications/Utilities\"). You should\nkeep this app in the dock because it is you primary interface for Radiance.\nType the following two commands:\n\nmkdir .MacOSX\nmv environment.plist .MacOSX\n\nNow close Terminal.app and right-click on the Dock icon and select \"quit\".\nThe white dot below the icon has to vanish. Open Terminal.app again (I told\nyou to keep in in the Dock ...).\n\nNow type\n\necho $PATH\nwhich rtrace\n\nEach of these commands should show you a path that contains your Radiance\ninstallation directory.\n\nI hope others will jump in and explain how to use Radiance because I have to\ngo to work now.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110718/93778ee9/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k3OsOKeJAt53XKG2H0KavXDRr+0AFUo4Vn6hdOka4UmAA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BLU0-SMTP25F26929B3842D4314D1A5BC4A0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 07:00:26 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION"}
