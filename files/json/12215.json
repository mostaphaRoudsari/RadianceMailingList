{"body": "\nDear RADIANCE experts,\n\nI'm Julitta. Postgraduate students. Need your help on installing RADIANCE into my laptop. I'm using MacBook Mac OS X 10.6.7.\n\nRead and follow instruction from RAdsite lbnl website and various forum and other websites showing instruction on installing the software. Unfortunately i'm lost and totally black out.\n\nHonestly I do not know where to start, such as... where to type a command... Have tried XAMPP command as suggested but failed to execute or unzip the mentioned files/folder.\n\nI've done the very first part of downloading the rad4R0all.tar.gz. (is it as simple as clicking the address, then it goes to your \"downloads\" folder, then double click, so from rad4r0_macosx-1.tar turn to a folder of rad4R0_macosx). Then? How to unpack or to be specific where to type this unzip<rad4roall.tar.gz.......\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulitta Yunus\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Julitta Yunus", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BLU0-SMTP25F26929B3842D4314D1A5BC4A0@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:38:44 +0800", "email": "julittayunus at live.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION"}
