Assuming you want a vertical grid and your z-axis is up, adding\nthe following transform to the string arguments would rotate the\nmaterial so that your surface was instead in the x-z plane:\n\n-rx -90\n\nSince we use a right-handed coordinate system in Radiance, and positive\nangles correspond to counter-clockwise rotations looking down the\nselected axis, this rotates the positive y direction in the original\norientation so it is now in the positive z direction.  Since this\nmaterial is symmetric front-to-back, it actually didn't matter in this\ncase which direction we rotated it.\n\nIf you want the surface in the y-z plane instead,  you would use:\n\n-ry -90\n\nThis rotates the positive x-axis into the positive z direction.  Just\nto be clear, your BRTDfunc would look like so:\n\nvoid BRTDfunc grating\n12\n0       0       0\nspectrans spectrans spectrans\n0       0       0\ngrating.cal -ry -90\n0\n13\nrrefl grefl brefl\nrtrns gtrns btrns\nrrefl grefl brefl\nA10 A11 A12 A13\n\nYou just add a couple of arguments to the string arg count, and tack\nthem on the end.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Angular selectivity of blinds", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Feb 16 07:22:33 2005"}
