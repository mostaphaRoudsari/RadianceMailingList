The only way I could figure out to\ndo this without writing a very nasty pcomb script is a hack involving\nvwrays and glow sources in rpict.  For a 1024x768 image, it would go\nsomething like this:\n\n% echo void glow sglow 0 0 4 100 0 0 0 > sources.rad\n% vwrays -i orig.pic < image.pts | rcalc -o 'sglow source s${recno} 0 0\n4 ${$4} ${$5} ${$6} 2' >> sources.rad\n% oconv sources.rad | rpict -vf orig.pic -w -x 1024 -y 768 \\\n| pcompos orig.pic 0 0 -t 1 - 0 0 > spotty.pic\n% rm sources.rad\n\nThe file \"orig.pic\" is your original rendering, and \"image.pts\" is a\nset of x and y picture coordinates (x left to right, y bottom to top)\ngiving positions in this image where you want to place red spots.\n(Change the echo command if you want a different color.)  The vwrays\nthen generates rays to each point in the image, which get converted to\n2-degree distant sources by the rcalc command.  (Again, you may wish to\nalter this if 2 is too big or too small.)  Finally, we render these\nsources and superimpose them on the original picture using rpict and\npcompos (with a threshold), resulting in \"spotty.pic\".\n\nI haven't tried this, and I probably messed up some bit of it, but\nhopefully you'll be able to sort it out.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Plotting specific points", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Feb 16 18:05:54 2005"}
