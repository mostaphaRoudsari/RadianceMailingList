Grobe:\n\nThanks very much for your reply. :-)\nI am just starting to use Radiance. I used the Desktop Radiance 2.0 bata to\ngenerate those rendering images, they are just for testing. I am not sure\nabout the values of aa, ar, ab, ad, (I think I was using the default setting\nin the Desktop Radiance.) but I got this kind of results randomly.\nSo I wonder if there are some guidelines which I can follow to get rid of\nthis problem, or is it just based on experance?\nBy the way, those 2 pictures looks different mainly because I changed the\nview type from Hemispherical to Perspective.\nBest wishes.\n\nHuang\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050218/6d51b25c/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Huang Weixin", "datetime": "Fri Feb 18 03:32:51 2005"}
