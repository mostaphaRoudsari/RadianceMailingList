{"body": "\nDear Axel,\n\nThere's a wealth of info in there.  Will try them out.  Thanks a bunch!\n\nBest regards,\nJun\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Thursday, August 18, 2011 4:22 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nDear Jun,\n\n\nYou will find a section titled 'Running Radiance on Windows' in my\n'Running LEARNIX' document which you can access here:\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/docs.shtml\n\nThe instructions walk you through compiling Radiance under Windows in\na Cygwin enivironment, and also detail how to get the Xserver running.\n\nAn alternative would be to run LINUX in a virtual machine such as\nVirtualBox. This will allow you to use rpiece (or, more conveniently,\nrpictmt which is a wrapper around rpiece) to utilise all processor\ncores for parallel rendering. I'm doing this every day because my\nmachine at work has Windows on it. It works rather nicely. This\napproach is also explained in the same document.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Unix emulator", "sender": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<003a01cc622a$be300bb0$3a902310$@com>", "refs": ["<CA+dqh62966jxnbTp0USVUD6BvshMOk8ZUw2G6t+i15C6Ua1UUQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 24 Aug 2011 14:55:00 +0800", "email": "Axel Jacobs", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Unix emulator"}
