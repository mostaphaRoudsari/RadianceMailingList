{"body": "\nHi group,\n\nJust curious if anyone has tried this before.\n\nI need to make a diagram showing where direct sunlight hits the floor\nin a room with an odd skylight.  I have a basic idea just from using a\nsolar chart, but I would like to accurately illustrate every possible\nsun patch location.\n\nMy thought was to make a loop where I render all possible sun positions\nfor half the year (renderings with sun only, no sky, and with -av 0 0 0\n-ab 0) and add all the images together as I go.  The resulting image\nwould show where the sunlight is falling for the entire year.  Depending\non how fine I make my sky changes, this might result in quite a few\ncalculations.
