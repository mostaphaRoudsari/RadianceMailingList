One thing that you may want to do is actually give your ambient\nvalue a little boost, so that the other surfaces are slightly\nilluminated.  Otherwise, it's tough to tell what you're looking at. The\ndirect sun patch against an all-black background could be tough to place\nin context, depending on what is illuminated by the sun. John M. shared\na tip at last year's workshop too, he used a green-tinted ambient value\n(-av 0 .5 0) so that it's clear what illumination is \"fake\" and what is\ndirect sun.  Giving your model a little \"ambient glow\" with -av will\nmake for a clearer rendering, I think.\n\nI've never merged images together like that and would be interested to\nhear how you go about it, and what issues there are to consider, such as\nexposure & filtering.  I'd love to see what you come up with.  This\ncould be a useful tool.\n\nP.S.\nSince you're doing -ab 0, the number of calculations shouldn't be a\ncause for alarm, the direct calculation is really fast.\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Solar Footprint", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4180FE52.8080206@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<s180b0a0.072@wmtao.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Oct 28 16:12:34 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Solar Footprint"}
