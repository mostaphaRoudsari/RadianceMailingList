{"body": "\nHi dhaRam!\n\nIn old times, we used .pic (picture) as a file extension in Radiance.\nThis however caused some confusion, as there are a lot of differen\nformats using the same extension. So some years ago, folks started to\nname Radiance \"image\" data files .hdr (high dynamic range). This is also\nofficially registred as a mime-type now, and in general is preferred.\nHowever Radiance does not really care about the name of your files.\n\nSo if your vht-projected image is in file fish.pic and you want to keep\nthe old naming, just adopt the command line accordingly.\n\n\nwill thus become\n\npinterp -vf fish.pic -vth -ff fish.pic 1 > hemi.pic\n\nBUT: If you have a closer look at Greg's mail, you will find that you do\nsomething quite different, and I do not really know why. Why do you use\nother parameters then Greg proposed?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare analysis", "sender": "Lars O.
