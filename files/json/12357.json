{"body": "\nHi Dharam,\n\nI guess you would be able to implement a reprojection for the images,\neither using Radiance's tools or any other software. You could e.g.\nstart with vwrays -vta (...), which would give you for each pixel of\nyour required -vta-projection the corresponding vectors. Using rcalc,\nyou could calculate backwards at which pixel-coordinates in a\nvth-projected image of given dimensions the pixel-value for this\ndirection is found. The problem is that there will be some interpolation\nneeded in the process. I am not sure whether this will be faster then\nre-rendering the images. Did you keep all the files for the renderings,\nespecially the ambient data? Depending on how you did the renderings,\ndoing a second run with only changed view-parameters, but existing\nambient cache data could be very quick.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare analysis", "sender": "Lars O.
