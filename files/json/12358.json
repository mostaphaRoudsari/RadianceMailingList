{"body": "\nhello folks.\n\ni have files (fish eye rendered images) of my project. im doing glare\nanalysis using Evalglare program and following the tutorial by Shelby Doyle\nand Christoph Reinhart in a step by step manner.\n\nthe mistake what i have done is:  i have rendered all the images in\nhemispherical view (vth) and the evalglare program takes only vta i.e\nangular.\n\nit took long to render those images around 150 files. this means i have to\nrender everyhting again by changing the the view type to angular and render.\n\nmy doubt is is there any other method where i can get the glare analysis\ndone with the hemispehrical view itself which is also 180degree fish eye.\nthis will save my time.\n\nthanks alot.\nwill be really helpful if i get the solution\n\nthanks\nregards\ndhaRam\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110829/df458f0b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "dharam", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAL121Wyk_b0N4KXAKJOrXAQvqs7+okApB8KgDgO+LQ4kXS-EEA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 19:06:47 +0530", "email": "dharmesh.124 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glare analysis"}
