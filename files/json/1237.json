{"body": "\nI gave it a little more thought, and I'm note sure how useful it would\nbe to have a BRTDfunc that approximates the aggregate behavior of\nvenetian blinds.  The only context where this might prove useful is in\nperforming daylight analyses where you don't care about external\nreflections and the users doesn't care to visualize the space.  Because\na BRTDfunc doesn't include the directional-diffuse portion in its\nindirect component, it wouldn't get an accurate contribution from light\nreflected off external surfaces.  The best it could do is get a\nreasonable value for the indirect solar due to light hitting the blinds\ndirectly.  Mathematically, even this would be difficult -- I'm guessing\nit would take me a day or two  to work up a reasonable approximation.\nAs far as the appearance goes, one would see a semi-translucent\nmaterial if one was to visualize your model with this material, which\nwouldn't end up looking like blinds at all.\n\nIn summary, I don't think this would be much of an improvement over a\nmkillum solution.  Does anyone else have some thoughts on this?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<98CB712E-295A-11D9-A977-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 29 05:29:41 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Approximating the gross daylight flux throughvenetian blinds."}
