{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI just have been able to see the last minutes of the presentation on\nrelevant optical measurements by Jacob. Anyways, even from the schedule,\nit is really nice to see a coherent terminology finally - no more\nBTDF/BRDF/BRTDF (or all of these without F), just BSDF everywhere.\nSomehow I do not like the F (as the abbrevation is usually not used to\ndescribe a function but discrete data, as Jacob just demonstrated when\ntalking about measurements), but it is still less confusing like that.\nMaybe the Radiance community will be the first having such a stringent\nterminology :-) I am excited to see the coming presentations...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
