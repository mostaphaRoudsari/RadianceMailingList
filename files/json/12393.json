{"body": "\nThanks Lars!\n\nI was stuck at a step during installation of Cygwin and MinGW and was looking for other options.

That means it can be used\nto display GUI-windows, most probably also those by Radiance. However,\nyou still need to provide a rudimentary unix environment, unless you run\nthe Radiance binary on a remote system and use the Xserver only for the\nGui (e.g. by tunnelling the X-protocol through a X-session. That works\nfine with Radiance as any X-based program.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Unix emulator", "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1255769799-1313670042-cardhu_decombobulator_blackberry.rim.net-1044539926-@b28.c4.bise3.blackberry>", "refs": ["<1812543795-1313556108-cardhu_decombobulator_blackberry.rim.net-1091195410-@b28.c4.bise3.blackberry><4E4B65DD.5030600@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 17 Aug 2011 08:55:25", "email": "\"Lars O.
