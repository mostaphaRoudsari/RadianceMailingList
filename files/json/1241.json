{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nThere have been previous post about how to obtain accurate (or as accurate\nas can be expected) material decriptions for image maps used within scene.\nThe general approach seems to be to scan the material, calibrate it using a\nmacbethcal.cal calibration file, normalize it with normpat and later apply a\nmaterial with desired reflectances. My question is what would be a valid\napproach for materials not scanned and calibrated? Many of the image maps\nthat I use I obtain from various sources (i.ow. the internet) such that I\ncan not get the exact reflectance of the material used for my image maps.\nThis would generally apply to the floor materials that I use. What I have\nbeen doing has been a similar approach that I have used with Lightscape.\nWhat I do is take the image apply it to a material and set the RGB\nreflectance to a range similar to the recommended reflectance range that is\nused in Lightscape. I question the validity of this approach.  I know that I\nam in the minority in this group due to the fact that I wish to obtain a\nvisually pleasing image while at the same providing accuracy when it regards\nthe lighting distribution throughout the building. Any help would be\nappreciated.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY101-F12G7Z2JQHeF000189c9@hotmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 29 20:00:07 2004", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reflectance of Image Map Based Materials"}
