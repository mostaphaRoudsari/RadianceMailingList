{"body": "\nStill will have some available for the Workshop...so far.  Get your pre-orders in if you want to make sure to get one!\n\nRandolph\n\nAt long last this most necessary reference returns!  We plan to have paper copies ready for the Radiance Workshop.  A downloadable PDF version will follow in six months.\n\nPaper copies are priced at US$35 + shipping.  The PDF version will be available in six months for no charge.\n\nThe books will be a black-and-white softcover for study, marking, tabbing, and use while your screen is covered with your beautiful renderings.  It has a professionally-printed color cover, costs no more than a pile of pages in a binder, and is infinitely more convenient. The color plates from the original will be available online.\n\nI am taking pre-orders via PayPal to randolph at panix.com.  (You can use a credit card, or send me a PO.)  I'm going to have stock at the Workshop, but only a limited number of copies--I may sell out.  If you want to make sure you get one there, pre-order.  I will not charge shipping if you buy one from me at the Workshop.\n\nWe will be setting up a web page for orders.\n\nAfter the Workshop, I will ship individual books for $6 (media mail) to anywhere in the continental USA.  For quantity orders, or shipping outside the USA, e-mail me at randolph+RwR at panix.com.\n\nRandolph M. Fritz\nrandolph at panix.com\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Randolph M.
