{"body": "\nHi, all,\n\nBTW, there's only a \"reinhard.cal\" file in C:\\Radiance\\lib rather than the\n\"reinhart.cal\" file as mentioned in Axel's tutorial.\n\nAre they the same?\n\nThe \"reinhard.cal\" file is \"Erik Reinhard's simple global tone-operator\"\naccording to the header of the file.\n\nIs the \"reinhart.cal\" file as mentioned by Axel's a different .cal file that\nwas created by Christoph Reinhart in Harvard? If it is, may I know where can\nwe find this file?\n\n- Thanks! Ji.\n\n\nOn Sat, Aug 6, 2011 at 12:59 PM, Jia Hu <hujia06 at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110806/bd83c7e5/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] [help] tregenza.cal missing in Mac", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD83LVJ3hdBKrNXzA_+fyJtT=8zXNmU+Bz-Knu51abGhNEnGLw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD83LVLibtb1MzTsuNwnbxE0HHvCVJ1DztFJNpO9n99VGJ3gCw@mail.gmail.com>", "<CABzgtwp=Ei7SXR2a4Kso0jdoyTUJ78HC4doNvV3-5Cd52fEyDQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 6 Aug 2011 13:32:06 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] [help] tregenza.cal missing in Mac"}
