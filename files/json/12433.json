{"body": "\nDear list,\n\nI recently discovered another Blender/Radiance project named HIDE\n(High Dynamic Range Imaging in Design Education).\n\nhttp://artsresearch.brighton.ac.uk/research/centre/office-for-spatial-research/projects/hide\n\nThe idea behind HIDE is to use HDR environmental maps to illuminate\nCGI scenes. HDR panos are generated with Hugin, and Blender is chosen\nfor the modelling and rendering. To facilitate HDR rendering in\nBlender, they devoloped the LiVi plug-in for Blender, which does work\nwith the latest version of Blender.\n\nThe project is well documented, and there are even some video\ntutorials on their site that demonstated how HDR panos are created,\nand how the LiVi Radiance rendering works.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+dqh63A5X7ZzniYJgemL7ij3MA+RkQgGvAaGcwyDgnTaVt6mg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 2 Aug 2011 10:20:04 +0100", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HIDE: Another Blender/Radiance project"}
