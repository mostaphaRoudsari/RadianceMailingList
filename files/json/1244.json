{"body": "\nHi Christoph,\n\nYou can use mkillum or any other aspect of Radiance for an annual\nilluminance profile by creating a cumulative sky model from weather\ndata.  Using mkillum, you would pick up the appropriate external\nreflections as well, which a BRTDfunc could not do.  If you want to\nbreak down the profile over time, then you need to create a\ntime-stepped calculation, possibly using an acceleration scheme such as\nthe one you devised or those of John Mardaljevic or Raphael Compagnon.\nIn such cases, I can see where a BRTDfunc modeling blinds might be a\nreal time-saver, since it will avoid a lot of the sampling variance\ncaused by detailed blind geometry.  It still wouldn't pick up those\nexternal reflections, though.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC32870F436D68@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<58549A04-29DA-11D9-9C82-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC32870F436D68@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>"], "datetime": "Fri Oct 29 20:44:09 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Approximating the gross daylight flux thro ughvenetian blinds."}
