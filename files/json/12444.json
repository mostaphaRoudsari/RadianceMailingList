{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nthe -n option for multiple-core usage as it is implemented into rtrace\nis not working for rtrace_dc. In the (still unofficial) version of\nrtrace_dc of daysim 3.1, the -n  is supported but unfortunately does not\nhave any impact on the calculation speed... :-( . I've tested that\nalready. So with the current version it doesn't make sense to use this\noption and block the other cores.\nMaybe a later version supports this option.\n\nChristoph: An ambient file is not necessary for -n.\n\nBy the way, does anybody know, if there is a limit for the -n option in\nrtrace?\nI tested it on my new 48(!!) core machine, but couldn't use more than 9\ncores, the other processes are existent  but don't use any cpu-time....\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nAm 01.09.2011 21:08, schrieb Mostapha Sadeghipour:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110901/1e3a7051/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAAd_PgTngSaxGPFOm=2og9acNnLPaW+CDKMbQVzWw8jq2zrYKQ@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Jan Wienold", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4E5FDAD1.1020503@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "refs": ["<CAAd_PgTngSaxGPFOm=2og9acNnLPaW+CDKMbQVzWw8jq2zrYKQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 01 Sep 2011 21:19:45 +0200", "email": "jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Executing gen_dc,gen_directsunlight on multiple processors"}
