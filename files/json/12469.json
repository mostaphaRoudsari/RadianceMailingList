{"body": "\nHi All:\n\nI have a grad student who has been working on running Radiance and 3DS Max alongside each other through these test cases - as step one in his understanding of matching real to simulated data. Apart from re-identifying the erroneous data in one of the datasets, and the extreme render settings for convergence for another case, he has identified two reports of work (with Radiance) like this. Anyone know:\n\na)      How we might get access to the full data\n\nb)      How we might contact these folks?\n\nhttp://www.diamond-congress.hu/cie2009/03menu/binx/22_Raphael_Labayrade.pdf\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop7/Content/Geisler-Moroder/RW2008_DGM_AD.pdf\n\nAs Jake notes: \"The second looks particularly interesting however I can't find the full set of test cases...\"\nM\n\n[cid:image001.png at 01CC7DC4.16017CC0]<http://www.victoria.ac.nz/architecture/staff/michael-donn.aspx>\n\nQuality Assurance makes simulation believable\n\n\nMichael Donn\n\nVictoria University of Wellington School of Architecture\nPO Box 600\n139 Vivian St\nWellington\nNew Zealand\n\nmichael.donn at vuw.ac.nz<mailto:michael.donn at vuw.ac.nz>\n\ntel:\nfax:\nmobile:\nSkype ID:\n\n+64 4 463 6221\n+64 4 463 6204\n+64 21 611 280\nthe_donn\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to always have my latest info?<https://www.plaxo.com/add_me?u=51541671447&src=client_sig_212_1_banner_join&invite=1&lang=en>\n\nWant a signature like this?<http://www.plaxo.com/signature?src=client_sig_212_1_banner_sig&lang=en>\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110927/383b03d8/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 814 bytes\nDesc: image001.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110927/383b03d8/attachment.png>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Michael Donn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<2DBE56A76E46FB4EB2AEEC29FCBD077828C841EB@STAWINCOX10MBX3.staff.vuw.ac.nz>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 27 Sep 2011 20:50:11 +0000", "email": "Michael.Donn at vuw.ac.nz", "subject": "[Radiance-general] CIE 171: 2006 'Validation' Dataset"}
