Currently our office uses Vectorworks  (we are a MAC based office), and we would like to convert 3D models to use for daylighting studies with Radiance software. I am unsure how to convert to a file that Radiance can use. Are you aware of how I can explore the file? Have others ran into this issue before? I have heard people have used sketchup models to be used with Radiance.\n\nAny information you could provide me with would be VERY VERY helpful.\n\nRachelle Lemieux\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110902/1394e043/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "rachelle at prairiearchitects.ca", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B564F6CD0114A44E816C0D68AE8C6E690D620E5E@MKEXCHVS2.Mail.Fiserv.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 2 Sep 2011 14:47:25 -0500", "email": "Rachelle Lemieux", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Converting files"}
