(Technically, the -dt 0 is\nnot really necessary, as it uses a mostly deterministic algorithm, but\nI put it in there to be on the safe side.)  Next, you need to eliminate\nsources of noise in your scene.  This means sticking to simple\nmaterials like plastic, metal, glass, and light, and avoiding patterns\nand textures with random or complex behaviors.  Certain ones will be\nOK, but explaining which and why would take too much space, so it's\nbest to ask when you need one.\n\nThat should get you started well enough.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] .pic precisi", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
