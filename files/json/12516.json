{"body": "\nHi Lars and Chris,\n\nThank you all for constructive discussions.\n\nI should've pointed out earlier that I'm only a novice user in Radiance.\n\n@Lars: do you mean like this? rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.33+$2*0.33+$3*0.33)' or\nrcalc -e '$1=0.4*($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)' ? the factor of 0.4 comes\nfrom dividing the wavelength spectrum of UVR (120-400nm) to PAR\n(400-700nm)...\n\n@Chris: do you mean I should scale my source and material definition by 4?\n\nMy apology if I didn't grasp your points clearly.\n\nThanks once again for your time and attention.\n\nKind Regards,\nRobert\n\n\nOn 21/10/11 16:49, Lars O.
