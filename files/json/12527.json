{"body": "\nHi Ery,\n\nThe most recent NFRC certified version of Window 6 has an bug that prevents the program from writing an xml file.  Make sure you're using the latest version (not NFRC certified) available here:http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/6/index.html .  Getting NFRC certification is a lengthy process.  So it'll be a while before the bug fix makes its way back to the NFRC certified version.\n\nThe latest version has a checkbox to \"write xml BSDF output\" in the preferences-> optical calcs dialogue, make sure it is checked.\n\nAlso, if you're running Windows 7 the file locations are awkward, the CSV file and XML file are sometimes written to different locations.  for me the XML file can be found here:\nC:\\Users\\Andy McNeil\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files (x86)\\LBNL\\WINDOW6\n\nAlso there is a bug that causes the filename of the xml file to be wrong if you've changed the name of the glazing system in Window or if you created it by copying another record.  I typically sort the directory by modification time and the most recent xml file written is the one I want.  You can verify by opening the xml file in a text editor and looking at the <name> tag on or near line 7.\n\nI hope something in this email solves your problem.   If nothing helps, let me know and well figure out what's happening online.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Oct 27, 2011, at 6:58 AM, Ery Djunaedy wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] xml file from window6", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A91756AD-93DC-4B15-A8F5-A4064657272C@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<4EA96393.6010102@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 27 Oct 2011 09:23:12 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] xml file from window6"}
