I'm thinking of porting the basics of radiance to an FPGA with\na view to (near-)realtime rendering from AutoCAD or similar. I'm\ncurrently evaluating previous work in this area, and so far it appears\nthat the most difficult bit of the problem would be the hardware\nimplementation of complex functions for procedural textures and surface\nmodels - in particular the generic lookup tables for images / function\ndata. Other than that it's just a lot of legwork... am I missing something?\n\nHas anyone tried this in the past? Perhaps a different type of hardware\nacceleration? Please let me know if you've got any success / horror\nstories! :)\n\nmike\n\nps: Another major problem for point + shoot rendering from 3D modeling\nprograms is ensuring oconv has a bounded finishing time for any given\nmodel. Most models I work with in AutoCAD or Lightwave (exporter coming\nReal Soon!) need extensive conversion work before oconv will run to\ncompletion. (Most often it simply runs continuously until it dies\nbecause it uses up all available memory. >4GB! ) Are other people having\nsimilar problems?\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Hardware accelerated radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Michael Kruger", "datetime": "Mon Feb 28 12:26:14 2005"}
