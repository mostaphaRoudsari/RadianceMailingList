{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\nworking with rtcontrib, I have problems to use more than one core. While\nthe main rtcontrib process\nworks at 100% CPU load, the rtrace processes only work at 5% CPU load.\nThe reason may be connected with the -x option of rtrace that I don't\nunderstand. This is the rtrace process automatically generated by\nrtcontrib:\n\nrtrace -dj .9 -dr 3 -ab 1 -ad 350 -ab 3 -ad 1024 -lw .0003 -ld- -ti\nsky_glow -w -h- -x 1 -y 0 -dt 0 -as 0 -aa 0 -o~~TmWdp -PP pfg5s274 -fff\nground.oct\nAs can be seen, the -x option is set 1 while the -y option is set 0.\n\nReading the man page of rtrace concerning the -n option, it reads:\n\"There is no benefit from specifying more processes than there are cores\navailable on the system or the -x setting, which forces a wait at each\nflush.\"\n\nHowever, I don't understand what that means or what the -x and -y options\nof rtrace do exactly.\nHow can I reach 100% CPU load also for the rtrace subprocesses?\n\nThanks for your help.\nWendelin Sprenger\n\n___________________________________\nMag.rer.nat.
