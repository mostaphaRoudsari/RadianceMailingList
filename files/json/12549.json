{"body": "\nI cannot identify any significant professional meeting/conference conflicts with these dates. I am personally unable to attend 20-24, but the 27-31 is most viable.\n\n-Rob Shakespeare\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Monday, October 10, 2011 3:22 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nNicolas Roy of Velux and his friends at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art, School of Architecture have offered to host the 11th Radiance Workshop next year in Copenhagen.  The proposed dates fall into two August possibilities:\n\na)  August 20-24\nb)  August 27-31\n\nAs usual, we appreciate any input as to conflicts or synergy these dates may have with other conferences distant or nearby.  Please respond to the list so we can have a discussion.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 2012 workshop", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2A1FD18147050B498AC9724AD18ADB3D28FBB8B1@IU-MSSG-MBX104.ads.iu.edu>", "refs": ["<84D4F9C7-FA67-45DB-8195-2D94D777A084@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 19:36:28 +0000", "email": "Gregory J.
