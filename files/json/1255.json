{"body": "\nHi,\n\nhas anyone tried the replmarks tool with newer releases (>3.5) of radiance?\nI have 3.6 and a head-release about four weeks old on OS X. I get 'bad\ninstance \"my_instance\"' type errors I never saw before and now I am\nwondering if there have been changes in radiance or if it is my system that\ncauses these errors?\n\nI use instances a lot, has anyone tried xform, replmarks and the other tools\non scenes with lots of instances in current releases? Have there been any\nchanges applied to the code in these areas?\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars Grobe", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1604.1099257891@www30.gmx.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Oct 31 22:25:07 2004", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] replmarks in 3.6"}
