{"body": "\nHi,\n\nWondering if anyone else is using Satel-light data with gendaylit. I seem to only be able to get direct horizontal irradiance (Ees, according to the glossary) rather than direct normal irradiance (Eesn) from the Satel-light database.\n\nCan I just divide the direct horizontal irradiance by cos(altitude) to get the direct normal irradiance? Is that valid?\n\nJohn Ford.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Ford", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C848F961-1F91-4619-89EC-C47327E5E3B5@bb3.net.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 6 Nov 2011 09:40:17 +1100", "email": "johnford at bb3.net.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Satel-light data into gendaylit"}
