{"body": "\nThanks for answers,\n\nAfter detailed analysis of lamellas' SKetchUp geometry, I decided to\nsimplify it a little bit - so I replaced curved parts with really small\nradius with 2 polygons.\nWhen exported number of surfaces per lamella is much smaller, and I still\nget correct reflectances and overall blind transmittance, so I think this\nsimplified lamella geometry will work.\n\nSince I need in building lots of blinds, so I'll surely use instances and\nxform to put it all in building.\n\nCU,\nMarija.\n\nOn Wed, Nov 9, 2011 at 4:11 PM, Lars O.
