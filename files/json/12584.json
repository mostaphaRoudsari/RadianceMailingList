{"body": "\nHi Rob:\n\nI try your programs under Win 7.I downloaded the Window version of Radiance\n4.0 from OpenStudio NREL website. Some programs written in perl such as\ngenskyvec are not included in the Radiance bin folder. I am\nnot familiar with Perl and Ruby.If I want to run it under Window OS, where\ncan I get these missing bin file?  or how can I compile the Radiance source\nfiles (4.0 or 4.1) under Windows OS?   I searched and found some related\nposts, but still do not know how to do it.\n\nThank you,\n\nJia\n\n\nOn Tue, Nov 8, 2011 at 3:47 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\nRobert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111117/209f333e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] OpenStudio-Radiance Demo Videos", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwq8Ws+LZ_PKZ52Fz=UUQiVD9cPzwwWyKL-B3vGLupg4vw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CADEE38C.AEC7%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Thu, 17 Nov 2011 00:03:05 -0500", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OpenStudio-Radiance Demo Videos"}
