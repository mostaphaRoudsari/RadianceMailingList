{"body": "\nHello Jia,\n\nGood question.  The \"i\" does derive from \"illuminance,\" but can be used for luminance values or pretty much anything derived from a lighting calculation, including something like \"sensor voltage\" for an lighting control system.  The \"V\" matrix includes the factor of pi (if necessary) and all other factors in the calculation of \"i\".  Thus, the equation need not change depending on the values you choose to compute.\n\nI hope that's clear enough.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] multiply pi to calculate illuminance?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F75AED02-7655-45DD-984E-5D076EAD1825@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CABzgtwpCy0uMkWmpsi7cPcOz1RCpe=GMcs3O7JDATD1nYth3kw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:30:12 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] multiply pi to calculate illuminance?"}
