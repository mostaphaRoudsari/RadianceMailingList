{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nInteresting question. Generally, one can assume outdoor spaces are well-daylit unless they are located in Seattle or London. =)\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by starting from the adjacent buildings and working backward? Defining a metric would be based on a totally different set of illumination criteria, glare tolerance, etc. It's an interesting question! What is your request based on, personal curiosity, or some new code/standard?\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\nOn 11/28/11 2:59 PM, \"Mostapha Sadeghipour\" <sadeghipour at gmail.com<mailto:sadeghipour at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nHi all,\n\nI wonder if anybody is aware of a daylighting metric for outdoor spaces. Do we have any scale for that or all the studies target the interior spaces so far.\n\nOne way came to my mind is to start from the adjacent buildings and then calculate backward. Is there a better way to do that?\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylighting metric for outdoor spaces", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF95348.BDD2%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 28 Nov 2011 15:07:39 -0700", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylighting metric for outdoor spaces"}
