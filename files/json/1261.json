What I should write over there? Is anywhere that I can find a simple and complete example for illuminating scenes constist from more complex models?\nShould I let 1+ and two zeros just as there are?\n\n\n..Beside the help I need for the above, I would like to read \"Real Pixels\" Graphics Gem II. I' ve ty to find it in the web but waht I found are only many references about this paper. Can I found it anywhere online?\n\nThank you  a lot,\nRegards,\nDespina\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050302/e1a440b8/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Despina Michael", "datetime": "Wed Mar  2 13:33:49 2005"}
