{"body": "\nHi Andy,\n\nThank you for clarification and explanation. It was so informative.\n\nI agree that using hours of sunshine (sunlight hours) in this way totally\nmake sense however in the code I mentioned it was a metric for building\nenvelopes (e.g. two hours of sunlight hours in 21st December is needed for\nresidential buildings).\n\nAs you said the weakness of metrics like VSC or Daylight Factor\n(SC+ERC+IRC) is not being climate-based and orientation sensitive but maybe\nthis is the best possible way for now.\n\nThanks,\nMostapha\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 30, 2011 at 12:18 PM, Andy McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111130/b266acc8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylighting metric for outdoor spaces", "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAd_PgQhKsZ03xVk9ET+vJ3QFzCFn1JWE4=1uK+hD4LC6hxYLQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<92FF15F8-64E4-4F4A-A5CB-A15598FE6963@dmu.ac.uk>", "<CAAd_PgQ6Cz8jQR-C=Ggjo=RGOh=xKFPop6UEoZr=5SLPVBGcwg@mail.gmail.com>", "<1C4D1763-AA73-4FEC-B985-4309B0C6407B@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 19:27:27 -0600", "email": "sadeghipour at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylighting metric for outdoor spaces"}
