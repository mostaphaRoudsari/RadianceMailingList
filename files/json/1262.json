What I should write over there? Is anywhere that I\ncan find a simple and complete example for illuminating scenes constist from\nmore complex models?\n\nShould I let 1+ and two zeros just as there are?\n\n\n\n\n\n...Beside the help I need for the above, I would like to read \"Real Pixels\"\nGraphics Gem II. I' ve ty to find it in the web but waht I found are only\nmany references about this paper. Can I found it anywhere online?\n\n\n\nThank you  a lot,\n\nRegards,\n\nDespina\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050302/57471f67/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Mar  2 14:23:17 2005"}
