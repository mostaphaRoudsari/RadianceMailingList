{"body": "\n\nHi Tim,\n\n40mm probably means hollow, not solid panels. The internal structure\nwould lead to transmission and reflection distributions which, depending\non your application, are probably not sufficiently described by trans\n(which allows only one transmissive and one reflective peak), prism or\nprism2. It would also be a good idea to know about the actual\nperformance of these panels, which requires measurements (Peter is\nrunning one of those labs able to do such measurements, others are at\nLBNL and SERIS). The topic BSDF has been discussed in detail on the\nrecent Radiance workshops, with the presentations available on the\nRadiance websites. Peter already replied to your initial message, and he\nis probably one of the most experienced when it comes to the\ncharacterization of the transmissive characteristics of such panels.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 4438 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Kryptografische Unterschrift\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111109/b776af9a/attachment.bin>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Polycarbonite Radiance files", "sender": "Lars O.
