{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm trying to model one complex blinds' lamelas in Radiance.\nI have lamela model in SketchUp but when exported to Radiance it gives 70\nsurfaces per one lamela - which is too much for simulations.\n\nSo I have an idea to try to model surface with gensurf, but no idea how\nexactly.\n\nSince I have SketchUP export I can extract data about sruface points so it\nis some array of (x,y,z) coordinates:\n(x1, y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2)...(xn,yn,zn).\nPoints in x and z aren't equidistant, while y={0,1}.\n\nProblem is how to use these values in gensurf.\nI want to have surface composed of multiple surfaces in x direction and 1\nsurface in y direction (length of a lamela)\n\nI suppose appropriate command format would be:\n*gensurf mat name dfile dfile dfile m n *\n\nWhat is the format of dat files I need here? I tried to understand\nsomething from manpage but no sucess.\n\nIs this the right way to model complex blind lamela (it has few curvatures\nand w shape etc.)?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111109/a9daae87/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAZQWqggh69W5YtXXZQG4MuQQy3tV6Bavj_d_sBSYZ8VEs9Rwg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 13:38:11 +0100", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] How to generate surface with gensurf program?"}
