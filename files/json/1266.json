The basic idea is, I have this\nexternally modeled object, i convert it to obj, bring it into RADIANCE using\nobj2rad and then xform it into place. During the conversion, the object is\nmade into a mesh and I would like the mesh to render smooth.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\nOn Mar 2, 2005, at 8:22 AM, Giulio Antonutto wrote:\n\n\n\nDespina,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can convert almost any  3ds model directly into radiance:\n\n\n\n3ds2mgf name.3ds\n\n\n\nmgf2rad name.mgf > name.rad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnow simply try:\n\n\n\nobjview name.rad\n\n\n\nthe rvu window should open showing the model illuminated by 3 light sources,\n\n\n\n\nit's a quick and good check to start with.\n\n\n\nOf everything is ok, you can now create in a separate file the sky,\n\n\n\nWhen you have done you combine the two with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noconv sky.rad name.rad > name.oct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand preview them with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrvu name.oct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnow you just need to set up the view,\n\n\n\ntype v in the rvu window, select point and viewing direction...\n\n\n\ngood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS\n\n\n\nthis is quick but do not incorporates uv coordinates, only colours are\ntranslated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have textures and uv you may need to use obj2mesh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce converted the model the syntax is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid mesh example\n\n\n\n7 modelname.mesh -rx 90 -t 10 10 10\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n7 is the number of inputs on the same line,\n\n\n\n-rx 90 rotates the model by 90 degrees on the y axys\n\n\n\n-t 10 10 10 translate the model from 0 0 0 to the point 10 10 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the mesh use:\n\n\n\nobj2mesh -a materialfile objfile > meshfile\n\n\n\nAbout that there is a quick tutorial I wrote at:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file\n=index&req=viewdownload&cid=5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Despina\nMichael\n\nSent: 02 March 2005 12:33\n\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to illuminate a scene with radiance which does not only  contain\nprimitives (e.g. sphere) but some more complex models such  a 3ds model.\n\n\n\nThat is, I need to do what is described in Debevec's IBL tutorial but\ninstead to have spheres in the scene, i wolud like to have a 3ds model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I understood so far from what I have read from web, is that I need to\nconvert .3ds to .obj and then use obj2mesh radiance programm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I should use that mesh (lets sat output.rtm) in the scene (file:\nscene.rad) with this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmod mesh id\n\n1+ output.rtm [xform args]\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would like to know if this is the correct process or there is another way\nto illuminate a 3ds with radiance?\n\n\n\nWhat about [xform args]. What I should write over there? Is anywhere that I\ncan find a simple and complete example for illuminating scenes constist from\nmore complex models?\n\n\n\nShould I let 1+ and two zeros just as there are?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...Beside the help I need for the above, I would like to read \"Real Pixels\"\nGraphics Gem II. I' ve ty to find it in the web but waht I found are only\nmany references about this paper. Can I found it anywhere online?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you  a lot,\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nDespina\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\n\n\n\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050302/8a5c5140/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Mar  2 16:09:40 2005"}
