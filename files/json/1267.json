{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nIf you know roughly the reflectance of the surface you want to model,\nyou can still use normpat (or more easily \"pfilt -2 -e 2\") to create an\nimage that has its overall value set to 1.  Then, simply apply the\ndesired reflectance as a neutral value to your surface (e.g., 20%\nreflectance would be \"0.2 0.2 0.2\") and use the image map you have\ndownloaded.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reflectance of Image Map Based Materials", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<04667FD4-29D6-11D9-9C82-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<BAY101-F12G7Z2JQHeF000189c9@hotmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Oct 29 20:13:06 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reflectance of Image Map Based Materials"}
