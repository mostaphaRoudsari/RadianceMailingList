{"body": "\nTim-\n\nJack is right on, as is Greg with his comment about the roughness. In an annual simulation context, I think we're talking about grid calcs and not pretty pictures (rtrace, not rpict; a bunch of points, not a view) -- the latter being too expensive. So with some experimentation you could probably create some simplified geometry or even a pattern to approximate the effect of the trees with a lower overhead (in terms of modeling time as well as computation time).\n\nTo answer your question about a beginner's list, this radiance-general list -- in addition to the list archives -- is \"open class\", serving beginners and experts for over a decade. You will love it here.\n\n- Rob G.\n\nOn Dec 6, 2011, at 7:32 PM, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4EDED037.6010202@visarc.com>", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<43AC2F36-9F8F-421F-AB88-CD383E5FBEA3@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<1323132479.40172.YahooMailNeo@web161405.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>", "<1323135267.53341.YahooMailNeo@web161402.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>", "<823EC04B-8C34-446C-8AA2-573C4FE518BA@lmi.net>", "<1323213901.32213.YahooMailNeo@web161405.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>", "<4EDED037.6010202@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 6 Dec 2011 20:03:51 -0700", "email": "rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Trees -- Time cost of different treemodelling approaches"}
