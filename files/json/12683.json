{"body": "\nHi David,\n\nSimilar to rtrace, on which it is based, rtcontrib has no notion of what a picture is.  The output from it is consequently lacking information you would get out of rpict or rvu for example.  There is no easy fix to this, other than scripting something to post-process the output as I suppose you are doing.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111209/74629314/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] changing header in images for evalglare", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<6B18CE43-28A6-49C2-9330-CA05A59227E7@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CACxOu50vrVcG9sqqVPQt2rhHdzRZSmA-S0hdNgDE=e1FFtFPSg@mail.gmail.com>", "<4A0BBBDA-3C41-42C2-B05C-7E78FFA2D19F@lmi.net>", "<CACxOu52h-RSqj8foacTBfivCa_gibb9yqCQsM3F24rxfrvWRTw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 9 Dec 2011 16:12:20 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] changing header in images for evalglare"}
