{"body": "\n\n\nHi Randolph and Christoph,\n\nthanks for your feedback.\n\nI have the \"Rendering with Radiance\" book and also read a lot of tutorials and have a understanding of how to render with radiance, but a lot of the important stuff is fragmented within several places.\n\nI was just wondering if there were a short overview (with graphics) which describes in detail what is going in detail, but it seems like I have to digg deeper and sort the puzzle...\n\nBest regards\nJan\n\n\nThe Radiance calcuations are covered in Greg's papers on Radiance, many\nof what you can find on his web site at\n<http://anyhere.com/gward/papers.html>.  A tutorial overview is given\nin the book *Rendering with Radiance* which you can buy from, well,\nme--e-mail if you are interested.\n\nFor the specifics of the IES light source calculations the code, I\nthink, is the best reference.  Look in the ies2rad man page, ies2rad.c,\nand source.cal.\n--\nRandolph M.
