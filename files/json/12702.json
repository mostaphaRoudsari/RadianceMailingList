{"body": "\nDear Randolph,\n\nthanks for the link to your thesis. It looks like that it covers again some of the missing links for my current puzzle :)\n\nEnjoy your vacation and best regards\nJan\n\n\nHi Randolph and Christoph,\n\nthanks for your feedback.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n\nI have the \"Rendering with Radiance\" book and also read a lot of\ntutorials and have a understanding of how to render with radiance, but\na lot of the important stuff is fragmented within several places.\n\n\nI was just wondering if there were a short overview (with graphics)\nwhich describes in detail what is going in detail, but it seems like I\nhave to digg deeper and sort the puzzle...?\n\nTry my thesis at\nhttp://dmg.be.washington.edu/xmlsiteengine/browsers/static/publication222.html\n- I covered some of the ground there.  After that, the code and this\nlist is the resource.\n\nI'm going on vacation, and won't be answering questions for a week or\nso, but will do so afterwards.\n\nRandolph\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111216/62c05582/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Winter, Jan-Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<0E4B6937-EF7B-4BAC-AFFB-25390DA8CC6C@tu-berlin.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 16 Dec 2011 04:00:41 +0000", "email": "j.winter at tu-berlin.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] behind the scenes detailed manual"}
