{"body": "\nDear Radiance community, at least once a year it's time to start an\noff-topic thread on the mailing-list. I wish all of you a merry\nchristmas and a happy new year. Hopefully we will be able to add some\nreal-life again to the more or less virtual communication on the email\nlists during the Radiance Workshop in 2012. Certainly also a great and\nvaluable opportunity for the new users and list subscribers to get a\ndirect impression on activities related to lighting and lighting\nsimulations. For now, I'll switch off my computer and continue my\ncurrent glare studies on canopy-attached indoor luminaires staring at\nour christmas tree's candles. Cheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
