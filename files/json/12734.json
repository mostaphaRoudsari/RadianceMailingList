{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm currently trying to understand what's going on behind the scenes of the radiance calculations. Can someone suggest a paper or manual which describes in detail how radiance calculates luminance / illuminance values from a given light source type and IES luminous intensity distribution file in a certain scene?\n\nThanks and best regards\nJan Winter\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111214/d5b437d1/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Winter, Jan-Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4EFBDD70-DB17-432A-90C0-515022FCE5E6@tu-berlin.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 12:01:16 +0000", "email": "j.winter at tu-berlin.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] behind the scenes detailed manual"}
