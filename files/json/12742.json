{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nI want to use evalglare to evaluate glare in radiance images. I generated\nimages by three phase method, unfortunately header of those images does not\ninclude view information, which I think that evalglare looks for\nexplicitly.\nI have tried to change the image header just in text editor but it  did not\nwork and demage the image. I would like to ask how to change the header, I\nknow that it may be trivial but I did spend some time on it already and did\nnot find how to do it yet.\n\nThank you for all advices.\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111209/91292d4b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "David Appelfeld", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CACxOu50vrVcG9sqqVPQt2rhHdzRZSmA-S0hdNgDE=e1FFtFPSg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 9 Dec 2011 15:28:10 -0800", "email": "d.appelfeld at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] changing header in images for evalglare"}
