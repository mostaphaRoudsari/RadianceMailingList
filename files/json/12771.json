{"body": "\nMay seem silly, but a 10x difference seems like the difference between lux and footcandles. Maybe your site measurements are in fc, or maybe you are multiplying your Radiance results to convert to lux when they were already in lux?\n\nIf you know your illuminance and lux measurement for one point, and can estimate the surface reflectance, you can check the formula L = E * R / Pi to see if it all makes sense. If L is in cd/m2 then E must be in lux for that formula.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120112/c895ee7c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance Values in Ecotect/Radiance", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B04E452E19D2@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<001a01ccd128$d068d510$713a7f30$@net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 09:31:45 -0500", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminance Values in Ecotect/Radiance"}
