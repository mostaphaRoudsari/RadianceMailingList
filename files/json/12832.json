{"body": "\nHi Ery,\n\nPcompos isn't smart enough to adjust the view after cropping, so it doesn't write it into the header in a way that pinterp can use it.\n\nThe image may be coming out square because a hemispherical fisheye can encompass at most 180 degrees vertically and horizontally, whereas an angular fisheye can be up to 360 degrees.  You can of course specify a different horizontal and vertical size with the -vh and -vv options, but both must be less than 180.\n\nWhat is the view in your original fish.hdr file?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pinterp on a rectangle image", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<70F4A65C-47D3-48A6-A2B9-E1AF1F94971B@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4F370DAF.1090701@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 11 Feb 2012 20:48:06 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pinterp on a rectangle image"}
