{"body": "<CB63CF24.DF4C%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>\n\nJan, Rob,\n\nI don't think nested functions are any version of standard C; I'm\npretty sure they are a GNU compiler extension.  If it's possible, do\nyou think you could engineer these out?  I'd look at it, but no-way do\nI have time to work on it.\n\nit's probably best if C code compiles with the gcc \"-ansi -pedantic\"\n(c90) or \"-std=c99 -pedantic\" options.  That's not a complete check;\nsome non-ISO usages are not caught, but it's better than simply letting\nsomething completely non-standard slip through.\n\nRandolph\n\n(Do we need to take this to the developer list?)\n\nOn 2012-02-17 16:34:39 +0000, Guglielmetti, Robert said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph M.
