{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nIt's really hard to tell from a single photograph, but it looks like your reflectance is probably around 50% gray with some fraction of that specular.  Here is my guess at a trans material for the slats:\n\nvoid trans slat_mat\n0\n0\n7 .65 .65 .65 .2 .15 .29 1\n\nThe 0.15 value is my guess at the roughness.  This material will have 15% specular transmission (.65*(1-.2)*.29*1), 20% specular reflectance, and 37% diffuse reflectance (.65*(1-.2)*(1-.29)).  Unfortunately, the math of the trans type is difficult to follow, which is why most folks use a spreadsheet or refer to the Lighting chapter in RwR.\n\nIf you arrange your slats into the correct blinds geometry, you can generate a BSDF for the system using genBSDF.  I should warn you though, there is a bug in the 4.1 release of genBSDF.  I'm waiting for Rob G. to finish his Windows package before I post a patch.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120222/011e2cca/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Perforated window shading", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<915721BD-C73C-40DE-97FF-7BECC258076F@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAEzj1z6QpvgQ_ePO-8tZXUcimXwZp+xDWnMUVsMarn49jaunng@mail.gmail.com>", "<4F44C9B5.7020204@gmx.net>", "<CAEzj1z4UA+VMQi9aPTn3YPbqdZWwgjrzdK+eK=YLf=jn8_qznA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 09:37:10 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Perforated window shading"}
