{"body": "\nSomewhat off-topic, but maybe a relevant curiosity;\n\nI'm just starting to script/extend radiance using python (win32).\nI'm interested whether other people are using radiance in this way -I\nsuppose so, I'm sure Georg Mischler has extensive experience-\nIs anyone aware of python/radiance scripts available online, or could point\nme in the direction of specific python/radiance content available online\n(perhaps willing to share?). My interest is mostly automating rendering\ntasks. From that I intend to see whether it could be interesting to combine\ngenetic algorithms with radiance to automate architectural research. I have\n-modest- experience in computing this way, but initial research focused on\nGA/FEM simulation. An example of such an experiment would be to parameterize\na window, the placement of the window, or the material in the room, and to\nsearch for a solution -using a GA- where there would be a constant luminance\nin the room. In order to conduct these experiments I first need to progress\nin automating rendering tasks.\n\nCheers!\n\nJF\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041026/8a0a2201/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20041026102736.96B3118000AE@mwinf0108.wanadoo.fr>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Oct 26 12:27:40 2004", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] python / shell scripting radiance"}
