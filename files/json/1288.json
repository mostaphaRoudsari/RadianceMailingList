Most cameras can take\nabout 3 (or 5) photos with Auto Bracketing but you need more in order to\ncreate an HDR Probe (about10-15 photos)\n\nIn order to take the photos set aperture at a fix value and change only\nexposure time in order to change the overall exposure.\nYou also have to set your camera at no flash.\n\nYou should  take a sequence of photos (about 10-15) with different exposure\ntimes, changing 1 f-stop each time, starting with bigger exposure.\nBefore begin to take your photos, take one photo using auto-focus in order\ncamera focus on the mirrored ball. Then set manual-focus and don't change\nfocusing (that is in order to have all photos with same \"focus value\")\n\nIf you planning ton use hdrgen for generating HDR probe, I recommned you to\ndisable alignment algorithm. At least in my case, when alignment was enable\nhdrgen gave worst results.\n\nI hope it helps,\nRegards,\nDespina\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nTo: <Radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nSent: Wednesday, March 09, 2005 3:53 AM\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob.Fitzsimmons@Summit.Fiserv.com", "datetime": "Wed Mar  9 15:24:27 2005"}
