{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nI understand about the tmeshes... I also concur with Andy (and my second\nsuggestion) which is in line with what you are doing.  I think what\nwould be nice to figure out is if this could all be done using native\nradiance tools (eg NOT sed/awk) by including a call to rcalc. It has\nbeen too long so I just do not remember if there is a way to get rcalc\nto do any type of string comparison. If there is not this could be a\nnice feature as this would allow great flexibility processing other\nscene data. Note my desire for doing it all natively in radiance is more\nfrom elegance than anything else.\n\nAnother neat feature would be if there was a way to generate an \"alpha\"\nfile in process of the rendering, where each pixel location also\nincludes the material name. This would be sort of like the option to\ninclude z-buffer data per pixel. I suppose this starts to generate huge\nfiles though. And may only have utility for a small subset of users.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack\n\nOn 2/25/2012 5:41 AM, Iebele Abel wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120225/44b4f797/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAD_et2WuSADPX3i2HoQac8jw7WrgcZbbAw4AKUR8QhN0QbZDUQ@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4F48EEE5.3070802@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<CAD_et2V0-_7c-CJkuOmVtReznQ_HYbr1F5iZOoTFmJnTHTuhpA@mail.gmail.com>", "<4F47E8C6.3000902@visarc.com>", "<E43A469A-DD3B-46C1-A274-8CCF024DD498@yahoo.it>", "<A366C96E-16D7-49C3-A781-FB12FCF9E757@lbl.gov>", "<10A70AB5-2B76-43CE-8E35-DAA535B5D0B8@lbl.gov>", "<CAD_et2WuSADPX3i2HoQac8jw7WrgcZbbAw4AKUR8QhN0QbZDUQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 25 Feb 2012 09:23:33 -0500", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Generating alpha channels using vwrays andrtrace"}
