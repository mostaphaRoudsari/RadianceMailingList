Vignetting, coating effects, etc. are all beyond what\nRadiance was designed to simulate in it's camera model.  You could\nmodel the lens system and camera geometry in Radiance directly, I\nsuppose, but it would be a lot of work.  Calculating an image this way\nwould be quite expensive, but I think it's possible.\n\nHave you considered using a more general optics simulation package,\nsuch as TracePro?\n\nhttp://www.lambdares.com/products/tracepro/\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] integrating lens system in Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Mar  9 17:28:32 2005"}
