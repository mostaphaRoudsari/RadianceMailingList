Is it sRGB of something else? (pcond seems\nto produce sRGB as a default - am I right?). I am using the DOS/Windows\nexecutables. Is the resulting RGB gamut same for all systems?\n\nRegards, Markku\n\nAt 22:46 2002-02-09 -0800, you wrote:\n\nMarkku_Norvasuo\nTechnical_Research_Centre_of_Finland\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Color appearance and color temperatur", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Thu, 14 Feb 2002 16:51:07 +0200"}
