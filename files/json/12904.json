{"body": "\nDaysim uses a program called radfiles2daysim.exe to take out light sources out of a Radiance scene and convert all color to gray. This is necessary because Daysim conducts the daylight coefficient calculation for the rad color channel only. Historically, this was introduced because in 1999 RAM used to be a serious limitation for annual  Radiance simulations.\n\nChristoph\nPS: Gosh, I feel old writing this email :).\n\nSent: Friday, February 24, 2012 1:08 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHmm...  That sounds odd.  I just tried an similar example with a red surface in sketchup, changed the materials.rad file after exporting so the surface is yellow and when re-rendered the rendering is yellow as expected.\n\nAre you importing your model into Daysim before you make the changes?\nIt could be that Daysim creates a copy of the model somewhere else on your computer, so when you make changes you are not changing the model that Daysim is using.\n\nOr, it could be that the material you are changing is not applied to the surface you are looking at.\n\nCan you send me an off list email with the files in you objects folder and the materials.rad file?  I'll have a look to see what's going on.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Feb 24, 2012, at 9:28 AM, Thibault Charles wrote:\n\n\nHi Andy,\n\nThanks for your response. I known the material file.

You can open it in a text editor and it has the material descriptions used in the Radiance model.\n\nDescriptions of the material primitive types can be found in section 2.1.2 of this pdf: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf\nAnd documentation of the materials algorithms are contained in this pdf: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Feb 24, 2012, at 8:39 AM, Thibault Charles wrote:\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI usually work with Radiance and Daysim by contructing 3D scene with Sketchup and importing it with Su2rad.\n\nSomething stay obscure for me : I cannot find the file in which is contained the information about the colors of surfaces. When I create a scene in Sketchup, the same colors appear in the rendering but I cannot understand how...\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nThibault Charles\nSolamen\nthibault.charles at solamen.fr<mailto:thibault.charles at solamen.fr>\n+33 6 78 54 27 91\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120224/82ae5ebb/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<3178D917-48BD-4D71-8EC3-5B50FDC63FE3@lbl.gov>", "sender": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80054941@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": ["<CAAZQWqii1TMnNoBctU7NdswXo=An-sZApE2H0M6iCKyHitJwBQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<02FEEBA2-80E7-4072-B6D3-1D1BBFFC0770@lmi.net>", "<CAAZQWqgaONuJ27rQL3i2h1z-VoVy_5RCdtS1+sXpB+pVj+aTsw@mail.gmail.com>", "<4f47bdf3.a611440a.1fda.2435SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>", "<4AAB5F38-2CFA-4DC6-9747-D40C939C6B24@lbl.gov>", "<8E7F7C65-4387-45F6-B331-18569B2FE41A@solamen.fr>", "<3178D917-48BD-4D71-8EC3-5B50FDC63FE3@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 18:14:19 -0000", "email": "Andy McNeil", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Color surfaces information and link with Sketchup defined colors"}
