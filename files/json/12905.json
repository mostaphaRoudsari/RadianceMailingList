{"body": "\nDear Ery,\n\nIf you do not have a full fisheye lens you should use a vertical illuminance measurement with the HDR image and feed the measured illuminance into evalglare. As Thomas noted, the resulting contrast portion (second part of DGP equation) might be wrong depending on what happens outside of the lenses view range. I'd be happy for Jan to add his two cents as well.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 7714, f: 617 253 6152, creinhart at mit.edu<mailto:creinhart at mit.edu>\nHome<http://architecture.mit.edu/faculty/christoph-reinhart> | DIVA<http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://daysim.com/>\n\n\n\n\nSent: Monday, February 06, 2012 9:27 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nEry\n\nYou can use the pinterp program to convert from one projection to another. See the man page for an example or dig in the archives where this has been discussed before. However, note that the glare equations are based on a full hemispherical image. You will have to fill in the missing perimeter of your converted fisheye image with values of the right brightness or your glare evaluation will be off.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\nOn Mon, Feb 6, 2012 at 9:15 PM, Ery Djunaedy <ery.mailinglist at gmail.com<mailto:ery.mailinglist at gmail.com>> wrote:\nFolks,\n\nI have a bunch of HDR images generated from photographs taken with regular -- non-fisheye -- lens. Is there a way that we can use these images for glare analysis in evalglare? The evalglare description says that it only accepts fisheye images. There is a tutorial from Harvard GSD (Doyle and Reihart) that shows a non-fisheye photo in evalglare: http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/HDR_III_Evalglare.pdf\n\nI am wondering whether this can be done at all.\n\nThanks,\n\nEry\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120207/83d7b712/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] evalglare with regular lens", "sender": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80023212@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": ["<4F308933.3080109@gmail.com>", "<CAKGV-k0zpJv+aFaZh6L13ySmTe-XtvbfF0t8=qbjvajmFL=s=g@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 07 Feb 2012 02:35:04 -0000", "email": "Thomas Bleicher", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] evalglare with regular lens"}
