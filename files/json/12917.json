{"body": "\nThis seems reasonable. I assume you have access to sufficient computing\nresources. If not, read on....\n\nIf you need cheap resources recommend using Amazon's EC2 SPOT instances.\nThe SPOT instances are not guaranteed. However, they are cheap: you can get\nthe equivalent of a dual-core Intel Core 2 Duo for about 6 cents an hour\n(high-CPU medium instance). You can check the prices half way down this\npage: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/. You can buy up to 100\nvirtual machines in a region. The list of regions is constantly expanding,\nbut I used Virginia, N. California, Ireland and Tokyo simultaneously at one\npoint to run 800 parallel simulations for HMG's PIER work. The cost was\nreasonable and the machines are easy to start up and shut down.  I would\nrecommend using the \"Simple Queue Service\" to keep track of which model\nneed to be run -- it is easier to have each machine poll the queue than to\ntry and schedule jobs before hand and deal with the (potentially) disparate\nsimulation times.\n\nOut of curiosity, how many runs are you thinking of? Have you timed each\nstep?\n\nGood luck and let me know if this was helpful.\n\nSincerely,\nTim\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 27, 2012 at 12:54 PM, Randolph M.
