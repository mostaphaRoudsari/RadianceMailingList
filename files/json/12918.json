{"body": "\nOK?so we have our huge number of simulation cases for our educational project.\n\nI think I want to organize the simulations as follows:\n1. Do a mkillum calculation for the glazing that includes the site model.\n2. Use BDSF for the interior blinds in their several positions\n3. Other than that, straight Radiance simulation.\n\nDoes this seem realistic?  Or am I off the deep end somewhere?\n--\nRandolph M. Fritz\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Randolph M.
