{"body": "\nHmm...  That sounds odd.  I just tried an similar example with a red surface in sketchup, changed the materials.rad file after exporting so the surface is yellow and when re-rendered the rendering is yellow as expected.\n\nAre you importing your model into Daysim before you make the changes?\nIt could be that Daysim creates a copy of the model somewhere else on your computer, so when you make changes you are not changing the model that Daysim is using.\n\nOr, it could be that the material you are changing is not applied to the surface you are looking at.\n\nCan you send me an off list email with the files in you objects folder and the materials.rad file?  I'll have a look to see what's going on.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Feb 24, 2012, at 9:28 AM, Thibault Charles wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120224/ca0ec779/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<8E7F7C65-4387-45F6-B331-18569B2FE41A@solamen.fr>", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3178D917-48BD-4D71-8EC3-5B50FDC63FE3@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<CAAZQWqii1TMnNoBctU7NdswXo=An-sZApE2H0M6iCKyHitJwBQ@mail.gmail.com>\t<02FEEBA2-80E7-4072-B6D3-1D1BBFFC0770@lmi.net>", "<CAAZQWqgaONuJ27rQL3i2h1z-VoVy_5RCdtS1+sXpB+pVj+aTsw@mail.gmail.com>", "<4f47bdf3.a611440a.1fda.2435SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>", "<4AAB5F38-2CFA-4DC6-9747-D40C939C6B24@lbl.gov>", "<8E7F7C65-4387-45F6-B331-18569B2FE41A@solamen.fr>"], "datetime": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 10:07:30 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Color surfaces information and link withSketchup defined colors"}
