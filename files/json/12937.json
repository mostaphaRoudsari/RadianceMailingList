I known the material file. It seemed to me that informations about colors where coded by patterns in this file and I have no pattern in my files...\nI created a really simple example in which the surface is red in Sketchup and my material file is only :\nvoid plastic outSideFacade\n0\n0\n5 0.7 0.7 0.7\n\nThe result is that in the rendering, the surface appear to be red and if I change the values in the material file, it is still red.\n\nWould you have an idea ?\n\nBest,\n\nThibault Charles\nSolamen\nthibault.charles at solamen.fr<mailto:thibault.charles at solamen.fr>\n+33 6 78 54 27 91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLe 24 f?vr. 2012 ? 18:19, Andy McNeil a ?crit :\n\n\nHi Thibault,\n\nsu2rad creates a file called materials.rad.  You can open it in a text editor and it has the material descriptions used in the Radiance model.\n\nDescriptions of the material primitive types can be found in section 2.1.2 of this pdf: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf\nAnd documentation of the materials algorithms are contained in this pdf: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Feb 24, 2012, at 8:39 AM, Thibault Charles wrote:\n\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI usually work with Radiance and Daysim by contructing 3D scene with Sketchup and importing it with Su2rad.\n\nSomething stay obscure for me : I cannot find the file in which is contained the information about the colors of surfaces.
