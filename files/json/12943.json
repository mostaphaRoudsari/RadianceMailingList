{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\n\nThanks -- this is a really nice summary of what we know.  It would be great to include in a FAQ if we ever get our act together...\n\nYou are probably right that it should be set lower.  You can always set it to zero (the default) and accept that you will underestimate values slightly.  Otherwise, you can render a fisheye image just outside the window setting \"-ab 0 -dv-\" and compute the average pixel value with:\n\npvalue -h -H -o -df  fisheye.hdr | total -if3 -m\n\nThat's pretty close to what compamb does.\n\n\nIn daylighting situations, the calculation shouldn't be very sensitive to the -d* settings.  You can set -dt 0 if you're worried about it, though.\n\n\nIt's just that mkillum doesn't pay off if you are only calculating a small number of points.  The only reason to use it is to reduce the error when you cannot afford a difficult indirect calculation over a million or so pixels.  If you are only computing a few hundred illuminance values to begin with, you are better off simply cranking up the indirect calculation parameters and letting rtrace deal with the window complexity.\n\n\nThanks for your input, always appreciated.\n\n-Greg\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120222/d9c0ba7c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum usage", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<02FEEBA2-80E7-4072-B6D3-1D1BBFFC0770@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAAZQWqii1TMnNoBctU7NdswXo=An-sZApE2H0M6iCKyHitJwBQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 10:16:02 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mkillum usage"}
