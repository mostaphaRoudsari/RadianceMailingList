{"body": "\nHi Thomas, Marcus!\n\n\nI was assuming that the blinds are still modelled geometrically (e.g.\nusing genblinds or an imported mesh). The trans modifier was just\nproposed to be applied to the blinds geometry. As the (metal?) blinds\nare transmissive only due to the holes, transmission would be purely\nspecular, reflection probably both diffuse and specular.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Perforated window shading", "sender": "Lars O.
