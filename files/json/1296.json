Each RAW format is maker- and model-specific, which causes real\nproblems for long-term support and archiving -- another reason to avoid\nthis format.  RAW files also tend to be large, and their advantages for\nreduced noise and exposure latitude are widely exaggerated.  Since\nmultiple images are averaged together to make an HDR, noise tends to\nget smoothed out, anyway, and JPEG artifacts disappear as well.\n\nThat said, I encourage you to do your own experiments, but weigh the\ncost in your time using RAW against the actual benefit you get from\nthem.  I've done my own, and I've found the benefit to be negligible\nnext to the effort required.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  I should have included the Nikon 900 series in my list of\nrecommended cameras -- most people who have used them for HDR capture\nhave had good experiences from all I've heard.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Digital Camera recommendations?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Mar  9 20:24:13 2005"}
