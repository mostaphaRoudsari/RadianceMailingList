Takes a bunch of stills and makes an animated gif.\nQuick & dirty, as you please.\n\nPros: scriptable, runs on Windows and unix.\nCon: animated gifs aren't really interactive.  I tend to do animations\nof the sun, and it's nice to be able to stop the action and study\nparticular times of day, something you can't do with an animated gif, so\nthanks again for the ffmpeg reference, Jack-o.\n\nInfo: http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/gifsicle/\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate movies", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4176957B.4040409@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<1098288513.41768d81255d4@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "<41768F64.9090605@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct 20 18:42:05 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ranimate movies"}
