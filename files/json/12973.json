{"body": "\nEry\n\nWithout modification you can't use the cropped image as input to pinterp.\nYou have to add an appropriate \"view ...\" line to the header of the cropped\nimage manually to give pinterp the information it needs for the conversion.\n\nIf you are just taking away the black area to the left and right of a (180\ndegree) angular fisheye projection you can copy the view line from the\noriginal file and only adjust the \"-vh\" value to match the \"-vv\" value. If\nyou also reduce the opening angle you have to calculate how large the\ncropped angle would be and add that as the value for \"-vv\" and \"-vh\".\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Sun, Feb 12, 2012 at 9:00 AM, Ery Djunaedy <ery.mailinglist at gmail.com>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120212/bc868e2b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pinterp on a rectangle image", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k1uYfqbhf0E7AmOMaw9J=yZSteEjTwyhct-Wr_gcWZ_tw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4F370DAF.1090701@gmail.com>", "<70F4A65C-47D3-48A6-A2B9-E1AF1F94971B@lmi.net>", "<4F37C5F6.9000900@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun, 12 Feb 2012 09:26:50 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pinterp on a rectangle image"}
