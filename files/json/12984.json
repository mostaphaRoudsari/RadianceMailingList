{"body": "\nHello Radiance users,\n\nI have two questions (unrelated to each other). It would be great if you\ncan offer your insights.\n\nQ1. I am trying to use MinGW version of Radiance in Windows (XP-vpc/7).\nEverything seems to work as expected but protate command. The command\nerrors out with a \"read error\". This command seems to work fine and dumps\nout expected results when I use it from Desktop Radiance installation. Has\nanyone faced such issues with protate and is there a solution for MinGW\ninstallation? Or am I missing something?\n\nQ2. I was wondering if I can use pinterp to translate an angular\nprojection/fisheye image to a panorama. If yes, what should I watch out for\nand how can this be done? If not, why not?\n\nThanks,\nViswanathan\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120207/a3bd2f8e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Viswanathan Kumaragurubaran", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAFan9geaWfacBFN-EEhWyuQcnY2dM5WBJpfJ24uoNGV08nQ_bw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 19:13:00 -0800", "email": "viswa at uw.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] protate in MinGW Radiance and projections usingpinterp"}
