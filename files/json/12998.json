{"body": "\nHi Randoph,\n\nCould you be more specific?  The radius of a sphere whose *projected* area is 1.0 for any distant point is sqrt(1/pi) as Chas derived it.  This is in fact what ies2rad needs.  This is not the same as a sphere whose total surface area is 1.0, which is the value you derived.\n\nIs there an error in ies2rad.c, somewhere?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<jgppge$sus$1@dough.gmane.org>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<093BDD35-78D4-4D1E-A61A-6FE267609C18@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<jgppge$sus$1@dough.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Mon, 6 Feb 2012 16:12:18 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Error: Rendering with Radiance p. 319Luminaire Modeling"}
