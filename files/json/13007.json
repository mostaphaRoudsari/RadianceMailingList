{"body": "\nHi Jill,\n\nhave you checked the material definition that is exported by Ecotect? if\nI remember correctly Ecotect exports \"mirrors\" as \"plastic\" so you'll\nneed to manually edit the definition in the .rad file.\nAnd check that the normals are oriented the right way around.\nFinally curved mirror reflections necessarily have to be approximated by\na mesh in this approach, so it will never look absolutely right....\n\nHope this helps,\n\nGiovanni\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 01 February 2012 16:11\nTo: radiance-general\nHello,\n\nDoes anyone have experience with mirror surfaces and especially curved\nmirror surfaces? I am not having luck getting sunlight to bounce off of\nthem the way they should. Are there any tricks? I am using Ecotect and\nexporting to Radiance.\n\nThank you!\n\nJill Dalglish\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Curved mirror surfaces", "sender": "jill at jilldalglish.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3082F0FAB@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": ["<4F29640B.7040501@jilldalglish.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 16:24:00 -0000", "email": "Jill Dalglish", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Curved mirror surfaces"}
