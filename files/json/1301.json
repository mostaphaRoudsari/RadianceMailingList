I think I understand the\n\"trans\" type for the first time, myself!\n\nBe sure also to refer to section 5.2.6 (pp. 325-6) in \"Rendering with\nRadiance,\" which translates between more sensible physical quanitites\nand the parameters of the \"trans\" type.  I believe Rob G. has an Excel\nspreadsheet that implements these formulas nicely, if you'd like to\nrequest a copy.\n\nBy way of excuse, the reason the trans type is so baffling is my\nstubborn adherence to the principle that Radiance primitives have\nwell-defined legal ranges.  All the material parameters (except\nroughness) have legal physical ranges of [0,1).  Since Radiance does\nnot enforce these limits, you can specify values outside this range,\nbut you should know that you are on shakey ground at that point.\n\nThat said, I freely admit that the obtuse derivation of the trans\nparameters in particular has caused a good deal more consternation than\nif I had used more usual values of Rd, Td, Rs, and Ts and simply noted\nthat these coefficients must sum up to something less than 1.  Oh,\nwell.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans mat", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Mar 10 18:45:17 2005"}
