{"body": "\nHi Michael,\n\nI would argue that the NREL Building Component Library seeks to fill this need for a vetted, trackable database of energy model components, where one can track QC, provenance, ratings, etc. The BCL will store weather data, materials data, schedules, systems descriptions, and more. In much the same way that the OpenStudio model is being extended to support not only energy modeling but also daylight modeling, so too will these components contain the data required for whatever the destination simulation tool is. In the case of a luminaire, we plan to store photometric distribution, along with specs and basic energy use that EnergyPlus cares about. Likewise for windows, we plan to store window constructions for EnergyPlus but also a set of BSDFs that can be used by Radiance in a 3-phase daylight coefficient simulation. Like many projects around here, EnergyPlus is the initial focus of support, and Radiance support will be added as we have time and funding. But I would encourage you to check out what is there to get a sense of what the plan is, and I would love to hear feedback from the community as to what else is needed to make this useful to us all.\n\nI have pinged my co-workers to see if there is any more background on the BCL that I can share, because they know the project much better than I do at this point, but I do think it may fill one of the gaps that we have been discussing today.\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn Mar 6, 2012, at 6:46 PM, Michael Donn wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New Radiance Website", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F16D9818-E153-42B4-83B4-FF537A16AEEB@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<mailman.201.1331074492.98291.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<2DBE56A76E46FB4EB2AEEC29FCBD077834A211BA@STAWINCOX10MBX3.staff.vuw.ac.nz>"], "datetime": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 19:14:05 -0700", "email": "rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New Radiance Website"}
