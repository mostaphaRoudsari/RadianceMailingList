{"body": "\nAs part of a project I am comparing measured data from both Berkeley and\nthe Isle de la Reunion to simulated illuminances under the Perez sky model\nin both Radiance and 3ds Max Design, however Gendaylit seems to be\nproducing incorrect sky descriptions for the overcast days in the dataset.\nI am wondering if I am missing something critical.\n\nBelow is the command I am using to produce a sky description, for 10:30am\non a particularly overcast winter day in Berkeley, with the measured direct\nradiation being 0.15W/m^2 and the measured diffuse being 155.13 W/m^2:\n\ngendaylit 12 4 10.5 -W 0.15 155.13 -g 0.2 -a 37.88 -o -122.25 -m -120 >\nnew.sky\n\nThis produces a sky that when simulated (using rtrace, with the -I option,\nand multiplying by 179) only gives a global horizontal illuminance of\n~12lux, rather than the expected ~19,000lux.\n\nUsing the -O option with a value of 2 produces a significantly brighter sky\nproviding ~800 lux, still far from what I am expecting.\n\nHopefully someone can spot the problem straight away;\n\nCheers,\n\nJake Osborne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120321/c3f810bc/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jake Osborne", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+c+v__LW7z=WvQsG-yRAT1CtJr28=6PggDiwTpDRR0sQf-5Uw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 21 Mar 2012 21:34:25 +1300", "email": "jzsosborne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Gendaylit overcast sky underestimation issue"}
