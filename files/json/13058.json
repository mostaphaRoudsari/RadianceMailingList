{"body": "\nDear group,\n\nI'd like to be able to generate two separate images from an HDR image\nof the sky vault: one with blue sky; the other with clouds and sun\n(assuming it's not occluded).  I'm not well versed in the usage of\n'pcomb' but I'm assuming I'll need to somehow create a mask based on\nboth color and brightness thresholds.  It seems from my archive search\nthat a call to 'pgblur' with a high radius might help in defining\nsharper boundaries between clouds and blue sky. (http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005046.html\n)\n\nHas anyone been successful in achieving something similar?\n\nAs always, thanks!\n\nChris\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pcomb-masking color channels", "sender": "Humann Chris", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAE8E899-19AB-4B1A-AFD1-E59176B0D353@coolshadow.com>", "refs": ["<jkfq67$rjv$1@dough.gmane.org>", "<427773F0-7BBD-4D33-85D2-9884B7264A98@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Tue, 27 Mar 2012 15:19:15 -0700", "email": "chris at coolshadow.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pcomb-masking color channels"}
