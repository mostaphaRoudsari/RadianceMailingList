{"body": "\nHi Randolph,\n\nSeems obj2rad has an initial test to determine if a polygon has specified normals.  If it does, then it breaks it into triangles.  Once it looks at the triangles, it then sees if the normals actually require interpolation or not.  If they don't, then it doesn't specify a texture, but they still get output as triangles.\n\nIs it a problem?  Just take off the normals if it is.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2rad splitting planar surfaces?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<427773F0-7BBD-4D33-85D2-9884B7264A98@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<jkfq67$rjv$1@dough.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 12:12:49 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] obj2rad splitting planar surfaces?"}
