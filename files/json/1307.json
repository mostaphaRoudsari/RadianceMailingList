It's 4% at\nright angles. I'm with you...\n\n\nI wonder if it was possible to just measure the size of the hilight and\nderive the roughness from there, given a known light source diametre and\ndistance, e.g. sun? Well, it's not going to be have sharp edges, but one\ncould take an HDR image and a luminance profile through it that finds the\n50% intensity...\n\n\nWhat I means is almost exactly what you described above:\nTo measure the reflectance: refl = L * PI / E. Measuring the luminance and\nthe illuminance for the same spot (even illuminance assumed) gives us a\nfigure for the reflectance\nTo measure the transmittance: trans = E_behind_material /\nE_in_front_of_material, ideally taken with 2 lux meters, but under\nrelatively constant illumination and with some averaging over several\nreadings, it will work.\n\nQuestion is: how far does this improvisation get us with the trans material?\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans mat", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Mar 11 01:47:45 2005"}
