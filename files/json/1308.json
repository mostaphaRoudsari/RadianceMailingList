You could try putting a\ntube on your lux meter (or using a luminance probe) and couple with a\ncollimated source (a good quality flashlight will do in a pinch) and\nback the source and probe away from the material.  Subtracting the\nmeasured specular (direct) transmittance from the previous integrated\nmeasurement will give you the approximate diffuse value.\n\nThis is all very, very rough.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans mat", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Mar 11 04:18:56 2005"}
