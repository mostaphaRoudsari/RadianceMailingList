{"body": "\nHi Mike, I think John's equation may be an equivalent equation - but here\nis how I have gone about it using these two equations:\n\nE = L * w * cos(theta)\n\nwhere w is the solid angle of the sun and theta is the incidence angle on\nthe illuminance plane; 0 for direct normal illuminance.\n\nThen the solid angle can be determined using this:\n\nw = 2 * pi * (1 - cos (half angle) )\n\nThis uses the half angle of the solar disc cone, so roughly .25 degrees.\n\nCheers,\nZack\n\nOn Tue, Mar 6, 2012 at 3:41 PM, John Mardaljevic <jm at dmu.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n211 North Public Road, Suite 220\nLafayette, CO 80026\n(303)946-2310\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120306/92184744/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] the disk of the sun", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAP856zGaYNR9ZyAWWcsHQcpEEjYo4sEFFt52pQpym+_+1UY7g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<9965791C-9A85-4BBF-A9BC-B05D624B3E07@dmu.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 18:12:09 -0700", "email": "zrogers at daylightinginnovations.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] the disk of the sun"}
