{"body": "\nHi All -\n\nI'm working on a project in which the brightness of the disk of the sun has become a discussion topic.\n\nUsing gendaylit set for California's central valley, a view toward clear (smoggy-ish) sunny skies  at 8am on September 1 reveals a disk luminance of 987,365,074 cd/m2.\n\nThis seems perfectly reasonable, although when I find myself commenting \"oh yes, it's about a billion...\" I can't help but pause.\n\nDoes anyone know of a handy reference for disk luminance based on location and climate? Or better yet, anyone out there with greater math skills than I know how to derive disk luminance from direct normal radiation found in a weather file?\n\nThanks!\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] the disk of the sun", "sender": "Michael Martinez", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5140928E-71F8-4CF9-9C0C-78D63C840695@coolshadow.com>", "refs": ["<04B072E0E3317A4486513BB18D6579C0841D70@exmbx10.ex.ad3.ucdavis.edu>", "<4F4DE46F.2080807@gmx.net>", "<04B072E0E3317A4486513BB18D6579C0842306@exmbx10.ex.ad3.ucdavis.edu>", "<4F4FC69B.1090307@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 13:00:36 -0800", "email": "michael at coolshadow.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] the disk of the sun"}
