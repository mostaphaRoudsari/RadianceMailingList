{"body": "\nHey Randolph,\n\nI have run into this before. Unfortunately I have had limited success in\ntracking down the issue and also have not really looked at it for some\ntime. If I recall correctly, a couple of things that I have noticed:\n\n* possible problem if a piece finishes before the first set of pieces\nare parcelled out out by rpiece - so if it 8 pieces are being\ndistributed at startup and piece 2 (for example) finishes before one\nof pieces 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 has even been processed by rpiece or\nwhile rpiece is still forking off the initial jobs.\n\nSorry I cannot offer more, I have spent some time in the code on this\none and it is not for the faint of heart to say the least.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 4/9/2012 3:29 PM, Randolph M.
