{"body": "\nThanks Jack, Greg.\n\nJack, what kernel were you using?  Was it also Linux?\n\nGreg, I was using rad, so those delays are already in there, alas.  I\nwonder if there is some subtle difference between the Mac OS Mach\nkernel and the Linux kernel that's causing the problem, or if it occurs\non all platforms, just more frequently in the very fast cluster nodes.\n\nOr, it could be an NFS locking problem, bah.\n\nIf I find time, maybe I can dig into it some more.  Right now, I may\njust finesse it by running multiple *different* simulations on the same\ncluster node.\n\nRandolph\n\nOn 2012-04-09 21:52:47 +0000, Greg Ward said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph M.
