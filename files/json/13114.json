{"body": "\nI've gathered little more information Thursday and Friday.\n\nFirst off, I am so far only using single nodes on our cluster for\nrenderings and instead taking advantage of multiple nodes to run more\nrenderings.  Each node in the Lawrencium cluster has two six-core\nXeons, and they are very capable.\n\nI ran a rendering on a different model in the same cluster environment,\nwhich worked perfectly.  My experience so far leads me to the following\nconclusion: whatever the problem is, it is dependent on the model and\nthe simulation parameters.  The model where it worked used mkillum; the\ntwo where it doesn't, don't.  This may--or may not--be significant.\n\nI think adding mkillum surfaces to the models that failed would be an\ninteresting experiment.  Maybe I can find some time to do it next week.\n\nRandolph\n\nOn 2012-04-11 17:22:52 +0000, Jack de Valpine said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph M.
