Thanks so much. I think I'll color rays in the graph according to\nhow often they bounce; the more often, the lighter they get since the light\nwill be more diffused accordingly.\n\n//One of these days I'll do myself a favor and get a linux box I promise ;)\n\nThanks again for your feedback!\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "datetime": "Fri Mar 11 18:53:48 2005"}
