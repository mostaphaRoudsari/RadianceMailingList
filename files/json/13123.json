{"body": "\nHi everyone\n\nI?ve been trying to use the ESP_r / Radiance coupling but encountered some\nerrors.\nI?m working on Windows7 64 bits, and with the lastest esp-r\ndevelopment_branch.\n\nAfter installing the mingw-radiance_setup-3R9 from\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance  (which sets the environment variables\nautomatically, I confirmed)\nI opened the esp-r file from the /cfg folder.\nBut while simulating its presents the following:\n\nSimulation has now commenced.\nRemoving existing transfer file.\nLighting simulation has now commenced.\nFatal error: Radiance simulation produced no data.\n\nSo it seems that esp-r isn?t linked with radiance.\nDoes the location matters? Because I?ve tried C:/Program Files/ ,\nC:/Esru/bin and also C:/Radiance\nIs the above radiance package complete?\nWhat is the best way to install Radiance in a Windows machine?\n\nThanks in advance\nJoao\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120418/0db285ea/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Jo=E3o_Santos?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAHdUKVVs84yWBfkEsh104Y0+ni1j5frkKqhntwiUHQOYiAb7UQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 11:16:07 +0100", "email": "joao.portugal.santos at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance ESP-r coupling"}
