When I tried all other commands there in no such a problem so I supposed I have set correct my path. 3ds2mgf does not appear eihter in this list: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/index.htm Does exist such a program in radiance?\n\nFor this reason I decided to make it with an \"indirect process\" and export my model as .obj (I used anim8or (www.anim8or.com ) to make model and export it as 3ds and obj as well)\n\nI used\nobj2rad thermos6.obj > thermos6.rad\nand successfully thermos6.rad was created.\n\nBut when I call\nobjview thermos6.rad there is the following error:\noconv -f -r 16384 example.rad /usr/tmp/lt27666.rad > usr/tmp.ov27666.oct\noconv: fatal - (thermos6.rad): undefined modifier \"mesh01\"\nrad: error generating octree usr/tmp/ov27666.oct removed\n\nSame error ( oconv: fatal - (thermos6.rad): undefined modifier \"mesh01\") appears when I call oconv command\n\nCan anyone help me? What I am I doing wrong? How can I solve the problem?\n(by the way I have also used 3D studio max to try for a simpler model but the same problem appears, so I assume that it is not a problem of anim8or exporting)\n\nHere are the files i used:\nwww.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~cs99dm1/rad/thermos6.rad (430K)\nwww.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~cs99dm1/rad/thermos6.3ds (30K)\nwww.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~cs99dm1/rad/thermos6.obj (80K)\n\n\nThanks a lot,\nDespina\n\n----- Original Message -----\nTo: 'Radiance general discussion'\nSent: Wednesday, March 02, 2005 3:22 PM\n\nDespina,\n\n\n\nYou can convert almost any  3ds model directly into radiance:\n\n3ds2mgf name.3ds\n\nmgf2rad name.mgf > name.rad\n\n\n\nnow simply try:\n\nobjview name.rad\n\nthe rvu window should open showing the model illuminated by 3 light sources,\n\nit's a quick and good check to start with.\n\nOf everything is ok, you can now create in a separate file the sky,\n\nWhen you have done you combine the two with:\n\n\n\noconv sky.rad name.rad > name.oct\n\n\n\nand preview them with\n\n\n\nrvu name.oct\n\n\n\nnow you just need to set up the view,\n\ntype v in the rvu window, select point and viewing direction...\n\ngood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\nPS\n\nthis is quick but do not incorporates uv coordinates, only colours are translated.\n\n\n\nIf you have textures and uv you may need to use obj2mesh\n\n\n\nOnce converted the model the syntax is:\n\n\n\nvoid mesh example\n\n7 modelname.mesh -rx 90 -t 10 10 10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n7 is the number of inputs on the same line,\n\n-rx 90 rotates the model by 90 degrees on the y axys\n\n-t 10 10 10 translate the model from 0 0 0 to the point 10 10 10\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the mesh use:\n\nobj2mesh -a materialfile objfile > meshfile\n\nAbout that there is a quick tutorial I wrote at:\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSent: 02 March 2005 12:33\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello!\n\n\n\nI need to illuminate a scene with radiance which does not only  contain primitives (e.g. sphere) but some more complex models such  a 3ds model.\n\nThat is, I need to do what is described in Debevec's IBL tutorial but instead to have spheres in the scene, i wolud like to have a 3ds model\n\n\n\nAs I understood so far from what I have read from web, is that I need to convert .3ds to .obj and then use obj2mesh radiance programm\n\n\n\nThen I should use that mesh (lets sat output.rtm) in the scene (file: scene.rad) with this:\n\n\n\nmod mesh id\n1+ output.rtm [xform args]\n0\n0\n\n\n\nI would like to know if this is the correct process or there is another way to illuminate a 3ds with radiance?\n\nWhat about [xform args]. What I should write over there? Is anywhere that I can find a simple and complete example for illuminating scenes constist from more complex models?\n\nShould I let 1+ and two zeros just as there are?\n\n\n\n\n\n...Beside the help I need for the above, I would like to read \"Real Pixels\" Graphics Gem II. I' ve ty to find it in the web but waht I found are only many references about this paper. Can I found it anywhere online?\n\n\n\nThank you  a lot,\n\nRegards,\n\nDespina\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\n\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050312/5aa5d135/attachment-0001.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Sat Mar 12 14:48:06 2005"}
