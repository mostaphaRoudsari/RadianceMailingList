{"body": "\nDear all,\nI have to model a two-pane glass make up with a selective 6mm outer pane with an integrated capillary slab (it is called kapilux), white tinted. The obtained effect is a uniform and diffuse light transmittance. The only technical data that I have are: 30% of direct visible transmittance  and 15% of diffuse visible transmittance. I think I should model it with \"trans\" material, but I don't know which parameters I have to use. Does anybody has an idea?\nThanks in advance. Best regards,\nValeria\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Valeria De Giuli", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<FF64C124-E5C3-40CF-9B99-C15140D5E9D5@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 22:34:54 +0200", "email": "valeriadegiuli at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modeling an insulating glass with an integratedcapillary slab"}
