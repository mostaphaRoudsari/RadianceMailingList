{"body": "\nDear Jo?o\n\nI'm afraid I have never used the coupling on Windows, however, the message must not mean that Radiance is not installed correctly or that it is not \"linked\".\n\n\n-          Where do you fire up ESP-r? On Unix / Cygwin, best results with Radiance coupling are usually obtained when starting esp-r in the /cfg/ folder of the model of interest\n\n-          Do you get any \"chatter\" from the / a console? Possibly, Radiance and / or ESP-r gives some messages which could help\n\n-          There seems to be a glitch in the current development_branch which leads to missing .opt files with Radiance coupling. Possibly add such a file manually (see a similar problem some weeks ago, I sent an example .opt to the group)\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\nVon: Jo?o Santos [mailto:joao.portugal.santos at gmail.com]\nGesendet: Mittwoch, 18.

Because I?ve tried C:/Program Files/ ,  C:/Esru/bin and also C:/Radiance\nIs the above radiance package complete?\nWhat is the best way to install Radiance in a Windows machine?\n\nThanks in advance\nJoao\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120418/c7b24b55/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance ESP-r coupling", "sender": "Geissler Achim", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0F4309A75967A944A1E3C19469796698EA19B9CCFC@MXAMU12.adm.ds.fhnw.ch>", "refs": ["<CAHdUKVVs84yWBfkEsh104Y0+ni1j5frkKqhntwiUHQOYiAb7UQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 12:36:32 -0000", "email": "achim.geissler at fhnw.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance ESP-r coupling"}
