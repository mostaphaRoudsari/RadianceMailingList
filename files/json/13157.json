{"body": "\nIt's really tough to say without knowing what they mean by direct and diffuse transmission.  From their website I understand that by \"direct\" they mean normal incidence direct-hemispherical transmission and by \"diffuse\" they mean hemispherical-hemispherical transmission.  I would suggest setting Td to 30% and know that for non-normal incidence angles you will over estimate overall transmission.\n\nThis product, with it's capillary tubes and diffusing papers, is a perfect example of a system that should be modeled with a BSDF.  Unfortunately your options for BSDF characterization are murky at best right now.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 27, 2012, at 2:47 PM, Valeria De Giuli wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<05E84B24-89B6-406C-87EF-D17464CF7B44@gmail.com>", "sender": "Andy McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4789D41D-020C-40A4-A222-0A315C4157DA@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<FF64C124-E5C3-40CF-9B99-C15140D5E9D5@gmail.com>", "<D25D89EE-E23A-4B70-B215-CCDF1AB03419@lbl.gov>", "<05E84B24-89B6-406C-87EF-D17464CF7B44@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 15:42:25 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modeling an insulating glass with anintegrated capillary slab"}
