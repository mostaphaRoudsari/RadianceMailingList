In the\nconversion process a gamma correction is applied (unless you set the\noption -g 1.0).\n\nThe gamma correction makes the images appear darker, means if you click\non your photo in an image editing program, and it gives you, say,\n0.6/0.5/0.1 as rgb (or 153/127/25 in the 0-255 range), the corresponding\nr/g/b coefficients will be lower after the import into Radiance.\n\nOnly if you set -g 1.0 (e.g. in ra_t16 -r -g 1.0 test.tga test.pic) and\nthen map the image onto a plastic with rgb = 1/1/1, you'll get the\noriginal r/g/b values form the picture (regardless if they're physically\nmeaningful or not), means the appearance will be the same as if you use\na 'plastic' with rgb = 0.6/0.5/0.1 directly.\n\n-cb\n\n\nPS\nnice images...is this the room in the registry office where Prince\nCharles and Camilla are going to hold their wedding???? Especially the\npink version would suit perfectly for it !!\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Mon Mar 14 12:11:17 2005"}
