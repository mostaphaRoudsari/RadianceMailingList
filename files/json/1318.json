{"body": "\nHi,\n\njust had a look at that betavote-site. Is there a reason why the pic of\nBush looks absolutely sharp while that Kerry is obviously a bit blurred,\nor is it just pure accident :-)..\n\nBTW, a recent poll here in Germany gave 73% for Kerry and 17% for Bush,\na bit differing from the betavote numbers. The funny thing is, that so\nmany people who aren't interested in their own countries politics, and\nwho probably haven't gone to vote locally since years, now want to\nparticipate.. .\n\nBTW #2 for me, the question of Bush or Kerry is still a bit boring, but\nif one day Arnold Schwarzenegger runs for president, I wanna vote, too !!!\n\n-cb\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<41862FD7.2060702@t-online.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Nov  1 12:34:44 2004", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Off-topic:  PLEASE VOTE!!References: <9B8768E2-2BC2-11D9-82E1-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>"}
