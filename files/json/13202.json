{"body": "\nHI All,\n\n\n\nI have installed the DIVA for Rhino plugin and since there I can no longer\nrun radiance grid analysis directly from Ecotect. I am getting the following\nerror message in the dos window:\n\n\n\n\"rtrace: fatal - command line error at '-sj'\n\n\n\nWhich then results in no data being written to the grid file.\n\n\n\nIn addition I cannot recall how to reinstall everything to its original\nstate as it was operating before installing DIVA for Rhino.\n\n\n\nAny help with this would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nBayanda\n\nBAS (UCT)\n\nGreen Star SA Accredited Professional\n\n\n\nPJ Carew Consulting\n\n3rd floor 71 buitengraght Cape Town 8001\n\ntel: 021 426 4051  fax: 021 426 5050  cell: 083 335 9365\n\n<mailto:bayanda at pjc.co.za> bayanda at pjc.co.za    <http://www.pjc.co.za/>\nwww.pjc.co.za\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120404/43b6df88/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Bayanda Mpauli", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001301cd1237$9e3224c0$da966e40$@pjc.co.za>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 4 Apr 2012 09:50:31 +0200", "email": "bayanda at pjc.co.za", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Ecotect, DIVA and Radiance"}
