{"body": "\nDear Stefano, et al,\n\nMy rendering pipeline often contains a call to pfilt to set the exposure as\nif the picture was taken with a particular fstop and exposure. Look at this\nreference:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/filmspeed.html\n\nHere is the example from that site. You can see the \"1/60\" and \"4\" in the\ncall to ev. Very handy.\n\nSo, if you were trying to produce an image as it would appear shot at 1/60\nsec. on ASA 100 (ISO 21) film at f-4, you would apply pfilt thusly:\n\npfilt -1 -e `ev \"2.81*1/60*21/4^2\"` raw.pic > fin.pic\n\n\nHope that helps,\nTim\n\nPS: here it is in action. Note I do not save the original file and direct\nstandard error to /dev/null. Both of these are probably a bad idea.\n\nrpict $VIEWPOINT \\\n-ps 1 -pt 0.15 -pj 0.6 \\\n-dj 0.7 -ds 0.5 -dt -0.5 -dc 0.75 -dr 1 -dp 256 \\\n-ss 0.3 -st 0.02 \\\n-ab 3  -aa 0.05 -ar 64 -ad 2048 -as 1024 \\\n-lr 4 -lw 0.0001 \\\n-x 2500 -y 2500 \\\nclock.oct 2> /dev/null \\\n| pfilt -1 -e `ev \"2.81*1/60*21/4^2\"` -x /4 -y\n/4 -r 0.6 > $filtFile\n\n\nOn Tue, May 15, 2012 at 4:32 PM, Andy McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120515/3307d475/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rvu exposure setting", "sender": "Tim Perry", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAFVgASV0tCg2-2eddQUPGWWJEQPjkMw=fEj6yqmH8+DUvTnrPg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<04B072E0E3317A4486513BB18D6579C00728D83D@exmbx10.ex.ad3.ucdavis.edu>", "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32233EE1AB44@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "<E4347ABE-01A2-4D26-AE77-DDC9A10C6503@ucdavis.edu>", "<F23FCD4D-6083-4059-B526-0A2F737CD7FA@lbl.gov>", "<91CF3598-81CB-4CD8-90AD-07E22A79CE44@ucdavis.edu>", "<0F0300F1-C7C8-492E-B73F-3D09C9D180FB@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Tue, 15 May 2012 16:40:52 -0700", "email": "tim.v2.0 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rvu exposure setting"}
