{"body": "\nDear Greg, thank you very much!\n\nI've got the C file you sent. However, I have no experience in C\nprogramming. So, can you kindly advise me how should I \"compile\" or \"do\nwith\" it?\n\nWhat I want to do is to get a falsecolor sky radiance fisheye image and map\nit back to a virtual sky dome. See the link below:\nhttp://diva4rhino.com/forum/topics/gendaylit-in-diva-2-0-seriously-underesitmates-total-irradiation\n\nSince the falsecolor image I generated from falsecolor2.exe is one with\nEast and West switched, I need to crop it to get ride of the color legend\nand flip horizontally it so that East and West are correctly visualized.\n\nThanks again!\n\n- Ji\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 18, 2012 at 2:03 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120518/d8934220/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<C5CE38F3-FF52-4ACB-8ED0-73642F8B3C3B@lmi.net>", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD83LVLQdCStVviEexVdo1YCwVA4z1iyT0r-Tmmo9AyF0BmnjA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD83LVJ1id5WafNoGzw1p+LhjkYLqHhem84U9mpOBeyfoFF8fw@mail.gmail.com>", "<C5CE38F3-FF52-4ACB-8ED0-73642F8B3C3B@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Fri, 18 May 2012 03:13:35 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] how to pipe the output of pcompos as inputfor pflip"}
