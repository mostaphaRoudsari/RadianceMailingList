{"body": "\n\nJohn -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for that.\n\n\n\nInterestingly the v. helpful C & W paper, although\n\nexpressing sentiments that are bang on target,\n\nseems to compare one simulation with another,\n\nbut not with real-world empirical data, unless I?m\n\nmissing something.\n\n\n\nMaybe up to some point, comparisons of their\n\nMonte Carlo results with some similar simulation\n\nin Radiance could be interesting/useful, but surely\n\nnot as useful as comparison with some real-world\n\nempirical data.\n\n\n\nDesperate for any kind of confirmation, my very\n\nrough lux-meter measurements of office blind\n\noverall transmission on an overcast London\n\nday compared tolerably with their simulations.\n\n\n\nI?m hoping some better real-world data will\n\ncome to light eventually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the subject of control of direct sunlight by\n\nblinds; despite having more than a suspicion\n\nthat you know more about daylighting than\n\nI do, here goes:\n\n\n\nThe reason I said I was ?not interested? in\n\ndirect sunlight in those studies was that for me\n\nat least, in the UK, the ?overcast sky? is the most\n\nuseful environment to apply in daylight studies\n\nat the early stages of building design development.\n\n\n\nIt allows alternative architectural designs to be\n\ncompared for degrees of compliance with\n\nparticular published UK CIBSE and BCO\n\ncriteria so as to merit the alternatives'\n\ndaylighting.\n\n\n\nI find that the usual objective for these sorts of\n\nstudy is to find the daylight factor with ?venetian\n\nblinds down, slats horizontal, overcast sky?.\n\n\n\nThe control of direct sunlight by the venetian\n\nblinds need not figure in these early simulations,\n\ndespite that being their major function.\n\n\n\nAny fixed solar shading does of course have\n\nto be modelled reasonably well, as do the\n\nrelevant parameters for the solar transmission\n\nof the fa?ade and glazings; the geometry and\n\nreflectance of the building model and its context.\n\n\n\nAgreed nevertheless that if one could develop\n\na function to simulate blinds, then not allowing\n\nthe direct factor to be simulated would be\n\nsomewhat perverse.\n\n\n\nRegards, George Chadwick\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nALL-NEW Yahoo!
