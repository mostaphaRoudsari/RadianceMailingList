{"body": "\nI think you get two suns but one sky. Not sure which one of the two. Suspect the one listed last in the octree.\nif you want to cumulate sky contributions you need to add images of each sky together and map them back in a new scene with brightfunc and glow.\nThe process may look something like this:\n\nrpict -w- -x 256 -y 256 -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -ps 1 model1.oct  > yoursky1.pic\nrpict -w- -x 256 -y 256 -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -ps 1 model2.oct  > yoursky2.pic\npcomb yoursky1.pic yoursky2.pic > yoursky.pic\n\nand then back in a new radiance scene, like this\n\nvoid colorpict dist\n11 noop noop noop yoursky.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 90\n0\n0\ndist glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\nPlease check it works and debug as appropriate.\nIt has been some time I have run this? and I do not recall why rx and ry, but probably has to do with the fisheye.cal.\nNot sure.\n\nNowadays I would suggest using rtcontrib as it does the same and much more...\nGood luck,\nG\n\n\n\nOn 20 May 2012, at 11:43, Ji Zhang wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120520/35c79c17/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAD83LVL3HwWgeEwkgHEubB7cHV_bvKQh--LgHOSRPGsbtqY+YA@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "giulio antonutto", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<625ABAF9-583E-4A5A-9018-272A7B0FAE4B@yahoo.it>", "refs": ["<CAD83LVL3HwWgeEwkgHEubB7cHV_bvKQh--LgHOSRPGsbtqY+YA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun, 20 May 2012 12:22:51 +0100", "email": "antonutto at yahoo.it", "subject": "[Radiance-general] can we refer to two sky description files inoconv?"}
