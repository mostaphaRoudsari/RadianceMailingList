{"body": "\nYes to #1, no to #2.  This was discussed before, and I added a warning from rpiece when the resolution changes, but I can't keep it from changing.  Rpiece (rpict really) needs the tiles to be of equal size, which means both dimensions must be multiples of the respective number of tile divisions.\n\nYou can work around the problem with some difficulty by noting what rpiece changes the resolution to and making sure you set -x and -y to this with -pa 0 on any other runs you do.  Unfortunately, the actual resolution will change with different -N settings because rad will make a different number of tiles to optimize processor loads.\n\nRegarding #1, I haven't changed trad in ages, so it may take a while to remember enough Tcl/Tk to add this.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] running radiance on multiple cores", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A24822C7-1159-4B5B-9248-1E6C3B245613@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFD9BF@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "<98F5AA52-AA9E-494E-BE4B-9286EA02FF09@lmi.net>", "<4FBDB8F2.3010205@curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Wed, 23 May 2012 21:45:49 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] running radiance on multiple cores"}
