Rpict normally \"jitters\" pixel centers as an\nanti-aliasing measure.  If you rerender your image, turning jitterinig\noff with -pj 0, you will get the exact pixel centers produced by\nvwrays.  Being off by even a fraction of a pixel can make a difference\nin the result, especially near the object's visible boundaries.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<1110972134.423816e62d31e@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Mar 16 16:26:01 2005"}
