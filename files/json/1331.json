{"body": "\nDear fellow Radiance users,\n\nGreg, John M, and myself had a little offline discussion considering the\ndate and place of the 2005 Radiance workshop. With this email, we invite you\nto share your opinions considering a preferred date and location for the\nnext workshop.\n\nThe NRC could host the workshop next August in conjunction with the IBPSA\nconference 2005 which will take place in Montreal, Canada\n(http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/ <http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/> ) from Monday,\nAugust 15th to Thursday, August 18th. The workshop would take place on the\nThursday and Friday before the conference (August 11th & 12th) at the School\nof Architecture at McGill. The school is located in downtown Montreal within\neasy walking distance from restaurants and cafes. The benefit of organizing\nthe workshop in conjunction with a major building simulation conference\nmight be that some individuals (including myself) have an easier time\ninternally justifying travel expenses to attend a major conference than an\ninformal workshop.\n\nJohn offered to host the 2006 workshop in the UK. Please let us know your\npreference for either location.\n\nBest regards,\n\nChristoph\n\nPS: Montreal and surroundings are definitely worth a trip in case you have\nnot been here before. There are plenty of weekend/ after meeting activities\nfrom Moshe Safdie's Habitat (that would make a nice Radiance model) to\ncanoeing in the Laurentians.\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Ph.D.                        tel: (613) 993-9703\nResearch Officer                                      fax: (613) 954-3733\nInstitute for Research in Construction      e-mail:\nchristoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\nNational Research Council Canada        1200 Montreal Road M-24, Ottawa\nOntario K1A 0R6 Canada\n\nDaylighting Analysis Software:\nThe Lightswitch Wizard (initial design)   www.buildwiz.com\n<http://www.buildwiz.com/lightswitch/index.cfm>\nDAYSIM (expert software)                       www.daysim.com\n<outbind://24/www.daysim.com>  <outbind://24/www.daysim.com>\n\n\nIEA Task 31\nhttp://www.iea-shc.org/task31/ <http://www.iea-shc.org/task31/>\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041102/be217a37/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC32870F4372DE@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Nov  2 16:59:27 2004", "email": "Christoph.Reinhart at nrc-cnrc.gc.ca", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance workshop 2005"}
