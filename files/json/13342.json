{"body": "\nWell, I think the neural network needs at least 300 pixel samples to do its work, meaning that the total number of pixels divided by the -n option must be at least 300.  Even with -n 1, it can fail if you only give it an image that's a couple of hundred pixels in size.  I don't think the other converters are so constrained.  You could use ra_bmp which does tone-mapping also, or ra_t8 if you really want an 8-bit image.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120517/367f0761/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ra_gif: out of memory error", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ECDC4F4B-17B0-42FB-B7BF-A1CB8F76507C@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAAZQWqgy0taUNcysa7Pv0mVoLNL3PM8xOvr_NybM5GGzZt0gWw@mail.gmail.com>", "<CEDF9B3E-89E4-416F-A8F4-32121E942AD1@lmi.net>", "<CAAZQWqj+5Fnxr-EC=KKrP+jopsR21QKgWQh65G4+W61G54s7RA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 17 May 2012 08:24:56 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ra_gif: out of memory error"}
