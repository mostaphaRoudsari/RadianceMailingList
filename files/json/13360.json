{"body": "\nGiovanni,\n\nI think there is another way, which requires some more fiddling, but that can give you a lot more flexibility.\nEspecially with visualisations.\nI would start by taking n. 6 x  90? wide angular images of luminance from the observer position.\nYou could use vwrays to work with rtrace.\nThen derive the illuminance at the view point, as you know the solid angle of each pixel / direction and the luminance of it.\nSee the IESNA book for details. You could write a little script with rcalc, python or octave.\nI guess Andy or Greg would do all in one line with sed / awk :-)\n\nOnce done you could have polar maps of your illuminance component, directionality of lighting in the space, etc etc.\n\nTo start playing with the idea you could do as Mark is suggesting, 6 illuminance values are  good as you could easily plot the vector illumiannce to visualise the directionality of lighting.\nThis is an useful metrics for museums.\n\nEither way, have fun!\nG\n\n\nOn 8 May 2012, at 14:16, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120509/be24f161/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFCE96@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "sender": "giulio antonutto", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<03A34276-0F18-4CF4-8BE6-30D0B11F9BB3@yahoo.it>", "refs": ["<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFCE7D@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "<F26DB3928A041843B352BA7F4307A46141B555CDA5@EXC-MCHVS12.mch.osram.de>", "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFCE96@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>"], "datetime": "Wed, 9 May 2012 08:55:27 +0100", "email": "antonutto at yahoo.it", "subject": "[Radiance-general] integral of radiation in one point-spherical illuminance"}
