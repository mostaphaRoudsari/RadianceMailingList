{"body": "\nHi Giovanni,\n\nthat is called spherical illuminance. As an approximation, you could calculate 6 illuminance values (up, down, East, West, North, South) and average them. Christopher Cuttle wrote a few papers on spherical illuminance.\n\nRegards\n\nMartin Moeck\nOSRAM\n\n\n\n________________________________\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2012 1:42 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear list,\n\nI have question that I hope you'll help get my head around.\nI want to calculate the overall illuminance on a point in space that is, regardless of directionality.\nI have made some simplified 2d sketches for clarity.\nAs I understand a radiance sensor point in rtrace will have cosine related sensitivity (image01)\nIf I am to place two coincident with opposing normals (image2) I'll miss on contributions from the sides.\nRotating the normals by 90 degrees at a time (figure 3) and summing contributions might not work either because will overestimate diagonal contributions (figure 4 ).\nSo I'm not getting too much closer to the solution...\n\nIs there something that I am missing here?\nAny light on this will be appreciated,\n\nBest,\nGiovanni Betti\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120508/1267d76f/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFCE7D@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "sender": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F26DB3928A041843B352BA7F4307A46141B555CDA5@EXC-MCHVS12.mch.osram.de>", "refs": ["<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFCE7D@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>"], "datetime": "Tue, 8 May 2012 13:51:58 +0200", "email": "Giovanni Betti", "subject": "[Radiance-general] integral of radiation in one point"}
