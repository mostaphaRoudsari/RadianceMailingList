It has two modes, -i and -e (similar to rpict). -i\n<modifier> will write ONLY geometry modified by <modifier> to STDOUT,\n-e <modifier> will output everything but geometry modified by\n<modifier>. This is a rather simple script, using sed and awk, and as I\nam not very good in using the text utilities, there is certainly a lot\nof overhead. However, it is useable, and can be found here:\n\nhttp://130.83.168.34/lars/rad/rad_filter.sh.gz\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] how to filter objects by modifier?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
