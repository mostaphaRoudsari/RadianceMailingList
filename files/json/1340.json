It looked like you guys\nneeded the help of a good Perl programmer :)\n\nIt's not heavily tested, I only threw it together in a few hours. I've put\nin little comments to help anyone trying to follow the code. I know that\nPerl has a bad reputation, but I try to make my perl code neat and consistent.\n*sigh* back in the day I was actually paid to code perl...\n\nI added the feature of \"following\" modifiers with the -s option. When this\noption is specified, non-surface primitives (i.e materials, textures,\npatterns, or mixtures) will be matched by their modifier and their id will\nbe added to the list of modifiers that are being matched. Make sense? This\nwill allow the user to specify the name of one modifier that is then\n\"modified\" by other materials, etc.\n\nAnyway, let me know how it goes. I've probably screwed up somewhere.\nbye\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: rad_filter.pl.gz\nType: application/x-gzip\nSize: 1303 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050402/d4ca8ca8/rad_filter.pl.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] how to filter objects by modifier?", "tags": [], "sender": "Ian Tester", "datetime": "Fri Apr  1 16:18:21 2005"}
