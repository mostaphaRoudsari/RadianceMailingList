{"body": "\nHi Nasif,\n\nInformation for the BSDF material is at the bottom of page 12:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf\n\nThough I've found that the BSDF material doesn't work well for\ndaylight coefficient based annual simulations (I'm assuming dds.bash is a\ndynamic daylight simulation script).  Putting the solar radiance into\nskypatches relies on probabilistic sampling to find patches containing the\nsun, and if you don't have much direct transmission from the direction of\nthe sun, you aren't likely to find the sun.  Not finding the sun causes big\nerrors.  For now, the three-phase method is a better alternative for annual\nsimulation of BSDF materials (you can find a tutorial at the bottom of this\npage: http://www.radiance-online.org:82/learning/tutorials - if you're at\nwork, your company's firewall might block access to port 82 - the temporary\nlocation of the new radiance online).\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 8:18 AM, nassif nassif <nynassif at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/2069464f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF xml into Radiance", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Nizc0-+xrNry_qVJh6-hoA0C-=P5EVTYuc7AiZuD9yqyVQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOQvQdktSHbMb-HiQiTpNAhLfU-jL28BUfuA6pBh1=Y0yX7jow@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 08:43:53 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF xml into Radiance"}
