{"body": "\nHi Tarik,\n\nThe problem is that keys.cal is not being completely generated. I think\nthat there are a couple of things to look at.\n\nFirst, I do not think that you are doing quite the right thing to create\nkey.fmt. \"key.fmt\" should be a file that contains a format, in this case:\n\nrview -vtv -vp ${px} ${py} ${pz} -vd ${dx} ${dy} ${dz} -vu 0 0 1 -vh ${vh} -vv ${vv} -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t ${t}\n\nThis should all be on one line and should not contain trailing or\nleading white spaces. This is the string that rcalc will match to in\norder to extract your variables.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I do not think that this is a valid command:\n\n./rview -vtv -vp ${px} ${py} ${pz} -vd ${dx} ${dy} ${dz} -vu 0 0 1 -vh ${vh} -vv ${vv} -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t ${t} > key.fmt\n\nSecond, I believe that there may be a problem with the case of the\nvariable names used. For example, your key.fmt uses all lower case (such\nas px, py and pz). Whereas in the call to tabfunc and the second call to\nrcalc you use mixed case for the variable names such as (Px, Py and Pz).\nI am not sure what os you are running on, it is possible that cygwin\nignores case and quite likely that windows does. Unix/Linux/OsX however\ndo expect case to match.\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nTarik Rahman wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] problems creating animation viewfile", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<418F94E6.3000408@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<1099923775.418f813f0edfa@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov  8 16:47:06 2004", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] problems creating animation viewfile"}
