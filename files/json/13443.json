If you have that system and want me to send you\ndirections, please let me know.\n\nThis really isn't that big a deal. I know how to hit \"delete\".\n\nGood luck with your travels,\nTim\n\nOn Sun, Jun 24, 2012 at 12:00 PM, Janelle Drouet <Jdrouet at lightswitch.net>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120624/88472486/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 100, Issue 23", "sender": "Tim Perry", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAFVgASVEPjKgaf2-04wAsX8o6mMeJ7A+z2kPHCzERCczpQiuhw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<mailman.1.1340564400.98282.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<CC0CB1FB.D008%Jdrouet@lightswitch.net>"], "datetime": "Sun, 24 Jun 2012 12:20:11 -0700", "email": "tim.v2.0 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 100, Issue 23"}
