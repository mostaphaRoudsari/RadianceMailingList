{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\nThis came up in July on the general list, and no one seemed to have a\nproper answer...\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/\n001939.html\n\nThe window size is determined by the X11 window manager.  Some window\nmanagers have preferences you can set for specific X11 clients, but I\ndon't know where they live.  Do you know what window manager you are\nusing?  (Hint: they are generally platform-specific, so if you tell us\nwhat machine/OS you are using, this would help.)  Can anyone on the\nlist offer suggestions?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Rvu window?
