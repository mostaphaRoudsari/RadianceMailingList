{"body": "\nHi,\n\nIs there a simple way of rotating the sky using rtcontrib? I'm using tregenza.cal, which, from the header of the file, has patch one at North and progresses eastwards for 30 patches.  I'd like to rotate the sky 8 degrees counterclockwise. I could rotate the objects and the views, but it would be nice to just move the sky. Is there a simple way to do this?\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn.\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Ford", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4D9F8275-D230-4A22-BCEA-4E53A921A268@bb3.net.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 16:48:44 +1000", "email": "johnford at bb3.net.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib- rotating the sky"}
