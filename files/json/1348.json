I mean that that setting the\nwindow size and height by the user might also reflect the wish to set\nthe image dimension for the view, this includes the aspect ratio. In\nRadiance, however, the aspect ratio is determined by the vertical and\nhorizontal view angle, and even in rpict the width or the height in\npixels is overriden if the angle aspect ratio doesn't match the pixel\naspect ratio.\n\nso apart form handing over pixel values to the X-server the question is\nwhich values should have priority (angles or pixels), this is - as\nalways - one of personal preferences (I personally like the latter\nversion, this is why 've changed it..)\n\nIf you simply set the window sizes in pixels, and the ratio doesn't\nmatch the angle aspect ratio, you'll end up with a window filled only\npartially by the image in one dimension, which doesn't look very\nprofessional. That's probably one reason why Radiance doesn't allow the\nuser to interfere at this stage.. :-)\n\n-cb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4190B0DC.9000300@t-online.de>", "refs": ["<000201c4c4c3$628bc350$0100a8c0@mallah>\t<E0FEFF54-31A5-11D9-998D-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "<418FAC00.8020003@pab-opto.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Nov  9 11:49:10 2004", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-dev] Re: [Radiance-general] Re: Rvu window?
