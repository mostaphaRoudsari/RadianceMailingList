{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nYou really need to refer to the code if you want this level of detail.  The paper you mention talks about Fresnel reflection, but these formulae are only applied for glass and dielectric.  Plastic uses an approximation developed independently by myself and another researcher, Christoph Schlick:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlick's_approximation\n\nIf you look in ray/src/rt/normal.c, you will find it there.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] calculation of one reflection (rtrace)", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B82DF329-66D1-4C80-A9E6-91316811A6A2@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4FEB7E06.30504@gmx.de>", "<E2666296-E63D-4904-B702-A1E544BC0D24@lmi.net>", "<4FED923D.1040401@gmx.de>"], "datetime": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 09:28:55 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] calculation of one reflection (rtrace)"}
