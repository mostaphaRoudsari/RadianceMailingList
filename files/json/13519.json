{"body": "\nHi all,\n\njust a note on the 15 \"new\" CIE sky types from 2003: these luminance\ndistributions can be\nused in Radiance using Philipp Greenup's ssldlum.cal that can be downloaded\nfrom\nwww.radiance-online.org/patches/ssld/SSLD algorithm with PDF.zip\n\nHowever, afaik these models are not commonly used (and even not really well\nknown)...\n\nA short note on Rob's comment: if I remember right the new CIE sky type 1\nis slightly different\nfrom the \"good old\" overcast sky. That's why the classical overcast sky\n(with the 3:1 distribution\nL(gamma)/L(zenith) = (1+2*sin(gamma))/3 ) is defined as additional 16th sky\ntype in the CIE Standard.\n\nBest,\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120621/5660e922/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Current practice for LEED sky modelling?", "sender": "David Geisler-Moroder", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAL-bo5HLAJJ0FMT4uKOYijzeufCq-bJu_64O4X4E7akRH6yL9A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<E66D955A-C2C8-4653-BB06-5ADA7F14C1CB@lmi.net>", "<CC0634A6.118A1%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 09:26:52 +0200", "email": "david.moroder at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Current practice for LEED sky modelling?"}
