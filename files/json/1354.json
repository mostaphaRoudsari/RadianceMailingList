{"body": "\nI think Rob is right.  As I said in my initial reply, many window\nmanagers under X11 override the client window dimensions, and some can\neven be instructed how to override these dimensions for specific\nprograms via a preferences file.  Unfortunately, each window manager\nhas its own way of doing this, so we need to ask the X11 gurus out\nthere how it might be done.  I don't really know how Gnome handles\nthings, for instance.  Under twm, the user can create a \".twmrc\" file\nin their home directory, which contains the variable \"MaxWindowSize\"\nthat may be set to control the maximum dimensions for any client\napplication.  Related variables are UsePPosition and RandomPlacement.\nI don't have a reference, but I know the Solaris window manager can\ndirect individual client placements.\n\nHowever, I agree that a -geom option would be a nice addition, and I'll\nlook into it if there's enough interest.  I'm also curious what people\nhave to say in response to Carsten's query about output dimensions\nversus view angles.  I always considered the latter to be more\nimportant, but I'm willing to be proved wrong democratically.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rvu window?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CDC070A4-326E-11D9-8894-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<000201c4c4c3$628bc350$0100a8c0@mallah>", "<E0FEFF54-31A5-11D9-998D-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "<418FAC00.8020003@pab-opto.de> <4190B0DC.9000300@t-online.de>", "<4190DB7B.4050501@rumblestrip.org>", "<Pine.BSF.4.58.0411091110120.97125@emancholl.pair.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Nov  9 17:45:52 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rvu window?"}
