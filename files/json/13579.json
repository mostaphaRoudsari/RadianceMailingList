{"body": "\nOn Wednesday, July 4, 2012, Michael Bannert <mbannert at cin.uni-tuebingen.de>\nwrote:\ntutorial. Right at the beginning when trying to view the sphere (page 14)\nusing the following command \"objline objects/things.rad | x11meta\", all I\nget is a mesh without surfaces and an error saying:\nserver shutdown).\"\n\nWhen does this error show in the terminal? While you're still looking at\nthe mesh or only when you close the window? If it only appears after you\nclosed the window then that's just because the x11meta window does not\nterminate the connection to the x server properly. That's not a problem.\n\nthis stage but I think that this error message is not a good sign.\n\nIt doesn't look like a problem at this stage. Continue with the tutorial\nand see if the following steps produce output you expect.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120705/bb7d8ce2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<889C1F1F-BE59-4EE7-A1D5-6714DD188964@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k1KebiCxQmT=_JZ_z4P6X7265KZKEoPEZL286MO2RK39g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<889C1F1F-BE59-4EE7-A1D5-6714DD188964@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>"], "datetime": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 08:48:26 +0200", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Error: \"X connection to .... broken(explicit kill or server shutdown)"}
