I created an\n.Xresources file (my xinitrc file seems to check for the presence of\nthat and does the \"xrdb -merge\" thingy if it exists) and placed:\n\nradiance.rvu.x:800\nradiance.rvu.y:600\n\n... in that file, but it didn't seem to work.  Of course the number of\nways I could have screwed up that tip is roughly equal to the number of\nKerry votes that may have been swallowed by Diebold voting machines a\nweek ago.\n\nAs usual, I am humbled by the list's collective knowledge of this stuff.\nI'll watch -- from the sidelines -- the continuing saga about getting\nthis done from the application side.  Looking forward to seeing how this\none pans out.\n\n-------------------\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rvu window?", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<41911A8A.4000707@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<000201c4c4c3$628bc350$0100a8c0@mallah>\t<E0FEFF54-31A5-11D9-998D-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>\t<418FAC00.8020003@pab-opto.de>\t<4190B0DC.9000300@t-online.de>\t<4190DB7B.4050501@rumblestrip.org>\t<Pine.BSF.4.58.0411091110120.97125@emancholl.pair.com>\t<4190F40E.8090405@rumblestrip.org>", "<41911617.2020107@t-online.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Nov  9 20:28:24 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rvu window?"}
