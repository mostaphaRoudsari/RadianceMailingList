{"body": "\nHi Iebele & Thomas,\n\nThanks a lot for your help! - I'm running other programs that make use of X11 without problems, e.g., Matlab, Gimp, Freesurfer...\n\n'xclock' and 'xeyes' - quite as promised - gives me a clock and eyes, respectively.\n\nI found some other posts on the web that were unrelated to Radiance mentioning the same error. It appears that it may have something to do with ssh settings. But I'm not remotely connected to any other machine... Just wondering...\n\n@Thomas: Yes, the error only occurred when closing the window. But there was an error beep when the window opened that made me wonder.\n\nFor the time being, I think I will just proceed with the tutorial and assume that this problem does not specifically affect the behavior of Radiance.\n\nGroetjes,\nMichael\n\nOn Jul 5, 2012, at 8:48 AM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nMichael Bannert, Dipl.-Psych.\nVision & Cognition Lab, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Univ. of T?bingen & BCCN T?bingen\nOtfried-M?ller-Str. 25, 72076 T?bingen, Germany\nPhone: +49 - (0)7071 / 29 - 89031\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120705/684e1b54/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAKGV-k1KebiCxQmT=_JZ_z4P6X7265KZKEoPEZL286MO2RK39g@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Michael Bannert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<234FB702-BF1D-49D5-8E1B-9B3ADB02F3A6@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>", "refs": ["<889C1F1F-BE59-4EE7-A1D5-6714DD188964@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>", "<CAKGV-k1KebiCxQmT=_JZ_z4P6X7265KZKEoPEZL286MO2RK39g@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 08:59:23 +0200", "email": "mbannert at cin.uni-tuebingen.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Error: \"X connection to .... broken(explicit kill or server shutdown)"}
