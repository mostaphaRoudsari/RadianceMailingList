{"body": "\nDear All,?\n\nI wanted to ask a question related to the prediction of the diffuse horizontal (or vertical contribution) of a particular patch of the sky ( with a specific patch altitude, solid angle, patch azimuth).?\n\nI am developing a patch-based Irradiance model and I wanted to compare with other models in Radiance , e.g.Perez Model. I know How to calculate the diffuse horizontal, or any titled surface of the whole sky, but in my case I wanted to compare in a patch-based mode. So I need to simulate a patch-based contribution of diffuse component in horizontal or any titled surface.?\n\nI thank you in advance,?\n\n\nRegards,?\n\nSokol?\n\n\n\n?\nDr. techn.
