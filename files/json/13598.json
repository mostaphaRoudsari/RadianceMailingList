I realised the generated results are for one day. In our office we are using the .EPW to generate the results for the whole year. (as used in the tutorial in rtcontrib). Is it possible with BSDF somehow? if yes, Is there any hints or tips to insert the .xml format generated by window7beta into the rtcontrib process?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nN.Nassif\n\nOn Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 6:21 PM, <radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org>> wrote:\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org>\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org>\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

Putting the solar radiance into\nskypatches relies on probabilistic sampling to find patches containing the\nsun, and if you don't have much direct transmission from the direction of\nthe sun, you aren't likely to find the sun.  Not finding the sun causes big\nerrors.  For now, the three-phase method is a better alternative for annual\nsimulation of BSDF materials (you can find a tutorial at the bottom of this\npage: http://www.radiance-online.org:82/learning/tutorials - if you're at\nwork, your company's firewall might block access to port 82 - the temporary\nlocation of the new radiance online).\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 8:18 AM, nassif nassif <nynassif at gmail.com<mailto:nynassif at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF with rtcontrib", "sender": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CC245C18.125A6%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 08:43:53 -0700", "email": "Andrew McNeil", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] BSDF xml into RadianceMessage-ID:"}
