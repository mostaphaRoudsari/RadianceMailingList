{"body": "\nHi Nassif,\nData in the BSDF isn't specific to a date or time, so yes it is possible to\ndo an annual simulation with the xml file from window.\n\nThere are two official options and one un-official option:\n\n1 - As Rob mentioned, you can use OpenStudio which does a lot of this for\nyou.\n\n2 - you can loop through hours of the weather data file. Following is a\nbash/awk example (add your weather data file at the end and include -a -o\nand -m in the gensky and gendaylit command):\ncount=-8\nwhile read line ; do\ncount=$((count+1))\nif [ count -gt 0 ] ; then\ndaytime=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $2,$3,$4-0.5}'`\nalt=`gensky $daytime  | awk '{if(NR==3) print $6}'\nif [ alt -gt 2 ]; then\ndir=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $14}'`\ndif=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $15}'`\ngendaylit $daytime -W $dir $dif | genskyvec | dctimestep V.vmx T.xml D.dmx\nfi\nfi\ndone < myweather.epw\n\n3 - Unofficial - you can use our annual utility (dctimestepcpu) that takes\na sky matrix file (list of annual sky vectors) and multiplies a whole year\nin one go.  Let me know if you want to go this route, I can send you the\ncode for you to compile on your system.  This isn't a straight forward\ncompile process though, it may require some tweaking on your end.\nhttp://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/sites/simulationresearch.lbl.gov/files/2011-ibpsa-radiance.pdf\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 12:46 AM, nassif nassif <nynassif at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120712/57d3cf25/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF with rtcontrib", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixRhWNdaoeaLkaDNwLOy17jp8DxwQYfVu+sRzDis4FRkw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOQvQdkqk6Bskj18+4WGpd7vLesxzELgsAbb_j=HTYmF8h+Yxg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 12:25:15 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF with rtcontrib"}
