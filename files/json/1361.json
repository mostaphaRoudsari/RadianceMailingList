Radiance does some\ninterpolation between ambient samples. A new indirect sample is only\ntriggered if the new point is outside of the sphere of influence of all\npreviously computed ones. This is controlled by the -a* options. The\nradius of those spheres is\n\nr_min = max_scene_dimension * aa / ar\n\nThe light from the ambient sampling can spill over into areas that would\nnormally not receive indirect light. Could you post a blow-up image of the\nbottom part of the left-hand wall? And see what fiddling with the -aa and\n-ar options results in.\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] clipping planes exposing object interiors?", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Apr  8 02:14:00 2005"}
