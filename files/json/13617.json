{"body": "\nThanks Thomas.\nThe API is pretty complete now but still changes due to evolving Blender\nfunctionality. I have to do quite a bit to port my scripts to the 2.63\nBMesh version for example. genskyvec.pl works when I simply type the\ncommand sequence into the windows terminal, it just seems that when\nexecuting the command sequence with Popen the data from gendaylit is not\ncorrectly understood by genskyvec.pl. Running simply within Python is a\ngood idea, I'll try that.\n\nRyan\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nDr Ryan Southall\nSenior Research Fellow\nSchool of Architecture & Design\nUniversity of Brighton\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Python script", "sender": "Ryan Southall", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<op.whjreziq7lwvrx@localhost>", "refs": ["<mailman.198.1342449120.2089.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"], "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 17:14:49 +0100", "email": "R.Southall at brighton.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Python script"}
