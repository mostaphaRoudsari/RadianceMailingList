Theoretically, this perhaps might be possible, but\ncertainly at a very high computational cost.\n\nSo the solution is to set the ambient resolution -ar sufficiently high\n(and/or) -aa low. The size of the scene cube also plays a role as can be\nseen in the expression for rmin in Axels answer, so a big outside (e.g\nlarge ground polygon) increases the problem. (In the RwR book there is a\nsection on this, and the use of a 'ground glow' is recommended to\ncircumvent this problem.\n\nIf you want to model a huge outdoor part, it is better to use separate\nambient caches for the 'outside' and the 'inside' part of your scene.\n\n-cb\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Fri Apr  8 10:16:14 2005"}
