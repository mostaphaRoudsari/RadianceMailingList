{"body": "\nHi Im?ne!\nRadiance is using an environment variable called RAYPATH to know which\ndirectories to use when searching for files. This allows to use library\nfolders. If you want to make sure that the current directory is searched\nfor files, add a dot (which represents the current directory) to your\nRAYPATH:\n\nexport RAYPATH=$RAYPATH:.\n\nThis is the syntax for the bash shell, other environments may have\ndifferent ways to set an environment variable.\n\nOnce you have a complex scene, adding some directories may help. I\nusually have e.g. subdirectories called mat, sky, scene, objects, and\nwould add all of them to the RAYPATH.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem whith file.oct", "sender": "Lars O.
