For info about what genskyvec is doing,\nyou should start with the man page, and then simply read the Perl code.\nBut I'd advise against a full rewrite; I think we just need to figure out\nwhat the problem is with the Perl script. We have found that Genskyvec\nfails on multiple XP machines, all running ActiveState Perl. I will try\nStrawberry Perl next, but I know I'm grasping at straws here.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/19/12 9:51 AM, \"Ryan Southall\" <R.Southall at brighton.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Python script", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CC2D9044.12816%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 10:26:19 -0600", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Python script"}
