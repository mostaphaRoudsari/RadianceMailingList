{"body": "\nHi Giulio, hi all,\n\nunfortunately it doesn't work out safely. In total I have many, many\ncases to look at (in total 40000 timesteps x 33 points x 2geometries)\nand there are still many cases, when rtrace doesn't catch the sun.\nSince these are calculations for an expertise, which is used for a\ntrial, I have to be absolutely sure not to miss any case...\n\nIs there any idea except calculating images ? Source subdivisions are\nunfortunately not possible when \"source\" is used...\n\nThanks!\n\nJan\n\n\n\nOn 07/24/2012 02:13 AM, Jan Wienold wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
