{"body": "\nHi Giulio,\n\nthanks!\n\nBoth solutions are a question of calculation time... but I use the\nsecond way now to be on the safe side (calculation of image) - even it\ntakes me much longer...For the evaluation I use evalglare, is pretty\nsimple to use for such cases.\n\nFor reflections I already did it in that way and I used a modified\nversion of evalglare (will put it online soon) to calculate the angle\nbetween different glare sources (in that case between reflection and\nsun), too. The only disadvantage is the long calculation time of several\ndays (1 image (ab0)+evaluation takes 6 sec -> 2.5 days on a single core\nfor one point..and I have 33 points and two geometries...).\n\nJan\n\nOn 07/24/2012 10:05 PM, giulio antonutto wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
