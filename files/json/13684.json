{"body": "\nHi Nassif,\nIt would be helpful to have more information about your scene and BSDF (and\nwhat is dds.bash??)\n\nI can think of two possible causes of your error:\n\n1 - One of the problems with the Window BSDF data is that they have low\nresolution.  The averaging of flux over a BSDF patch causes the direct\nsunlight to smear.  The resulting sun patch is bigger and less bright.\nThis is illustrated in figures 12 & 13 of this paper:\nhttp://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/4414.pdf\n\n2 - Using the BSDF material in a daylight coefficient simulation can under\nestimate illuminance from direct sun.  If your BSDF is for clear glass,\nthen it should be possible to improve it by setting ss to > 1 (like maybe 8\nor 10).  I think this works with rtcontrib...\n\nYou might also consider generating a high resolution tensor tree BSDF using\ngenBSDF.  It'll definitely help with problem 1, and would help with problem\n2 if your BSDF is clear glass.\n\nRegardless though, I'd suggest 3-phase method for anual simulations using\nBSDFs.  It is much better for non-specular glazing.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 16, 2012 at 12:16 AM, nassif nassif <nynassif at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120730/0afc453e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAOQvQdnCgz66A_AZOZ_nk3Y7L8W2psoeHSpaFVcrfbk-XY-FGg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Niwa0CEQ89OMFH-CDtM+cphO320sGycOGx4sN2KOKdCbuQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOQvQdnCgz66A_AZOZ_nk3Y7L8W2psoeHSpaFVcrfbk-XY-FGg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 16:53:11 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] parameters for dds (rtcontrib) using BSDFmaterial"}
