{"body": "\nI can't remember if I replied to this or not. I am old.\n\nAnyway, Thomas, RAYPATH is indeed set correctly. We are considering dropping support for WindowsXP at this point, seeing as how it's almost as old as I am, and these scripts work fine on Windows7 (soon to be supplanted by Windows8). The reason I replied to the list is because I'm curious:\n\nIs anyone running Radiance on WindowsXP anymore? Email me offlist (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov) if you have a sec, listers. Just trying to get a sense of how many XP/Radiance users are out there.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\nOn 7/20/12 11:31 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at googlemail.com<mailto:tbleicher at googlemail.com>> wrote:\n\nI think I had the same error during testing.
