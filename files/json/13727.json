Some information can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=859261\n\nAs a work around you can specify the command as\n\ngensky 3 21 12 | perl -S genskyvec.pl\n\nThis at least solves the problem of the empty pipe. It should work in a\nPython Popen command, too.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120720/7c07dd72/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Python script", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k0XiQLsJ-JX5iZoC4kJT+3_gWeKwbTz15iFJo5b3--RzA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<op.whpabbyl7lwvrx@localhost>", "<CC2D9044.12816%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Fri, 20 Jul 2012 11:48:57 +0200", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Python script"}
