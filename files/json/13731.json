{"body": "\nHi Imene\n\nThe RAYPATH environment variable tells the Radiance binaries where to\nsearch for files if they can't be found in the current directory. In your\ncase with the command\n\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad\n\nRadiance expects the file \"chair.rad\" in the current directory, that is the\ndirectory where you issue the \"oconv\" command. Since you have the chair.rad\nand table.rad files in a subdirectory called \"objects\" you should use the\nfollowing line to place your scene elements:\n\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 objects/chair.rad\n\nTry this first before you start to fiddle with the RAYPATH variable.\n\nBTW: A common way to organize your scene files is to keep all your geometry\nin a \"objects\" directory (and optionally a \"skies\" directory for sky files\nand so on). Then you create a single file \"scene.rad\" that only references\nthe files in the \"objects\" directory via \"!xform\" commands:\n\n!xform materials.rad\n!xform skies/sunny_sky.rad\n\n!xform objects/room.rad\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 objects/chair.rad\n!xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 objects/table.rad\n\n\nThen you only need the command\n\noconv scene.rad > scene.oct\n\nto create the octree file. If you want a differente scene you just copy the\nscene.rad file and add or remove whichever geometry you want to change.\n\nRegards\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120719/235bff30/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem whith file.oct", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k0g6hgsWRONKGSJUP9CobcoO+HGG7GR-F1sJYqSxzubxQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<5007CB71.1020607@gmx.net>", "<662874640.110851342692200823.JavaMail.www@wwinf7111>"], "datetime": "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 15:26:10 +0200", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problem whith file.oct"}
