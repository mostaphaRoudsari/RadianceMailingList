{"body": "\nHi Imene,\n\nThere are several way to accomplish this. If we assume that you have a\nseparate file for your chair object called \"simple_chair.rad\" with its\norigin at the lowest point midway between the front legs and facing\nalong positive X (for example), here are a few ways to place the chair\nor multiple copies of the chair in your scene.\n\nIn a new file called \"scene_chairs.rad\" you could use  xform as follows:\n\n!xform -rz 90 -t 10 0 0 simple_chair.rad\n!xform -rz 270 -t 10 5 0 simple_chair.rad\n\nThis should place two chairs (simple_chair.rad) 5 units apart from each\nother in Y located 10 units from the origin in X.\n\nHowever if you are going to do lots of repeated instances of the chair,\nit would be better to use real octree instances as these will save on\nmemory. To do this you need to do the following:\n\nStep 1: compile the chair object into a frozen octree - assumes that the\nmaterials are in a separate file\n\noconv -f mats.simple_chair.rad simple_chair.rad > simple_chair.oct\n\nNOTE that this creates what is known as a \"frozen\" octree which\nbasically means that the materials and geometry are all compiled\ntogether and changes to any of the base rad files will NOT\neffect the octree....\n\nStep 2: create a file called - \"simple_chair.instance.rad\" and input the\nfollowing\n\nvoid instance my_simple_chair_instance\n7 simple_chair.oct -s 1.0 -t 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0\n0\n\nStep 3: place your chair object (for example in scene_chairs.rad):\n\n!xform -rz 90 -t 10 0 0 -a 20 -t 2.5 0 0 simple_chair.instance.rad\n!xform -rz 270 -t 10 5 0 -a 20 -t 2.5 0 0 simple_chair.instance.rad\n\nassuming that I did this correctly this would create 2 rows (offset by\n10 units in X from the origin) of 20 chairs each facing each other at a\ndistance of 5 units in Y.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 7/16/2012 10:15 AM, imenslama at voila.fr wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120716/57aa1885/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] practical question about radiance", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<50042A8B.70803@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<6385175.72281342448119177.JavaMail.www@wwinf7108>"], "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 10:51:55 -0400", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] practical question about radiance"}
