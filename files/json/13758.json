{"body": "\nHi Ryan.\n\nInteresting that Blender is coming back to Radiance. I am following the\nPython API development but I'm still not sure it has all the bells and\nwhistles to make it worth the effort.\n\nRegarding your Popen problem: Do you have problems with other Perl scripts\nas well or is it only genskyvec.pl?\n\nI do remember that I had some issues with command lines and Popen on\nWindows when I was writing falsecolor2. It's mostly the correct quoting of\nthe arguments. I don't recall doing anything specific that solved my\nproblem, though.\n\nCan you test your code outside of Blender in plain Python or do you have\ntoo many dependencies on the Blender modules?\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Mon, Jul 16, 2012 at 12:14 PM, Ryan Southall\n<R.Southall at brighton.ac.uk>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120716/d03a7056/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Python script", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k1cBnaNuy9PC8fUKqq72KC-=G6Q3v9NdJU8R3xB6CZ=FQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<op.whjap11j7lwvrx@localhost>"], "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 13:01:34 +0200", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Python script"}
