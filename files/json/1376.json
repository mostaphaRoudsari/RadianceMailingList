I will give Bodypaint a try, but I doubt if\nit does generate surface normals from a file that doesn't have them.\nAnyways, I wonder if the perforate.cal could be changed to work at once\non surfaces without UV coordinates.\nWhen mapping pictures it goed well, since I (not really me:) changed a\nfew lines in picture.cal :\n\npic_u = U;  //was: pic_u = Px;\npic_v = V;   //was: pic_v = Py;\n\nI don't know why this works, but it does....\nIf something like this could be done in the perforate.cal file, that\nwould be nice,\n\n-Iebele\n\n\nGiulio Antonutto wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] perforate.ca", "tags": [], "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "datetime": "Wed Apr 13 16:54:17 2005"}
