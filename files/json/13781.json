{"body": "\nHallo Andy,\n\nthank you for your reply.\n\nI looked through the Tutorial you advised about. I realised the generated\nresults are for one day. In our office we are using the .EPW to generate\nthe results for the whole year. (as used in the tutorial in rtcontrib). Is\nit possible with BSDF somehow? if yes, Is there any hints or tips to insert\nthe .xml format generated by window7beta into the rtcontrib process?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nN.Nassif\n\nOn Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 6:21 PM, <\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120712/74559975/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "nassif nassif", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOQvQdkqk6Bskj18+4WGpd7vLesxzELgsAbb_j=HTYmF8h+Yxg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 09:46:20 +0200", "email": "nynassif at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF with rtcontrib"}
