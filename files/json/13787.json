{"body": "\nHi Imene\n\n\nSomewhere within the Radiance src tree, there is a materials file of\ntypical building materials, including spec and rough. This has been\nintegrated in the Colour Picker for Radiance which you can find here:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/colour_picker.shtml\nGo Chooser > Building Materials\n\nMulti-coloured materials are trickier and require some cal file. This\ncan be quite complicated to work out. Carsten Bauer developed some\nmindbogglingly complicated examples for granit and other materials.\nThey were somewhere on his Radzilla web site (which is no longer\nactively developed):\nhttp://www.cb-d.de/radzilla.html\n\nUnfortunately, all Radzilla download have been removed because the\ncode was getting too old. I might still have the Radzilla materials on\nmy hard disk at home. I shall try to get permission from Carsten and\nsend them to you, if you like. Please contact me off-list if you are\ninterested.\n\nDetermining spec and rough to any degree of accuracy is nighly\nimpossible. Your best bet is to do some test renders and compare them\nto physical samples of the materials that you are trying to match.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+dqh61rhNqhgSbT7_ULt2dJo9KLQg-jsZrucAA7pTvbnM18kg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 10:46:34 +0100", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] materials in radiance software"}
