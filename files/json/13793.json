{"body": "\nDear Radiance community,\n\nI'm just starting to use Radiance and I'm currently going through the tutorial. Right at the beginning when trying to view the sphere (page 14) using the following command \"objline objects/things.rad | x11meta\", all I get is a mesh without surfaces and an error saying:\n\n\"X connection to /tmp/launch-VcMFzD/org.x:0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).\"\n\nNow I'm not sure if the mesh is all that I'm in fact supposed to see at this stage but I think that this error message is not a good sign.\n\nAny thoughts on what this could mean and how to solve the problem?\n\nBest regards,\nMichael\n\nPS.: I'm running Radiance on Mac OS Snow Leopard using the latest snapshot of Radiance. I followed the installation instructions suggested  here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68\n\n--\nMichael Bannert, Dipl.-Psych.\nVision & Cognition Lab, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Univ. of T?bingen & BCCN T?bingen\nOtfried-M?ller-Str. 25, 72076 T?bingen, Germany\nPhone: +49 - (0)7071 / 29 - 89031\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120704/6eb8e5ef/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Michael Bannert", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<889C1F1F-BE59-4EE7-A1D5-6714DD188964@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 4 Jul 2012 18:49:51 +0200", "email": "mbannert at cin.uni-tuebingen.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Error: \"X connection to .... broken (explicitkill or server shutdown)"}
