{"body": "\n\nThis is really just at the idea stage, but what we were thinking about\nis an October 2002 workshop in Fribourg, Switzerland (an hour and a half\nfrom Geneva or about 2 hours from Zurich if I remember right).  Raphael\nCompagnon has held three introductory Radiance tutorials over the past\nseveral years, and a few participants have asked for something more\ndetailed as a follow-on.  His intro materials have been available in the\nreference directory on the Radiance website for a while, but he may have\na more recent update for us (Raphael?)  We haven't figured out whether\nto set it up as a tutorial or a workshop or a bit of both, where people\ncould present the work they are doing as well as learn some more\nadvanced techniques.  We're just asking for input at this point, and\nlooking for interested parties.  We'd probably want to recover\nsufficient costs for me to fly out there and perhaps one or two other\nRadiance experts, but I haven't investigated all the costs at this point\nand we need a better idea of how many participants, etc.  Once I get\nsome feedback, we'll start to flesh out some kind of agenda.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance workshop idea", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1EB9C912-F823-11D5-9E99-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 23 Dec 2001 20:02:59 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance workshop idea"}
