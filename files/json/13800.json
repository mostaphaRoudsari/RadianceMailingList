{"body": "\nHi Im?ne,\n\nthere are several options. One is to write to dxf, which is partially\nsupported by several converters such as dxf2rad. When modeling, you\nshould not use solids - besides that, you would need to check for the\nspecific converter about supported primitives. 3dfaces usually should\nwork.\n\nUnfortunately there seams to be little to no support for exporting 3d\nfiles in current Autocad releases. In the past there were 3ds and obj,\nbut both got removed as far as I know. So I would probably choose\nanother software if possible.\n\nThere are export options from almost any 3d modeling tool to obj, which\nis very well supported. Can you use Rhino, Blender, Maya, Sketchup, ...?\nAll these would probably work better.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<989437904.81031341236172246.JavaMail.www@wwinf7126>", "sender": "Lars O.
