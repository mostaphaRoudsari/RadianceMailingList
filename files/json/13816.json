{"body": "\n\nHi,\n\nI would like to thank you for your prompt response.\n\nAll the best,\n\nVirginie Grosdemouge.\n\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Virginie,\n\n\n\nfor the reflector to be considered properly with direct sun\nexposure, you need to model its surface using the mirror modifier.\n\n\n\nI gave an example (as I was not sure about the way how I derived the\nvalues from a metal surface) earlier this month. Subject was\n\"virtual light sources with mirror & diffuse component\", date\n2.8.2012.\n\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\nI have tried to model a\nlightshelf inside a single room in order to verify its\nimpact but It seems that Daysim consider this element like\nan obstacle to light more than a reflecting object. Is\nthere any simple way to model a typical lightshelf?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120814/ccbb3a05/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling of a lightshelf", "sender": "grobe at gmx.ne", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB104-W445CD7DCBEEA75FD7DE875EEB70@phx.gbl>", "refs": ["<DUB104-W510CE01A7162657AE8014FEEB70@phx.gbl>,", "<502A0527.1060801@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Tue, 14 Aug 2012 09:58:31 +0200", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Modelling of a lightshelf"}
