The following result is the closest approximation for Radiance:\n\nvoid metal Copper\n0\n0\n5 0.926278 0.636980 0.534138 1 0\n\nIt assumes the surface is clean and perfectly polished with no dust or scratches.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120822/6ae946e2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reflectance of different material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F46DFFD4-9736-4BEE-B00A-F438EAA1E55A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1345635083.47677.YahooMailNeo@web171205.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 22 Aug 2012 08:09:23 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reflectance of different material"}
