{"body": "\nOur sincere apologies for this!!  Something went wrong with the mailman server when we added the new lists Rob mentioned, and a bunch of us got hundreds of duplicate e-mails in our inboxes.  Daniel Fuller seems to have resolved the issue, although I'm still not sure what happened.\n\nFor the future, it's a good idea for people to refrain from posting to the list if something goes wrong, since it only adds to the noise.  It's best to write to me personally if you spot a problem.\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120816/33202f96/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<1345105915.22354.YahooMailNeo@web161504.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<13A7678C-72BC-4D02-903F-BC12ACC2EF40@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CC516D37.13745%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<1345105915.22354.YahooMailNeo@web161504.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 16 Aug 2012 15:02:43 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New Lists: radiance-daysim andradiance-openstudio"}
