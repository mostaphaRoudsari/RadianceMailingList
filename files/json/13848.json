{"body": "\nHi Virginie!\n\n\nThe trans material is for translucent materials. Getting its parameters\ndefined is rather complex and one of the frequently asked questions.\n\nFor a typical, clear glazing, glass is the option you should use! It is\nan approximation, as not a solid glass volume is considered but the\nglass pane is approximated as a zero-thickness pane of given transmissivity.\n\nIf you do not have manufacturer data available, download the optics tool\nfrom lbnl, which takes values of the international glazing database\n(igdb) to set up your glazing made of glass panes, coatings, air gaps.\nThis tool will offer an export option to Radiance, which will be a glass\ndefinition for a typical clear glazing.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Materials definition", "sender": "Lars O.
