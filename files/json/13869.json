{"body": "\nWow, this looks like a fantastic program(me)! Some new names as well as old reliables. Excellent. I'm with Mostapha and Chris, if this could be webcast that would be awesome, but failing that I'll settle for the slide decks eventually. Congrats to Nicholas for getting a fully packed schedule! Seems to me that the Radiance community is as active and vibrant as ever.\n\n- Rob\n\n________________________________________\nSent: Monday, September 03, 2012 8:58 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nP.S.

I understand there are about 50 registrants at this point, and we may be reaching venue capacity as well!\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Full workshop ahead!", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA3225FDC07A6C@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<D36E3230-118E-457B-A4FD-C7E8E92F226B@gmail.com>,", "<2901824C-6EE6-4508-A254-D1EC1DD21730@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 09:09:49 -0600", "email": "Gregory J.
