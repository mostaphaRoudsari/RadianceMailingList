{"body": "\nWow, thanks for all your feedback!\n\nSeems like the lightjet is an interesting machine.\nGenerally I'm on par with Jack, I share his view on quality / cost effective\nprinting.\nI had to think about the idea of colout fidelity seeing the art work of Yves\nKlein.\nIts interesting to see art which main focus is pure colour.\nThe interesting thing here is that with Radiance, it really isn't difficult\nat all to produce this pure kind of colour, your just not being able to get\nit out of your machine. I've been printing with Durst Lambda on light boxes,\nwhich is quite an excellent technique, but in the light of pure pigment\ncolours, everything just looks faint. Hence the quest for 32 bit floating\npoint output. Looking at the VIPS software\n(Supports a large range of numeric types Images can contain 8-, 16- and\n32-bit integers, signed or unsigned, 32- and 64-bit floats, and 64- and\n128-bit complex numbers, http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/vips.php) it seems\nthat this issue addressed here is relevant.\nWhat good is all that data if your not able to get its full output. Actually\nI tried to be in touch with the developers at Durst, to give them the\nstunning idea of making a floating point Lamba driver for free, alas, no\nresponse. Looks like this is a dead end so far. Thanks for all your\nresponses!\n\nJelle.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041202/98bc6206/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20041202173102.3F6E62001450@mwinf0901.wanadoo.fr>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec  2 18:31:10 2004", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] printing floating point images"}
