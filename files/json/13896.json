{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\n\nAppending the $RAYPATH to the end should not break anything. If it is\nnot set, nothing will be appended, that it is.\n\nIf you really typed Export as above, with capital E, that may be the\nproblem.\n\nI am not sure about the syntax. On bash I would not first define the\nvariables and than export them to the environment, but directly set the\nenvironment variables as\n\nexport PATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH\nexport RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH\n\nBut both may be valid.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FAQ - Known problems", "sender": "Lars O.
