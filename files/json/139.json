{"body": "\nThank you for releasing a new version of Radiance.  I will try compiling\nit on my alpha this weekend and post my results :-)\n\nRegarding a Radiance workshop, I am somewhat interested.  Approximately\nwhere and when would such a workshop be held?  I am guessing the\nworkshop would be held in the Berkeley or SF area, but could you be more\nspecific about the time: september, october, november?  Also, how\naccessible would this workshop be for newbies?  Raytracing is my hobby,\nso I am more interested in just creating images than architectural\nlighting (I am currently working my way through your book RENDERING WITH\nRADIANCE).\n\nOnce again, thanks for updating Radiance.\n\nDaniel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Joycelyn Maddux", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3C24256E.B235BCB6@earthlink.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat, 22 Dec 2001 00:17:18 -0600", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance 3.4 beta and Conference"}
