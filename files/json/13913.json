{"body": "\nDear colleagues:\n\nSome of might be interested in the Cambridge Solar Map, a new interactive map to show Cambridge property owners how much electricity can be produced on their rooftops from solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, how the financial investment will pay off and how much pollution will be reduced (http://www.cambridgema.gov/solar/). The map is based on Radiance/Daysim simulations of about 17,000 rooftops with the 3D model derived form GIS and LiDAR data. Technical details on the map can be found here<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/CambridgeSolarMap>.\n\nThose of you in the Greater Boston Area are very welcome to join us on Wednesday, Oct 3,  at 6PM in the Cambridge Main Library on Broadway for the 'official release' of the map. The city has invited a number of solar installers who will be showcasing their products and services. Starting at about 6.30 PM we will have an hour of presentations.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120930/e91111f9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Christoph Reinhart", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E8017E9FF@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 30 Sep 2012 00:29:36 +0000", "email": "tito_ at mit.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Cambridge Solar Map"}
