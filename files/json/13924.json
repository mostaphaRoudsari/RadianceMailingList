{"body": "\nHi Randolph,\nI use an Ocean Optics USB 2000+ spectrometer. It incredibly samples\nevery 1/3 of a nanometer. I particularly appreciate the SpectraSuite\nsoftware needed to drive it. Very useful to determine CCT etc. You can use\nMGF tools to convert its text data into a Radiance format. I also\npurchased a reference lamp module to keep it calibrated. Used it today in\nfact, to sample a 97+ CRI LED.\n\nHere are a few lines from a lamp file..\n.\n.\n419.34\t1.51324047E-6\n419.71\t1.52070443E-6\n420.08\t1.58661166E-6\n.\n\n.\n\n\nRob Shakespeare\n\n\n\nOn 9/20/12 7:10 PM, \"Randolph Fritz\" <rfritz at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<967C32E2-7D20-4104-83CD-EECC43EC4BC2@lbl.gov>", "sender": "Shakespeare, Robert A.", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2A1FD18147050B498AC9724AD18ADB3D377C4D62@IU-MSSG-MBX104.ads.iu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 21 Sep 2012 02:33:08 +0000", "email": "shakespe at indiana.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Ocean Optics Spectrophotometer Data andRadiance?"}
