{"body": "\nThanks Andy! I recommend VLC player for all your codec brain damage issues.

The new files play using iTunes, quicktime or various other *good* media players on windows.  They still don't play with windows media explorer (unless you've managed to install the right codec).  I've also updated a few of the presentations over the last couple of days.\n\nThe trouble with posting materials quickly is that revisions become necessary...\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Mon, Sep 17, 2012 at 10:59 AM, Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:amcneil at lbl.gov>> wrote:\nAll,\nI've just uploaded the last of the presentations, including replacing presentation that had pdf export artifacts.  Greg's photos have also been posted.  If anyone else has photos they'd like to share, send them to me and I can add them.\n\nThere are now zip files so you can download all the presentations at once.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Sep 16, 2012 at 9:45 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\nThanks to all for hosting this event, attending the event, and for sharing the event with those of us who were unable to attend.
