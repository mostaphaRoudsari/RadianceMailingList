{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nI've re-encoded all the audio files from the workshop because some people\nhad problems listening to them on windows PCs.  The new files play using\niTunes, quicktime or various other *good* media players on windows.  They\nstill don't play with windows media explorer (unless you've managed to\ninstall the right codec).
