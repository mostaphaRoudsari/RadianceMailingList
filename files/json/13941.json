{"body": "\nHi Aksel!\n\nThe most important is to check that RAYPATH includes all needed directories. And that these actually contain the libraries you'd expect there. Type\n\necho \"$RAYPATH\"\n\nand then find whether at least rayinit.cal is in one of the returned directories.\n\nAbout x11meta, I am not sure how well it works in general. There seam to be several pitfalls with the meta-utilities.\n\nHm, and thanks for reminding me that I started setting up a FAQ-system and somehow did not really complete the job so far ;)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FAQ - Known problems", "sender": "Lars O.
