{"body": "\nDear Radiance Users,\n\nWe have reached capacity for talks at the upcoming Radiance workshop in Copenhagen, which includes a seminar day covering DAYSIM, BSDFs, Optimization, and r(t)contrib on Sept. 12th.  The workshop on the 13th and 14th also looks to be very interesting, and we hope you can attend.  However, we are no longer accepting abstract submissions, as there isn't room in the schedule to add anything more.\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you in just over a week.  (Yikes!  I had better start preparing my talks!)\n\nBest,\n-Greg (& Nicolas)\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Gregory J.
