{"body": "\nHi Folks,\n\nJust a quick note to let you know that we have updated the Radiance installers to coincide with the new 0.9.0 release of OpenStudio.\n\nRadiance installers here:\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\nNews on the new OpenStudio release here:\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov/content/openstudio-090-release\n\nI tried statically linking to the tiff libraries so hopefully this version of the Mac installer will work on 10.5, I just don't have a 10.5 system to test it out on. Let us know!\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<295249CD-8881-4000-906B-21D88D44FFBC@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 08:49:58 -0600", "email": "rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New OpenStudio Version, New Radiance Installers"}
