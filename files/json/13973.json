{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\nI'm trying to use Daysim to simulate different configurations for a dynamic\nshading system. My understanding is that Daysim produces daylight and\nelectric lighting data for the whole year. So my intention is to create a\nseparate Daysim project for each case. And then assemble the 12 monthly\ndata manually to get one *.ill file for the whole year.\nDoes anyone know how can i use the new *.ill file to generate daylight and\nelectric lighting data for the whole year ? is there a way to import it\ninto daysim to show the results? if not, how can i do that manually ?\n\nThanks a lot,\nBelal Abboushi\n\n--\n*Belal Khalid Abboushi*\n\nM.Sc.Arch Candidate - Design & Energy Conservation\n\nCollege of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nThe University of Arizona - U.S.A.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121003/84d8635e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Belal Khalid Abboushi", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAJ6rF0bNpqH6EpiNAQcftq8FY+e1gpf=5ouV-gAv2K1hpGxRvw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 12:58:20 -0700", "email": "babboushi at email.arizona.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daysim monthly daylight and electric lightingdata"}
