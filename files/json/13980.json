{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have a couple of Radiance images which are almost the same. These images are combined using pcomb:\n\npcomb img01.hdr img02.hdr img03.hdr ? > combined.hdr\n\nUsing pcomb this way, the resulting image has higher radiance values as the input images. What I want is that the resulting image has the same radiance values as the input files. How can I do that?\n\nAny hints are most welcome,\n\nCheers,\n\n- iebele\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Iebele", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D913B06F-045B-4504-A2FF-5B1B24F49774@iebele.nl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat, 6 Oct 2012 22:15:24 +0300", "email": "iabel at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pcomb question"}
