{"body": "\nHi Shailan!\nThat is what gendaylit is typically used for. Please check the manpage\nat http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/gendaylit.1.html :\n\n\" /Gendaylit/ produces a RADIANCE scene description based on an angular\ndistribution of the daylight sources (direct+diffuse) for the given\natmospheric conditions (direct and diffuse component of the solar\nradiation), date and local standard time. The default output is the\nradiance of the sun (direct) and the sky (diffus) integrated over the\nvisible spectral range (380-780 nm). We have used the calculation of the\nsun's position and the ground brightness models which were programmed in\n/gensky.
