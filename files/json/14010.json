{"body": "\nClaus, thanks for the detailed explanation.\n\nRE: > Your sky images naturally only cover a hemisphere. If done\ncorrectly in HDRshop your env maps when remapped to angular mapping\nwould result in everything BELOW the horizon, below the xy-plane,\nwould return black.\n\nI found sample sky probes with this mapping on\nhttp://projects.ict.usc.edu/graphics/skyprobes/\n\nWhen i initially looked at these images, i had assumed they were\nacquired using a chrome sphere (with the ground portion cropped)\nrather than a fisheye lens, due to their \"half-sphere\" appearance.\n\nI'll give these a try using Paul's .cal file and method. Assuming that\nworks, i will try to transform my hemispherical sky images to match\nthis angular mapping using HDRshop.\n\nThanks for taking a break from vacation to push this along!\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Oct 15, 2012 at 12:40 PM, Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen\n<cbm at create.aau.dk> wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<7AEAEFDD-D8B6-40E4-88A1-49263982A5D2@create.aau.dk>", "sender": "kyle konis", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAzVHq3DOc25GXBOiH=hyrvvdjGgfom06_y3NwUbb5rGXemDOQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAAzVHq2=j=eLM-0r1wb+GSNDxYKApeyi1tHmhLz2Ejj6=Bb+6w@mail.gmail.com>", "<91355210-820E-408D-ADB4-C3DEDDE0EEA1@create.aau.dk>", "<CAAzVHq3yNs=DCg0K2i6Y7_cJ5sScXPRxtBVXcKSiuZJsoZVrSQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<7AEAEFDD-D8B6-40E4-88A1-49263982A5D2@create.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Mon, 15 Oct 2012 13:18:15 -0700", "email": "kskonis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Attempt to illuminate Paul Debevec'srnl_scene.rad with a hemispherical HDR image of the sky"}
