{"body": "\nHello:\n\nWhat is the definition of \"front\" and \"back\" transmission in the BSDF xml\nfile? I  test using BSDF files of Window 6 and genBSDF,  and find that it\nuses \"Transmission Back\" to calculate radiance. \"genBSDF +forward -backward\ntest.rad > test.xml\" gave zero illuminance.  So \"back\"  denotes from\noutside to inside (towards inside the room)?  that is, the incident ray\nfalls on the outside window surface?\n\nHowever, the three-phase daylight coefficient method  tutorial mentions\nthat Radiance uses \"front transmission\" data. In addition, in source code:\nbsdf.c, line 1343:\n\n# line 1343\nif (!strcasecmp(ezxml_txt(ezxml_child(wdb,\n\"WavelengthDataDirection\")),\n\"Transmission Front\"))\nbreak;\n\nIt looks using \"transmission front\".\n\nWhich (front or back) transmission does Radiance use?\n\nThanks,\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121015/635605ac/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwpKsKQfax7D4Qd8xR8E6YY_OowtNaXs0=0w83A52rtK8A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 15 Oct 2012 23:49:42 -0400", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] front and back transmission in BSDF"}
