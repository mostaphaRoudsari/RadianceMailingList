{"body": "\nThanks to Greg and Rob,\n\nTurns out it was a Windows OS issue (surprise surprise). Just to share what\nI learned with the list - Windows can have certain permissions issues that\nprevent Radiance from running correctly. We also found a weird Registry\nvalue (yikes!) that was the main culprit.\n\nAdding a \".\" to my path also may have solved my problem - in any case I'm\nkeeping it in there for good measure. Now to do some scene rendering...\n\nCheers,\nAlex Krickx\n\n*\n*\n\n*Alex Krickx, LEED AP*\nProject Engineer**\n\n*________________________________*****\n\nI N T E G R A L****\n\n*                         ** **GROUP*****\n\n** **\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247****\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com\nwww.integralgroup.com****\n\n** **\n\n*DEEP GREEN Engineering.*\n\n*_______________________________*\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 18, 2012 at 10:08 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121018/a43739a7/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems with RAD", "sender": "Alex Krickx", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAJhox8RDvLcHVMdQz=pWjZbaPaxNKjh4ZZnDrXJPH8w6OaT70w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAJhox8Q-f8VWdy=3YfsP1BsOQG6oPVi6cd8CS_iw5ps4rFVO_g@mail.gmail.com>", "<CCA58BF8.15EF2%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CAJhox8QJYoW1VqXs-7zF4dX7_RdSbnZkDPA5Cj2_46tZKkwnWQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<E1DD7FCE-A250-4EBE-AD0B-E16D78B9AD5B@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 16:40:20 -0700", "email": "akrickx at integralgroup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems with RAD"}
