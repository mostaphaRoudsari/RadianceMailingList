Reflectances are 0.8 0.8\n0.8.\n2.Room dimensions are 10x10x10 and the center is positioned in the (0,0,0).\n3.In the middle of the room is placed a luminaire, with indirect light\ndistribution. It is oriented toward ceiling, so workplane illuminance has\nonly indirect component.\n\nI found somewhere in the mail archives a command for illuminance calculation\nfor a grid of points. For my testing room the command is:\ncnt 6 6| rcalc -e '$1=$1*2-5; $2=$2*2-5; $3=-4; $4=0; $5=0; $6=1'|\nrtrace -h -oov -I -ab 2 room.oct| rcalc -e '$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=$3;\n$4=47.4*$4+120*$5+11.6*$6'>illuminance.txt\n\nWhich value is the most appropriate for -ab parameter? Should I also use\nsome other ambient parameters?\nI've tried with different -ab values and results are ascending, so I don't\nknow which result is the most accurate.\n\nPurpose of this calculations is to compare values from Radiance with values\nobtained form \"Infinite Plane-Exitance Difference Method\" approved from\nIESNA for calculation of indirect illuminance.\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija", "datetime": "Sat Apr 23 12:00:54 2005"}
