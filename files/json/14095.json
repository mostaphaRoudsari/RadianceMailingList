{"body": "\nThank you very much, Greg!\n\nFollowing your advice, the simulation time is reduced from 9 min to just 3\nmin !\n\nThe bash script is:\ncat ./sensor.txt | rtrace -I -h -w -oov -u- -aa 0.1 -ab 6 -ad 1024 -ar 256\n-as 512 -af ./ambient_file.amb -n 8 ./Octree_files_.oct > ./Results.txt\n(I'm very eager to test it on our HPC later ! )\n\nI think this can be one of the FAQs of Radiance.\n\nThank you again! And have a nice weekend!\n\n-Ji\n\n\nOn Friday, October 19, 2012, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121019/fb27fac6/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<C6138FF4-C728-4D00-A062-5F3CAC577D6B@lmi.net>", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD83LVKPTcpatGty8UcX4N=dZNwZGpLE3u8kb75Cvk0eig9siw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD83LVJRUQ1v+Y4euFZPp0OOMmgJipbcM31OaHovuTsj8pVUcA@mail.gmail.com>", "<C6138FF4-C728-4D00-A062-5F3CAC577D6B@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 23:49:16 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] why the rtrace \"-n\" option doesn't reducesimulation time ?"}
