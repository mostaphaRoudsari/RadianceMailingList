{"body": "\nHi Tom,\n\nI'm not sure why using a mirror as its own alternate would do anything\n-- the code says it should be the same as not specifying an\nalternate....\n\nThat said, there's little point is specifying a mirror material for a\nmesh surface.  It should behave just like trans at that point -- it\nwon't create any virtual sources, which is presumably why you would use\n'mirror' in the first place.  Virtual sources only get created for\nplanar surface types:  'polygon' & 'ring'.  Any other surface type\n(including meshes) just get treated normally.\n\nFor a 90% reflective material with 10% transmission, the following\n'trans' should work:\n\nvoid trans mirror_mat\n0\n0\n7 .92 .92 .92 .9 0 1 1\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Transparent Mirror Material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CFFA2DB0-4550-11D9-81F1-000A95BB392A@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Dec  3 18:29:45 2004", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Transparent Mirror Material"}
