{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI am having a weird issue with the RAD command. Radiance is running on my\nmachine: I checked my scene before and had no issue with using oconv on my\nscenes and then using rvu to check out the octree. But once I set set up my\n.rif file and run \"rad summer.rif\" I get the following error:\n\noconv mod3.rad summer_sky.rad > summer.oct\noconv: system - cannot open scene file \"mod3.rad\": No such file or directory\nrad: error generating octree\nsummer.oct removed\n\nIf I change the filename in my .rif for mod3.rad I get a different error\n(\"no such file\") so it should be pointing to the right file. Any\nsuggestions? I'm running radiance on a Windows7 machine. I'm pretty sure I\ndownloaded the files from NREL's openstudio site. Any suggestions? I've\nattached my files - they're pretty simple.\n\nThanks,\nAlex Krickx\n\n*\n*\n\n*Alex Krickx, LEED AP*\nProject Engineer**\n\n*________________________________*****\n\nI N T E G R A L****\n\n*                         ** **GROUP*****\n\n** **\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247****\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com\nwww.integralgroup.com****\n\n** **\n\n*DEEP GREEN Engineering.*\n\n*_______________________________*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121018/3f3d0cd4/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: mod3.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 12810 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121018/3f3d0cd4/attachment.obj>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: summer.rif\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 375 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121018/3f3d0cd4/attachment-0001.obj>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: summer_sky.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 357 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121018/3f3d0cd4/attachment-0002.obj>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Alex Krickx", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAJhox8Q-f8VWdy=3YfsP1BsOQG6oPVi6cd8CS_iw5ps4rFVO_g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 09:22:02 -0700", "email": "akrickx at integralgroup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems with RAD"}
