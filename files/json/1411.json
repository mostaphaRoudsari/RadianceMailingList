I recently installed the .deb\npackages for radiance, but I'm having some problems with the oconv command.\nFor some reason bash can't find it. I followed the instructions for\ninstalling the .deb files <a\nhref=http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/packages/>here\n<a>, and did not see any mention of oconv. Is this a separate package I need\nto install? Is there another PATH that needs to be set? Any help you could\noffer would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nDave Maino\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050423/b94a221a/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
