{"body": "\n\nOops ... I didn't notice two threads were involved:-)\n\nYep, panoramic conversion tools in HDRshop are second to none.\n\nAt the conceptual level: it makes absolutely no difference what geometry your light probe is mapped to. It can be sphere, box, super quad, tetrahedron, whatever, as long as it totally encompasses the scene.\n\nThe .cal you had in your other post would work for any geometry provided you had the correct mapping (image format) of the env map.\n\nThat cal file is called whenever a light ray intersects the sky box (it is a box in Debevecs example, but could just as well be a sphere). The cal file takes the coordinates of that intersection and converts it to a spherical coordinate and subsequently transforms this spherical direction to a look-up in an angular mapping of the env map.\n\nTherefor it does not make any difference what geometry you are using because it is just a proxy geometry used to generate some intersection of which only the directions, not distances, are relevant. Hence the requirement for a big box in Debvecs example. Had the object/scene to be illuminated been 10000 by 10000 units large the box would have had to be an order of magnitude larger than that at least.\n\nYour sky images naturally only cover a hemisphere. If done correctly in HDRshop your env maps when remapped to angular mapping would result in everything BELOW the horizon, below the xy-plane, would return black.\n\nIf you go ahead a try to make your own cal file that suits your cropped fish eye images then you don't have to worry about the black corners of the square image outside the spherical projection of the sky. Those pixels would never be looked up because they correspond to impossible ray directions.\n\nAs you can see (also from the typos) I am writing from my iPod as I am on vacation. I may be able to provide more direct technical assistance once I'm back in my office next week. I can probably find some image examples and a cal file we can tweak to your needs.\n\n\nBest\nClaus\n\nSent from my iPod\n\nOn 15/10/2012, at 19.32, \"kyle konis\" <kskonis at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAAzVHq3yNs=DCg0K2i6Y7_cJ5sScXPRxtBVXcKSiuZJsoZVrSQ@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Claus_Br=F8ndgaard_Madsen?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7AEAEFDD-D8B6-40E4-88A1-49263982A5D2@create.aau.dk>", "refs": ["<CAAzVHq2=j=eLM-0r1wb+GSNDxYKApeyi1tHmhLz2Ejj6=Bb+6w@mail.gmail.com>", "<91355210-820E-408D-ADB4-C3DEDDE0EEA1@create.aau.dk>,", "<CAAzVHq3yNs=DCg0K2i6Y7_cJ5sScXPRxtBVXcKSiuZJsoZVrSQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 15 Oct 2012 19:40:16 +0000", "email": "cbm at create.aau.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Attempt to illuminate Paul Debevec'srnl_scene.rad with a hemispherical HDR image of the sky"}
