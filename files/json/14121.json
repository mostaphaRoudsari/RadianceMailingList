{"body": "\nDear All,\n\nI was wondering if anyone had ever tried to generate a sky description\nfor radiance based on the 'Practical Analytic Model for Daylight'\nsuggested by Preetham et al.\nParticularly I was wondering if anyone tried to solve the equations in\nsuch a way that (like the Perez sky model in Gendaylit) all parameter\ncan be derived from a standard weather file and the turbidity calculated\nfrom the ratio of direct and diffuse illuminace (or irradiance)\nI seem to remember the GenUtah sky by Mark Stock went some way in this\ndirection but the format of inputs wasn't amenable to submit climatic\ndata.\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\n\nRegards,\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Preetham sky in Radiance", "sender": "Giovanni Betti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C309A67673@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": ["<CAAzVHq2=j=eLM-0r1wb+GSNDxYKApeyi1tHmhLz2Ejj6=Bb+6w@mail.gmail.com>", "<91355210-820E-408D-ADB4-C3DEDDE0EEA1@create.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Mon, 15 Oct 2012 10:19:40 +0100", "email": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Preetham sky in Radiance"}
