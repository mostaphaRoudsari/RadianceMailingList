{"body": "\nHi Per!\n\nThis is a translucent, diffusing panel. There have been lots of\ndiscussions on this on the mailing list, as well as a bunch of\npresentations on workshops and even papers. The basic answer would be -\nuse the trans material in Radiance.\n\nHowever, the material model for trans is very generic, while translucent\npanels are made applying very different approaches. There is volume\nscattering, scattering by etching / sanding / ... a surface (outer or\ninner), laminating films on or in between panes, ... and all show\ndifferent characteristics. In your case, it is probably volume\nscattering, so I would guess reflection to have a strong specular peak\ndue to the clear, smooth surface, with a strong diffuse component from\nlight scattered back, and probably a nice diffuse transmission. However,\nit is difficult to know before having any data on it. Can you see a\nlight source through it, when holding it in fron of e.g. a strong lamp?\nOr does the brightness appear more or less flat? Peter is offering\nmeasurements using his goniophotometer, as well as others do. Christoph\nReinhart described modeling a translucent panel in his paper:\n\nReinhart C F, Andersen M, \"Development and validation of a Radiance\nmodel for a translucent panel\", Energy and Buildings 38:7 pp. 890-904, 2006\n\nwhich can be found at EPFL:\n\nhttp://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/88112/files/Development%20and%20validation%20of%20a%20Radiance%20model.pdf\n\nand presented on a workshop:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2005-montreal/PDF/TranslucentPanelValidation.pdf\n\nSo a wide field to work on... Cheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121010/e6821bca/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to describe a diffuse illuminating pane?", "sender": "Lars O.
