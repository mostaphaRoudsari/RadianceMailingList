{"body": "\nDear Shailan,\n\nit will be difficult to help you with this:\n\n1) We do not really know the problem. What means different results - are\nwe talking about 1000%, 10%, 0.1%?\n\n2) We do not know the scene (model) and simulation paramaters. Do you\nuse a mirror (secondary light source), is direct sun considered, are you\nmodeling the sun (if it is existing in the model) by a small light\nsource or as contribution to Tregenza patches...? You attached some\n.eco-files, which probably can be opened in Ecotec, but as a Radiance\nuser I cannot even open those.\n\nSo my advice: Give a really clear description of the problem, and\nprovide us with information to reproduce it. E.g. a Radiance scene\ndescription together with the parameters you are using.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] different results", "sender": "Lars O.
