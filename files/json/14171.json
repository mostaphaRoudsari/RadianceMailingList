{"body": "\nHi Shailan,\n\nyou did not make the model available, so this is all guess-work. By the\nway, as Greg mentioned, we do not attach files on this email list,\ninstead use some web- or ftp-space and embed a link into your mail, please.\n\nWhat you had sent were the parameters used processing the model using\nRadiance tools (collected in rif-files for rad, the control program for\nscene processing). The only interesting difference I found in there was\nthe scene extent. While I cannot find out whether my assumption is true\nor not, as I do not have access to the model, a different scene extent\n(geometry) could point us to a difference in the model geometry. I have\nno idea how the two rif-files were created, but if the software doing so\ndid a good job, then one model starts at x=1 while the other starts at\nx=2. Not exactly identical models.\n\nMaybe you find a way to put your model onto a ftp or website so that\nothers can have a look at it. Aside, you could use objline or objview or\nany kind of scene previewer, rotate a bit, and check that there are no\nobstructions in front of one model's facade or any unwanted differences.\nYou can also use getbbox on both radfiles - the bounding box for two\nidentical geometries should be the same...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] different results", "sender": "Lars O.
