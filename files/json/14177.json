{"body": "\nHi Shailan,\n\nYou need to give more details.  Is this a mirrored light shelf, and what material does it use?\n\nThere is no \"minimum size\" for sampling in Radiance.  However, depending on your scene and your rendering parameters, errors may increase as a bright, important surface gets relatively smaller and it may be necessary to adjust some parameters to compensate.\n\nWithout an image or any other information about your scene, it is impossible to be of help.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] reflector size", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D5D611C2-FF8D-44CD-A012-D65073DD9D68@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CABNGNZ+h_DROWEFET6Onh6vpKJU-9x_cU3f6_vw72rig8n9Rgg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 12 Nov 2012 09:38:49 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] reflector size"}
