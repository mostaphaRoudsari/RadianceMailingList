{"body": "\nI hope this is the correct list for users of Radiance through Ecotect.\n\nI am trying to calculate DGI for a specific camera view - position.\nI calculate the luminance using Radiance through Ecotect. Then the\ngenerated pic file I copy it in the command prompt starting file. There I\ncopy the following command that is the ulim\nthat is: fl2cd(v)=3.426*v;cd2fl(v)=0.292*v;ulim(La)=fl2cd(10^(5.731+(log10(cd2fl(La))+5)*(0.3376+(log10(cd2fl(La))+5)*0.0189)-6));\n\nThen I Type the following in the command prompt for my file that is called\n(ex2)\n\nfindglare -p ex2_c1.pic -t 100000|glarendx -h -t vert_ill|rcalc -f\nulim.cal -e '$1=ulim($2/PI)'\n\nThen I get the following message:\nfindglare: picture read error\n'$1=ulim($2/PI)'\n^ illegal variable name\n\nDo you have any idea why this is happening?\n\nThank you in advance\n\nMAria\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121113/a16c906b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Maria Mandalaki", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CALMqCJUKu_PzYrXuj15YrwbMg1W5xJp6BeH+dSpMXEA5XyZ20w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 09:58:12 +0200", "email": "mamand at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Calculate DGI with Radiance through Ecotect"}
