Assuming you know the lamp type used and its lumen output, the\nmaterial the fibers and end piece will be made of, the length you'll need\n(which shouldn't be too hard to estimate if you know where the box is\nlocated and where the fibers terminate), and an approximate shape for the\nend piece, you should be able to put together a fairly accurate distribution\nthat takes into account losses in the fibers, box, and end piece. TracePro\nwill allow you to export the distribution to an IES file which you can then\nuse in radiance. Depending on how accurate you want to get this can take you\nanywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours to put together.\n\nI'm not familiar with other ray-tracing/luminaire design programs like\nTracePro, but I'm sure there are more out there that allow you to do the\nsame thing.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nDave Maino\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] fiber optics?", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
