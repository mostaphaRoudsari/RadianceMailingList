{"body": "\nHello Radiancers,\n\nI am a new Radiance user/developer, and I am working on the calculation of\nSolar Heat Gain through complex fenestration systems. I started learning\nRadiance some time ago, and just an hour ago, a pretty obvious doubt came\nto my mind:\n\nIf RADIANCE uses the RGB optical properties (that is, visible spectrum, I\nsuppose); how comes that it calculates the Radiance instead of Illuminance?\nIf the materials change the spectrum of the radiation in every bounce, how\nis it possible to just use the classic \"179*(0,265*R+0,67*G+0,065*B)\" to\ncompute the illuminance?\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\nGerm?n Molina\n\nPS: Sorry to bother with rookie questions, but I am the only person in my\nUniversity using RADIANCE.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121128/ae8c6b17/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4+ZRgssd_L7sTJH=mvoVmV-DNrFHJ7UA-Fdc2A1kvt-fg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 28 Nov 2012 16:26:19 -0300", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance's optics"}
