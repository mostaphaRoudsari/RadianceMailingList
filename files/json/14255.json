{"body": "\nIt could depend on your measurement point and the rest of the model. Does raising to a higher ab value for both models increase calculation time too much? Maybe you could increase to 5 or more bounces for both models and relax other parameters but maintain reliable results. If you repeat the simulation multiple times or increase calculation parameters and get results within a reasonable margin of error, then you're probably as accurate as possible for the model inputs.\n\nSent: Monday, November 19, 2012 3:00 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear all\nI am analyzing light shelf with different dimensions for my thesis. I want to compare a model with light shelf with a model without shelf. I wonder If I should change the ambient bounces parameter in the no shelf model, because the  reflections decreases, or not,? The ab parameter that used for the models with shelf is 3.\nThanks in advance\nSincerely\nShailan Zareiy\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121119/9975886d/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] lightshelf simulation", "sender": "sh.zareiy at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B051B8C240D6@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CABNGNZ+Q6N2xcsXX-TmszJCbV0=HH=8x3e0Zw6Csn8hKv7TCqQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 09:16:53 -0500", "email": "shailan zareiy", "subject": "[Radiance-general] lightshelf simulation"}
