TIR Systems (www.tirsys.com),\nfor\nexample, offer industry-standard IESNA LM-63-02 data files for their\nDestiny\nproducts.\n\nThere are two classes of fiber optic lighting: 1) the fiber optic emits\nlight along its length, similar to cold-cathode (\"neon\") lighting; and\n2)\nthe fiber optic emits light at its end, typically in a housing designed\nto\nlook like a small point-source luminaire.\n\nIn the first case, the fiber optic is probably best modeled as a\nLambertian\nemitter. In the second case, industry-standard IESNA LM-63-02 (or\nEULUMDAT)\ndata files are applicable.\n\nIESNA Publication LM-76-02, \"Photometric Testing of Fiber Optics\nLighting\nSystems,\" describes recommended practices for fiber optic photometry.\n\nIan Ashdown, P.
