{"body": "\nDear Maria,\n\nYou will find a tutorial on Using Ecotect in combination with Radiance and Daysim under http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/teaching_resources.html.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, November 06, 2012 7:00 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nDear List,\nI am using Radiance through Ecotect. I hope this the correct list for my question.\n\nCan I calculate daylight autonomy with radiance through Ecotect, for an office unit that I have modeled in Ecotect? I have done it with Eoctect already, but i want a more accurate result.\n\nIf yes, how can I do this?\n\nThank you in advance,\nMariaM\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121106/1b286204/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] question concerning daylight autonomy", "sender": "mamand at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E801C9AAD@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": ["<CALMqCJVJuNj+62iMiTiXkpF8Jb7FE3xeny7bDb4L5-2i8cS0jw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 6 Nov 2012 12:40:41 +0000", "email": "Maria Mandalaki", "subject": "[Radiance-general] question concerning daylight autonomy"}
