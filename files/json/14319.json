{"body": "\nThough many of us use Radiance directly in our various flavors of lighting design/visual impact analyses, I seek a list of currently supported software titles which either imbed Radiance or draw upon it directly. Any information regarding architectural field impact and the fields it penetrates, particularly in non-research environments, would also be most helpful.\nRather than clutter the list mailing, please send information directly to me, and if of general interest, I will post the accumulated list.\nThanks in advance!\n\nRob Shakespeare\nshakespe at indiana.edu<mailto:shakespe at indiana.edu>\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121206/253695fb/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance... impact and penetration", "sender": "Shakespeare, Robert A.", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2A1FD18147050B498AC9724AD18ADB3D378EF536@IU-MSSG-MBX104.ads.iu.edu>", "refs": ["<245253.28433.qm@web100717.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>", "<5C0CE6BE-2225-43A3-ADAB-37AFD1EABCF1@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 6 Dec 2012 15:50:47 +0000", "email": "shakespe at indiana.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance... impact and penetration"}
