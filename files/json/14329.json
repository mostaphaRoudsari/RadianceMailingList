{"body": "\nJohn,\n\nA very timely and useful response thank you.  As you know the EFA (Education Funding Agency) in the UK has released its FOS (Facilities Output Specification) for the next generation of schools.  The directive from the government was a higher standard of space for lower cost / m2.\n\nWe made the decision to drop daylight factors and move to CBDM for the next generation of schools and the topic of the UDI exceed level came up during the writing and testing of the baseline design and indeed it has come up again since as people try and create standard designs.  As it stands the UDI autonomous was set at 100-2000 in the FOS.  What this means for designers when you look at a balanced design, (thermal and lighting), you need to control heat gain with smaller external windows and therefore supplement the daylight from a secondary source.  However, this costs money.  E.g. Atria, lightwells, lightpipes etc.\n\nWhat is interesting when you raise the UDI exceed from 2000 to 3000 then you can start again to design single sided lit spaces just as we had with DF's (indeed the type of rooms we are trying to stop building as the blinds are typically pulled down and the lights are turned on).  My thought therefore is whether in raising UDIe to 3000 because say a person can typically accept that level of light, then means we have significantly increased the contrast in a single sided lit space.  If we have, have we increased it to a level where parts of the space feel gloomy?   Is the answer to move UDIa to 300-3000, does that matter much?\n\nRegards\n\nAndrew\n__________________________\nAndrew Bissell\nB.Eng(Hons) C.Eng MSLL MCIBSE MIET\nLighting Design Director\nCundall Light4\nDirect: +44 (0)161 200 1235\nMobile: +44 (0)7899 907 978\nOffice: +44 (0)161 244 5660\nP Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\n\nSent: 11 December 2012 20:27\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nDoes John M. wanna weigh in on this?\n\n\nI believe Mardaljevic has been considering higher alternative thresholds as well.\n\nYes, on both counts.\n\nOriginal UDI of 100-2,000 lux was conceived around 2004, and was, with hindsight, a little too conservative regarding the upper limit.  I suspect now that those studies giving preferred maxima less than 2,000 lux could well have been the older articles in our sample.  Quite possible that work environments of around 20 years ago were less forgiving of high daylight illuminances, e.g. curved CRT screens, etc.  It seems that the more recent studies are all nudging-up the preferred / tolerated upper limit.\n\nSplitting the UDI range at the design level (e.g. 300 lux) was done in 2007 and applied to the (1st) VELUX study.  For the past few years I've been using the values 100, 300 and 3,000 lux to define the four UDI ranges: fell-short (<100); supplementary (100 - 300); autonomous (300 - 3,000); and, exceeded (>3,000).  For general daylighting use I don't see any need to alter the 100 and 300 lux bounds, but there may be good cause to increase the upper limit to 3,500 or 4,000 lux (greater?).  I'll be doing some sensitivity tests on that seeing how it affects annual totals for the autonomous and exceeded ranges.  It may not make much difference for many designs, at least in terms of UDI-autonomous and UDI-exceeded.  Though that's not to say that it wouldn't have knock-on consequences for, say, annual predictions of DGP.\n\nI do find the four range UDI scheme very useful to help evaluate (and communicate) the daylighting performance of a space -- especially when there are several facade variants to be considered and a simple slide transition reveals the impact of the design change in a manner that is very readily assimilated.  For other, more specialist applications, I see no problem in adjusting the three defining lux levels to suit, e.g. 20, 50 and 200 for a gallery space where conservation is an issue.\n\nSo, UDI -- no fixed rules.  Though a consensus for general daylighting applications may be forming around the 100, 300 and 3,000 (or 4,000?) lux values.\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\nJohn Mardaljevic\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/staff/profile/367.html<http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/>\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com<http://climate-based-daylighting.com/>\nFor further information about Cundall please visit http://www.cundall.com/News/World-Green-Building-Week.aspx\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCundall Johnston &amp; Partners LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales.Registered number OC300389.\nRegistered office: Horsley House, Regent Centre, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE3 3LU\nAll information contained in this email is private and confidential, and may also be privileged.\nThis email and its attachments are intended solely for the use of the addressee only and if any third party whatsoever\ncomes into possession of this email,they rely on it at their own risk and Cundall accepts no duty or responsibility\n(including in negligence) to any such third party.\nIf you have received this email in error, please immediately notify the sender and delete all copies from your system.\nPrivacy Policy: Use of this email and any attachments is subject to the terms on our Website at\nhttp://www.cundall.com/Misc/Privacy-Policy.aspx If you cannot access these terms,\nplease email terms at cundall.com with SEND TERMS in the subject heading or telephone +44 (0191) 213 1515 and we will send you a copy.\nAll of our business is conducted in accordance with Cundall?s Ethical Business Policy. http://www.cundall.com/Knowledgehub/Ethical-Business-Policy.aspx\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis email message has been scanned for viruses by Mimecast.
