{"body": "\nMay I ask if anybody compiled the *GenCumulativeSky* program created by\nDarren Robinson for *Mac OS*?\n\nDarren mentioned that the source code of GenCumulativeSky is written in *C++\n*. I assume we can use *Xcode* to compile it as an executable program for\nthe Mac system. But I don't know how to do it ...\n\nCurrently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal\nand SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2\nfiles in Mac system with other Radiance program. It's just a little bit\ninconvenient...\n\nAdvices are greatly appreciated!\n\n- Ji\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121212/06d7203d/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD83LV+y4Zf7Ju1r9RJS4PSo5=RXPuAW9fvksOASuHKVRG59SQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:52:36 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky compiled for Mac?"}
