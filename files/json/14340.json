{"body": "\nHappy Friday!\n\nJust a quick note to let y'all know that we have updated all of the\nRadiance binary installers, and they are available for download at the\nNREL OpenStudio website. Specifically, here:\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia\nnce\n\nScroll down a tad, and you'll see a section called \"Download Radiance\nBinaries\". We offer Windows 32-bit, MacOS Universal, and Linux 32-bit and\nLinux 64-bit.\n\nChris Humann, I went back to dynamically linked libraries, so these won't\nwork for ya on OSX 10.5, sorry. There have been a bunch of updates and\nfixes to a lot of the three-phase stuff for Windows, so Windows users\nshould definitely grab themselves a copy. This round should also fix the\nQt Rvu for many users. Please let me know if you have any difficulties\nwith the new packages.\n\nHave a good weekend,\n\n/rpg\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CCF0AA6F.17D5C%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 10:05:35 -0700", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Updated NREL Radiance Installers are Available"}
