{"body": "\nThank you very much, John and Thomas!\n\nI've found John's paper, and will read it later.\n\nAs far as I know, GenCumulativeSky also has two ways to create cumulative\nsky: the smeared sun approach (+s1 option) and the binned sun approach (+s2\noption), which might be similar to John's method #1 and #2 respectively\n(see its options below, the -r, -p, and -E option were added by the\nDIVA/DAYSIM team, I guess).\n\n\n###################################\nUsage: GenCumulativeSky [-d] [+s1|+s2] [-a latitude] [-o longitude] [-l]\n[-m standard meridian] [-h hour shift] [-G|-B|-E] <climate file>\n(Note: longitude +ve East of Greenwich)\n\n-d      Ignore diffuse irradiance\n+s1     Use \"smeared sun\" approach (default)\n+s2     Use \"binned sun\" approach\n-l      Output luminance instead of radiance\n-r      Output radiance/179000 (ensures that units in the Radiance\nImage Viewer are in kWhm-2)\n-p      Output radiance/1000 (ensures that units in the Radiance\nRGB data file  are in kWhm-2)\n-G      File format is col1=global irradiance (W/m2), col2=diffuse\nirradiance (W/m2)\n-B      File format is col1=direct horizontal irradiance (W/m2),\ncol2=diffuse irradiance (W/m2)\n-E      File format is an energyplus weather file (*.epw) The\ngprogram uses the global irradiance (W/m2) and diffuse irradiance (W/m2)\ndata columns.\nIn combination with '-E' the considered time interval can\nbe specified:\n-time <start time of day> <end time of day>\n-date mm_start dd_start mm_end dd_end (if start-date after\nend-date then the winter interval is considered)\n####################################\n\n- Cheers, Ji\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 17, 2012 at 1:32 AM, John Mardaljevic <J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121218/d294c1e2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky compiled for Mac?", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD83LVJOeCarTtmVdVbj3vbGD9BdAsBHzCjxLXtXk=i-RGgOiw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AE2C06A5D4A79244AA0AB930A5BFD04B147BDB21@ITSMBX-4.lunet.lboro.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Tue, 18 Dec 2012 16:05:12 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky compiled for Mac?"}
