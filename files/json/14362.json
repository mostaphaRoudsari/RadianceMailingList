{"body": "\nHi, Rob and the list, a small follow-up question:\n\nI was testing GenCumulativeSky.exe to get the* annual \"global horizontal\nradiation\"* for *a single unobstructed upward sensor*.\n\nThe results is* *always *SMALLER or LOWER *than the *SUM of the \"global\nhorizontal radiation\" column in the epw file*. (For London.epw, up to 2.7%\nlower; for Paris.epw, up to 1.73% lower, for Singapore.epw, up to 1.5%\nlower ...)\n\nMay I ask:\n1) Is the difference in this kind of magnitude acceptable?\n2) is the difference related to the parameters for rtrace (I assume not, as\nthe sensor is unobstructed and the scene is empty...)?\n\nThanks!\n-Ji\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2012 at 2:15 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\nRobert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121214/a8c581cf/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky compiled for Mac?", "sender": "Ji Zhang", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD83LVJW5Q_oMD3R=sXGd7qcqG7K1eSt888vaUR9nrD4Mhj3xA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD83LVKMnjnAXc5swpPtC9xi2MsM-LT2ox3X8FA1ar4hHvN1rQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<CCEE14C1.17B32%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 12:08:48 +0800", "email": "hope.zh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] GenCumulativeSky compiled for Mac?"}
