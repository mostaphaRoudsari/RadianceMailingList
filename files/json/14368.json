I assume we can use Xcode to compile it as an executable program for the Mac system. But I don't know how to do it ...\n\nCurrently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal and SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2 files in Mac system with other Radiance program.
