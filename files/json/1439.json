I\nhave an obj-file, and if I load it with obj2rad, I get a nice radiance\nmodel of the file. If I use obj2mesh, the model has errors.\n\nThere are zero-surface polygons reported, so the CAD geometry is not\nreally clean. However, I thought that the basic parser would be the\nsame in both translators. Have I been wrong here? My problem is that I\njust decided to use mesh objects instead of instanced geometry\nresulting from obj2rad. So I wonder if I should go back in this case\nnow.\n\nBelow the small images, \"nice\" from obj2rad, \"corrupt\" from obj2mesh\n(both as seen in objview).\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: nice.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 6994 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050517/f707a382/nice.jpg\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: corrupt.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 7240 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050517/f707a382/corrupt.jpg\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
