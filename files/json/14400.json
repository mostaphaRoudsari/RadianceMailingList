{"body": "\nHi Aksel,\n\nThere is indeed interest in the Radiance community (I'm speaking as a\nvoyeur, not a Radiance expert), see i.e.;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/python-radiance\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pyrat/\nEtc.\n\nI would love to have a Radiance script as a demo of how flexible Python is,\nmaybe there is some smallish task that we can tackle?\n\nWhen I use Radiance, I see the input files, and all I can think of is; this\nshould be XML... Maybe there is interest in a 2-way parser?\n\nAs far as a more complete \"wrapper\" project is concerned, we would be happy\nto also support in any way.\n\n-Marcus\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 3, 2012 at 1:40 PM, Aksel Gro? <aksel at gobo.io> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121203/1463e4b2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<1966E9C2-8D7C-4975-983F-F972FFAE478C@gobo.io>", "sender": "info info", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+9aNUV+gM+LnsAS9tU74nnxHKvFPk+gR3=qGV7xp1cnuaF5Ag@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CA+9aNUWkTu8uKZ_eABsFj=PJ_wrQLDARvqAcZfpwA2FLbYq23A@mail.gmail.com>", "<1966E9C2-8D7C-4975-983F-F972FFAE478C@gobo.io>"], "datetime": "Mon, 3 Dec 2012 15:10:31 +0100", "email": "info at pythonpoweredbuilding.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Leveraging the Python language in BuildingPerformance Simulation"}
