{"body": "\nHi Ji,\n\n179 is the efficacy of white (equal energy) light over the visible\nspectrum.\n\nDaylight is composed of a broader spectrum, so the efficacy (visible light\nper watt of energy) is lower.  Usually around 90 for the sun and 110 for\nthe sky, but changes based on various factors.\n\n179 is used in Radiance as a convention since we are simulating visible\nlight.  So when you're defining you sky using gensky with weather data you\nneed to either use the measured illuminance values and divide by 179 to get\nradiometric units for the visible spectrum, or use the measured radiance\nvalues (for solar spectrum), multiply by an approximate efficacy, then\ndivide 179 to get radiometric units for the visible spectrum only.\n\nIf you use gendaylit all the conversions are done for you.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 1, 2013 at 8:36 AM, Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130102/1766274b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAD83LV+44Y9qKcr-47B34uYtMmQ5Ra03XDNbvrc+rSp_42Z-GA@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NizPOxTOUZMkLMgErwV43B2FaMGz_4pDKAw8ZhYw3jWKUQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD83LV+44Y9qKcr-47B34uYtMmQ5Ra03XDNbvrc+rSp_42Z-GA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jan 2013 11:23:35 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] why \"global horizontal illuminance\" issmaller than \"global horizontal radiation\" multiplied by 179 in epw file?"}
