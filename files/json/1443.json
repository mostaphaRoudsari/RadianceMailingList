{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI'm having some trouble understanging something (again).  I wanted to\nverify that an .ies file I have is being used properly, and I'm getting\nsome confusing info.  I have an .ies-formatted photometry file for a\nPAR38.  The candela at nadir is 5448.  To do a simple verification that\nall is well I performed the following steps:\n\nies2rad -o foo -di -t white -m 1 foo.ies #convert file\noconv foo.rad > foo.oct # create octree\necho \"0 0 -120 0 0 1\" | rtrace -h -I -ab 0 foo.oct #calculate illuminance\nat 10' below fixture\n\n... output from that is:\n3.276076e+00    3.276076e+00    3.276076e+00\n\nTaking 3.276706 and multiplying by 179 I get 586 lux, or about 10x what\nI'd expect.  I'd assumed that by measuring the light source in a void,\nthat the candela at nadir could be used in a simple point calc, unaffected\nby interreflection.  So, shouldn't CBCP*d^2 = illuminance ?\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<57020.209.212.87.250.1102718194.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Dec 10 23:36:41 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] point calcs for verification: oddness"}
