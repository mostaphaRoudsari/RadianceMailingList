{"body": "\nHi Philippe!\n\n\nRhino and BRL-CAD are _very_ different tools. Rhino is a 3d-modeller\nwith advanced GUI and fancy buttons. BRL-CAD is basically a very\npowerful CSG engine, with several frontends such as GUIs and command\nline tools. If you need really have CSG modelling, possibly scripting,\nBRL-CAD probably would be perfect, but for modelling some geometry with\na nice GUI Rhino (or Blender or wharever) is easier.\n\nJust for completeness, you were probably just looking at the wrong\nplace. Just as with the radiance tools, you will not find the utilities\ncoming with BRL-CAD in any menu bars or Command Window Help. They are\ncommands, you can execute them if they are in your PATH, and you find\nhelp using manpages.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRL-CAD 7.22", "sender": "Lars O.
