{"body": "\nUsers of LightWave and those in the know,\n\nI have noticed that exporting an object from LightWave (.lwo) to\nWaveFront OBJ format yields a .obj file that does not specify the\nsurface normals (\"vn\").  I can actually bring the .obj file into Poser\nand then re-export it as an .obj and, voila, the surface normals are\nincluded.  Anyone know what tweaks can be done or options can be\nexercised within  LightWave to export objects in .obj format with\nsurface normals (\"vn\") listed in the file?  This is helpful when trying\nto use the obj2rad command and the -s option with obj2mesh for\nsmoothing purposes.\n\nThanks!\n\nkirk\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kirk Thibault", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<44BF41FE-4A27-11D9-A5F9-000A956A0F62@biomechanicsinc.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec  9 22:14:27 2004", "email": "kthibault at biomechanicsinc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] LightWave-Radiance OBJ question"}
