{"body": "\nDear list,\n\nYet another question on the trans material.\n\nThe question is on the design of a roof in an exhibition hall. The first layer is facing the outside air, the next layer is approx. 20cm below and the third layer is another few meters below. All 3 layers are built up the diffuse transmitting glass.\n\nWe have built all 3 layers of glass with material Trans, cf. the data below:?\n\nCr Cg Cb Rd Rs Sr Td Ts\n0,1 0,1 0,1 0,1 0,08 0,02 0,5 0\nA1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7\n0,65 0,65 0,65 0,08 0,02 0,83 0,00\n\nThe rendering parameters are (in ecotec):\n\n-dp=512\n-ar=22\n-ms=0.74\n-ds=.3\n-dt=.1\n-dc=.5\n-dr=1\n-sj=.7\n-st=.1\n-ab=12\n-af=RCP.amb\n-aa=.2\n-ad=400\n-as=64\n-av=0.01 0.01 0.01\n-lr=6\n-lw=.002\n\nMy question is when rendering the scene and looking up towards the roof you can see right through the panes as they are not translucent but clear glass. One can clearly see outline of the top window and connection between the roof and the walls which is rather unexpected.\n\nAre there a logical?explanation?for this or what could be the case here? Should I have modeled the inner layer as an illum source?\n\nAny input is appreciated :)\n\n\n/Per\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130121/7c617f83/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Per Haugaard", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1358798254.58084.YahooMailNeo@web171303.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 19:57:34 +0000 (GMT)", "email": "perhaugaard at yahoo.dk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Trans material"}
