They just don't\nhave a diffuse component.\n\n\nYour information is correct as far as I understand what you are\nsaying.  If you can fit your measurements to a Gaussian lobe\ndistribution, you are better off using one of the native models\n(trans or trans2), as all ray paths will be followed appropriately.\nThe general BRDF types, transfunc, transdata, and BRTDfunc, only use\nthe directional-diffuse lobe specified for interactions with light\nsources.  General ray sampling from an arbitrary distribution is\nquite expensive, and not done in Radiance for that reason.\n\n\nThe diffuse portion of the window distribution through a prismatic\nglazing will be computed by mkillum, leaving the\n\"specular\" (directional) portion to be done during the final\nrendering.  This is the correct behavior, and you don't have to treat\nit specially with mkillum, which is helpful for considering\ncontributions from the sky, ground, and neighboring structures.\n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean, here.  If you have some way to simulate\nyour exterior and measure the actual output distribution of the\nwindow system as a light source, then you wish to represent that as a\nbrightdata modifier on a window polygon, this would work.  It's a\nvery challenging measurement problem, though, which is why no one has\ndone it to my knowledge.  (Anyone out there have information on this?)\n\nThe purpose of mkillum of course is to create a light source from\nyour surface(s) by simulating an outdoor situation.  It doesn't\nalways work, though.  Specifically, mkillum has trouble resolving the\ncontribution from the sun through curved, specular reflectors and\ndevices.  It can handle most everything else.\n\n\nMeasure and validate.  Repeat.\n\n-Greg\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Redirecting+scattering", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu May 19 17:08:48 2005"}
