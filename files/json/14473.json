{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nHope I am getting how this works right...\n\nThe question regarding the Trans material previously posted by Per was\nbasically posted on my behalf and therefore I will take the liberty to just\nbuild upon that thread.\n\nWith respect to the difference between generating illuminance and luminance\npictures you of course have a very valid point. However, I am simulating a\nmodel with three layers of Trans material and I would expect that your view\nfrom inside and outwards even when considering illuminance levels would be\ndiffused (being filtered through three layers) ? Maybe I am missing\nsomething?\nWhat happens in between layers of Trans material (inter-reflections\netc.) and what are the internal surface properties?\n\nThank you for all you help so far!\n\n--\nBest regards,\n\n*Martin*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130122/f6ad500c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Martin Vraa Nielsen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAB61kRdwPNnDwhXZKMaKRo3Pq_7hGz-0Lq6+WPrEvsv+vRMuCg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 15:03:29 +0100", "email": "martinvraa at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Trans material"}
