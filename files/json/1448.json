The diffusing\nmaterial can be modeled by trans material. If you have a complex\nscattering material, you can adapt the trans material by an cal\nfunction. (Don't use BRTF-func or data with the current photon-mapping\nversion).\n\nTo be more efficient using the diffuse sky, you should define a\nphoton-port, where all the photons are emitted to. Usually the\nphoton-port material is the window pane.\n\nThen you can simply run the simulations, direct and diffuse\ncontributions should be calculated correctly.\n\nLast but not least, there exist also a version of daysim containing\nphoton-mapping, so you can run these simulations also hourly (or other\ntimesteps) if you want. Unfortunately, the latest daysim version didn't\ncompile with the photon-mapping extension - but if you need it, you can\nuse also the older version, Christoph could provide it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nJan\n\nFederico Giovannetti wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050519/bf64c462/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Redirecting+scattering", "tags": [], "sender": "Jan Wienold", "datetime": "Thu May 19 17:13:54 2005"}
