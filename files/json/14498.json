{"body": "\nGeorge\n\nSounds like a nice project! Please note that depending on the number and\ncomplexity of objects in your scene the rendering times for Radiance may\nnot be suitable for real time viewing. If you hit this problem you can\npre-render textures for your objects in Radiance that capture the lighting\nsituation. You then just have to map the rendered textures on your object\nand are free to use your game engine to provide the perspective image\nnecessary for your projection.\n\nI don't have URLs at hand but there were some presentations on this in past\nRadiance workshops.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 29, 2013 at 4:36 AM, P George Lovell <\np.g.lovell at st-andrews.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130129/c0b4bb2a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<51079815.3030207@st-andrews.ac.uk>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k3xgh_QCyzj=t_87eEPK2vddBoT3KR_nPtcO-CWostYXA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4DEF4B1B.60406@st-andrews.ac.uk>", "<51079815.3030207@st-andrews.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 11:33:06 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering for off-centre presentation in aVR lab"}
