Given the standard efficacy used by\nRadiance, this amounts to 16.2 W of light energy (which can't be\ndirectly determined from the electrical consumption!)\n\nThe tube has a circumference of approximately 81.7 mm and a\nluminous length of around 1.198 m. This results in a luminous\nsurface of 0.0979 m2.\n\nThe radiance of this tube is therefore:\n\n16.2W / (0.0979m2 * Pi) = 52.7 W/m2/sr\n\nThis is what the average rgb value of your glow material should\nbe based on. The luminance of the tube then amounts to 7684 cd/m2.\n\nBtw: If I feed the lampcolor program with those values, then I\nget very different results than you do:\n\n$> lampcolor\nProgram to compute lamp radiance.  Enter '?' for help.\nEnter lamp type [WHITE]: daylight fluorescent\nEnter length unit [meter]:\nEnter lamp geometry [polygon]: cylinder\nCylinder length [1]: 1.198\nCylinder radius [0.1]: 0.013\nEnter total lamp lumens [0]: 2900\nLamp color (RGB) = 35.450659 48.609340 43.581585\n\n0.265*35.450659 + 0.670*48.609340 + 0.065*43.581585 = 44.8\n\nThis is 0.85 of the 52.7 above. Lampcolor has a depreciacion\nfactor for each lamp type, possibly accounting for aging (the\nactual purpose of the factor is not documented).\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling Lamps", "sender": "Georg Mischler", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.BSF.4.30.0112201028070.99546-100000@emancholl.pair.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Dec 2001 10:58:23 -0500 (EST)", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling Lamps"}
