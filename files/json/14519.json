{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nThe physics of this situation is unusual, and the Radiance source code does apply a correction for the \"solid angle ratio\" caused by lensing at the surface.  However, Radiance doesn't track source directions properly inside a dielectric or through a refracting object -- it naively sends rays in a straight line towards the source, missing it in cases where significant refraction occurs.  This is why a straight ambient calculation works but the direct calculation does not.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130131/3e3cd69c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] usage of rtrace within a material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<403AD9AF-B03D-430D-99EE-AE39275C0154@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<mailman.360.1359644522.2200.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<OFFDC48366.DAB018EE-ONC1257B04.00545B13-C1257B04.005D0A21@ise.fhg.de>"], "datetime": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 09:08:04 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] usage of rtrace within a material"}
