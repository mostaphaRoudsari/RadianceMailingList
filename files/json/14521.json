{"body": "\nI should have said specifically that the source calculation doesn't work if the light bends and stays bent.  In a more typical situation where the dielectric is in two parallel planar surfaces, the ray straightens out again and everything works just fine.  Radiance started out only having the dielectric material -- glass and trans types were added much later.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130131/3c59a39a/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] usage of rtrace within a material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<45CEFC78-B7FA-4B81-A58F-29F1C33BCFF8@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<mailman.360.1359644522.2200.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<OFFDC48366.DAB018EE-ONC1257B04.00545B13-C1257B04.005D0A21@ise.fhg.de>", "<403AD9AF-B03D-430D-99EE-AE39275C0154@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 09:18:01 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] usage of rtrace within a material"}
