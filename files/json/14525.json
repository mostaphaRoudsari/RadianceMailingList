{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nFor those who don't know me, my name is Kera Lagios, and I am one of the\ndevelopers of the DIVA-for-Rhino plug-in. Last October,  we held the first\nDIVA Day on the campus of MIT in Cambridge, MA. We gathered together DIVA\nusers to learn advanced simulation methods and exchange work, ideas and\nfeedback. We have posted the slides and many videos of the day's\npresentations on our website www.diva4rhino.com. We encourage you to visit\nthe site and check out the interesting work.\n\nClick here to go to the DIVA Day page <http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day>\nor\nClick here to go straight to the DIVA Day\nPresentations<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day/diva-day-presentations>\n\nThank you,\nThe DIVA Team\n\n\n--\n*Kera Lagios*\nFounder and Owner\n\n*Solemma, LLC*\nBoston, MA\nc 617.680.0275 <kera at solemma.net>\nwww.solemma.net\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130109/1e74a838/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kera Lagios", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAP0o02+_dTzRWdrW0WyCrphxSsP9rziNoqFy7UdEwWcZJthBXA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 09 Jan 2013 18:01:10 -0000", "email": "kera at solemma.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] DIVA Day Presentations and Videos Posted"}
