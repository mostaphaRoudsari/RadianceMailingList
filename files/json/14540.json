{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nwhile it is one of the most fundamental material types in Radiance, dielectric is hardly used in simulations with Radiance as far as I know. I once or twice had to use it, but never for critical parts of a model.\n\nNow, I need to find the irradiance in (!) a glass pane on the second surface S2 in this simple sketch:\n\n|        |\n|        |\n| o      |    * source\n| sensor |\n|        |\n\nS2      S1\n\nThe glass material applied to a flat surface through S1 obviously does not work here, as it includes reflection at S2 into the plane through S1. That would lead to an underestimate of about 4% at normal incidence. What I did is to model S1 as a dielectric, S2 as plastic, and ran the rtrace command with the -i switch, location as marked by the o-letter in the sketch and the view vector towards S2.\n\n- My first question - is this a valid model in Radiance, with a volume having a dielectric interface on one, a plastic surface on the other side?\n\n- Second question, can I expect rtrace to calculate a valid irradiance reading under these circumstances?\n\n- Third question, and that is funny - how do I find the transmissivity parameters for a glass, as dielectric would expect them, if I have transmission T measured?\n\nIf someone here could share some insight how to find a valid dielectric description from a typical transmission measurement for the visible spectrum, that would be of great help for me....\n\nCheers and TIA,\nLars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130131/746b81e5/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
