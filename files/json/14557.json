{"body": "\nHi Martine!\n\n\nYou can do so by piping \"sensor locations/directions\" into rtrace and use the -I+ switch. That way, you calculate irradiance at that location without having a visible surface in place. You can get one value for a given location by e.g. piping one location / direction vector, e.g. echo \"0 0 0 0 0 1\" | rtrace -I+ (all other parameters...). Or you can generate a grid of such values, eventuelly forming an \"irradiance image\", by using vwrays to generate the locations / directions for you. This is much more flexible then rpict -i, which always depends on a surface in your scene. Have a quick look at Axel Jacob's tutorial to see some examples.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130125/321ecd81/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Trans material", "sender": "Lars O.
