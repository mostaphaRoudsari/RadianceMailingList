{"body": "\nThanks for the suggestion Greg; unfortunately that's not the case as the\nscript does not hang there and the just goes to the next line of the\nbatch file.\n\nWhat's even funnier is that the same files run from another machine...\n...which is what will happen for tonight and tomorrow I'll try to figure\nout what's wrong with mine...\n\nStill open to suggestions though! ;)\n\nThanks\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 23 January 2013 17:14\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Giovanni,\n\nI suspect that your test.rad (or materials.rad) file has a line of the\nform:\n\n!some_script\n\nthat is hanging because it is attempting to read from the standard\ninput.  Whatever script produced the ROPT= line is the one hanging up\noconv.\n\n-Greg\n\n-dr 1 -ss 1\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] misterious error", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C30A2B861C@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": ["<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C30A2B85F1@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "<7D292D0E-931D-4073-9499-E400E9D2AB24@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 18:03:47 -0000", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] misterious error"}
