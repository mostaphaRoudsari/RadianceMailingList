{"body": "\nHi Martin!\n\nFirst, it would help to know whether you experience this with luminance maps, too.\n\nFor illluminance/irradiance any transmissive surface is tricky, as the observer may expect different results.\n\nWhat -ab setting do you use? -ab <3 would only let the specular transmission trough your multilayer diffuser, if I am not completely wrong... And that should make it appear like a dark (+ reflection) clear glass? I never tried this kind of stacking.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130123/8af95710/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Trans material", "sender": "Lars O.
