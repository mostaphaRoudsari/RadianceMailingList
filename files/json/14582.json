{"body": "\nHi Per,\n\nYou should not be seeing straight through the surface.  I did a test using your parameters, and could not see through such a trans material.\n\nAre you sure that what you are seeing is not the shadows cast by the beams?  Have you double-checked your geometry to make sure all the materials are correctly assigned and the surfaces where you expect them?  What happens when you substitute an opaque material for the trans?\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130121/19d00331/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Trans material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<68445C84-6543-475B-85BE-F9DE004299D0@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1358798254.58084.YahooMailNeo@web171303.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 12:07:39 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Trans material"}
