{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nA long time ago I developed a utility to interactively visualize data\ncontained in BSDF files.  I found it extremely useful, so I shared it with\na few others who also found it useful.  We decided to release it publicly\nand now, a year later, I am *officially* allowed to share it.\n\nYou can download installers for windows and linux here:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/bsdf-viewer\nIf you want to use it on Linux let me know, I can send you something that\nyou can test for me.\n\nIt was written using processing which is Java based.  Processing is maybe\nnot the best for this, but I started there with something very simple, and\nas things tend to go it got complex pretty quick.\n\nThe mac version supports tensor tree BSDFs the Windows version only\nsupports Klems BSDFs.\n\nI hope you find it useful.\n\nAndy\n\nPS - It's a bit rough around the edges, sorry.  Please report bugs that\nprevent you from being able to use it and I will try to fix them quickly.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130117/b846e070/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NiwhUFuEWCoKa+Zd_azdwvOCCoUOg+Ge=a-gZMbHt9da8Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 17 Jan 2013 18:21:12 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDFviewer"}
