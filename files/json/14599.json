{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI know that questions regarding the trans model tend to be either repetitive or lead to never-ending threads, however here is one more in the series.\n\nI wanted to model a translucent surface, where I know really nothing about reflection. My idea was to keep Rd and Rs set to zero and only define the transmission. A simple example would be a surface with perfect lambertian transmission (Td=1, Ts=0) and no reflection at all (ok, hard to produce such a material, but I had reasons to separate transmission from reflection information). According to my understanding that would be:\n\nvoid trans puretransmission\n0\n0\n7\t1\t1\t1\n0\t0\n1\t0\n\nHowever, being lazy, I thought this might be a good time to try the widget for cross-checking. Which made me realize that Cr, Cb, Cg are not asked for. Instead, I seam to need a value > 0 for Rd, which means I can never achieve the above definition.\n\nAm I just doing it wrong? Did this problem never arise because noone else wanted such a strange trans model? Or - which would give me a headache - is my understanding of Cr, Cg, Cb wrong? I always understood A1-A3=1-absorption(r,g,b).\n\nThank you, cheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
