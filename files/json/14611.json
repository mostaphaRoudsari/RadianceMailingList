{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nChanging the -c setting in genBSDF may result in a more accurate BSDF estimate, but it will not increase the resolution of the recorded distribution, which is defined by the 145x145 Klems basis.  Near normal incidence, the resolution is about 5 degrees, but increases to 15 or 20 degrees towards grazing angles.\n\nTo obtain a higher-resolution BSDF, you will need to switch to the tensor tree representation, which means using the -t4 option, probably '-t4 5' or '-t4 6' in your case.  The '-t4 5' setting will yield a BSDF with 1024 incoming and 1024 outgoing directions, which corresponds roughly to 2-degree resolution near normal incidence.  The higher setting of '-t4 6' gives you about twice the resolution, or 1-degree accuracy.  However, it does take about 4 times as long to calculate, and any tensor tree BSDF will take much longer to compute with genBSDF than the Klems basis.  Final rendering times should be similar, however.\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<2AA57BD2-3C52-44DE-B9A9-F2B9013AA57F@coolshadow.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A82DD1B8-027E-4577-8CB5-BCCD5993E6A5@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CALPn_+ZVwosGdzHqy25Ak5DLy+CKaSOfDeHmEzxFw9U_z6ga8w@mail.gmail.com>", "<2AA57BD2-3C52-44DE-B9A9-F2B9013AA57F@coolshadow.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 14 Jan 2013 11:41:21 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Glare analysis of BSDF representation oflight redirecting glass"}
