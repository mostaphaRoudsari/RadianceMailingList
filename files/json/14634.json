{"body": "\nHi Ji Zhang!\n\n\nI would not put too much effort into understanding why it is 179 lm/W in\nRadiance. It usually really does not matter for you. You can use it as a\nconstant as long as you are interested in photometric quantities, as in\nsuch case, you input and your output will be in lumens, not watt. So\nfeed in by dividing by 179, read out by multiplying with the same.\nThat?s it. This is completely unrelated to the \"real\" luminous efficacy\nof lamps, skies, stars (aka the sun...), which is not that easy to\npredict. So, whenever possible, I'd use the photometric units for input\nwhen I need photometric results. This means you are working with\nwell-defined conversions.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130104/db0999b9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAD83LVJBYMiVDxmjkmHGz=8geBi4Fc1MNCRsSHRN+1TEZOkeKg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Lars O.
