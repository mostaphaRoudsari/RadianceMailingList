Jack got the right\none in his response.\n\n\nOh dear.  Mixing illuminants is even more complicated, and not\nsomething Radiance does very well.  For this to be done correctly,\nyou really need a full-blown spectral lighting simulation.  The\nproblem is, there aren't any.  You can trick Radiance into doing it\nby running multiple scenes and choosing different spectral sample\nwavelengths for RGB each time then combining the results, but it's a\nhassle and difficult to do right.\n\n\nIs this RGB or Yxy (or ???)\n\n\nOnce again, what you'll get out of this technique is a simple color\ncast in your renderings, which will have almost nothing to do with\nhow people might perceive the actual space, and doesn't tell you a\nthing either about how colors are rendered.\n\n\nIf you don't have spectral data, then this is an exercise in\nfutility.  You can't learn anything by modifying the source colors\nindependent of the surfaces.  Your results won't have any value or\nmeaning.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Lamp colour", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
