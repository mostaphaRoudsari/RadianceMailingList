Usually around 90 for the sun and 110 for the sky, but changes based on various factors.\n\n179 is used in Radiance as a convention since we are simulating visible light.  So when you're defining you sky using gensky with weather data you need to either use the measured illuminance values and divide by 179 to get radiometric units for the visible spectrum, or use the measured radiance values (for solar spectrum), multiply by an approximate efficacy, then divide 179 to get radiometric units for the visible spectrum only.\n\nIf you use gendaylit all the conversions are done for you.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 1, 2013 at 8:36 AM, Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com<mailto:hope.zh at gmail.com>> wrote:\nDear list, Happy New Year!\n\nI have a simple question related to conversion from irradiance value to illuminance value, and pls correct me if I'm wrong:\n\nUsually we can estimate the illuminance (lux) for a given point by multiplying the irradiance (w/m2) for the point as simulated via Radiacne by 179 (lm/w) which is the luminous efficacy used in Radiance, or more strictly (R*0.265+G*0.670+B*0.065)*179.\n\nHowever, it seems that in a epw weather file the \"global horizontal illuminance\" value is not equal to but smaller than the \"global horizontal radiation\" value multiplied by 179.\n\nMay I ask:\n1. why there's such a large discrapency?\n2. Will this lead to over-estimation of illuminance when using cumulative sky derived from \"global horizontal radiation\" ?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n- Ji\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAOG+NizPOxTOUZMkLMgErwV43B2FaMGz_4pDKAw8ZhYw3jWKUQ@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CD09DE7D.18301%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jan 2013 12:55:09 -0700", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] why \"global horizontal illuminance\" issmaller than \"global horizontal radiation\" multiplied by 179 in epw file?"}
