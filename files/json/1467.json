{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI am a student from Bristol University in the UK currently rendering a scene\nwhich includes a desk lamp with a halogen bulb.\n\n\n\nThe bulb is similar to the one at the following address:\n\nhttp://www.lightworld.com/MERCHANT2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD\n<http://www.lightworld.com/MERCHANT2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=97\n88&Category_Code=halogen> &Product_Code=9788&Category_Code=halogen\n\n\n\nI am trying to replicate the reflective, transparent inner surface of the\nlight cone, does anyone have any ideas on how I can make the mirror material\nhave a degree of transparency so I can accurately represent light leaving\nthe rear of the bulb.\n\n\n\nMany thanks in advance,\n\n\n\nTom Wood\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041202/3b1104f1/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Tom Wood", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<mailman.3.1102015693.370.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec  2 20:28:13 2004", "email": "Tom.Wood.01 at bristol.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Transparent Mirror Material"}
