I  use the\ngenbox command for the light map, obviously the light is not as focused because\nit's spread out over the large box 100 100 100. If the surface is specular,\nnice reflections are rendered but if it is purely diffuse, the shadows hardly\noccur.\n\nThanks\n\nTarik\n\n\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sharper shadows using a light prob", "tags": [], "sender": "Tarik Rahman", "datetime": "Wed May 25 15:15:58 2005"}
