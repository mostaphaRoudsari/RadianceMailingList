{"body": "\nHi Catarina!\nAs far as I know, Desktop Radiance has not been supported for several\nyear. This list is on Radiance, which shares some underlying code with\nthe old Desktop Radiance, but has seen continous development over the\nyears. I suggest that you stop using Desktop Radiance and either go with\n\"pure\" Radiance (which means to get into touch with the command-line\ntools Radiance is made of) or one of the various frontends. Daysim,\nRelux, the Blender-Integration as well as several integrations in more\ngeneral building simulation systems are among the options in the latter\ncase.\nIt is almost impossible to give any useful comment here, as we do not\nknow the model (geometry), the material properties or the luminaire,\nplus we have unsupported code. From what you wrote, you do not have any\ndaylight in your scene - still, the values you observe could indicate\nthat you have a sky model that you are not aware of, and measure\nilluminance where your sensor gets hit by direct sunlight.\n\nStill, a very generic hint - if you observe funny results in your\nilluminance simulation, take a \"look\" using a more \"natural\" camera\nsetting with a luminance calculation. This helps to identify problems in\nthe model (missing ceilings, coordinate systems where one would not\nexpect them to be located related to the camera, funny overlaps of\nsurfaces, ...). Still - Desktop Radiance is for historical interest but\nnot for simulation work any more.\nOptics 5 is a tool to find transmission properties of multi-layer\nglazings. You can import these into Radiance - but Optics does not\nsomehow interfere with Radiance, and is a separate software.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange results", "sender": "Lars O.
