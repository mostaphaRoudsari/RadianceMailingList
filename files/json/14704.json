{"body": "\nHi Catarina!\n\nI would count Ecotect as one of the building simulation systems\nincluding an interface to Radiance. It is not a free one (unlike others,\ne.g. Openstudio, Esp-r, ...).\n\nYou may want to have a look at Livi, which is a Radiance interface for\nBlender. It looks pretty cool... Artificial lighting is handled by\nadding an IES candela distribution data block to Blender's lamp object.\n\nhttp://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi\n\nBesides that it is a good idea to at least once \"understand\" Radiance\nwithout an user interface. The frontends are all nice and polished, and\ngive the impression that things are easier than using text files and\ncommands. But they also hide critical aspects, setting some defaults or\nmaking assumptions that one should at least be aware of. Take a look at\nthe tutorial section at www.radiance-online.org, especially the two\ntutorials by Axel are a perfect start!\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange results", "sender": "Lars O.
