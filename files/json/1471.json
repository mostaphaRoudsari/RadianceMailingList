You should also consider\nusing the new mksource program, especially if your environment map\ncontains the sort of small, intense sources that should generate\nshadows.  However, to do so, you'll need to map your light probe onto\na distant glow source rather than a large box.\n\nSee the postings from last month on mksource, starting with:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-\nApril/002602.html\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sharper shadows using a light prob", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed May 25 20:31:38 2005"}
