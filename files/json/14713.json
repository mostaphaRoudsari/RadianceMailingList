{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI was trying to run glare analysis via Desktop Radiance for glazing with 2\ndifferent VLT:\n\na) VLT = 30\nb) VLT = 60\n\nThe type used for these glazing are kept as default --> \"glass\".\n\n1) For the first analysis, I have adjusted the exposure for both images in\norder to reflect more accurate visual view showing the differences between\nclear and darker glass.\n\nThe glare index via UGR shows:\n\na) VLT 30 = 36\nb) VLT 60 = 44\n\n2) For the second analysis, on top adjusting the exposure, I have also\nused \"pcond -h\" on the images.\n\nThe glare index via UGR shows:\n\na) VLT 30 = 0\nb) VLT 60 = 0\n\nLooking at the comparison of the results above, I am not sure whether\n\"pcond -h\" should be used prior to glare analysis. Should the glare\nanalysis be done on raw images without \"pcond -h\"? ......although it was\nstated that \"pcond -h\" will create a view that mimic human responses.\n\nWould really appreciate any sharing or help on this!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nCheers,\n\nAnn\nIf you are not the email's intended recipient, kindly inform the sender\nand delete it.\nThe email may contain confidential information which should not be\nretained, nor disclosed to another individual.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130227/da4ab0b9/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: image/gif\nSize: 29720 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130227/da4ab0b9/attachment-0001.gif>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sim Swee Ling Annie", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<OF391D99AF.38999B60-ON48257B1F.00308605-48257B1F.0033A66E@surbana.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 17:25:43 +0800", "email": "anniesim at surbana.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Desktop radiance Glare Analysis: Pcond"}
