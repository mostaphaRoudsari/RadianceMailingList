{"body": "\nThat's a good practice, and one I follow as well.  Since pcond output is meant to be sent to a printer or low dynamic-range display device, converting it to a lower bit-depth at the same time makes perfect sense.  Some of the programs that convert to such formats have built-in tone-mappers that are similar to pcond but less sophisticated and faster.  See the ra_bmp '-e' option and the normtiff command.\n\n-Greg\n\n----------\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Desktop radiance Glare Analysis: Pcond", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0B7E4D77-C725-42D3-87A8-4D043193DBF9@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<OF391D99AF.38999B60-ON48257B1F.00308605-48257B1F.0033A66E@surbana.com>", "<512DDBED.2030208@gmx.net>", "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052BD821F34@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 08:54:31 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Desktop radiance Glare Analysis: Pcond"}
