{"body": "\nHi Ann,\n\nfirst, Desktop Radiance is unsupported and has not been updated for\nages. Avoid using it, there are better, supported software around based\non current versions of Radiance.\n\nSecond, glare analysis is based on the pixel values. Thus I would not\nadjust anything in images that are supposed to be used for analysis. To\nmake sure that you are working with original pixel values, use pcomb -o\n: pcomb -o filtered.hdr > raw.hdr and use raw.hdr as input for all your\nanalysis.\n\nBut: Images generated by pcond -h can NOT be used for such analysis, and\nas far as I know, there is no way to revert the changes made to the\npixel values. The idea behind pcond -h is to give a visual impression\nwhat an scene would be perceived like by a human observer, which\nrequires changes to the pixel values beyond exposure settings.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Desktop radiance Glare Analysis: Pcond", "sender": "Lars O.
