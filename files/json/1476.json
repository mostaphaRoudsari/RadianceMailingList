How could I get my hands on it?\n\n//as a more personal question: c-shells? Have you been tempted by any of the\n//p-languages (Python, Perl, Php)? Excuse me for not being a *nix guru, but\n//I think it would be a good idea to code the c-shell scripts as a (Python?)\n//module? Speaking for myself myself, but it would ease up scripting\n//radiance considerably. Idea?\n\nCheers, Jelle.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "datetime": "Fri May 27 12:22:17 2005"}
