{"body": "\nHi,\n\nMy name is Catarina and I am trying to perform a lightning simulation with\nDesktop Radiance.\n\nI think I followed all the necessary steps to insert my model:\n- Design the geometry (its a simple cube, with the dimensions 5*5*2.8, and\na window);\n- Attach materials to the surfaces;\n- Insert the luminaire;\n- Define a gride (I am using the reference grid simualation);\n- Define the orientation.\n\nAfter that, I perform the simulation but the results are very high (I\nobtain values for illuminance around 14000 or higher). Additionally, the\nlightning distribution around the room does not make sense. I have low\nvalues in some points and very high value in other.\n\nI am performing the analysis in a windows 7 (32bits) operative system. I\ndon't know if the operative system interfere with the results?\n\nI read something in your site about the optics 5 software. I have already\ninstall it and uninstall and the results remain awkward.\n\nCan you please tell me if I am doing something wrong?\n\nThank you very much,\nCatarina\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130222/6cb5a7c1/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Catarina_Ara=FAjo?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAC4Zz-KCqoByAbNfi2bBYL4-Djx9djUNWwb=6SFGkiraqWs=3w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 13:26:50 +0000", "email": "catarinaba7 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Strange results"}
