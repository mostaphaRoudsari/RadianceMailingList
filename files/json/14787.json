{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nYou are right the math behind is what interests me.\nI know that it depends on projection. For the moment I'm interested in\nangular fisheye view used for evalglare input images. I thought that is\ngives equal solid angle for every pixel, but it seems that angles vary\nslightly (increasing towards image corners), and that's what is puzzling me.\n\nMarija\n\nOn Thursday, February 14, 2013, Lars O.
