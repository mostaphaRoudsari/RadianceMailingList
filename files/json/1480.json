Therefore, rtcontrib sets -aa 0 to switch caching off\nin its call to rtrace.  You should adjust your -ad value\naccordingly.  (It also sets -as 0 for similar reasons.)\n\n\nYes, you should see both direct and indirect contributions from\nrtcontrib.  At least, that's the idea.  Maybe I should check to make\nsure of the results, because my test scene didn't contain much\nindirect lighting.  Let me get back to you on this....\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cach", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
