{"body": "\nDear John,\n\nto my knowledge, the Perez model only works in a limited range for the sky\nclearness and brightness; at least gendaylit does. In the new version of\ngendaylit that has been announced yesterday, the sky clearness and\nbrightness values are set to the border values in your case, and the\noutput is still calculated. Therefore, the octree can still be created and\nused for this time step, without the bash script being aborted (\"bad sky\ndescription\"). The warning messages are still directed to stdout as long\nas the -w option is not set.\n\nMy guess is a wrong combination of high direct-normal irradiance values\nand the defined point of time. Do you apply hourly irradiance values? Does\nthe problem still exist if you change the calculation to 10-minute values?\nMaybe you can recalculate your weather files with the Skartveit-Olseth\nmethod (Meteonorm, for example, provides this option.)\n\nCheers,\nWendelin\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130201/9f2cafac/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit- bad sky description (John Ford)", "sender": "Wendelin.Sprenger at ise.fraunhofer.de", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<OF469D82FE.DA367236-ONC1257B05.0050EBC4-C1257B05.0052C0A0@ise.fhg.de>", "refs": ["<mailman.370.1359726400.2200.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"], "datetime": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 16:03:52 +0100", "email": "Wendelin.Sprenger at ise.fraunhofer.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Gendaylit- bad sky description (John Ford)"}
