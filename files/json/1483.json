It has to do with your -ad 1536 value and the\nway I'm computing weights, which causes the ambient rays to drop\nbelow your -lw threshold.  I made a temporary fix that circumvents\nthe problem in this case, but I haven't checked it into CVS because I\nneed to think more carefully about how I'm computing ray weights in\nthis part of the code.  I'll check it in when I'm sure I have it\nright this times.\n\nThanks -- you're my alpha alpha tester!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cach", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat May 28 17:40:48 2005"}
