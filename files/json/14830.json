{"body": "\nHi Tim,\n\nHaze is the percentage of transmitted light which deviates from the\nincident direction.  So you could interpret the haze to mean that 50% of\nthe transmitted light is diffused.\n\nAs a first approximation I would use trans with the following transmission\nproperties:\nTs = 0.455\nTd = 0.455\n\nThough with a haze of 50% assuming that the scattered light is lambertian\nis a bit of a stretch.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 11, 2013 at 10:45 AM, Tim Perry <tim.v2.0 at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130311/03a091f8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAFVgASXeU4MQ6uSteN1zcfLdjTJ6OputgrqcNeG_odu4vSP9rg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NiyTZ+FvFGkvYrrUw4W2ckXUFnEGJVawAqv=WBnxEJ3eKw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAFVgASXeU4MQ6uSteN1zcfLdjTJ6OputgrqcNeG_odu4vSP9rg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 11:05:21 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling a film w/ 50% haze and 91%tranmission."}
