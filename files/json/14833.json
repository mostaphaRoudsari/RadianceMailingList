{"body": "\nDear list,\n\nI was trying gendaymtx and the new dctimestep (it works excelent, thanks to\nthe developers), and noticed the following.\n\nI modeled a big cube, and set sensors pointing north, south, east and west\n(the idea is that the cubes shades). Then, I made a DC matrix, created the\nsky matrix; and dctimesteped all together (the weather used is Montreal),\nand got THESE <https://sites.google.com/site/sunliteproject/comments>\nresults.\n\nThe sensors were defined (North, South, East and West, respectively)\n\n0 3.1 1 0 1 0\n0 -3.1 1 0 -1 0\n3.1 0 1 1 0 0\n-3.1 0 1 -1 0 0\n\nAnyway; North and South seem to be ok to me (simetric along the day, and\nthe south has more \"sun\" than north). But West and East seem to be\ninverted...? and the east is more insolated in the afternoon? (I havent\nreally looked at the numbers themselves, but just to the tendency). *Can\nthere be a bug in the program??*\n\nOn the other hand... is there any plan on adding the -O option to\ngendaymtx, to get the solar intensities?\n\nTHANKS TO EVERYONE IN ADVANCE\n\nGerman\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130311/7455e7ee/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaymtx axis convention and -O 1 option.", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4KBv+4LmCAtYc0aUsJ=sNbgb5R8hWym5zhzMxzp_ou53g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAF-iH4JpuXj9ks1f9hWbP5_0BY0Fg5ZVTrNtaiT5O9wzrMe6SQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 16:30:44 -0400", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gendaymtx axis convention and -O 1 option."}
