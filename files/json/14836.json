{"body": "\nHi Germ?n,\n\nI am not quite sure how the new gendaylit -O option, which changes the incorporated spectrum, is supposed to interact with RGB colors in a Radiance scene.  You would have to redefine your materials to incorporate a different set of wavelengths and define what those are to really be consistent about it.  Doing everything in single-channel mode introduces another type of inaccuracy, one that is potentially greater than the difference between total flux and visible flux.  You really have to know what you're doing.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130311/c2f033f5/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaymtx axis convention and -O 1 option.", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<9A531184-B417-4B16-80D8-5F8A265936E4@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAF-iH4JpuXj9ks1f9hWbP5_0BY0Fg5ZVTrNtaiT5O9wzrMe6SQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAF-iH4LtOr99q31wB-EQZjO6Ct2Tcu4i2xKbvL_Pz6UE44YQ8w@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAF-iH4L=gBm=EB26Cvj8qjYcymwg2ZR3zZ4OyFERrHavFnvm5g@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAF-iH4LaJENHLD5DtAnPrqqW4_SV0bv9MiuQazf-AqHaQn6UkQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 20:04:29 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gendaymtx axis convention and -O 1 option."}
