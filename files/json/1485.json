You really\nneed to override some of the rendering options, though, as rad's\noutput is not appropriate for rtcontrib, anymore than it's\nappropriate for mkillum.  It's a different use of Radiance and you\ncan't really think of it as rendering anymore.  In particular, the -\nad option should be set to something much smaller, since the ambient\ncache is disabled.\n\nThanks again for helping me find the problem.
