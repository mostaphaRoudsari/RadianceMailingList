{"body": "\nHi Christopher\n\nActually i am computing per pixel visibility ( or say each point visibility of the surface) in the up direction. I suppose if we set ambiance bounce more than zero, then it will have inter-reflection effect. and to avoid interreflection contribution i have done surface material perfectly black and bounces zero.\n\nYes we do need light source, for that i am using glow ( self?luminous?surface ?) and a unity hemispherical light source for a point.\n\nand logically i suppose -completely visible point is shaded as unity, and zero will be treated as occluded. so value of rgb determines the visibility factor.\n\n-i option produces ?irradiance map.?\n\n\nso basically i render the scene?\nrpict ?-x resx, -y resy -i -ab 0 -vf camera.vp ?scene.oct > scene.hdr\n\n\nBest Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n________________________________\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nSent: Friday, March 15, 2013 3:57 PM\n\nYou will need at least one ambient bounce to calculate the contribution of an ambient ?glow? source. Zero ambient bounces means only direct sources like ?light? would be traced.\n?\nAlso, I?m not sure, but the rpict manual says the -i option actually estimates the irradiance using the radiance value and the lambertian reflectance. I?ve never delved into the code, so I?m not sure how accurate that description is. After testing -ab 1, you might also try assigning a very small reflectance to your black surface.\n?\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup? business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130315/0436b852/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient occlusion map ?", "sender": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1363362191.44301.YahooMailNeo@web121704.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>", "refs": ["<CADoMKs0cxWiPJDc_bHGKovPNK8W7TBiqeZ5tdQLB1z6LBp-CnA@mail.gmail.com>", "<2BCC3578EA36FE49A3EE485C490D2467145AD3@SRV-EX01.transsolar.local>", "<1363352613.73965.YahooMailNeo@web121701.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>", "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052BDD0C853@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 08:43:11 -0700 (PDT)", "email": "Christopher Rush", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] ambient occlusion map ?"}
