This is because glow was intended to model\nthe sky, a very large area source.  It is much more efficient and accurate\nto sample the sky using the stochastic ambient calculation compared of the\ndeterministic direct calculation.\n\nWith -ab 0 you get no light in your image from the glow (unless you can see\nthe glow geometry in your view).  Setting -ab 1 when using a glow source is\nequivalent to a direct only calculation (ie without any\ninter-eflection effects).\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Fri, Mar 15, 2013 at 9:39 AM, Brajesh Lal <brajeshlal at yahoo.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130315/06eba346/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient occlusion map ?", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixwUaTNb40jJsfVnZYtDnGi4-f9O6FPUUBPZROqSueAgQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CADoMKs0cxWiPJDc_bHGKovPNK8W7TBiqeZ5tdQLB1z6LBp-CnA@mail.gmail.com>", "<2BCC3578EA36FE49A3EE485C490D2467145AD3@SRV-EX01.transsolar.local>", "<1363352613.73965.YahooMailNeo@web121701.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>", "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052BDD0C853@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "<1363362191.44301.YahooMailNeo@web121704.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>", "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052BDD0C947@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "<1363365584.47813.YahooMailNeo@web121705.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 09:53:06 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient occlusion map ?"}
