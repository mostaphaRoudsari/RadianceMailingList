{"body": "\nShamim.\n\nYou can export the analysis from Ecotect (it becomes a list of xyz coordinates with normal direction vector of that sensor). You can then use rtrace to calculate your illuminance values. You will need to create two grid files, one with normal vectors pointing up (0 0 1) for light arriving from the ceiling and a grid with normals pointing down (0 0 -1) for light bouncing off the floor.\n\nUsing the \"Final Render\" option in the Radiance Analysis/Export panel of Ecotect allows you to assign a grid (\"Generate Point Data\" check box). If you are using radiance from the command line rather than the Ecotect interface, the best way I've found to save a grid file is to set the output to \"Daysim header\" and uncheck \"Auto-run Daysim\". The analysis grid will be in the specified folder, saved as a .pts file.\n\nI suggest looking through this tutorial for step by step guidance. http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf\n\nBest of luck.\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\n\nSent: Monday, March 18, 2013 8:48 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nI do not know if radiance supports 'analysis grid' or its equivalent but if it did, can I suspend one in 'mid-air' (say one at 30\" off the floor) and expect to get illuminance values off it?  Can it be a two-sided grid registering both the light coming off the ceiling and the floor?

Radiance polygons follow the \"right hand rule\", which means that a polygon that is planar to the x,y and drawn in a counter-clockwise fashion will have the surface normal running along the positive z axis.\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Mar 16, 2013, at 11:43 PM, Shamim Javed <javeds2006 at gmail.com<mailto:javeds2006 at gmail.com>> wrote:\nAndy,\n\nHow could you tell by just looking at the numbers that my ceiling surface normal was facing up?\n\nI am trying to import the results of the radiance simulation (with bands of light hitting the floor) on to an analysis grid to finally generate an illumination graph that would have progressive 'bumps' reflecting these light bands.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/owvm7gqtamicdou/analysis%20grid.pdf\nAny suggestions on an effective way of doing this would be much appreciated.\n\nMy radiance image has a distinct raddish tint unlike yours which came out with much more natural colors.

It seems odd that there is one reflection of the the floor but none off the ceiling (the light that gets to the floor comes straight through the window and misses the light shelf).  There should be the same number of reflections from both.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Fri, Mar 15, 2013 at 4:00 PM, Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:amcneil at lbl.gov>> wrote:\nShaim,\nCan you try typing the commands I sent directly at the dos prompt?\nThat would tell us if it is a problem with the outdated version of Radiance you are using or if it is a problem with the Ecotect Radiance Control Panel.  I still think it is a problem with the latter as the commands settings didn't get into the header created by Radiance.\n\nI'd rather determine if Ecotect related software is the cause now, rather than going further assuming that it is Radiance (which I doubt, but I am biased).\n\nAndy\n\nOn Fri, Mar 15, 2013 at 3:45 PM, Randolph M.
