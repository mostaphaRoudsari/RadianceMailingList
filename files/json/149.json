When I export a\nbunch of these to OBJ format, I end up with a 5MB file.  When I\nconvert that file to .rad format, it's 38 MB!\n\nSomehow, I don't think that's going to work.  It is not a complex\nform--the hardest parts to model are the bends in the bar--but I would\nprefer not to write code to do so.  Anyone have any thoughts?  Or\nwould it be better to start writing?\n\nRandolph\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Randolph Fritz", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Apr 2002 22:23:28 -0800"}
