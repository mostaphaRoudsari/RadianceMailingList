{"body": "\nHi Carolin,\n\nDid you end up having to use the manual build process? I thought our NREL builds of the Radiance source supported Mac all the way back to 10.6; if not, I'll have to look into how we might support earlier versions.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n________________________________________\nSent: Friday, March 29, 2013 4:41 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nSeems to work now, thanks a lot.\n\nCarolin\n\nGesendet: Donnerstag, 28.

The NREL Radiance installers are for OSX versions 10.7\nand 10.8. The \"Illegal instruction\" error means that the compiled binaries\nuse instructions that became available only in OSX 10.7.\n\nYour options seem to be: Upgrade to 10.7, or install and build Radiance\nmanually. Check out this page for instructions:\n\nhttp://radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1\n\nSorry about the incompatibility. We're here to help with the manual\ninstallation.\n\nMark\n\nOn Thu, 28 Mar 2013, Carolin Seib wrote:\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] beginner's installation problems", "sender": "carose at gmx.net", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32260B2DC041@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<trinity-17f1cd6a-6779-45e5-9025-e0d11f7167bc-1364473406781@3capp-gmx-bs27>,", "<Pine.LNX.4.64.1303281104550.8284@zaxxon.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>,", "<trinity-7660a8ec-ca81-44e4-b07a-a4eb308e9361-1364553689898@3capp-gmx-bs26>"], "datetime": "Sun, 31 Mar 2013 10:36:08 -0600", "email": "Carolin Seib", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] beginner's installation problems"}
