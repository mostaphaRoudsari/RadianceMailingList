{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nThe view defaults for genklemsamp are the same as the rendering programs, except that it assumes a parallel view (-vtl).  The view up vector will be +Z unless you specify otherwise.  So long as it isn't parallel to your view direction, as in the case of a horizontal skylight, you don't need to specify it.\n\nYou will need to specify the interior normal direction using the kbin() function defined in klems_int.cal for your \"view matrix\" calculation.  Just make sure these agree with what you give to genklemsamp.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130329/efd3977c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genklemsamp - surface orientation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C427D03E-7AC1-49CA-A42C-AEEBBAC73394@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<51560259.5080108@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 15:15:23 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genklemsamp - surface orientation"}
