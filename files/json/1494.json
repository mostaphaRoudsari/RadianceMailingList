There are several correlations of light depreciation with lightpipe\ndepth, and of course the light pipe reflectance is key to this. Most light\npipes are 97 - 99 per cent specular reflective. Could you please elaborate\nhow one would implement the glow material and brightfunc relative to a given\nrelation and light pipe reflectance?\n\nRegards,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n--\nThis message has been scanned for content and\nviruses by the DIT Information Services MailScanner\nService, and is believed to be clean.\nhttp://www.dit.ie\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Light pi", "tags": [], "sender": "Anthony J.
