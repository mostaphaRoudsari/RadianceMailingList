{"body": "\nEry,\n\nGerman is correct.  179 lumens/watt is the efficacy for uniform\ndistribution of visible light.  And only useful after you've converted to\nvisible energy.\n\nThe efficacy for the solar spectrum varies based on properties of the\natmosphere (which is constantly changing).  The efficacy for direct sun is\ngenerally 80-120 lumens/watt.  The efficacy for sky is typically 100-140\nlm/watt.  The efficacy of light on a facade is further complicated since it\nis a constantly changing mix of direct and sky.\n\nSorry I can't give you an easy number!\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 20, 2013 at 3:36 PM, Germ?n Molina Larrain <gmolina1 at uc.cl>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130320/de864739/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] illuminance on external facade", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixHRTT7ui-Awn2YXXUQ5ct39GjE=FFmFd7JBM6RzqAY3A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<514A38B1.3020801@gmail.com>", "<CAF-iH4+36O2OJXQT2O+S=DU1JTs3+oRScDGHo_RJ2g=_viv-Gw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 16:54:30 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] illuminance on external facade"}
