{"body": "\nYou will need at least one ambient bounce to calculate the contribution of an ambient \"glow\" source. Zero ambient bounces means only direct sources like \"light\" would be traced.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure, but the rpict manual says the -i option actually estimates the irradiance using the radiance value and the lambertian reflectance. I've never delved into the code, so I'm not sure how accurate that description is. After testing -ab 1, you might also try assigning a very small reflectance to your black surface.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130315/b710987a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient occlusion map ?", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052BDD0C853@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CADoMKs0cxWiPJDc_bHGKovPNK8W7TBiqeZ5tdQLB1z6LBp-CnA@mail.gmail.com>", "<2BCC3578EA36FE49A3EE485C490D2467145AD3@SRV-EX01.transsolar.local>", "<1363352613.73965.YahooMailNeo@web121701.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 10:57:05 -0400", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient occlusion map ?"}
