{"body": "\nFolks,\n\nI am stumped. There is a halo around a black box on a grey background\nin a rendering, and I can't figure out how to get rid of it (because I\ncan't imagine that it's real).\n\nI am preparing renderings for an art submission, and I am simulating a\nlittle model mountain inside a small flat black frame on a light grey\nwall, in a room with an array of ceiling lights and one spot. Here is\nwhat happens (rpict and mountain-removed rvu):\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/whyTheHaloMaster.png\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/whyTheHalo.png\n\nThe black material is plastic with 0.0 specularity.\nThe halo is independent of the ambient parameters.\nThe halo is independent of -lw refinement.\nThe halo is still there if the black box touches the wall or is offset a little.\nThe halo doesn't go away when I render at high resolution.\n\nCan anyone tell me what is going on here? Unzip and run \"make\" on:\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/whatGives.zip\n\nMark\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CADoMKs0cxWiPJDc_bHGKovPNK8W7TBiqeZ5tdQLB1z6LBp-CnA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 00:56:27 -0400", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Strange halo artifact in rendering"}
