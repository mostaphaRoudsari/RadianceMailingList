You need to make sure you have the latest\nHEAD release, as I suspect you picked up a buggy version of src/rt/\nambcomp.c or similar.  If you recompile with last night's HEAD and\nstill have problems, send me a list of the options you're using in\nmkillum and I'll see if I can figure it out.  I did my own test runs\nthis morning to check that it's behaving correctly, and I couldn't\nfind anything wrong.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: New rtcontrib program - mkillum conflict", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun Jun  5 21:48:52 2005"}
