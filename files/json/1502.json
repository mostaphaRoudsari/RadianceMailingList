{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nDoes anyone here know how to alter or adjust gensky's sun color?  I guess\nwhat I am looking for is a color that is warmer that the color that I am\nachieving now. This is for asthetic purposes but I want a solution that is\nphysically accurate. I have tried altering the day and time of day to\nachieve this but it seems that only the angle, height, and intensity of the\nsunlight is changed and not the color. I don't mind hard coding it in the\napplication if it necessasary if it isn't too messy. Any suggestions?\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F16FA1A4FDF2EB6425A9881A4930@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jan  6 17:02:22 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sun Color"}
