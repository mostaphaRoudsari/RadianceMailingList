{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI've been asked to model windows that have a film with 50% haze and\n91% transmission.\n\nI do not have a BSDF for the material. The best option I can think of\nis to use the trans material with 91% transmission and hope that it\nprovides about 50% haze. Does anyone have experience modeling film\nbased on haze? If so, any pointers? A tutorial I should look at?\n\nThanks,\nTim Perry\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Tim Perry", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAFVgASXeU4MQ6uSteN1zcfLdjTJ6OputgrqcNeG_odu4vSP9rg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 10:45:36 -0700", "email": "tim.v2.0 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling a film w/ 50% haze and 91% tranmission."}
