{"body": "\nPhD Studentship:\n\nApplicability of Climate-Based Daylight Modelling - Research into Practice\n\nLoughborough University - School of Civil and Building Engineering\n\nApplications are invited for a PhD Studentship starting in July 2013 to undertake research in climate-based daylight modelling and its application to solve traditional, novel and emerging problems in the daylighting design of buildings at all scales from individual spaces to urban settings. The work will be supervised by Prof. John Mardaljevic (Loughborough University) and Dr. Francesco Anselmo (Arup, London).\n\nTo be of practical use in industry, the disparate strands of CBDM research need to be synthesised to create a robust and authoritative modelling framework - one that has well defined stages, methodologies, quality assurance procedures, etc.  CBDM has been applied to a wide range of real-world projects, e.g., daylighting for museums. But it is still an unknown methodology for most practitioners.\n\nCBDM is constantly evolving, so one of the challenges will be to capture this 'moving target' and give shape and coherence to the future development of CBDM. In addition to working closely with industry, the project is aligned with the aims of two International Commission for Illumination (CIE) Technical Committees on CBDM and Daylighting. Thus the project will have significant impact on the future use and development of CBDM in both research and practice.\n\nThe candidate will work in close collaboration with Arup, and be expected to undertake visits/internships at Arup offices in London lasting a minimum of approximately three months over the duration of the project.\n\nhttp://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGG407/phd-studentship/\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease forward this to any suitable graduate interested in CBDM.\n\nAny interested parties should copy emails to Francesco Anselmo and myself.\n\nBest\nJohn\n\nJohn Mardaljevic\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/staff/profile/367.html<http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/>\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com<http://climate-based-daylighting.com/>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130402/1a32137f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AE2C06A5D4A79244AA0AB930A5BFD04B1481A886@ITSMBX-3.lunet.lboro.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 2 Apr 2013 19:58:39 +0000", "email": "J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] PhD studentship in climate-based daylightmodelling"}
