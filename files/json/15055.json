{"body": "\nHi Mike,\n\nAnyhere runs on a low-budget server that occasionally experiences problem.  In this case, something more serious is going on and I just wrote to the administrator (/ business owner) to find out what.  Hopefully, we'll have it sorted out in a day or two.  Meanwhile, I will e-mail you a copy of Photosphere.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  This probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, so I'll cross-post my reply there.  Any follow-up should happen on HDRI.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Photosphere and anyhere.com?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<09D839E4-5638-400F-A36A-D631B69AC28C@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<2DBE56A76E46FB4EB2AEEC29FCBD07784C272679@STAWINCOX10MBX1.staff.vuw.ac.nz>"], "datetime": "Thu, 11 Apr 2013 08:14:10 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Photosphere and anyhere.com?"}
