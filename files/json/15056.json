{"body": "\nHi Andy,\n\nI just tried installing this on Ubuntu and got a couple errors.  First it\ncomplained of not having a \"BSDFViewer\" directory.  Was this supposed to be\nin this .tar file?  So, I copied this same directory that was in a\n\"BSDFViewer1.2_ubuntu\" package I got from you and it runs until I get\nerrors like this for each file in BSDFViewer directory:\n\n/usr/bin/ld: i386 architecture of input file 'xxxxx.o' is incompatible with\ni386:x86-64 output\n\nIt also complains about not finding a \"libBSDF.so\" file.\n\nAm I missing some updated files or something else?\n\nThanks!\nZack\n\nOn Wed, Mar 27, 2013 at 11:21 AM, Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n211 North Public Road, Suite 220\nLafayette, CO 80026\n(303)946-2310\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130411/bd1ade36/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDFviewer", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAP856z+OiEJoNODb0HCwzNU2FtRvu2yWjjS3bCGO96-Pd_65w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAB4o_Vitdz4AZXS2x6k_fWhp-vWhhCFfUUsE+_R+01JfLapQSw@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAOG+NixxpAkwHkA3Hi=2SJ5-NnKUk7Yi1H5z5N6FrFQSnTUniQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 11 Apr 2013 16:21:10 -0600", "email": "zrogers at daylightinginnovations.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDFviewer"}
