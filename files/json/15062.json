{"body": "\nHi Andre,\nThanks for sending a report.  I'm gald you were able to get it to work.  It\nshouldn't need those other things to build libBSDF.so, so I'll see if I can\nremove the dependencies.\n\nWhat did you do to fix the jni_md.h location problem?  Did you copy it into\nthe correct place?\n\nThe WINDOW team want's to use this software (or a cleaned up versin of it)\nto display BSDFs from WINDOW, so it will have the ability to load a file\npassed as a command line argument eventually.\n\nThe best public documentation is available here (starting at slide 18):\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW3_Multires_BSDF.pdf\nbut that's not much to go on.\n\nI can also offer a few images of the tensor tree angle bsdf basis to help\nunderstand how the shirly-chiu mapping works with the hilbert curve:\nhttp://gaia.lbl.gov/people/andy/public/tensortree/\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 12, 2013 at 2:07 AM, Andre Kostro <andre.kostro at epfl.ch> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130412/71bd7dc7/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDFviewer", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NizfeD-coE+W080rv4zDA5VC1wj4_CpiPh+=jau5eMGddw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAB4o_VgCYrJkuqXV0TeAXn1Tn7dXXru4BPo6vmJPJ50oFRW9Rw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 12 Apr 2013 10:31:47 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDFviewer"}
