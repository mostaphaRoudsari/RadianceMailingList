{"body": "\nDear List,\n\n\n\nI have a problem that I hope the radiance community can help me\nunderstand.\n\n\n\nAssume you have simulated a scene with artificial light and you have set\nthe colour of the light to true white (R=G=B; approximate colour\ntemperature 6500k).\n\nI assume it should be possible in postprocessing to alter the colour\ntemperature of the light source and of the scene (assuming that's the\nonly light source) using some pcomb expression (different coefficients\nfor the RGB coordinates).\n\nDoes anybody have any pointer to the math required to calculate the\ncoefficient to change the light source from, say, 6500K to 3000K?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/af0c931f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Giovanni Betti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C30ABD686B@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 15:35:01 +0100", "email": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] change image color temperature"}
