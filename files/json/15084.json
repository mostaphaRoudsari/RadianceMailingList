{"body": "\nHi Aitor,\n\nThis question probably belongs on the radiance-dev list, so I am cross-posting there and ask you to sign up (if you haven't already) and respond on that list.  (Same goes for others -- thanks!)\n\nThe data order in the file is a matrix running from smallest to largest Klems patches, with the columns (inner loop data) corresponding to the input directions.  This is verified by a tag in the \"DataDefinition\" section that says:\n\n<IncidentDataStructure>Columns</IncidentDataStructure>\n\nIf \"Rows\" appears there instead of Columns, then the outgoing directions are the inner loop, but this would be unusual and probably not supported by WINDOW.\n\nThe units of a BSDF are 1/steradians.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to link to C code, you may also use the existing BSDF parser library included in the Radiance source tree to do the data loading and interpretation.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/b91be1b0/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF reader", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<6B069468-5FD9-4BF5-BB77-25B66447D0E6@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAOhSWL4G4Vi8xfkCWjKi2_-b=BPJma47sDJUAU+taJQiDdvdXQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:43:05 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF reader"}
