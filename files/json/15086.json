{"body": "\nVaib,\n\nThere is an important difference between the -i (lower case i) and -I\n(capital i) in rtrace.   When -i is given, rtrace will trace a ray in the\ndirection given, and then will calculate the hemispherical irradiance at\nthe point where the ray intersects with geometry (ignoring some material\ntypes).  With the -I command it calculates the hemispherical irradiance at\nthe point you specify using the direction vector as a a normal for the\nimaginary surface on which irradiance is calculated.\n\nUsers typically want -I, except for specialized cases.  You should make\nsure that  -i is correct for your case.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 22, 2013 at 4:44 AM, Vaib <vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/d603f755/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace direction", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Nix4+b6T0A_9-Ff73nEuWYoOwY4+0R+VrApYi0DCuM4wKw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD7gt0W1Tp89jr9b1E6-AZ6d_jtJwMk82tQ7qSM-WU_XoMVvNg@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAD7gt0WyjPQyoxBr2W=O1K0FBHu_9ormpuyxKBWYHBUJJuRVtg@mail.gmail.com>", "<51746090.7020603@gmx.net>", "<CAD7gt0Ww83MXiCdjhYjaoRfJ6wDkWSCuVJYkBy0Wesx8yS-7gw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 10:07:16 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtrace direction"}
