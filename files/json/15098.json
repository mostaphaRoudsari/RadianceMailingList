{"body": "\nDear List,\n\nI am a starter on the use of Radiance, and I have some doubts about the\nmodeling (of the real world, as it always is, in engineering at least). I\nhave heard that material reflectivity is a very important parameter that.\nHow important are:\n\n- Color (I am pretty sure I read something in this list about grey-world\nsimulations... I think it was Rob).\n- Textures\n- Specularities\n- Patterns\netc.\n\nMy concern is that defining materials is actually not a very easy task, so\nI just wanted to know what are the most important things here.\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH!\n\nGerman\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130426/223e4531/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4+NM-DzmVrqzNPHQL2unbhh39bsAt3yHUqOOT78M3UQew@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 26 Apr 2013 11:36:27 -0400", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling the real world for lighting analysis."}
