{"body": "\nDear Radiance users,\n\nThis is my first attempt on this forum to find how to integrate a fritted\npattern on an IGU.\nAs far as I get, I have generated from Optic 5 some data from the product I\nwas looking for.\n\nI got interested by this post:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000327.html\n\nbut how to integrate the definition of the fritted material (typically 50%\nfritted - white color) ? Looking deeper, it seems there is a script \"glaze\"\nthat can be used with Radiance but I couldn't find it\\used it.\n\nI am trying to follow these guidelines :\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/devalpine_visarc_glazing.pdf\n\nThanks a lot for your feedback.\n\nBest,\n\n\n\n--\nOlivier Brouard\n\nobrouard at gmail.com\nt: + 1 (415) 373 7808\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130423/6113b6ef/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Olivier Brouard", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CACWEaWzbhOBNsOaL6hTZsZj2MS5_1x9v2zhWuDdHfGaop=ne2w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 23 Apr 2013 17:43:22 -0700", "email": "obrouard at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] How to make fritted glass in radiance ?"}
