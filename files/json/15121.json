{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nThis is indeed very interesting. (And very cool, in my opinion!)\n\nI have been looking for a low-cost platform to do HDR image generation (in\nthe field) with the program HDRGEN, the command-line HDR image builder.\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/\n\nAny idea how long it would take the Pi to composite 7 .JPG images (say\nabout 1000px by 1000px in dimension) into an HDR image?.\n\n(Then i would do a bit of analysis with Radiance and send some commands to\ncontrol physical devices)\n\nBest,\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Apr 20, 2013 at 12:03 PM, Mark Stock <mstock at umich.edu> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/c9b66664/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance on Raspberry Pi", "sender": "Kyle Konis", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAzVHq0wmsNW7mYcAKbqaZnkqPuPoDcfPQT+1G9FAu7=nvSvfw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CADoMKs0G_pqF27LNQJu0CkK3n5GUobxi10qwK2-D=ydZhu=1Ow@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 14:49:46 -0700", "email": "kskonis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance on Raspberry Pi"}
