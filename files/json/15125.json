{"body": "\nHi Aitor,\n\nI recommend considering using the BSDF parser library from Radiance if you\ncan.  The library has load and query routines to get everything you need.\nIt supports both Klems and TensorTree BSDFs without any need to\ndifferentiate between them your side.\n\nI used it for BSDF viewer, and it would have been a breeze if I didn't need\nto use Java Native Interface in the process.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 22, 2013 at 9:43 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/e839f25c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] [Radiance-dev]  BSDF reader", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NiwcRCM0TBJxX2164XjGOmSPTdJOSRueSuaA=Xr9Pbzm6Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOhSWL4G4Vi8xfkCWjKi2_-b=BPJma47sDJUAU+taJQiDdvdXQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<6B069468-5FD9-4BF5-BB77-25B66447D0E6@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:54:40 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] [Radiance-dev]  BSDF reader"}
