There's a formula to calculate a good value, which I think is part of what the rad command does if the scene dimensions are set smaller than your whole octree. If your rendering doesn't take too long you could just try increasing it arbitrarily, maybe jump up to 1000 to look for any benefit. You could also try setting -as around 500 instead of the default 128.\n\nThose are the quick and easy things to try, but the recommendations from Rob and Greg might be even better or faster.\n\n\nMy ambient parameters were (the rest are all defaults):\n\n-ab 8 -ad 2000 -aa 0.05 -ar 256\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130417/b159ef30/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering parameters help and weird colors", "sender": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052C28D63A8@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CAF-iH4LQxMrNP0OHtMkE_c2DJtZm2ruN5H4x-EcaYQQqwjrK4g@mail.gmail.com>", "<CD942852.1D284%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CAF-iH4Ltd0NrGeRhJFs=vD4cZ7MjyHNMKZRLLE91urgihgO1AA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 12:58:14 -0400", "email": "Germ?n Molina Larrain", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering parameters help and weird colors"}
