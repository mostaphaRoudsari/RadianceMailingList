{"body": "\nDear List,\n\nSo I have been rendering with some interesting features in SketchUp, like\nexporting landscapes (hills and mountains) from GoogleEarth.\n\nHere is a link for you to understand what I am talking\nabout<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ltv125db6hjp74a/hsnL6S-_JI>\n\nAnyway, I have been rendering some stuff and I have two doubts:\n\n1.- My environment is basically grey, but only the mountain near my\nbuilding is brown; but everything has turned to be brown (as can be seen in\nImage2)... is that the \"color bleeding\" (or something like that)? Is that a\ngood result? or there is a problem with my modeling?\n\n2.- As can be seen in Image (the one that shows the interior of the\nbuilding, looking out), there are some weird effects, making my image to\nlook as it was painted with a brush or something. What is the parameter\nthat would help me reduce that?\n\nI am not sure why in Dropbox the images look much more darker than in my\nPC. They were created using rpict, and then filtered with \"pfilt -x /2 -y\n/2 image.hdr > image.tiff\"\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\nGerman\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130417/5e61837a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4LQxMrNP0OHtMkE_c2DJtZm2ruN5H4x-EcaYQQqwjrK4g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 12:12:02 -0400", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering parameters help and weird colors"}
