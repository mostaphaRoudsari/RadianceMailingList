{"body": "\nThank you, Santiago\n\n?type? doesn?t work but now that I know that it is a unix command I will see if I can find a windows command that will.\n\nAnd you are right I had a ?1? instead of a lower case L.  works now.\n\nThanks!\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n\nSent: Wednesday, May 08, 2013 6:24 PM\nTo: 'Radiance general discussion'\nHi,\n\ncat is a Unix program, so it should be available under OSX and Linux, but not under Windows. Wikipedia says the command ?type? is an equivalent, but I haven?t tried it.\n\nAbout genprism, I think the argument before the vector should be -l (lower case ?L?) not -1 (the number one), I?m not sure which one you?ve used, but may be worth checking.\n\nHope this helps.\nSantiago\n\n\n\nSent: 2013?5?9? 7:42\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nI?m working through the tutorials in Rendering with Radiance & have 2 commands that I?m having trouble with so far.\n\n\n1.       !cat (concatenate)  - from page 80 in book - Scene 1 Tutorial, section 2.5 - is this still a valid command?  I couldn?t find an executable file for it in my  Radiance directory & a search online didn?t bring up reference to it either.    The error I get when I try to run oconv is ?Can?t find executable for ?cat? .system - cannot execute ?!cat ./lib/table_1.rad?\n\n\n\n2.       Genprism - from page 53 in book - I can run genprism if I don?t put in the final 4 extrusion factors.   What am I doing wrong?\nIf I run the command as written in the book:  genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_sw 4 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -1 0 0 2.5 > look.txt\nI get the following error:               Usage:  genprism material name { - | vfile | N v1 v2 .. vN} [-1 1vect] [-r radius] [-c][-e]\n\nIf I run the command without the extrusion vector (final 4 #?s) it creates the prism with the ?z? values at 1 which I?m guessing is the default.\n\nThank you for help!!\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130509/bec3cf57/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Beginners Questions", "sender": "shouck at brummitt.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7EB5C8890A170241BC188DA82FBCA3CC4BB06108@BY2PRD0410MB353.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>", "refs": ["<7EB5C8890A170241BC188DA82FBCA3CC4BB05E29@BY2PRD0410MB353.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>", "<E0B3AE7CA2BFA7479FB4A93F66B48F5119412CEAF4@E-AEXC02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 9 May 2013 15:44:17 +0000", "email": "Sandy Houck", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Beginners Questions"}
