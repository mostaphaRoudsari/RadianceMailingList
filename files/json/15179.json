{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI did a validation against the test cases in chapter 5 (test cases with\nanalytical references) of CIE 171:2006 about 2 years ago for an internal\nevaluation. The report that contains the results is all in german, however,\nthe numbers are \"international\" :-). So together with the results from\nchapter 4 (experimental test cases; I presented parts of them at the\nworkshop in 2008, the overall chapter 4 results are in my thesis) I should\nhave results for all test cases in the CIE report.\nThere should be some more proposals for test cases in chapter 6 of CIE 171,\nhowever, if I remember right they are somewhat unclear and not properly\nspecified.\n\nGreg, I will send you the report off-list, and if necessary can also take\nsome time to translate it...\n\nBest,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/5/9 Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com>\n\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
