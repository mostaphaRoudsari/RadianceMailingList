My guess is that it was simply averaging the pixels together to come up with an average RGB value.  I've done similar things with photoshop, but this method is a far cry from what the actual measured reflectances would be, and is only a visual attempt at getting it close.\n\n.8 .8 .8 sounds too high for wood.  I think wood (depending on the type is around ~.2 to ~.4 depending on the wood).  Check your radiance's lib directory.  I believe there are some old materials files that include wood definitions.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMark\n\nHi, Dear friends:\n\nI am trying to map pictures to simulate the texture of wood, carpet and so on.\nI use ra_tiff to convert a .tif picture into a .pic picture, and then use colorpict to map it such as:\n\nvoid colorpict image01\n9 clip_r clip_g clip_b 02.pic picture.cal frac(U) frac(V) -s 500\n0\n0\n\nimage01 plastic wood_mat\n0\n0\n5 .8 .8 .8 .02 0\n\nI found that the properties of plastic material like \"5 .8 .8 .8 .02 0\" influence the result greatly. how should I set them properly?\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nYours,\n\nHuang\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050616/6bf4279a/attachment.html\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 16, Issue 11\n************************************************\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050616/64d655f2/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "datetime": "Mon Jun 20 19:23:09 2005"}
