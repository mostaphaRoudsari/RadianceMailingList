Never actually used a BRTDfunc so I will have to look at that more closely.\n\nAnyway, I went ahead tried to put a couple of cal files together since only one of our computers could handle the 3D grid despite my efforts, and got lucky with this one.  It seems to work great even though I'm not completely sure what the mod function is really doing.\n\nThanks for responding.\n\nMark de la Fuente\n\ngrid.cal\n\n{\nThe cal file for a \"wire\" mesh consisting of vertical cables holding up horizontal rods.\nThis file could really be used to make any pladlike combination of two materials.\nThe file is written around vertical surfaces.  If a horizontal grid  or some other orientation is desired, xform the material or modify the cal file.\n\nA1 = Width of vertical members\nA2 = Vertical member on center spacing\nA3 = Horizontal member\nA4 = Horizontal member on center spacing\n\nAn example of how this would be used to cut rectangular holes out of a wall:\n\nvoid plastic wall\n0\n0\n5 .5 .5 .5 0 0\n\nvoid mixfunc grid_wallx\n4 void wall grid_x grid.cal\n0\n4 .1 .5 .05 1\n\ngrid_wallx polygon box.1540\n0\n0\n12 ...\n\n}\n\ngrid_x = if( f_grid_x, 1, 0 );\ngrid_y = if( f_grid_y, 1, 0 );\n\nf_grid_x = and( grid_vert, grid_horiz(Px) ) ;\nf_grid_y = and( grid_vert, grid_horiz(Py) ) ;\n\ngrid_vert = mod(Pz,A2) - A1 ;\ngrid_horiz(rod) = mod(rod,A4) - A3;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 2\nMessage-ID: <58DC6471-8DB7-4F34-B9A6-8B31647D7501@gmail.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; delsp=yes; format=flowed\n\nHi Mark,\n\nThere is a file called grating.cal that models depth of 3-D grids and\nuses a BRTDfunc type to approximate the ensemble behavior.  I posted\nit in response to a similar request from Richard Clibborn:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-\nFebruary/002438.html\n\nIf you want the actual appearance of the blinds, rather than simply\nits transmission at a distance, then a mixfunc is required.  I don't\nhave time to write one right now, or even modify Georg's.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050619/c8b050ad/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward@gmail.com", "datetime": "Sat, 18 Jun 2005 09:13:45 -0700"}
