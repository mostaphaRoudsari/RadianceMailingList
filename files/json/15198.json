{"body": "\nHi Ogata,\n\nIt looks like you are trying to create a BSDF for a single layer system,\nwhere the single layer is a shading layer.  Unfortunately, this can't be\ndone in Window.  There's really no reason Window couldn't do the optical\ncalculations for a single shading layer, but Window can't do thermal\ncalculations for a system that allows free air movement through.  And since\nWindow has one \"calculate\" button that does everything single layer shading\nsystems have been prohibited.\n\nThe annoying work around is:\n1. add a layer of glass to your system.\n2. turn on debug output by checking the box in preferences/options - this\noutputs csv files containing transmission and reflection data for each layer\n3. copy the data from the shading layer csv file for front and back\ntransmission and reflection and paste into the appropriate tags of the xml\nfile.\n4. fix other xml tags as necessary (for example you could change the\nthickness but I don't think it is necessary for Radiance)\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, May 14, 2013 at 6:16 AM, Germ?n Molina Larrain <gmolina1 at uc.cl>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130514/a18f60f0/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Transmission Matrix.", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Nixpc=jTggvZQ+ij2qQ1idX-=tuKRFqtnGAxjzEZw4qrQw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<522091.90512.qm@web100707.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>", "<6A316912-D07F-4B75-917C-ED7DE139A5DE@lmi.net>", "<627538.93092.qm@web100718.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>", "<24314261-6314-457E-8854-32592B1D5FEB@lmi.net>", "<CAF-iH4KJDn3Qyfrg5u6n1n54fehPkvMsHp_ySZo8MpGifHiqwg@mail.gmail.com>", "<870581.71832.qm@web100718.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>", "<CAF-iH4KBCRkOtKEnkr0ZZ=6tJigaGmxJp7uAZbJJgzYpNhBqrA@mail.gmail.com>", "<307357.83013.qm@web100711.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>", "<CAF-iH4Lq-vFHVkcojO38+E+_u_jXf9WK1_cgOSqNCGkiVOMH1w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 14 May 2013 16:49:48 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Transmission Matrix."}
