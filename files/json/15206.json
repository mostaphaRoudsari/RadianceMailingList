{"body": "\nHi Rob & Greg,\n\nActually I can get 'type' to work at the command line - outside the scene txt file - (I had the slashes the wrong way first).  I just can't seem to 'call' it when creating the oct file if it is a line in the scene txt file like the 'cat' program is shown from page 80 of the book \"!cat lib/table_1.rad\".\n\nMy understanding from the 'cat' command in the tutorial is that it will append those files to the end of the octree - making my scene file less cumbersome.  (Please correct if I am not understanding that correctly!).\n\nIf I replace the cat line above with \"type lib/table_1.rad\" and do oconv I get the error \"can't find executable for type\".  However if I go to command line & use \"type .\\lib\\table_1.rad >> scene1.all\" it will append the table_1 file to the end of scene1.all.\n\nWhich is fine with me since I'm incredibly happy when something works!! But I'm guessing having that simple line in the scene file, which makes the scene file smaller will come in very handy when I'm doing more complex projects.\n\nI wasn't able to get the 'program' command to work at either the command line or from within the txt file.\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck??

When you say it \"didn't work\", what do you mean? Is the command there but complaining about a syntax error, or does your system complain that 'type' is an unknown command? Because type is standard on Windows, at least XP and 7?\n\n- Rob\n\nOn May 9, 2013, at 9:44 AM, Sandy Houck <shouck at brummitt.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Beginners Questions", "sender": "rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7EB5C8890A170241BC188DA82FBCA3CC4BB06180@BY2PRD0410MB353.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>", "refs": ["<7EB5C8890A170241BC188DA82FBCA3CC4BB05E29@BY2PRD0410MB353.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>", "<E0B3AE7CA2BFA7479FB4A93F66B48F5119412CEAF4@E-AEXC02.global.arup.com>", "<7EB5C8890A170241BC188DA82FBCA3CC4BB06108@BY2PRD0410MB353.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>", "<7EF38D6B-1871-444E-9C5C-5D17F4EB24F3@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 9 May 2013 16:46:40 +0000", "email": "Rob Guglielmetti", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Beginners Questions"}
