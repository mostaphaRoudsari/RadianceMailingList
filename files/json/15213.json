{"body": "\nI'm working through the tutorials in Rendering with Radiance & have 2 commands that I'm having trouble with so far.\n\n\n1.       !cat (concatenate)  - from page 80 in book - Scene 1 Tutorial, section 2.5 - is this still a valid command?  I couldn't find an executable file for it in my  Radiance directory & a search online didn't bring up reference to it either.    The error I get when I try to run oconv is \"Can't find executable for \"cat\" .system - cannot execute \"!cat ./lib/table_1.rad\"\n\n\n\n2.       Genprism - from page 53 in book - I can run genprism if I don't put in the final 4 extrusion factors.   What am I doing wrong?\nIf I run the command as written in the book:  genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_sw 4 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -1 0 0 2.5 > look.txt\nI get the following error:               Usage:  genprism material name { - | vfile | N v1 v2 .. vN} [-1 1vect] [-r radius] [-c][-e]\n\nIf I run the command without the extrusion vector (final 4 #'s) it creates the prism with the 'z' values at 1 which I'm guessing is the default.\n\nThank you for help!!\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130508/faff08b1/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sandy Houck", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<7EB5C8890A170241BC188DA82FBCA3CC4BB05E29@BY2PRD0410MB353.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 8 May 2013 23:41:56 +0000", "email": "shouck at brummitt.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Beginners Questions"}
