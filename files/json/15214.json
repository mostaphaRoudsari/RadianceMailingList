{"body": "\nGreat idea. We had planned to use the test cases in CIE 171:2006 for validating the Radiance implementation in OpenStudio, but this effort had to get scaled down in the interest of time. I like the idea of hosting a site (similar to Mark Stock's benchmark site (http://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench.html)) where individuals could report their own results. I would like to throw NREL's hat into the ring for hosting such a thing, with the caveat that Greg brings up about copyright issues over CIE 171. Maybe some folks closer to CIE (John M?) could weigh in on this. We could of course just post the results, and anyone wishing to either perform the validations or to understand the meaning behind the results would have to get their hands on the document. That doesn't seem like too much of a burden to software developers or to scholars of lighting simulation, after all.\n\n- Rob\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wednesday, May 08, 2013 1:08 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nCc: Ian Ashdown\nMy friend and fellow lighting software author, Ian Ashdown, gave me the following message for the Radiance community.\n\nIan is responsible for the creation and development of the AGi32 simulation engine, which is widely regarded in the lighting design community (for good reason).  He has suggested that it would be a good idea for one or more persons to undertake a validation of Radiance based on CIE 171:2006, a suite of sample lighting scenes with known numerical solutions.  I believe Radiance has been partially validated against this dataset.  In particular, Mike Donn posted a request for more information with a couple of references to others' work along these lines in 2011:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008173.html\n\n(Corrected links from post: <http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2008-fribourg/Content/Geisler-Moroder/RW2008_DGM_AD.pdf> and <http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2011/P_1146.pdf>)\n\nI don't know of anyone who has gone through the entire CIE 171 test set, but this is what Ian proposes.  Note that there are some tests to watch out for, and whoever works on this will probably be talking to me at multiple points.  I look forward to learning something new in the conversation.\n\nOne way to approach this would be to set up a wiki or plone site where individuals could upload their validation tests and open them up for comments.  This would require some public documentation of the CIE 171 tests, and this is where it all gets a bit fuzzy.  I don't have this document and if we were to purchase it, I am uncertain as to the legality of sharing (portions of) it.\n\nIdeas and further suggestions are welcome.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nThis is an academic  challenge for the Radiance community.\n\nValidation of lighting design and analysis software has been an issue within the architectural lighting design community since the first commercial programs were released in the 1980s. Several studies were performed for physical spaces, the most notable being:\n\nDiLaura, D. L., D. P. Igoe, P. G. Samara, and A. M. Smith. 1988.\n\"Verifying the Applicability of Computer Generated Pictures to Lighting Design,\" Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society 17(1):36-61.\n\nwhere the authors constructed and measured the proverbial empty rectangular room while carefully monitoring and controlling photometer calibration, ambient temperature, luminaire voltage, ballast-lamp photometric factors, lamp burn-in and other light loss factors, surface reflectances, accurate photometric data reports, and other issues.\n\nSuch studies are useful for interior lighting designs, but considerably less so for daylight studies where it is nearly impossible to measure, let alone control, the sky conditions.\n\nThey are also mostly pointless for complex spaces with occlusions and non-diffuse reflective surfaces. Regardless of how carefully the room parameters might be modeled and controlled, the results only apply to that particular space.\n\nThe alternative is to develop a series of test cases with known analytic solutions based on radiative flux transfer theory. This became the premise\nfor:\n\nMaamari, F., M. Fontoynont, and N. Adra. 2006. \"Application of the CIE Test Cases to Assess the Accuracy of Lighting Computer Programs,\" Energy and Buildings 38:869-877.\n\nand:\n\nCIE 171:2006, \"Test Cases to Assess the Accuracy of Lighting Computer Programs.\" Wein, Austria: Commission International de l'Eclairage.\n\nAt least lighting software companies,  DIAL (www.dial.de) and Lighting Analysts (www.agi32.com), validated their software products with respect to CIE 171:2006. It does not appear however that anyone has done this for Radiance.\n\nAs a Radiance community member, you may rightly ask, \"Is this even necessary?\" Numerous studies have demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of Radiance, which may rightly claim the title of being the gold standard for lighting simulation software. (I am saying this as the Senior Research Scientist for Lighting Analysts, by the way.)\n\nMy answer is yes, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nLighting Analysts engaged an independent third party called Dau Design & Consulting (www.dau.ca/ddci ) to perform the CIE 171 validation tests using\nAGi32 in 2007. The full report is available here:\n\nwww.agi32.com/Downloads/TechnicalDocs/Report%20on%20AGI%2032%20validation%20of%20CIE%20171_Compiled_070620.pdf.\n\nWhat was interesting about the tests was that AGi32 failed a number of them on the first pass. As simple as they are, the results were dependent on such things as the surface meshing parameters and convergence limits (for radiosity calculations). Roughly equivalent parameters for ray tracing would be the number of rays and the number of reflections.\n\nIt was easy enough to optimize the parameters obtain the best results, which is what an experienced user would likely do anyhow for complex environments.\n\nNote that I said \"experienced user\"; that is, someone who has learned by trial and error what works best for a given software product. CIE 171:2006 has the potential (so far unrealized) of providing beginning users with a cookbook of sorts to document and choose the best rendering parameters for various situations. This alone would be valuable, but it becomes even more useful when the user needs to work with two or more lighting simulation programs and hopefully obtain similar results.\n\nValidating AGi32 against CIE 171:2006 also led to a few puzzles where no amount of parameter tweaking produced acceptable results. Further in-depth analysis proved that the tests themselves were incorrect, being based in invalid assumptions. These are documented in the report, but sadly CIE Division 3 has not seen the need to issue an amendment to CIE 171. There are at least also two other tests (5.13 and 5.14) that have been called into question.\n\nThese issues notwithstanding, CIE 171:2006 is a useful document, which leads to the academic challenge ...\n\nValidation of Radiance against CIE 171:2006 involves more than just setting up a few simple models and running the tests. There will undoubtedly be test cases where the calculated results do not even begin to agree with the published results. Optimizing the program parameters will demand an in-depth understanding of what they actually mean and do, and so offer a valuable learning experience for students doing for example a class project.\n\nDigging deeper, there will likely be other issues with the test cases where invalid assumptions lead to incorrect published results, subtle or otherwise. Just because CIE 171:2006 was derived from a PhD thesis does not mean that it is entirely correct. This, combined with proposals for more rigorous and comprehensive tests, could form the basis for an interesting MSc thesis. (The tests are mostly derived from radiative flux transfer theory and as such are aimed at radiosity-based methods. If these are not suitable for ray tracing methods, what would be reasonable equivalent\ntests?)\n\nFinally, it would alleviate a lot of angst regarding lighting software validation in the architectural lighting design community if the major commercial and open source products were validated against CIE 171:2006 (with acknowledgement that there are no overall pass/fail results). Ideally, each company or software developer would conduct the tests in-house because they know their products best. The catch here is that they would then be expected to publicly post both the results and their test models so that anyone could use their products to confirm the test results. This would ensure that the test results remain valid as the products undergo continual improvement.\n\nIn terms of Radiance, it could be a community effort, with various people contributing test models and proposing best parameter settings. In addition to providing a useful \"best practices\" guide for Radiance, this would likely result in Radiance validating CIE 171:2006. It would also be welcomed as a valuable contribution by the architectural lighting design community.\n\nIan Ashdown, P.
