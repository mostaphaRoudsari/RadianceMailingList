{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI have made a version of the gendaymtx program that uses an EnergyPlus file\n(called epw2daymtx). It has all the other options available in gendaymtx,\nbut I added some new:\n\n- It allows interpolation for subhourly analysis.\n- Allows overwriting the latitude-longitude-timezone from the weather file.\n\nIn case someone wants to try it and check for bugs and that kind of stuff,\nlet me know! I compared a few cases, and it worked well.\n\nTHANKS\n\nGerman\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130605/1dda30ee/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4+zQimU3UnDovAcKW2KVFdgp=Cs2eJUKM8zMtD54GGnEw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 12:06:18 -0400", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] .epw to Daylight Matrix"}
