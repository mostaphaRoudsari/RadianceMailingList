{"body": "\nHi Mike,\n\nthis looks strange - indeed! The first glare source has an error in the\nx-y location (nan). There was on older version of evalglare (1.00-1.02),\nwhich had some problems when one pixel of a glare source was located\ndirectly at the border. but this is fixed for the current version.\nWhat version of evalglare (type evalglare -v) are you using and what\nfish-eye type is used for the image?\nCan you send me such an hdr (not to the group, directly to my email\nadress jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de).\n\nJan\n\n\nOn 06/05/2013 07:46 PM, Michael Martinez wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
