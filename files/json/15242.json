{"body": "\nHi Nassif,\n\nRadiance includes a script called \"vinfo\" that allows you to edit the information header of an image.  I'm not sure what view parameters evalglare needs from the header, but at minimum, you should include the -vh and -vv parameters in a \"VIEW= -vtv -vh [deg] -vh [deg]\" specification.  Photosphere sometimes adds such a line if it can figure out the camera lens settings from the Exif header.\n\nNo need to upgrade your Mac OS version if you're having issues with evalglare.  I don't think that has anything to do with it.  More likely, you don't have the latest version of it.  Maybe Jan can chime in with some advice.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130620/14eb9ac7/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Photos with evalglare", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A3B54464-ED3A-4F89-9DCF-35FB618EE451@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAOQvQdmx2cvqJ9NSJ11YYFFbeptTifXgmRdb4EGqKnBHMrJMhA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 09:31:53 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR Photos with evalglare"}
