{"body": "\nHi Nassif,\n\nthe most important thing is, that you KNOW what is your type of lens you\nare using. Then you have to \"transfer\" its specification into correct\nradiance view parameters.\nwhat you need is view type, horizontal and vertical size of the image.\n\nIf you look at the documentation of evalglare you can see, that you can\nspecify the view type when calling evalglare (you don't have to add the\nview spec to the HDR file):\n\n/In case, the view settings within the image are missing or are not\nvalid (e.g. after the use of pcompos or pcomb), the view options can be\nset by command line options. As soon as view options are set within the\ncommand line, view options within the image are ignored. The view\noptions are implemented according to the RADIANCE definition (please\nread man page of rpict for details)://\n//-vtt Set view type to t. (for fish-eye views, please use --vta or\n--vth preferably)//\n//-vf viewfile Get view parameters from file.//\n//-vv val Set the view vertical size to val.//\n//-vh val Set the view horizontal size to val.//\n/\nAnd be sure using the latest version of evalglare (1.11).\n\nGood luck!\n\nJan\n\n\nOn 06/19/2013 10:21 AM, nassif nassif wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
