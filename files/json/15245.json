{"body": "\nHi German!\n\n\nDid you think about in what use cases radiosity may be faster, and in\nwhich it wouldn't? And are you aware of the \"hybrid\" rendering approach\nused by Radiance? Especially the way that the ambient cache is working\nas a means to accelerate the stochastic diffuse-indirect calculation\nthat a radiosity renderer aims at?\n\n\nI think most of this is already happening when you are using the ambient\ncache.\n\n\nIf you want to do this using scripts and the available tools, you could\nstep through all surfaces in a scene file. There are tools to do the\nsampling available.\n\n\nYou can tell rtrace to output object names instead of radiance or\nirradiance values. You can also get both the name of the object and its\nradiance. This would even allow to add the radiance value of a scene\nwith -ab 0 and the precalculated \"radiosity\" value. Somehow what most\nradiosity renderers do to achieve sharp shadows (they add a\nraytracing-step for direct calculation).\n\nStill I have doubts that this can be faster than the current\nimplementation.... :)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiosity method implementation on Radiance", "sender": "Lars O.
