For this fixture, my illum box\nis 4' x 1'9\" x 2'6\", encompassing the reflector, supports, and lamp for\neach arm.  The central support arm does pass through this illum box, but\nmost candelas are going forward so I do not think this is causing\nsignificant inaccuracies in the resulting distribution.  I think the\nshadow lines on the floor are a little more intense because of this but\nthat's about it.  Any issues with applying ies data to such a large\nillum box?\n\nThanks for the suggestions!  Have you been successful using replmarks -x\nfor light sources in your renderings?  I think the double use of\nreplmarks -x (once for the 4 ies files, and then again for my final\nplacement) may be causing my problems now.\n\nZack\n\n--\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Luminaire octr", "tags": [], "sender": "Zack Rogers", "datetime": "Thu Jun 23 20:15:54 2005"}
