{"body": "\nHi Germ?n,\n\naeons ago I hacked up a primitive radiosity thingy for RADIANCE in an afternoon to compare with our measurements for validation of diffuse interreflection. It's actually embedded in the rendering engine and may not compile with the current release anymore, but it might be worth looking at to give you some ideas on how (not?) to do it. As I recall, it used a standard relaxation method and a fixed quadrilateral mesh, so nothing fancy.\n\nLet me know if you're interested and I'll excavate that ancient artifact.\n\nRegards,\n\n--Roland\n\n\n--\n\"END OF LINE\" [MCP, 1982]\n\n\nOn 21/06/2013, at 2:57 PM, \"Lars O.
