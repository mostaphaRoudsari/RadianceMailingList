{"body": "\nDid no one respond to this?\n\nThere isn't really such a thing as \"average luminance\" for a surface.  It has to be \"average luminance for a surface from a specific view,\" which sounds like what you are discussing.  In this context, I don't think it makes much difference whether you average by pixel solid angle or not, as it tends to change slowly over an image.  Similarly, the view type does not matter very much to the result.\n\nIf you actually want to know the significance of an object's luminance to glare or the like, then you don't want to average luminance at all -- you want the contribution to vertical illuminance as a sum of pixels times projected solid angle.  For this, simply adding up pixels from a hemispherical fisheye is the easiest method.\n\nThe whole notion of luminance contrasts in a viewing environment is ill-conceived in my opinion.  Originally, the rule of thumb was a maximum contrast ratio of 3:1, which no reasonable space actually achieves.  One specular highlight will ruin your whole metric!\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130621/9937c764/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminance contrast calculation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<17813300-F0C3-41D4-976B-0F5B06C3AED3@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAAZQWqjGFjDxnUEGA0itjt-f78E_cPBSKfVPobdsjSutX4=pSg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 11:58:48 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Luminance contrast calculation"}
