{"body": "\nDear Shri,\n\nI believe that Norbert Lechner has some construction drawings on his web site. I am usually borrowing a very simple heliodon from Lam Partners for the MIT daylighting class. The best forum to post this question on is the Society of Building Science Educators. A key discussion to have is of course what one can actually do with heliodon measurements.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 7714, f: 617 253 6152, creinhart at mit.edu<mailto:creinhart at mit.edu>\nSustainable Design Lab<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/> | DIVA<http://www.diva4rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://daysim.ning.com/> | mapdwell<http://www.mapdwell.com/> | umi<http://www.urbanmodeling.net/>\n\nUpcoming Events\nJuly 10-12  Harvard Executive Education on Daylighting Buildings<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-1>\nJuly 15       DIVA Day<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013> 2013 in New York\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Thursday, June 27, 2013 6:22 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nDear All,\nI am aware that this is not directly related to the discussion group but I am sure the experts here most likely have the know-how or connections related to this.\n\nA colleague of mine would like to construct a heliodon for academic and experimental purposes at a university. Could someone please point to any resources/people with the construction drawings that can be used to construct this? (most likely this will be built by the students themselves or semi-skilled workers).\nThanks in advance,\n\nShri\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130627/14b9cef2/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Construction drawings for a Heliodon", "sender": "shrikarbhave at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FF28185@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": ["<CABL0RjevCqCVRtxzet_k2D1ZojLZPgACc0gXHt7r00PTrQ3iDQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 12:48:56 +0000", "email": "Shrikar Bhave", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Construction drawings for a Heliodon"}
