{"body": "\nIs the intention to check if speed improvements are possible? It could be a lot of work for potentially little gain. Maybe there are already validation/benchmark studies that could show it takes X minutes to get within 10% of a known solution with radiosity and Y minutes to get within 10% of the same solution with Radiance.\n\nOr maybe radiosity is perceived to be faster, but you have a scenario that your favorite radiosity software doesn't handle well? Maybe Radiance only handles the scenario of interest well because it doesn't use radiosity.\n\nI suppose since Radiance is open source, there is a potential path toward implementing radiosity into Radiance - whereas most radiosity software (AGI, Dialux, etc.) would not accommodate a homespun version implementing a Perez sky for example or outputting an HDR image for use in evalglare.\n\nKeep in mind that adapting Radiance to a radiosity method probably requires to ignore (or otherwise account for) the specular reflection component defined as part of any material type. In many scenes this may be unimportant.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiosity method implementation on Radiance", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B0599D50F573@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CAF-iH4+CAZ1CanJvKdq0vM0_Xmw0uCh-a5y3tp3ODbQX90J9Uw@mail.gmail.com>", "<51C45BBE.2010801@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 10:54:15 -0400", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiosity method implementation on Radiance"}
