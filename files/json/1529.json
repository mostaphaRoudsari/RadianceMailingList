I have researched the following site to get some background about\nthis:\n\nhttp://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/\n\nresponse by Greg to a previous question that I had for adjusting the sun\ncolor:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002263.html\n\nMy question is how may I convert from a CIE(x,y) chromaticity to RGB using\non two variables as was performed for the above. The Radiance function file\nxyz_rgb.cal requires three variables (x,y and the luminosity, z). The reason\nwhy I am asking this is because I wish for the values that I'll employ to be\nin the physically valid range (i.e. .265074126*r + .670114631*g +\n.064811243*b = 1).\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Thu Jun 23 21:21:24 2005"}
