{"body": "\nHi Greg and All,\n\nIn brief follow-up to this, I want to sanity check myself. For the 3\nphase method:\n\n* vmx - for rcontrib klems_int.cal needs the normal from the glazing\nsurface pointing to the interior, eg <0,1,0> for a south facing window\n* dmx - for genklemsamp the view direction is the normal direction\npointing outside, the opposite of what is used for vmx, eg <0,-1,0>\nfor a south facing window\n\nLastly, as long as a glazing surface is not facing straight up, that is\na skylight parallel to the ground plane, then then an up direction of\n<0,0,1> can be used.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 3/29/2013 6:15 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130605/727249d4/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genklemsamp - surface orientation", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<51AF968E.8080506@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<51560259.5080108@visarc.com>", "<C427D03E-7AC1-49CA-A42C-AEEBBAC73394@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 05 Jun 2013 15:50:38 -0400", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genklemsamp - surface orientation"}
