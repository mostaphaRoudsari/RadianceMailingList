Rayfront can create that for you as well.\n\nIf it works at all (eg. if there's no issue about intersecting\nbounding boxes), then it should be possible to get the desired\neffect within or without Rayfront. As all of Rayfront, I tried\nto design this part so that it would make it easier to handle\nthan the manual method. Now we'll find out whether that actually\nturns out to be the case...\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Luminaire octr", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Thu Jun 23 23:23:18 2005"}
