{"body": "\nGreg,\n\nActually what I did was to combine gendaymtx and Daysim's epw2wea. This was\nan intermediate step for another program I am working in. Also, another\nintermediate step was the compilation the Daysim's wpe2wea on Mac (in case\nyou want it)... although I am not quite sure if there are isues considering\nthe source of the data (Solar or Local time, energy savings, and that kind\nof things).\n\nIt is good to know in advance that this might change, let me know which one\nyou choose... I am going to keep working on what I am doing, since I need\nto proove some stuff for my MSc, haha.\n\nRegards,\n\nGerman\n\nPS: My code also has a ot of repeated functions that exist on other files\n(gendaymtx, in this case)... I would like to learn how to clean it soon.\n\n\n2013/6/5 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130605/c13fade8/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] .epw to Daylight Matrix", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4J+nUG_SkZ4EV3g7gTMtmK1xrhvomjFEU7sFroUr7PUOg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAF-iH4+zQimU3UnDovAcKW2KVFdgp=Cs2eJUKM8zMtD54GGnEw@mail.gmail.com>", "<8396076D-C46A-4778-B0CB-C245B688BB32@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 14:17:53 -0400", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] .epw to Daylight Matrix"}
