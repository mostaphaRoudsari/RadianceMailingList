{"body": "\nHi there-\n\nI work in the architecture field and I'm interested in just processing the\nraw data that radiance generates instead of looking at images that might be\ngenerated.  I want to build my own spatial mapping of illuminance values in\nanother visualization tool.  Sorry for the newbie question!\n\nHow would I do that?
