{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI wonder if anybody has recommendations for modeling multi-layer ETFE\npillows similar to what you can see in this project: (\nhttp://www.jmhdezhdez.com/2011/04/mediatic-media-tic-barcelona-etfe-efte.html\n)\n\nIf you are not familiar with this system here is a video that shows how the\nsystem [potentially] works: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VSoUxvtiNo)\n\nThere are multiple layers of ETFE with different coating patterns. What is\nthe best way of modeling this system considering all the possible internal\nreflections? Is this a good case for three-phase method daylight simulation?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130718/899b305f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAd_PgR86AfWh_XCVZv7YnS2cUJBZQb4H8Fdho9BqGK2CgGRxg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 18 Jul 2013 17:18:17 -0400", "email": "sadeghipour at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylight simulation for Multi-Layer ETFE Pillows"}
