{"body": "\n\n\nHi Johannes, welcome.\n\nAh, the two best resources for learning & using Radiance are:\n\n1) The book \"Rendering with Radiance\", and:\n2) This list.\n\nRendering with Radiance recently became available again for purchase, and\nif you search this list's archives you will find the ordering information\nfor that.  It is truly the bible for this software.  As Brad Hamilton said\nto Jeff Spicoli in \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" when referring to the\nrules of the restaurant, \"read it, know it, live it\".\n\nAs for math & physics, well, this former theatre major is using Radiance\non a fairly regular basis.  Oh yes, there are conversations on this list\nthat go sailing clear over my head, but that just shows the enormous\nflexibility of the software and the diversity of the user base.  That\nsaid, you *should* have a grounding in the basics of the physics of light\n& illumination.  I'd assume you have an interest in that or you wouldn't\nbe looking to get involved with this bunch of wackos in the first place.\n\nHave fun...\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "<BE0D9EBA.52CC%johannes@itara.org>", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<41968.209.212.87.250.1105716220.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "refs": ["<DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F900302C37B@l-gnts05>", "<BE0D9EBA.52CC%johannes@itara.org>"], "datetime": "Fri Jan 14 16:24:01 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] MacosX and X11 and radiance and blender andbrad"}
