{"body": "\nHi Peter,\n\nThank you so much for your informative email.\n\nI hope the material provider has already the measurements done so I can use\ntheir measurements for the study. I'm not sure though.\n\nI have used .xml files generated by Window for a study before however in\nthat case the surfaces were planar so I generated the file for the glazing\nconstruction and applied it to a single surface. In this case though I have\nnon-planar surfaces with a different pattern on top of each one which makes\nit a different case.\n\nAlso thank you for the link to the paper. I looked at it when you sent it\nout first and I found it really useful. It is a really comprehensive\nreview. Thank you so much for sharing.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n\nOn Sat, Jul 20, 2013 at 7:01 AM, Peter Apian-Bennewitz <apian at pab.eu> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130720/3809a1f1/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<201307201101.r6KB1YGl005601@mta2.lbl.gov>", "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAd_PgSFcO7oFkZ_7dYFqtNN=eet19s4zWWQCQZ4ko3KcyP_0Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAAd_PgR86AfWh_XCVZv7YnS2cUJBZQb4H8Fdho9BqGK2CgGRxg@mail.gmail.com>", "<5790BFB4-DDA5-42F4-9F2C-E669D2E245FF@gmx.net>", "<201307201101.r6KB1YGl005601@mta2.lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Sat, 20 Jul 2013 14:24:55 -0400", "email": "sadeghipour at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] material models [Was: Daylight simulationfor Multi-Layer ETFE Pillows]"}
