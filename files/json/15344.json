{"body": "program Radiance\n\nHi Peter\n\n\nthis is a great paper you have put together. Picking the proper\nmaterials for fancy glazing and translucent shading has alway been a\nbit of a black art. Your comparison shows very clearly what the\ndifferent materials can and cannot do. I was particularly struck by\nthe fact that BSDF is currently not particularly well suited for\nmodelling the view out that one gets with  translucent materials for\nwhich trans is not quite good enough. I have not done much work with\nBSDFs, but always lived under the impression that a measured BSDF is\nthe ultimate in accuracy for both light transmission (daylighting) and\nview out (shading).\n\nThanks for making this paper available\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+dqh601MjukJQ_iaWSquKOmHJb-KuJX6t2LnSVUqHPtjHOTZg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Jul 2013 10:08:38 +0100", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Review of simulating four classes of windowmaterials for daylighting with non-standard BSDF using the simulation"}
