{"body": "\nI have an application which currently uses rtrace to generate illuminance data for sensors, and I'm trying to change this to use rcontrib.\n\nWhen I have sensors on the WP pointing up (see simple model http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/model.png) I get results that I'm happy with (results for rtrace - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1_rtraceCIE.png and results for rcontrib - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1_rcontribCIE.png).\n\nWhen I move the sensors to the ceiling and pointing down (see revised model http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/model2.png) I get no results for rcontib (results for rtrace - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1D_rtraceCIE.png and results for rcontrib - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1D_rcontribCIE.png).\n\nI've attached the data files (http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/files.zip) - the file rcontrib.bat is what I'm running.\n\n\n[IES]<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\nDon Stearn\nSoftware Engineer\n\nT:\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8500\n\nF:\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8501\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com\n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\n\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
