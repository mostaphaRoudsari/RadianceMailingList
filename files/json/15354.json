{"body": "\nHi Andy,\n\n\nI think in Windows DOS-shell speak, TEST_M~1.OPT means something like\n\n\"the first file in this directory that starts with 'TEST_M' and has a\nbase name (ie excl 3-letter extension) that is longer than 8 chars.\"\n\nSince there is no 'test_Model1.opt' in this directory, 'test_Model2.opt'\ngets the '~1' treatment. Weird, I agree.\n\nUPPER/lower case is pretty arbitrary under Windows, although you can't\ncreate 'test.txt' if 'Test.TXT' or 'TEST.txt' already exist.\n\nWhat do you make of the -lr option? This is a little too obscure for me...\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Query regarding rcontrib", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<51EF16BD.1060904@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<mailman.14.1374620330.1449.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"], "datetime": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 00:50:21 +0100", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Query regarding rcontrib"}
