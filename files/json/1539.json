Without this, the -mfpmath=sse\noption is useless.\n\n-mfpmath=sse,387 this will give you a boost if the SSE unit is separate\nfrom the old x87 unit but I don't know enough about the K8\narchitecture to know if it does. It will try to use both\nexecution units, but the man page says it still\nexperimental.\n\n-ffast-math\tthe man page says this is dangerous but I've never noticed\nany problems myself. Try it if you want.\n\nApart from that, wait for upcoming GCC-4.x releases to flesh out its\noptimisation features, in particular auto vectorization. The SSE2\ninstruction set can handle double precision FP math, better than the single\nprecision in SSE or Altivec. You should theoretically be able to get some\npretty awesome performance out of that processor. Reality is another matter\nthough... :(\n\nMy other suggestion would be to check out some Gentoo web sites. Those guys\nare nuts about compiler optimisations :P\n\nbye\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Compile error on AMD running Fedora 4", "tags": [], "sender": "Ian Tester", "datetime": "Mon Jun 27 17:46:25 2005"}
