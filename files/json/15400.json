{"body": "\nI don't have a sample project you can run, but I can offer some advice:\n\nA standard daylight coefficient run with a trans material (or BSDF) is\nfinicky because the the sky is sampled stochastically without regard to the\nposition of the sun.  If your sampling density is low or you use a high\nresolution sky descretization scheme you might not fully sample the sky,\nmissing patches.  If the sun happens to be in a missed patch your result\nwill under estimate the illuminance.\n\nI'd recommend using high -ad parameter, low -lw parameter and use the\ntregenza sky (not reinhart).  Or better yet, use the 3-phase method.\n\nI'd recommend running a few static sky conditions with rtrace to compare\nwith your DDS results.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jul 24, 2013 at 1:53 AM, nassif nassif <nynassif at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130724/b3c40a94/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAOQvQd=5xrnacZTbugAT4gh-kPHb73ras=gf2XUBseSqdiCsqQ@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixcUHBAnhSyVaH+4Bdj9rpvN44spkpVx89oPK+yoo34SA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOQvQd=5xrnacZTbugAT4gh-kPHb73ras=gf2XUBseSqdiCsqQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 09:31:24 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Trans material sample with dynamic daylightsimulation (rcontrib)"}
