{"body": "\nOh, oops!  Guess that is the way it works, not the other way around.  If you output into a single file as you were doing, the first 8760*3 values are the first sensor, the next 8760*3 are the next sensor, and so on.  A simple sed script should work for separating them, and you can automate generating the sed script using rcalc.  If you have 20 sensor, you would use:\n\n% cnt 20 | rcalc -e 'a=8761*$1+2;b=8761*($1+1)' -o '${a},${b}w sensor${recno}.txt' > sedscr.txt\n% [dctimestep command] | tr \\\\t \\\\n | sed -n -f sedscr.txt\n\nFor more or fewer sensors, just change the '20' in the first line.  I haven't tried this, but it should work -- assuming you have tr and sed, that is...\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130723/c01e11eb/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAN1QwsMzWLcrJ3+ppcAwrE73RDrwm_6jQCbEyqzSLqYVcM=s=Q@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<48993DD7-B5BE-4F03-97B3-B9CDED12BE72@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAN1QwsMJuneADe-YO2tt50gsKBRUsmzBO_05A6B=pmdMSdDHVA@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAF-iH4Jw804J7Hyk8LKaZK3f0dBtfiNUS+wD1XW4am8M6E8YBg@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAN1QwsNzj2e2Xko4zVN0wD4j=81eh-0bKcuovACxX4mdcVRZHQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<B068CC2C-1E00-4AD5-8D17-58B9A8510539@lmi.net>", "<CAN1QwsMzWLcrJ3+ppcAwrE73RDrwm_6jQCbEyqzSLqYVcM=s=Q@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 19:25:35 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] The Three-Phase Method for SimulatingComplex Fenestration with Radiance"}
