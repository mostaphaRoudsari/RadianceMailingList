{"body": "\nDear all.\nJust wanted to announce the availability of LiVi version 0.3. LiVi is my add-on for Blender that acts as a pre/post-processor for Radiance. Major changes in this version are the use of gendaymtx for DDS, per-point numerical result display, and Radiance sky files can now be selected as a sky option. I've have done limited testing on linux (64bit) Windows 7 (64bit) and OS X 10.6/7 (32 & 64 bit).\nLiVi can be downloaded for the LiVi website at http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi. LiVi is released under a GPL version 2 license and the code can be checked out at the Google Code repository https://code.google.com/p/livi/. Bug reports can also be left there. Questions, feedback etc can be posted to the LiVi mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/livi-list.\n\nFinally, have a super weekend.\n\nRyan\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ryan Southall", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<18EF33640F961B4BA442571DEB1356B3BB98DB7D@BELLATRIX.university.brighton.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 19 Jul 2013 20:16:30 +0000", "email": "R.Southall at brighton.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] LiVi version 0.3"}
