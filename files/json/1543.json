My problem, initially, was due to the Radiance\nlimitation that light cannot be included in an instance.  My problem\nwith the workaround, any of those discussed I think would work - just\ndifferent ways of assembling the pieces, was that I was refering to a\n*.rad file in a my \"./parts\" directory.  However, inside the *.rad file\nwere references to my \"./scene\" directory which is not a subdirectory of\n\n\"parts\" but at the same level.  My RAYPATH definition has the current\ndirectory \".\" as a path and so it was simply not finding the files...a\nmistake I probably would have noticed sooner had I not been using a\nRadiance interface (rayfront) and a mistake I probably would have never\nnoticed had I not jumped behind the scenes.\n\nDon't know if this will help anyone, but thought I'd post to resolve\nthis thread.  Thanks for all the help!\nZack\n\nBTW- Georg, in Rayfront if people try to create \"parts\" as rad files\nrather than octrees and then replmark them I think it will result in the\n\nsame problem.\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Zack Roger", "datetime": "Tue Jun 28 02:03:43 2005"}
