The weather tape is assumed to be in the simple ASCII format understood by DAYSIM,  which  contains  a\nshort  header  with  the  site parameters followed by the month, day, standard time, direct normal and diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance values, one time step per line.\"\n\nBTW, we are working on getting a version of epw2wea into the Radiance source tree so that future Radiance installers will include this utility in a regular Radiance install. I kinda thought that with gendaymtx being part of Radiance now, a utility to convert standard EnergyPlus weather files into the Daysim format was pretty much a dependency now, and luckily Christoph Reinhart agrees. NREL has a version of epw2wea that is compiling on all platforms and we hope to get it integrated into the Radiance source soon.\n\nAlso, we are currently testing our integration of gendaymtx into OpenStudio; we are now seeing annual climate based daylight simulation execution times in a matter of minutes (single phase)! We hope to have this capability integrated into the release in time for the Radiance Workshop. Stay tuned...\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\nOn Aug 2, 2013, at 1:45 PM, Leyla Sanati <leylasanati at gmail.com<mailto:leylasanati at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130804/f770549c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "leylasanati at gmail.com>", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA322630BFD7EC@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 4 Aug 2013 08:32:08 -0600", "email": "Leyla Sanati", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] epw2wea"}
