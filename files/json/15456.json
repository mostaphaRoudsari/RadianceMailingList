{"body": "\nHi, and thank you for your reply!!\n\nIf I select the output of gendaylit -O 2 (lm/m^2/sr) then I generate the\npicture using rpict, convert to human visual response using pcond\n-h and then to bmp using ra_bmp then I get a picture that is visually more\nbrighter than if I select the output of gendaylit -O 0 (default) and then\nmultiply by 179.\n\nI confirm, when I use -O 2 (output lm/m^2/sr) then I don't multiply by 179,\nonly when I select the default output (W/m^2/sr).\n\nI don't have problem with the results of the values, but with the generated\npicture, using the default of the parameter -O the picture looks less\nbrighter\n(even after *179).\n\nI wonder which of the two pictures is the right one, as it doesn't seem to\nhave anything to do with the results of the values, but with the way how\nthe image\nis created...I guess...\n\n\nI really apprecieate your help!\n\n:)\n\n\n2013/8/5 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130805/d99d0d31/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond, luminance or visible radiation?", "sender": "minchaca", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAO0Bi3X3b5poHtOuObpNM-qQ5qqEr=doUNgBrRckHuVm9fPLrw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAO0Bi3XiEQ7CBF5806AjKfvyD2wB5wfo2cgt0G9xwhZx-7qscg@mail.gmail.com>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF619982360163FF@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 17:56:04 +0200", "email": "miinchaca at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pcond, luminance or visible radiation?"}
