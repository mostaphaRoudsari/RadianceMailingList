{"body": "\nChantal,\n\nFor now the Three-phase method does nos support other basis than full\nKlems' 145 patches on each hemisphere. You should check that your .xml\nBSDFs are in that basis, and in the correct format.\n\nI understand Tregenza and Klems subdivitions are different, but both of\nthem have 145 patches...? If the .xml format is correct, you should get no\nerrors but an incorrect answer...?\n\nOn the other hand:\n*1) When trying to use the created daylight matrix: south.dmx with\ndctimestep (3.4 putting all together)\nI obtain the following message: fatal-unexpected EOF reading\nresults/south.dmx*\n\nI guess this could be because the sky subdivitions chosen for the Sky are\ndifferent when calling the gendaymtx and rcontrib programs? Chek the -m\noption in gendaymtx and the MF: option in rcontrib.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n2013/8/27 minchaca <miinchaca at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130827/ce39517d/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Three-phase method: more questions", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4LrfsbDTuFYoRCzNbZroRn+PrVbHt9pwC-biExbg_Xvcg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAO0Bi3UdDQsC8EVw=GqUi21NORdNjGhmN5gdLR6YNcCOCwWhFw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 27 Aug 2013 10:24:49 -0400", "email": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-phase method: more questions"}
