{"body": "\nHi Andy,\n\nI was interested in Ladan Ghobad's presentation on the third day of the\nRadiance Workshop (Thesis, NC State) but could not attend the session\nbecause of conflicts.  That particular session's slides have not been\nuploaded on the radiance site.  Any way to access them?\n\nRegards.\nShamim.\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Aug 12, 2013 at 7:31 PM, Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130817/487cf3b4/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Workshop Day 1", "sender": "Shamim Javed", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAGLB0_0R2PJLYfbS=qwf-R-KJ4JVPXUDZQ1Nz_puibotFqud_w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOG+Nix9ti1wZL3FWNM4Ky3xO7=VTcLGx_a=G2e6Q4uvMNFAfA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 17 Aug 2013 20:12:54 -0400", "email": "javeds2006 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Workshop Day 1"}
