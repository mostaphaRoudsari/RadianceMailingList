{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nIs there any reason you can't just render your large image straight\noff?  It will come out uncompressed, as the RLE algorithm in Radiance\ndoesn't work for scanlines longer than 32K, but otherwise everything\nshould work.  Are you getting some error along the way?  I just ran a\ntest with pcompos, creating a 50K by 50K image.  It took 9 GBytes of\ndisk space and took a few minutes to write out, but seemed OK\notherwise.\n\nCompositing tiles after filtering them separately will result in\nvisible lines at the tile boundaries in some cases.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] super high res images", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7281715D-6B16-11D9-9998-000A95BB392A@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<41EFFEFF.2030805@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 20 20:07:55 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] super high res images"}
