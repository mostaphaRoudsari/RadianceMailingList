{"body": "\nHi Dolf,\n\nIf your hdr image is created using rpict with the -i option than you can\nuse pvalue to extract the pixel irradiance values.\npvalue -da -h -H basic.hdr > basic_RGB.txt\n\nIf you just want to apply masks you can use pcomb with if statements like\nthis:\npcomb -e 'ro=if(ri(2),ri(1),0);go=if(gi(2),gi(1),0);bo=if(bi(2),bi(1),0)'\nbasic.hdr mask1.hdr > basic_mask1.hdr\n\nIf your hdr images were not generated using rpict -i you could use vwrays\nand rtrace to generate the illuminance data files for your image:\nvwrays -x 500 -y 500 -vf view.vf | rtrace -i -ab 3 scene.oct > output.txt\n\nHope this helps,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 6, 2013 at 7:25 AM, Dolf Bakker <dolfbakker at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130806/c2c5e3a7/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RGB irradiance from HDR-images", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixefNUktK9YROrVWPJqv0TQXrrTY4VwdyTzgb3zzKpj_Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAFfUoK4p_6ZyqpSCHdnN_J2JdaRbcFEGf7oTD8B1OJ-dynevzw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 6 Aug 2013 11:00:50 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RGB irradiance from HDR-images"}
