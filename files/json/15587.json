{"body": "\nFolks,\n\nIf you have the chance to go to the Guggenheim in NYC, go and see the\nJames Turrell exhibit. You've never seen the Guggenheim quite like\nthis before, and as appreciators of light and its behavior, you will\nfind yourself both satisfied and intrigued by his installations.\n\nI've been working to recreate a few of them in Radiance, and am\nrunning into some difficulties. One piece, \"Afrum I (White)\", should\nlook like this:\nhttp://nyogalleristny.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/afrum1.jpg\n\nIt's a point light in a small box above the entryway to the room, a\nspecial 6-sided hole cut in the wall, and the light beams this\ncube-like shape onto the corner. The light patch illuminates the room.\n\nInstead, what I get looks like this:\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/img06.png\n\nHere are the relevant rendering parameters:\n-ds 0.02 -lw 1e-5 -ab 5 -aa 0.03 -ar 256 -ad 1024 -as 512\n\nI suspect that I simply need more ambient subsamples, as a few ambient\npoints are catching the patch and some are not. But increasing -ad and\n-as do nothing to improve quality.\n\nOr, WAIT, are those bright spots seeing the little hole (it's 6\" wide)\nthrough which the light is originally emerging? How can I prevent\nthat?\n\nMark\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CADoMKs1BnQYWGxD_N4WMTZOrpuWUVv22uyv_WbhXYSrNkn26hA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 1 Sep 2013 23:08:28 -0400", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Spots when recreating Turrell installation"}
