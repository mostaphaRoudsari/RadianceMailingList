If not you need to\ndownload the libraries (look either on Carsten web site or on the\nofficial radiance web site)\n\nIf you have a precompiled version of radiance, just look over the past\nmessages for environmental variables, there should be a full lot of\nmessages about this out there.\n\nyou need to, depending on your terminal, define a variable called\nRAYPATH that tells the terminal where radiance libraries are kept\n(assuming you installed them).\n\njust try to understand if you are using bash ($) or tcsh (%) first (open\nthe terminal and look for the last character before the blinking cursor,\nis it % or $ ?),\nthen locate the user profile file (that has a different name depending\non the above... it may be ~/.bash_profile for bash and ~/.tcshrc if you\nuse tcsh).\nadd the proper line to define RAYPATH\n\nNOW BE REALLY CAREFUL! IF YOU DO A MISTAKE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO BACK.\nso I would suggest you to try using a text editor to change the file...\nand remember to use UNIX line ending. Try with a copy of the file 1st,\njust to be sure.\n\nWhen you have done check by\nopening a new terminal\ntyping env\nyou should show the new defined variable:\n\nRAYPATH=........\n\nciao,\n\ngiulio\n\nPS which platform are you using radzilla on?\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of ida\nSent: 05 July 2005 13:08\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nHi giulio,\n\nThanks for the info,great! it's working when i using\ntext editor(write thier primitives and parameters\ndetails)but then when I used exported object from maya\nto radiance(.obj)is not working is show the error such\nas(fatal-cannot find function file \"rayinit.cal\" ).is\nit I did the wrong way during I install the radzilla?\n\nMany thanks,\nidaz\n\n\nMessage: 4\nTo: \"Radiance general discussion\"\n<radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nMessage-ID:\n\n<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB51B3758@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nIda,\n\n\n\ntry this:\n\n\n\nrzpict -x 600 -y 400  -vp 61 14 -29 -vd -3 -0.4 1 -vu\n0 0 1 -av  .6 .6\n.6  -o image.pic scene.zoct\n\n\n\nthe trick is the '-o image.pic'\n\n\n\nhope this works,\n\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]\nOn Behalf Of ida\nSent: 05 July 2005 06:37\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nThanks Francesco,\n\n\n\nI have done test it by putting /rzpict -vp 61 14 -29\n-vd -3 -0.4 1 -av\nthe anonymous\ncharacter (is not image).
