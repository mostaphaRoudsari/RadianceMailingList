{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir/Madame,\nI've tried using the BSDF function to create a material using Diva for Rhino. I added this line to the code :\nvoid BSDF testmat6 0 bsdf_0c.xml 0 1 0 .00\nand I'm sure that my .xml file is working as I've tried it on a BSDF viewer and it worked.Once I run the simulation on Diva for Rhino an error appears in German language. What I assume that I've wrote something wrong in the material file so that's why I cannot run the simulation. But I can't find the error, can you help me out with it?\nI used the genBSDF function to convert the .rad file to an .xml file.\nSincerely,Islam Mashaly.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130907/8854165d/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: bsdf_0c.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 67412 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130907/8854165d/attachment-0001.obj>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FW: BSDF Material Error", "sender": "Islam Mashaly", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB122-W44C4D4AEB2D6590335FB56FC3D0@phx.gbl>", "refs": ["<DUB122-W7A83F2146540DB07FC326FC3C0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Sat, 7 Sep 2013 03:08:44 +0200", "email": "islam.akm at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] FW: BSDF Material Error"}
