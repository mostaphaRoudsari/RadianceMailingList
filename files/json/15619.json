{"body": "\nHi Germ?n,\n\nI tried it, and I don't get an error.  What -O setting are you using when compiling Radiance?  Anything above -O2 has been known to generate incorrect code with gcc.  Even -O2 sometimes causes runtime errors.\n\nIf you recompile and get an error using -O1, try without -O, just using -g, and run it in the debugger.  This is the only way to find out where it is going wrong.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130912/b4b47dc9/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pkgBSDF weird behavior", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<491DC4C0-5BC1-408A-925E-2AC823427349@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAF-iH4+ZaaLaB6WdZCd_PprfOi_Tv+b1wPSLRK3zN4TUV58bxQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<3B64C631-87EB-4A04-9462-6AB6FAFBE3F9@lmi.net>", "<CAF-iH4L7T8YO9DYv-jPuRrrYMwwLb7h=7T4Dj+bbznV3uswo9w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 17:00:34 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pkgBSDF weird behavior"}
