{"body": "\nHi Alexa,\n\nI don't really feel I can add that much to this discussion, as I think\nvalidation of software by its author is also something to view with\nsuspicion, but I agree with you in general that good validation studies\nare very difficult to find.  I just wanted to say something about the\nfollowing reference.\n\n\nI have a copy of this report, which was prepared by Anat Grynberg\nduring her second summer internship at LBNL.  However, I do not think\nit is particularly useful as a numerical validation.  It focuses mostly\non a \"qualitative study\" to demonstrate that Radiance can model scenes\nwith a realistic level of detail.  Much of the work surrounded the\ncreation of the well-known LBNL conference room model.  It also covers\nthe initial design of the imaging gonioreflectometer, but does not\ncontain much in the way of quantitative comparisons.  Anat did perform\na quantitative comparison based on a previous study of Superlite,\ncomparing it to measurements in a skydome the previous summer, but this\nwork was never published.  It is out of date at this point, anyway, as\nthe version of Radiance she was using lacked some of the better\ntechniques it has now for handling large area sources.\n\nHowever, if you are interested in seeing these early studies, I can dig\nthem up and copy them with some effort.  The color images of course\nwill not come out, but you can get a flavor, at least.  The more recent\nstudies are much better.  These were undertaken mainly because nothing\nelse existed at the time.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Evaluation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<01111C49-6C1A-11D9-96DD-000A95BB392A@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<41F1292D.9070808@bradford.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Sat Jan 22 03:05:56 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Evaluation"}
