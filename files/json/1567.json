I am currently\ntrying to make rendering times shorter, excluding detail geometry from\nthe ambient calculation. Using -ae, I got the \"too many modifiers\"\nmessage, and switched to -aE with a file containing the modifier names.\nHowever this did not help. So how many modifiers can I exclude with a\nstandard-compile radiance (I guess it is defined somewhere in the\nsources)?\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
