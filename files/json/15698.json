{"body": "\nHi Leyla,\n\nAll you can really do is play with the -c option and the rendering parameters.  You probably don't want to change -c in this case, but you can make the rendering go faster by altering the default options, which are:\n\n\"-w -ab 5 -ad 700 -lw 3e-6\"\n\nYou can try running:\n\ngenBSDF -n 12 +f +b -geom meter -t4 5 -r \"-ab 3 -ad 500 -lw 1e-5\"  \\\nreveal_glazing.rad venetian80.rad LChazed.rad > bsdf/v80_hazed_t45.xml\n\nAlso, I noticed that your blind slat material has 10% specularity, which probably isn't realistic unless it has a metallic coating.  I would expect the specularity to be 0.05 or less.  You are also better off specifying a non-zero roughness value unless the slats are really mirror-smooth.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130917/cf85f43e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF question", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5EC4A58F-4600-409A-8CA9-A8E6F9540C35@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAN1QwsMfZzJUSDssW61BQ5Y1FR5JZByre2cAhHA5nOMMCLTaQw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 17 Sep 2013 18:00:46 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genBSDF question"}
