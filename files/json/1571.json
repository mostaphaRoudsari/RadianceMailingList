( see http://www.toren.com/radiance/fieldsok.jpg )\n\nOne problem that remains now, is that the above commands will not work\nwhen oversampling 4 times the image size, to obtain sharper results.\nI have to figure that out soon, and will post the result at that time.\n\nThe really good news is that a simple test comparing rendering times\nresulted in 14 minutes rendering time using this 'field' rendering\nagainst 11 minutes when just sending doubles from vwrays to rtrace. This\nmeans that this kind of field rendering is quite a time-saving approach.\nGreat!\n\nIebele\n\nPS: Please note that where you wrote  '\\vwrays,  I wrote  `!vwrays (\nomitting the slash)\nThis is because Linux uses bash as standard, while you probably uses csh.\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering fields", "tags": [], "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "datetime": "Fri Jul  8 20:03:53 2005"}
