{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nGreg has written new utility for Radiance - rcollate.  This utility enables\nusers to easily resize and transpose matrix data (text or binary).  The\nprogram was developed to ease the five-phase method workflow for\nilluminance sensor points.  It replaces awk and tr, which were only\navailable for unix type systems.  Now you can perform the entire five-phase\nmethod workflow on Windows.\n\nHere's the manpage:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rcollate.pdf\n\nThe five-phase tutorial has been updated to use the new utility and to\naddress a couple issues raised by Leyla (thanks!):\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf\n\nMany thanks to Greg!\n\nBest,\nAndy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130910/a4a8509c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixKb-G5mt3geYBYx5u2x7oSM56EarY21y9v-Oo-qUb8xg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 10 Sep 2013 18:23:39 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcollate - A new Radiance utility!"}
