{"body": "\nHi Leyla,\n\nI don't think you are doing anything wrong.  In fact, the errors you were getting were due to a floating point round-off problem that up until now had never manifested.  I guess your geometry tripped it, somehow.  I have checked in a fixed version, which should eventually show up on the downloads sites.  Meanwhile, you can manually change line # 184 in your copy of genBSDF to read:\n\nin_disk_rgn = floor((.999995*in_disk_phi + PI/4)/(PI/2)) + 1;\n\nThe new .999995 multiplier avoids the round-off problem at phi=315 degrees.\n\nIt is unusual to model a system consisting of two windows.  Normally, you would model each window system, or just one of the two if they are identical, then re-use the generated BSDF.  Do include the window surrounds in your model as far as the sills go, but not the walls around them.  Unless you have some special reason for doing that.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130907/880d4dfa/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF error", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<290DF4FE-4422-4E19-9453-29CBF69C4725@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAN1QwsO=AmYsN1o-Nssk8Nsv0AncB1Vvq6SSsYNCaR8-7jWUvg@mail.gmail.com>", "<99F34B63-3370-466B-B207-2A648FCAEF3B@lmi.net>", "<CAN1QwsPi4mN2GN314-WyjhVOHV=VumvMKb7d6ZsT5wctJZcE_A@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 7 Sep 2013 10:54:27 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genBSDF error"}
