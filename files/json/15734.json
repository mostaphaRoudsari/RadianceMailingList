{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nFunny you should be trying to simulate this -- my wife (who is an artist herself) was just down in L.A. and Turrell has what must be a very similar exhibit there, as she sent me a nearly identical photo of it.\n\nMy first guess would be the same as yours, which would be to crank the -ad parameter much higher.  You may not need to increase the -as all that much.  Finding the bright spots is the difficult part, since it is so near the horizon as seen from points on the adjacent walls.  (Cosine-weighted sampling means that the horizon gets fewer samples than the zenith.)\n\nTo avoid any contributions from the source box, make the surrounding out of a special material and name it with an -ae option.\n\nFailing that, I would go full Monte Carlo and see if that works:\n\n-aa 0 -ad 1024 -as 128 -lw .0002 -ab 2\n\nYour scene breaks one of the basic assumptions in the Radiance indirect calculation, which says that indirect lighting is fairly well-distributed in the space.  Here, you have a patch acting as a light source.\n\nOnce I implement the irradiance Hessian described in the recent Siggraph Asia paper by Schwarzhaupt et al., the situation might improve:\n\nhttp://zurich.disneyresearch.com/~wjarosz/publications/schwarzhaupt12practical.html\n\nBest of luck!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Spots when recreating Turrell installation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<23E832BB-6AC5-423F-AB59-5C871EA5830D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CADoMKs1BnQYWGxD_N4WMTZOrpuWUVv22uyv_WbhXYSrNkn26hA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 2 Sep 2013 10:00:58 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Spots when recreating Turrell installation"}
