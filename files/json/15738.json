{"body": "\nBruno,\nIt seems that there is a problem with your command line. It's tough to tell\nexactly without seeing it, but my guess is that you've done something like\nthis:\n\n-faa klems_int.cal\n\n\nbut it should be two seperate options like this:\n\n-faa  -f klems_int.cal\n\n\nIf this isn't the problem pleas send the full command and we'll have a\nbetter chance at troubleshooting.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 1, 2013 at 7:07 AM, Bruno Bueno\n<bruno.bueno at ise.fraunhofer.de>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131001/4849d2ed/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcontrib output format options", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Nizik_jvMvAb=KubcuPCi9AWKgCxxtE93GYujz_ySRb-pw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<524AD711.9010202@ise.fraunhofer.de>"], "datetime": "Tue, 1 Oct 2013 10:22:09 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcontrib output format options"}
