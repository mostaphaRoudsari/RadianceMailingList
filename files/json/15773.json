{"body": "\nHi Jack, hi Lars,\n\nthanks a lot for the quick response!\nJack, your second hint exactly did what I was looking for. I tried to use\npcond first, but didn't think of the possibility to use a histogram...\n\nSorry, if my description was somehow cryptic, but you exactly found what I\nwanted...\n\nJust for information: the pfilt exposure corrections do not help in my case\nbecause the tone-mapping that is done in the HDR2LDR conversion (with\nhdr2jpeg / ra_tiff or similar) does the tone mapping for each single frame\nindependent from the other images. (But maybe I just got something terribly\nwrong here...!?)\n\nThanks!\nDavid\n\n\n\n2013/10/22 Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131022/d1dbdf10/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Tone mapping for animation", "sender": "David Geisler-Moroder", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAL-bo5FiX2kZwzHXKcK8CLrr5eqydD6ffNELXW-pBKUPdnJDaQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAL-bo5EWL=NjbOrBTQcxpF-Q=FSqU=C_fjSL+Cx-gYWtfAqjOQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<5266861B.5090302@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 17:14:04 +0200", "email": "david.moroder at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Tone mapping for animation"}
