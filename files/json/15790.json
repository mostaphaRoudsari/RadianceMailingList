{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nThank you for checking. My bad! I use my own written epw2wea convertor so\nthe user don't need to download epw2wea file separately. That was a bug\nindeed. Sorry about that.\n\nOne more question about conversion of the results of gendaymtx. Where can I\nfind  solid angle subtended for each patch of Reinhart sky? I already have\nthe values for Tregenza sky as (0.0435, 0.0416, 0.0474, 0.0407, 0.0429,\n0.0445, 0.0455, 0.0344) for the 8 rows. Is it fine to use the same numbers\nfor every two rows?\n\nThanks again,\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 3, 2013 at 12:21 PM, Gregory J.
