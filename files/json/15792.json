{"body": "\nHi Mostapha,\n\nThis sounds like a bug in gendaymtx.  Some versions of the standard library print out \"-1.#J\" for NaN (Not a Number), which can result from a divide-by-zero or similar illegal math operation.  If you send me your weather file in a separate message (not to the mailing list), I will see if I can reproduce the problem.  There may be a corner case or two that gendaymtx still doesn't deal with gracefully.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131003/ab53fd3a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaymtx returns -1.#J -1.#J -1.#J", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1AF66972-0D9D-4E9B-9ED9-44030B4D4C79@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAAd_PgQYFVWp1XfoNw8MRfEy_wqz-Ovkawmmjkxyg4YoUQ4R_g@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 3 Oct 2013 08:37:15 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gendaymtx returns -1.#J -1.#J -1.#J"}
