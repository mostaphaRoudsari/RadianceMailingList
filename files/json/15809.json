{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nI am using Radiance to render objects using realistic lighting conditions.\n\nThe objects I use are represented as triangulated polyhedra. Currently I'm accessing\nthe radiance outgoing from the objects in a scene using rendered images (rpict and then pfilt)\nof the scene (with no information anymore on each single triangle).\n\nI am wondering whether it is possible to have access to the\nradiance outgoing from each triangle directly (as a list of values, one for each triangle\nfor example)?\n\nI'm running minGW radiance in windows (with a Matlab wrapper), but could\nswitch to Linux if required.\n\nBest wishes,\nOlivier---\n\nDr Olivier Penacchio---\nSchool of Psychology & Neuroscience\nSt Mary's Quad\nSouth Street\nSt Andrews\nFife\nKY16 9JP\nScotland, United Kingdom\n\nTel: +44 (0) 1334 462099\nFax:+44 (0) 1334 463042\n\nEmail:op5 at st-andrews.ac.uk<mailto:psych at st-andrews.ac.uk>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131112/6db7b464/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Olivier Penacchio", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3C120D8376A40D4D8EFDC0ABA036E813091CF9FD@UOS-DUN-MBX3.st-andrews.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 13:36:30 +0000", "email": "op5 at st-andrews.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Access to outgoing radiance at polyhedra level"}
