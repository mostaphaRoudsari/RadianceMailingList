{"body": "\nGood morning,\n\nI am interested to know if it is possible to generate a camera view that\nreplicates the projection of a waldram diagram? I then assume it would be\npossible to overlay the relevant waldram diagram using Pcomb.\n\nIn particular I am looking to address the calculations of Rights to Light\nissues in the UK. I am confident of being able to calculate the sky\ncomponent within a scene at reference points, but as a nervious beginner\nwould like to be able to generate the waldram diagram from the same\nreference points to double check the accuracy [and convince potential\nclients].\n\nMany thanks..\n\nNickd\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "nick devlin", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<opsk86p6xhbxkgpz@nick.xco2.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jan 27 09:48:10 2005", "email": "nickd at xco2.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Waldram projection camera views."}
