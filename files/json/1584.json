{"body": "\nHi\nI'm trying to light a room with the light that's irradiated onto a mirror sphere\nin order to insert synthetic objects into the room. In radiance I take a close\nup .pic of the mirror sphere and convert it to a light probe using HDRShop. Do\nI use same code as in Debevec's tutorial, you know\nvoid colorpict hdr_env\n7 red green blue lp_smallMirr.hdr angmap.cal sb_u sb_v\n0\n0\n\nhdr_env glow env_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n!genbox env_glow room 50 30 50 -i | -t 2.5 2.85 2.5\n\nfor the lighting? Will angmap.cal work for any light probe or do I have to write\nmy own because when I render this, the reflections from the light probe aren't\nmapped onto the walls of the room properly?\n\nThanks for any help\n\nTarik\n\n\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lighting from a light probe", "sender": "Tarik Rahman", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1106842725.41f9146558dbb@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<opsk86p6xhbxkgpz@nick.xco2.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 27 17:19:08 2005", "email": "tarik.rahman at ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Lighting from a light probe"}
