{"body": "\nHi Tarik,\n\nYou have to make sure your light probe capture is aligned properly, so\nit's a matter of figuring out the right orientation vectors in your\nsynthetic scene.  There are also matting issues in the final combine\nstage.  Are you working from Debevec's tutorial, which was published in\nIEEE CG&A?  See also the thread from November on this list under the\nheading \"Alpha channel/object matte\".  There are some scripts and tips\nin there.\n\nThere are a lot of hurdles to jump in getting image-based lighting to\nwork.  A lot of it, you're just going to have to figure out on your\nown, I'm afraid.\n\nGood luck!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lighting from a light probe", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B5386EB3-7084-11D9-B9C1-000A95BB392A@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<opsk86p6xhbxkgpz@nick.xco2.com>", "<1106842725.41f9146558dbb@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 27 17:59:20 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Lighting from a light probe"}
