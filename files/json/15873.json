{"body": "\nHello Radiance Group,\n\n\n\nI want to right a code which is estimating the illuminance (or ever better\nradiation) in horizontal level under overcast sky. Although I have managed\nto find similar equations for clear sky, I haven't managed to find any for\nan overcast CIE sky.\n\n\n\nCan you lead me to any reference that can help me on this research?\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\n\nSotiris Papantoniou\n\nPhD Candidate\n\nEnvironmental Engineering Dept.\n\nTechnical University of Crete\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131112/bc5811ec/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sotiris Papantoniou", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001b01cedfe4$c0a80f20$41f82d60$@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 22:21:20 +0200", "email": "sotos.enveng at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Equations for horizontal radiation/ illuminanceunder overcast sky"}
