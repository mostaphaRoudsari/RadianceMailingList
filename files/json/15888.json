{"body": "\nHi Andy\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help with all my questions. I found the solution to\nthe last one... (Not really worth mentioning!!)\n\n:))\n\n\n\nRegarding my previous 1st. Question:\n\n\n\nI tried to create a *glazing_bsdf.rad* file using one of the cfs.xml files\nthat we have in the lab. I?ve got the message:\n\n?Unsupported IncidentDataStructure for BSDF?, I assume this means that this\nis not a ?tensor tree high resolution BSDF?.\n\nThis might be a silly question but: if there is a way to resample the\ntensor tree BSDF into a Klems basis BSDF, is there any way\n\nto do the other way around? Or...perhaps this 'error message' means\nsomething else..?\n\n\n\nI thank you in advance for your help again!!\n\n\n\nChantal.\n\n\n2013/11/1 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131103/3e601423/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 5Phase & proxy geometry", "sender": "minchaca", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAO0Bi3ULamYmGMeEr_Pg_z_b8ALNbzxZxgqPxQhpW8n6KXocyg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAO0Bi3XFY5byD6Nq7TOgkZbyEKDRwePN10+TO_2ty1yhYqmXxA@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAOG+Niz0g0TBPBFKmjpHtzpTaOjuHoJRuevOWuTJy9LAt4cTmg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 17:53:29 +0100", "email": "miinchaca at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 5Phase & proxy geometry"}
