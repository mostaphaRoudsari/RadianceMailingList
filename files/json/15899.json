{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI wish to show illuminance values at specific locations at world\ncoordinates (x y z) in an image. I mean, to show the illuminance values (in\nan orthographic image of a plan created by a camera with parallel lens) at\nthe real position of the illuminance sensors (Rtrace/Rsensor).\n\nThe only way I could find is to use Psign to produce text's image, and then\nposition the produced text in the plan image by using Pcompos. Something\nlike this: psign 100 Lux | pcompos inp.hdr 0 0 +t .5 - 200 200 >\nout.hdr. However,\nPcompos takes input of the location of a pixel and places the text there.\nThis is not what I intend to achieve.\n\nAre there other ways to do this? Thank you in anticipation.\n\nBest regards,\nVaibhav Jain\nwww.vaibhavjain.co\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131211/31ac9268/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Vaib", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD7gt0XvXjdLP50W5bvVK3dGsgWjFsZDnNd+zRgB-cCXzo88QA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 02:06:35 +0100", "email": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Insert text in Radiance images at specificlocation (x y z)"}
