I was using gcc.\n\nhat\n\nI'm a naieve user. I construct 'furniture' as discrete boxes of surface in\na texture I like and then micro-adjust their position against room walls\nuntil it looks 'right' -It may well be this introduces some overhead that\nbetter constructed objects would avoid.\n\nI still have real problems thinking in the project 3space inside the\nmodel. I feel like a 5 year old trying to use a treasure island map on\nthe kitchen floor: 3 forward three left two up rotate twice six back...\n\nlabelled anchors to get base-relative locations could be nice.\n\nand I think I asked for a simple floating compass a while back, is there\na hack to get one into initial models to confirm various positions? or\na way to float key object points in text over the model?\n\ncheers\n-George\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] increase resolution: BAM! fall off the end of the universe", "sender": "George Michaelson", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7231.1008091195@apnic.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 12 Dec 2001 03:19:55 +1000", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] increase resolution: BAM! fall off the end of the universe"}
