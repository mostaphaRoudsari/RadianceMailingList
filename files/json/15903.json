{"body": "\nI don't think photon mapping will handle this, either.  It's really outside the scope of an architectural rendering package.  Subsurface scattering needs to be implemented at a fundamental materials level, and involves gathering contributions from nearby a hit point in a geometry-aware fashion.  Not to say that it couldn't be done, but there's no real motivation to add it to Radiance.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C077E0BD-44CA-42F0-9030-083BD839D292@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<OFF2AF8F0E.CCD48E15-ON80257C3E.00579E82-80257C3E.0057E2F1@LocalDomain>", "<39547BCB-45F2-4DFC-AAE0-426F7283A0C3@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 09:15:56 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance"}
