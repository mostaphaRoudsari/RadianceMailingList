{"body": "\nI'm not saying it couldn't be done.  I'm saying there is no one to do it or support such an addition given our current focus.  Some things are simply out of scope based on our application area, whatever users may want.  You are of course welcome to make such extensions yourself, though I might recommend working with Radzilla or (easier still) utilizing another free renderer that already has such capabilities.\n\nI don't know the current status of the photon mapping add-on for certain.  Someone else will have to answer that.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131211/ce3c3b7e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BE8B9E59-B574-4EC2-BD0F-AE0595AA16A1@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<C077E0BD-44CA-42F0-9030-083BD839D292@lmi.net>,", "<OFF2AF8F0E.CCD48E15-ON80257C3E.00579E82-80257C3E.0057E2F1@LocalDomain><39547BCB-45F2-4DFC-AAE0-426F7283A0C3@gmail.com>", "<OFC781B842.17C4DAEE-ON80257C3E.0060EAA7-80257C3E.0060EAAC@LocalDomain>"], "datetime": "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 09:52:45 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance"}
