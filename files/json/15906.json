Lars Grobe conducted some tests with the \"mist\"\nprimitive, but the results weren't convincing.\n\nWann Jensen has proposed a BSSRDF and a photon mapping approach to model\nsubsurface scattering, so it is doable, but not with the current photon\nmap implementation; it would require adding the BSSRDF itself plus the\nappropriate photon scattering routines. The flux carried within the\nmaterial would then be obtained from volume photons, which are already\nbuilt in.\n\nHaving said that, while we're planning a few (overdue) extensions to the\nphoton map, subsurface scattering currently doesn't have a high priority.\n\nSee ya,\n\n--Roland\n\n\n--\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSenior Research Associate\n\nT direct: +41 41 349 39 77\nroland.schregle at hslu.ch\n\nLucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts\nSchool of Engineering and Architecture\nCC Envelopes and Solar Energy (EASE)\nTechnikumstrasse 21, CH-6048 Horw\nT +41 41 349 33 11, F +41 41 349 39 60\nwww.hslu.ch/ccease\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance", "sender": "Schregle Roland HSLU T&A", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<op.w7xv7kefgbjfop@ccmse-sim>", "refs": ["<OFF2AF8F0E.CCD48E15-ON80257C3E.00579E82-80257C3E.0057E2F1@LocalDomain>", "<39547BCB-45F2-4DFC-AAE0-426F7283A0C3@gmail.com>", "<C077E0BD-44CA-42F0-9030-083BD839D292@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 18:58:22 +0100", "email": "roland.schregle at hslu.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance"}
