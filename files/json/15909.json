{"body": "\nHi Roland,\nThanks for this perspective, good to know the subject is of interest and\nthanks for your work on the photon map module.\nThanks Greg for your response. I was not asking anyone to do it, just\nwanted to collect the community views on the feasibility and see whether a\ncollaborative development could interest some of you. I might investigate\nthis further.\nRegards,\nThibault\n\n\n\n\n\n42-43 Gloucester Crescent\nLondon\nNW1 7PE\nT +44 (0) 20 7267 5161\nF +44 (0) 20 7482 0329\nmaxfordham.com\n\nMax Fordham LLP is a Limited Liability Partnership.

Lars Grobe conducted some tests with the \"mist\"\nprimitive, but the results weren't convincing.\n\nWann Jensen has proposed a BSSRDF and a photon mapping approach to model\nsubsurface scattering, so it is doable, but not with the current photon\nmap implementation; it would require adding the BSSRDF itself plus the\nappropriate photon scattering routines. The flux carried within the\nmaterial would then be obtained from volume photons, which are already\nbuilt in.\n\nHaving said that, while we're planning a few (overdue) extensions to the\nphoton map, subsurface scattering currently doesn't have a high priority.\n\nSee ya,\n\n--Roland\n\n\n--\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSenior Research Associate\n\nT direct: +41 41 349 39 77\nroland.schregle at hslu.ch\n\nLucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts\nSchool of Engineering and Architecture\nCC Envelopes and Solar Energy (EASE)\nTechnikumstrasse 21, CH-6048 Horw\nT +41 41 349 33 11, F +41 41 349 39 60\nwww.hslu.ch/ccease\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131212/6fb65ddd/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 25055 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131212/6fb65ddd/attachment-0001.jpe>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance", "sender": "roland.schregle at hslu.ch", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<OF0298AEB1.F0BCBDB3-ON80257C3F.002CA928-80257C3F.002D0DEF@LocalDomain>", "refs": ["<OFF2AF8F0E.CCD48E15-ON80257C3E.00579E82-80257C3E.0057E2F1@LocalDomain><39547BCB-45F2-4DFC-AAE0-426F7283A0C3@gmail.com><C077E0BD-44CA-42F0-9030-083BD839D292@lmi.net>", "<op.w7xv7kefgbjfop@ccmse-sim>"], "datetime": "  11/12/2013 17:59", "email": "Schregle Roland HSLU T&A", "subject": "       Re: [Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance"}
