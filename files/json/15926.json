{"body": "\nHi Brian,\n\nGood research!  The materials do not translate very well, so you'll just have to do the best you can with those.  If your object(s) have mapped textures, you may be better off using obj2mesh instead of obj2rad, since a Radiance triangle mesh supports mapped textures.  You'll still need to translate the texture image file(s), however.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131221/abe763ef/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Conversion of obj files", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F23CA79C-D6C1-4C6B-8AB4-AAEFF4887168@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1387672930.91705.YahooMailNeo@web141105.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 21 Dec 2013 20:35:53 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Conversion of obj files"}
