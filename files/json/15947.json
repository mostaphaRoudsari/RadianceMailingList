{"body": "\nHi Sierd!\n\n\nThe glass material is an optimization for thin, clear glass panes.\nTransmission through such glass, which depends on the material, is\nexpected when you define a glass material in Radiance, can be measured.\nReflection is - for an ideal, flat glass - a property of only the angle\nbetween surface normal and ray and the transmission (as a fraction of\nlight is reflected from the second surface, which means it has to travel\n2 times through the material).\n\nSo for all use cases that the glass model in Radiance was implemented\nfor, you would not need the reflection to be defined.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] question transmission an reflection glass", "sender": "Lars O.
