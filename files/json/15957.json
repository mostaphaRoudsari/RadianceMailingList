{"body": "\nHi everyone,\nI am a newcomer in the radiance community. I am involved in a project to assess the light output from light pipes. We are gonna simulate the light output of 2 types of light pipes and then compared them to the on site measurements. I would appreciate any guiding or advise on where to start the simulations. I am considering backward retracing as a more suitable option than forward retracing for this particular case, what do you think?\nThank you\nAle\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140107/00594243/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?B?QWxlamFuZHJvIFBhY2hlY28gRGnpZ3Vleg==?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB117-W34A51482FDC0CDA49CD51BCAB60@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 14:17:33 +0100", "email": "paxeco2205 at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Using radiance for simulating light pipes"}
