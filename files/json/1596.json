The paper proof is at\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/rays.pdf\n\nIt should appear in about 2 weeks in LEUKOS at www.iesna.org.\n\nAnyway, I was quite surprised how many rays it takes to get stable results. We traced up to 7 million rays through a specular microlouver sold by www.Siteco.de. We took the exiting ray distribution towards the room and converted it into an IES photometric format file in 1-degree vertical and 22.5 degree horizontal steps for use in Radiance or other lighting calculation programs.\n\nMartin\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 4101 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050715/23c6994c/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Martin Moeck", "datetime": "Sat Jul 16 00:51:24 2005"}
