{"body": "\nHi Kyle,\n\nYes, the latest version of falsecolor is a Perl script, requiring Perl to be installed on your system. A couple of questions:\n\n1. what operating system are you using? I?m guessing Windows, since Mac and Linux OSes ship with Perl. Regardless, here?s where you can get info on getting Perl:\n\nhttp://www.perl.org/get.html\n\n2. Are you sure you want an illuminance rendering? If so, you need to pass the ?-i? (that?s a lowercase ?I?) option to rtrace to get an irradiance image.\n\nAs always, the man page is the best source for usage info:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/falsecolor.pdf\n\n- Rob\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, January 14, 2014 12:47 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHi,\n\nI would say that I have an adequate understanding of radiance.  I am capable of producing renderings and performing glare analyses.  I have been asked to produce a falsecolor illuminance rendering.  I have the latest version of radiance installed and I see that there is a falsecolor program but I am not sure how to use it as it is not a recognized command.  I have been told I need perl to operate the falsecolor program.  What exactly is perl? Where do I download it and how do I install it?  Once installed, to execute the falsecolor function same as calling it out in the command prompt like rpict and ies2rad? I was given this task today and need to produce this by the end of tomorrow. Any help provided would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you,\nKyle\n\n\n\nKyle E.
