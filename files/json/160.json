Can you resend just the text portion of the message -- not\nas an attachment?  In general, it's not a good idea to send attachments\nto a mailing list.  If someone wants to look at your file and you can't\nput it on a website, you can mail it to people who request it\nspecifically.  That way, it doesn't get sent automatically to the entire\nlist.\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 9 Apr 2002 23:08:07 -0700"}
