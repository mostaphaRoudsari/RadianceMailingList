{"body": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nFor anyone who has been missing the -z option of ra_tiff, which used to\ngenerate LZW output, it is working again in the latest release, or\nshould have been.  The issue surrounded the infamous Unisys patent on\nLZW compression, which expired a couple of years ago.  The 3.6 release\nwas _supposed_ to have the new TIFF library with -z enabled again, but\ndue to pilot error (mine), it never got in there.\n\nTo get the latest version, you'll need to download and recompile the\noverlay for 3.6 that's on the Radiance websites:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\nand\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/\n\nLook for the file \"rad3R6P1supp.tar.gz\".\n\nIf you don't know what ra_tiff is or have never used and don't intend\nto use this option, then feel free to ignore this message.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Gregory J.
