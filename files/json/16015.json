{"body": "\nThanks Lars/Greg,\n\nAh, I had expected increased turbidity to result in scattering that\ncorrelated with object-distance.\n\nI was hoping to estimate (roughly) how scatter changes the colour of\nstuff beneath water as a function of turbidity and distance (and viewing\ndirection). I may need to rein in my ambitions.\n\n\nWith regard to mist: By \"specfic light sources\" I take it you don't mean\ngensky then? Do you have a simple example of mist being used in a small\nmodel? I can then work this into my already bloated matlab wrapper.\n\n\"genocean\" I get it ;-) , but not before foolishly googling-it!\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\nOn 30/01/2014 16:07, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr P.
