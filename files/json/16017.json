{"body": "\nHi George,\n\nI just want to add to what Lars said, which is correct.  Turbidity does not affect the light distribution in gensky.\n\nSadly, we don't have a genocean to create lighting environments for underwater -- that would be a nice addition!  If you are trying to simulate absorption and scattering in a participating medium, you can try playing around with the -m* options to affect the global environment.  There is also the \"mist\" primitive for controlling local media and scattering from specific light sources.  The single-scatter approximation used in Radiance is very approximate, however, and specifying a non-zero global extinction coefficient then having light sources infinitely distant (a la the \"source\" type) results in a lamentable zero contribution to the scene.\n\nHowever, there's no reason in the case of the ocean that you couldn't use one mist sphere for water surface, indicating the sun as the source, and you should get roughly the correct behavior down below.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] confused by turbidity", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<599604DC-39B1-4D19-8543-5A1099B3331F@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<52EA3990.7080400@st-andrews.ac.uk>", "<959E3678-6386-42E2-A4EC-39D55859AE67@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 08:07:41 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] confused by turbidity"}
