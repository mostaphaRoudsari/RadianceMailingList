{"body": "\nWhat is your method for determining the transmission and reflectance of the glass? Are you familiar with the Optics software and the international glazing database? There is also an interactive script \"glaze\" that allows you to define multi-pane glazing and some basic coatings.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Monday, January 13, 2014 10:51 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHi Lars,\n\nThanks for your responding my question. I have used the glass function but I\ncan only chance the transmission of this pane and not the reflection. In my\nproject is the reflection of this pane very important and I was thinking the\nBRTDfunc will help me whit this. So for  that I have found the glazing.cal\nfile in the library to calculate my glas but is ther also an explanation of\nthese calculations\n\ncheers, Sierd.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRTDfunc (Lars O.
