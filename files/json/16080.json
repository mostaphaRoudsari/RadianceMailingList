{"body": "\nHappy Monday everyone, Dr. Greg,\n\nIn a few days I will be evaluating my Radiance model with measurement\ndata (illuminance values). Can you please recommend some\nguidelines/best-practices/research-papers that have conducted\nsuch quantitative analysis, and came out with some methodologies for model\ncalibration, and their confidence intervals. My university had \"Rendering\nwith Radiance\", that could have been a good starter, but somehow it has\nmysteriously gone missing. It has become a rare book, if I guess right. :)\n\nMy experiment will be a controlled one, in which only the lights will be\nturned On or Off and I will check their influence on results. The major\nfactor for anomalies could be from Sky, as initially I will be using Gensky\nas the sky model.\n\nI look forward for your suggestions. Thank you!\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140203/3365ee8c/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Vaib", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD7gt0UoRvUU+kEv1TLXEKr0_9Ezi5S+o4s1xt7U06rF-X+Kjg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 09:03:35 +0100", "email": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reg. evaluating Radiance results"}
