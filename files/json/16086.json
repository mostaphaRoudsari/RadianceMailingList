{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nI only call the daylight coefficient method a two-phase approach because it has two phases.  You can of course call it a 1-phase or 0-phase method if you prefer(!)\n\nI'm hoping Christoph Reinhart and Rick Mistrick will also say something about what they've been working on, to the extent that it differs from OpenStudio.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140203/59c98e2f/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3- or 5-phase method in simulation programs", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E950968C-D87A-49DB-8425-F51E44FC846F@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAFVgASULHpVBjEvOMkZ_BUBe=b78byxdHtBfSUJSO9Lm6Aym-A@mail.gmail.com>", "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32263AFB1BE2@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 09:43:52 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 3- or 5-phase method in simulation programs"}
