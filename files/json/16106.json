{"body": "\nShit, it appears that the ?a option fell off the wagon when falsecolor was converted from a csh script to a Perl script. I swear it used to be there. Am I losing my mind? This is entirely possible. OK, ok, bad info there. Sorry about that one, Vaib.\n\nNow then, the pextrem deal. What do you mean it doesn?t take an hdr file? That?s precisely what it does. Here?s what that should look like:\n\n$ pextrem pass2-v2lux.hdr\n99 511   0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00\n4 232      9.960938e-01 9.960938e-01 9.960938e-01\n\nIOW, you call pextrem, give it an hdr image, and it returns the pixel coordinates (x,y) and radiance (Rr,Rg,Rb) of the low and high pixels. What?s happening when you try this?\n\n\nSent: Wednesday, February 05, 2014 10:25 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nThank you Rob.\n\nAm I doing it wrong? -a option is a \"bad option\" :) Not valid argument I mean..\n$ falsecolor -i foo.hdr -s 1000 -n 10 -l Lux -a > bar.hdr\n\nAnd pextrem doesn't take HDR file. I have to work with HDR, as it has conversion libraries in Java.\n\nVaib\n\nOn 5 February 2014 17:50, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\nHi Vaib,\n\nA couple of things:\n\nThing One: there is an ?a option, which ?autoscales? the max value for the scale to peak at the max value found in the image.\nThing Two: yes, you can use pextrem to get the min and max values (in Rr,Rg,Rb) printed to the command line.\n\n- Rob\n\nSent: Wednesday, February 05, 2014 9:39 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHello everyone,\n\nFalsecolor's documentation states that \"The ?e option causes extrema points to be printed on the brightest and darkest pixels of the input picture.\"\n\nIs there any way to output (not print on image) the extrema values? This could be helpful in appropriately scaling the \"scale\".\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140205/9e3e2cc6/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAD7gt0WMMeMKb_oNPk+kACOp0vPnuxdvnHEsqm4_t-DHPqDR9w@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com>", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32263AFB1D77@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<CAD7gt0W-5a129yKfO+Y55KRD=6CCTkk-Hi+jrN+7JM_WyNmDeQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32263AFB1D68@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "<CAD7gt0WMMeMKb_oNPk+kACOp0vPnuxdvnHEsqm4_t-DHPqDR9w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 10:38:44 -0700", "email": "Vaib", "subject": "[Radiance-general] How to get extreme values from a falsecolor image"}
