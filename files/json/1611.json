I have asked one question about mapping texture and thanks very much for your answers. But now I am still not clear about those functions.\nI use \"frac(U) frac(V) \" to tile the texture just like an example I found on the Internet. But I found there are other methods to do so such as \"tile_u tile_v\". I have searched in the book \"Rendering with Radiance\", but can not find explanation about it.  Also I can not find further explanations of function clip( ) and noop( ). Is there anything I can refer to or are they just somwhere in the book \"Rendering with Radiance\"?\n\nWould you please help me on this naive question? Thanks a lot.\n\nyours,\nHuang\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050720/2224d2f8/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Huangwx@kyotoUniv.", "datetime": "Wed Jul 20 03:59:27 2005"}
