The lightsources cause\nspecular reflections with very bright specular spots (highlights) on the\nfloor. These specular spots do not look realistic (better said: these\nhighlights disturb in the image, because there are so many of them).\nI have tweaked the specular, roughness and rendering parameters also,\nbut I can't  get rid of these specular reflection highlights, apart from\nmaking the roughnes very small or 0. But with low or zero rougness the\nrelections of the other geometry become too sharp.\nIs there a way to model a reflective material (or lightsource?) without\na ( or a dimmed) specular reflection highlight ?\nOr any other suggestion?\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reflection vs specularit", "tags": [], "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "datetime": "Wed Jul 20 13:37:18 2005"}
