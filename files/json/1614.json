I have asked one question about mapping texture\nand thanks very much for your answers. But now I am still not clear\nabout those functions.\n\nI use \"frac(U) frac(V) \" to tile the texture just like an example I\nfound on the Internet. But I found there are other methods to do so such\nas \"tile_u tile_v\". I have searched in the book \"Rendering with\nRadiance\", but can not find explanation about it.  Also I can not find\nfurther explanations of function clip( ) and noop( ). Is there anything\nI can refer to or are they just somwhere in the book \"Rendering with\nRadiance\"?\n\n\n\nWould you please help me on this naive question? Thanks a lot.\n\n\n\nyours,\n\nHuang\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050720/718afdb5/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Jul 20 16:16:57 2005"}
