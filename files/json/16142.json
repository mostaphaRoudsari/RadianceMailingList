{"body": "\nCrossing over to the general list...\n\nIf you can create an octree from your model, try the command and option getinfo -d\n\nThat will return the dimensional information for your full scene though, so if there are objects included outside of your area of interest, it becomes more tricky.\n\n\nSent: Friday, February 07, 2014 12:12 PM\nTo: radiance-dev\nHello everyone,\n\nIt is a kind of weird question but thought to hear your views.\n\nLet's say, someone gave me a .rad file which is a model of a rectangle room. This model has many polygons for surfaces such as walls, windows, luminaire, furniture etc.\n\nHow shall I develop a method/function that can parse this .rad file and return me back the room dimensions. I have no additional information, like walls' name variable etc.\n\nI want to make a simple java method for that. I am not using any CAD API.\n\nIs it possible? Please don't bash me for my stupid question.. :P\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140207/3482b5da/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF619982360D839D44@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 17:41:21 +0000", "email": "Vaib", "subject": "[Radiance-dev] How to parse room dimensions from .rad model ?"}
