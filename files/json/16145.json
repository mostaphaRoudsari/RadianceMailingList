{"body": "\nHi Jill,\n\nA couple of ways to search the archives. One is to just rely on Google, but\na better way is to browse the archives here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-general\n\nThe best way is usually to search the archives here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/search-1\n\n...but this doesn't seem to be working at the moment. Boo.\n\nNow then, your specific question: the so-called NREL Radiance binaries do\nnot include the obj directory because they are not part of the program,\nthey are just \"auxiliary\" files. You can get them by downloading this\narchive:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R1supp.tar.gz\n\n...and unpacking the archive like so:\n\ntar -xzf rad4R1supp.tar.gz\n\nOnce you have those, you'll also wanna make sure you have X11 installed. I\nlike XQuartz for that, which you can get here:\n\nhttp://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg\n\nThen you should be able to run that example scene you're trying to do. I\nwould recommend looking at some of the other tutorials on the\nradiance-online site, though.\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Feb 7, 2014 at 3:42 PM, Jill Dalglish <jill at jilldalglish.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140207/bedceab6/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Search Radiance-Online archives", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAEkFE9iDA73UURP5XJs2650zcDJEfXw-7VUEEvKtGZY1oe5nBQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<52F56161.6020607@jilldalglish.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 16:03:26 -0700", "email": "rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Search Radiance-Online archives"}
