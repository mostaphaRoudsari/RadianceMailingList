The former will give you some sense of\nwhat frac(x) actually calculates, the latter will help with tile_u and\ntile_v. Picture.cal is the basic procedural function for mapping an\nimage texture onto geometry using the \"colorpict\" material modifier\ntype. The function clip(x) makes sure that the value x is forced to the\nrange [0,1] while the function noop(v) simply return the value v without\nany modification.\n\nHuangwx@kyotoUniv. wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050720/b9759aca/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mapping textur", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed Jul 20 16:52:01 2005"}
