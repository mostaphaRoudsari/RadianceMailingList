In other words, it seems that in\nthe real life example there is never a direct reflection from the\nlightsources/lightbeam  to the eye. The reflection seems too diffuse for\nthat to happen.\nSo, in the real world the situation I like to simulate exists, now\nfinding a way to simulate this in Radiance will be the challenge..\n\nI am reading the book RWR now,  chapter 12.1 on specular sampling in\nindirect calculations. However I have the feeling that the problem i am\nfacing is in the direct calculation. It just seems that when I could\ncontrol the highlight apart from the reflection , I could model my floor\nmore accurate.\nOr am I totaly lost here ??  Is specularity exactly the same as\nreflection in Radiance?? After 10 years I still have to learn soo much\nabout Radiance. Ok,  that's the fun and the power of Radiance... :)\nAny suggestions remain welcome.\n\nIebele\n\n\nGiulio Antonutto wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reflection vs specularit", "tags": [], "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "datetime": "Wed Jul 20 19:00:36 2005"}
