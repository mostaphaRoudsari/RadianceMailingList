{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI wish to render a scene and output a black and white image where the\nblack areas have 0 irradiance and everything else is white.\n\nI then want to pcomb this over another image so that on that image all\nthe black parts of the mask appear in black, but wherever the mask is\nwhite, the underlying picture shows through.\n\nHow can I do this?  I can see it should be possible, but the devil is in\nthe details it seems...\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Christopher Kings-Lynne", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<41FA46F6.6020302@familyhealth.com.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 28 15:08:15 2005", "email": "chriskl at familyhealth.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Generating a black and white pic"}
