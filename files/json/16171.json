{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI tried to make light source invisible by using the -dv option in rpict,\nbut somehow it doesn't work for me. The lights are shown black.\n\nIn my case, the camera and lights are placed at the same height in a room,\nand the camera is looking down towards the floor. I have tried both with\nand without -dv option.\n\nWhen I place camera just below the lights, then the lights are not visible\n(which is obvious, as lights are then not in line of sight).\n\nHas someone else also experienced the same? Thank you!\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140216/375ff173/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Vaib", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD7gt0UD_foJ1H0KwVvxkNRkawqZ1dWyokb_8YDgR1is42ztUA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 16 Feb 2014 23:19:20 +0100", "email": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict -dv option to switch light sourcevisibility"}
