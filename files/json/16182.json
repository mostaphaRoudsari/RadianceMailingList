{"body": "\nI'm trying to model a computer screen for glare analysis in Radiance.  I\nhave measured luminance values for the monitor showing white and black\nscreens in a dark room, as well as spectrophotometer reflectance data on\nthe screen while off.  Currently, I'm modeling it using a generic glass\nmaterial in front of a glow material, but this creates a lot of specular\nreflection in rpict renderings that doesn't match up with observations.\nDoes anyone have suggestions for creating more accurate Radiance materials\nto model the monitor?\n\nThanks,\n\nNathaniel\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140219/15da47bf/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nathaniel Jones", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAJR73tshh3gsecTYzeUZ+d3xb9Ppz--Yb53j2__UHL_D3xmhvg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 11:51:03 -0500", "email": "nathanieljon at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling a flat-screen monitor"}
