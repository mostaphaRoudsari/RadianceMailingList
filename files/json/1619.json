{"body": "\nRegarding posting images, I did manage to get the attachment from\nKirk's post, but in general we should keep attachments to a minimum.  A\nlot of mailers get upset about them, and they create long download\ntimes for those of us who are still in 56K modemland.  (Not me, but\nthis friend of mine...)\n\nThe general etiquette is if it's an image and it's over 100K, then it\nshould go on a website with a URL for those who are interested.  If you\nhave multiple images and details, again a webpage is preferable.\n\nOh, and if you reply to a post with an attachment -- PLEASE take the\nattachment off your own e-mail.  In general, I like to keep attached\ncopies of e-mails to abbreviated versions (unless they are short), and\nnot attach e-mails with a nested attachment.  In general, everyone's\nbeen really good about that.\n\nThat said, this is a really, really nice diagram.  Thanks, Kirk.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lighting from a light probe", "sender": "Gregory J.
