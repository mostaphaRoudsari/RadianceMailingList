Why? Is it assumed that in general, the light conditions\nin a building are like that? I have used a -av of .5 .5 .5 here,\ntogether with -ae excluded objects (I wrote enough questions on that\ntopic ;-). This results in a strange image, as the calculated ambient\nis redish, and the ambient-excluded objects appear very strange (like\nblueish) because they are the only objects illuminated by this neutral\ncolor. I can understand that if using -ab 0, setting a colored -av\nwould not make sense as ALL indirect illumination would be neutral\nthan.\n\nSo, am I right that in the case here (I use the -av settings only for\nthe -ae excluded objects in a scene that is rendered with -ab 2), using\na neutral value would be simply wrong and I have to use the \"measured\"\n(from rview) radiance?\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 2134 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050721/ee571035/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
