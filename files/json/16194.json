{"body": "\nHi Greg and David,\n\nThat is great.  I looked at the man page of rsensor program, that is what I\nneed.  I have a few questions for which I am struggling.\n\n1.  you mentioned I still have to use a cone to cutoff light even if I\ndefine the sensitivity data files?  should I list all from 0-90 (row\ndegree) in the row or just view angle range (e.g., from 0 - 54 deg in row)?\ndoes the program do some interpolation for angles are not defined in the\nsensor files?\n2. Our program was built based on Daysim, and use gen_dc to generate\ndaylight coefficient and us ds_illum to calculate the sensor readings. The\nreadings are cosine weighted, but it seems no way to integrate rsensor with\nds_ill or .dc files. I understand the 3 or 5 phase DC methods is good to\nhandle this. Since we already have the code from Daysim, it may be easy to\ndirectly integrate resensor with current Daysim generated .dc files? Do you\nhave some suggestion?\n3. If we use three phase DC method, we have to generate the BSDF files,\ngenBSDF +f +b will double the time, so for blinds in the south wall\nsettings, I only need use deault (+b only, not +f), is tha right?  +b will\ngenerate Transmission From (Window 6 convention), is that right?\n\nThank you very much,\n\nJia\n\n\nOn Thu, Feb 20, 2014 at 4:29 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140220/d88dc919/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] incident ray angles", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwo_U_4rdKCH9aKH-6xdH3=DGhwB8_xxkAOsEjju6Peodg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CABzgtwpGCVEit5XmGZQOAR9ep87-0KpYohiHF_FEeSQRsjM3zg@mail.gmail.com>", "<6B6E8CBA-9882-4DC2-9F22-AEFD38986475@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 13:37:42 -0500", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] incident ray angles"}
