{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI looked at the genbsdf.pl.  It seems that genBSDF +f will generate the\nTranmission Front (defined in xml file) and genBSDF +b will generate\n\"Transmission Back\" in xml.\n\nHowever, bsdf_m.c code prefers the \"Transmission Front\" data. So when\nusing genbsdf, is that a good pratice to add +f, which generate\n\"Transmission Front\" that is preferred by Radiance?\n\n\nif (!sdata)\nreturn RC_FAIL;\n* /**\n* * Remember that front and back are reversed from WINDOW 6 orientations*\n* * Favor their \"Front\" (incoming light) since that's more often valid*\n*/\ntfront = !strcasecmp(sdata, \"Transmission Back\");\nif (!strcasecmp(sdata, \"Transmission Front\") ||\ntfront & (sd->tf == NULL)) {\nif (sd->tf != NULL)\nSDfreeSpectralDF(sd->tf);\nif ((sd->tf = SDnewSpectralDF(1)) == NULL)\nreturn RC_MEMERR;\ndf = sd->tf;\n} else if (!strcasecmp(sdata, \"Reflection Front\")) {\nif (sd->rb != NULL) /* note back-front reversal */\nSDfreeSpectralDF(sd->rb);\nif ((sd->rb = SDnewSpectralDF(1)) == NULL)\nreturn RC_MEMERR;\ndf = sd->rb;\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140220/55ab3530/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwohwTMBMjvbjAZ+oX3nP=W52Rr3ztqaazMFxg788iTbjg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 14:16:54 -0500", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genBSDF"}
