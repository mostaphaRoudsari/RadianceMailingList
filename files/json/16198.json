{"body": "\nHello,\n\nThere are 30 sensors in the space, each of which has sensor spatial\nresponse file and use rsensor to calculate illuminance values.  If I use\nthree phase method to conduct annual simulation. My current method is to\nuse:  rsensor -h -vf view.vf . to generate the 10000 rays and use these\nrays to calcualte V matrix.  in other words, I am using three phase method\nto calculate 10000 sensor points. At the end, only a single sensor values\nare calculated.   Is there any better way?\n\nThanks!\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140221/ebf1f232/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwpFY0=mcbNJ7+_k7jX2YbC0RE7emkC2h6w9o8GEfQatUw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 00:43:10 -0500", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rsensor and annual daylighting simulation"}
