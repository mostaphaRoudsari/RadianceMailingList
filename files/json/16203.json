{"body": "\nHello Jia,\n\nThe DAYSIMps addon to Daysim by Penn State, \"Considers photosensor spatial\nsensitivity, location, aiming, control algorithm, and calibration.\" You\ncan see on page 11 it works by using some '.sen' files that describe the\nsensor sensitivity, and there is a new sim_photosensor program in the\nDaysim toolchain to enable this. The 2013 workshop presentation by Richard\nMistrick is probably of use.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\nOn Fri, 21 Feb 2014 04:12:35 -0500, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140221/dcc6494a/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] incident ray angles", "sender": "J.
