I didn't really use -av in previous projects, but need it\nnow because the complexity of the scene forces me to exclude modifiers\nfrom the ambient calculation.\n\nAs far as I understood, the influence of the -av setting (on objects\nnot excluded from the ambient calculation) can be dimmed by the -aw\nsetting, and as I start my renderings with an \"ouverture calculation\"\nthe computed ambient distribution should be stable enough. Am I wrong\nhere?\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 2134 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050722/1b3f3e7f/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] estimating -av values, color", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
