{"body": "\nHi Jia,\n\nI put my answers inline, and included your second e-mail at the bottom...\n\nThe cone is an easy (but computationally wasteful) alternative to using rsensor if all you need is a cut-off.  There is no reason to use such a device with rsensor.\n\nI will leave this to the Daysim experts to answer.  Using rsensor with the 3-phase method is more likely to succeed as you point out.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n\nRegarding your second question, the 10000 sensor samples are integrated to a single value, and this is the way it works.  You can of course change this with the rsensor -rd option, but your accuracy will suffer.  In the scheme of things, 10000 rays is not too big a number of samples if your scene has a lot going on.  Convergence of Monte Carlo approaches generally proceeds as 1/sqrt(N) for N samples.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n+++++++++++++\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140221/d551db2b/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] incident ray angles", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0630B78B-02FC-4306-8DB8-5848A216B6BF@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CABzgtwpGCVEit5XmGZQOAR9ep87-0KpYohiHF_FEeSQRsjM3zg@mail.gmail.com>", "<6B6E8CBA-9882-4DC2-9F22-AEFD38986475@lmi.net>", "<CABzgtwo_U_4rdKCH9aKH-6xdH3=DGhwB8_xxkAOsEjju6Peodg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 10:12:35 +0100", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] incident ray angles"}
