{"body": "\nHi Hana,\n\nIf I understood your question correctly, you need to calculate illuminance\non a vertical grid in Ecotect. I guess you have already calculated\nilluminance on a horizontal grid at 0.8m height above ground (working\nplane). If this is correct, then please see the image attached.\n\nI also started with Ecotect, but I am not sure it has its own user group.\nBut in this group too, there will be people who are experts in Ecotect.\nHope it helps.\n\nRegards,\nVaib\n\n\n\n\nOn 18 February 2014 08:03, Hana Al-Jawder <hana.al-jawder at sydney.edu.au>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140218/848d24f1/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: verticalGridEcotect.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 58013 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140218/848d24f1/attachment-0001.png>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] vertical illuminance using Radiance", "sender": "Vaib", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD7gt0U0qXM8Mtg_t2ehe1YGg8q4kengN9cXGyDs9Onac4pSww@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<B7E6424E7BA25A49855CFB6E30349C2F61E8D225@ex-mbx-pro-02>"], "datetime": "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 13:23:06 +0100", "email": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] vertical illuminance using Radiance"}
