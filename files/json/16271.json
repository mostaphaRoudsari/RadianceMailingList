{"body": "\nHi Greg, Vaib and all,\n\n\n\nAbout my question, I asked earlier, here are more details about the problem.\n\nI am doing daylight analysis for a room using Radiance with output showed in Ecotect, I have the drawing with all required details ( the latitude, longitude, weather data, time, date and surface materials and colour) I already did calculate all the illuminance points at 0.8m on the grid created in Ecotect and got the result I need. Know I need to calculate the vertical illuminance for similar point I have in the grid that just facing the window opening as I need these readings to calculate the glare index for room I am studying it.\n\nThe problem that I am no that expert in using radiance, so is there any simple tips can help me in solve this problem?\n\n\n\nI do appreciate your help in this matter\n\n\n\nMany thanks and best regards,\n\n\n\nHana\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140218/a5d2b337/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Hana Al-Jawder", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B7E6424E7BA25A49855CFB6E30349C2F61E8D225@ex-mbx-pro-02>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 07:03:03 +0000", "email": "hana.al-jawder at sydney.edu.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] vertical illuminance using Radiance"}
