{"body": "\nHey Kyle,\n\nI?m making a bunch of generic BSDFs for window substitution in OpenStudio and thought it would be nice to have a couple of simple data visualizations of each one, for the docs. Kind of a back burner thing, just wondering if this has been done already. What I *don?t* know about R could fill a book, but I do know it?s pretty capable?\n\n- Rob\n\nReply-To: Radiance discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nTo: Radiance discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nHi Rob,\n\nI would be game to try writing something with R.  I'm aware of Andy's BSDF viewer and it is indeed awesome.\n\nIs there a particular project / task driving this interest? Batch visualizations?\n\n-Kyle\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 12, 2014 at 8:25 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\nHey gang,\n\nBesides Andy?s (awesome) BSDFViewer util, does anyone have any other fave ways to plot the distribution of their BSDFs? Anybody have an R or gnuplot script to take a plain old Klems basis BSDF xml file and make a (series of) polar plot(s)?\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Plotting BSDFs", "sender": "kskonis at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CF219EDD.2FCC%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<CF219740.2F90%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CAAzVHq138GXv2jPpMmFW9qNzu5YtrWL-dEQNi7gD9+zs0jc5Dw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wednesday, February 12, 2014 at 9:41 PM", "email": "Kyle Konis", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Plotting BSDFs"}
