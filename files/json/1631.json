I'm sorry I never got to\nwrestle rtrace before, I was stuck too long with the DTPrad wintel\nbinaries, I'm glad to have radiance's full power on my disposal now\n(thanks Fransesco!)\n\nAlso, this will not show all the rays returning to the light sources,\nas this part of the calcuation never gets fully 'traced', the reason\nbeing that the direct calculation in Radiance attempts to minimize the\nactual number of rays followed to sources as an optimization.  If you\nwant to see the paths all the way back to the sources, you'll have to\nget into the rt/source.c file and start modifying the code directly.\n\n\nNow that would be computationally perverse to undo that! Hmmmmmmm...\nSince I'm only starting to program (god bless python) that might be\nsomewhat ambitious ;-)\nAlso tracing the rays to the source would be for sake of the image,\nthere's no numerical ardour to get that done...\n\nRegarding the -s option in xshowtrace, you can go in and change it\nyourself.  The sleep call is on line 260 in px/xshowtrace.c.\nUnfortunately, sleep only takes integer arguments, but you can replace\nit with a call to nanosleep() on most systems.\n\nNow that sounds like something I could pull off!\nCheers, thanks a lot!\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20050126162147.02B3F1C000BE@mwinf1203.wanadoo.fr>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jan 26 17:22:15 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: graphing radiance raytrace paths"}
