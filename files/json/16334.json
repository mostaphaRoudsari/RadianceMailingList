{"body": "\nThank you Andy and Greg,\n\nPlease do consider the points I've raised in the last email, and let's\nhope that the community makes an effort to upload content. I am willing\nto partake in the organization and uploading of portions of the\nradiance-online content, but a plan of action would be a good first task.\n\nAlso, there are numerous ways to set up a wiki. I personally like the\nhomepage of http://wiki.blender.org/ and was able to teach myself\neverything I needed to learn through their intuitive structure. The\nsoftware is provided freely by: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki\n--I'm not an advocate of any particular wiki distro, but some just work\nbetter and look prettier than others.\n\nThanks to all!\nChris\n\nOn 2/5/14 2:18 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140205/bd543871/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposal", "sender": "Chris Kallie", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<52F29CC8.5090804@umn.edu>", "refs": ["<52F1C62C.9050902@umn.edu>", "<52F1F440.7050007@gmail.com>\t<52F22ECD.70704@umn.edu>", "<52F26CBC.6060602@umn.edu>\t<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32263AFB1D73@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>\t<CAOG+Niwg-DahBuzTzOjQOepjMtvOKtZZ-BAbXoHhc_dXLpYuFg@mail.gmail.com>", "<3EFFA2B9-A638-427B-B18A-1ADCA8059F42@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 05 Feb 2014 15:19:20 -0500", "email": "kallie at umn.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposal"}
