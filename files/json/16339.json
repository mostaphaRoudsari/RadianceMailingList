{"body": "\nHi Chris, Rob,\n\nradiance-online.org is set up as a community website for anyone to add and\nedit content. Danny and I are the only ones to have done anything, but\nthat's not the intent. It's not quite a wiki because we feel it needs a bit\nmore editorial oversight to remain relevant and accurate, but anyone can\ncontribute regardless. Anyone should feel welcome to register, send me an\nemail, and I'll promote you to author.\n\nI also won't get in the way of, and may even contribute to, another wiki\nattempt. But i'd ague that an FAQ is more necessary.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 5, 2014 at 9:26 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\nRobert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140205/2575fa13/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposal", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Niwg-DahBuzTzOjQOepjMtvOKtZZ-BAbXoHhc_dXLpYuFg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<52F1C62C.9050902@umn.edu> <52F1F440.7050007@gmail.com>", "<52F22ECD.70704@umn.edu> <52F26CBC.6060602@umn.edu>", "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32263AFB1D73@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 11:04:46 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposal"}
