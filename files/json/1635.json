{"body": "\nHi Katja,\n\nWhy don't you just borrow the OpenSource C code in the Radiance\ndistribution?  No need to roll your own, really.  The Radiance picture\nformat is well-described in:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf\n\nThe code you want is in the ray/src/common directory in the\ndistribution, which may be downloaded from:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software\nor:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\n\nThere is also a program that will convert from floating-point raw files\nto and from Radiance pictures, called pvalue.  It's use is a little\nobscure, though.  It's described in the man pages section on radsite:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/whatis.html\n\nI assume you read the article in Graphics Gems II, already?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<14e731f14e0bae.14e0bae14e731f@nyu.edu>", "sender": "Gregory J.
