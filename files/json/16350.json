{"body": "\nMy typical process is to export to .obj, then use the command obj2rad. When you export to obj, be sure to tick the box to export materials, so that any material names you've assigned in Rhino carry over into the rad files. Also, the -f option for obj2rad tends to keep each surface contiguous (rather than triangulating further than the obj export).\n\nSent: Wednesday, February 05, 2014 10:45 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHi,\nI have a Rhino model that I would like to use in Radiance. What type of file should I export it to?\nThank you,\nAlejandro\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140205/48444ca3/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rhino to Radiance", "sender": "paxeco2205 at hotmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF619982360D834884@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<DUB128-W36D5B9F70B1FAC8462F680CA950@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 15:53:35 +0000", "email": "Alejandro Pacheco Di?guez", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rhino to Radiance"}
