To\nget such a behavior, you have to increase the initial image\nresolution and downsample more with pfilt.\n\nSimilar to motion blur, best results are usually obtained through a\ncombination of pdfblur and the new -pd option.  There is also a new\nscript to do combined motion and depth-of-field blur, as the two are\nnot really separable.  It's called pmdblur, and it's man page is the\nbest place to get details.\n\nThanks is due to Jack de Valpine of Visarc, who funded this addition,\nalong with support in ranimate that now provides motion and depth-of-\nfield blurring as an option.\n\n\nThe technique is not adaptive, but it takes advantage along with\neverything else of rpict's selective rendering of samples based on\nimage coherence (the -ps and -pt options).\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Announcing Radiance 3.7 releas", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
