{"body": "\nHi,\nI have an array of M x N x 3 (as in RGB) single precision floating\npoint numbers,\nand would like to save it as a RADIANCE hdr format which uses 32 bits\nper pixel,\ni.e. R G B have each 8 bits and they all share one exponent which is\nalso 8 bits.( If I understand this correctly)\nI would like to know how exactly the format works. How does one pick\nthe common exponent? How does one deal with extrem intensity values in\nthe different color channels?\nI am writing the program in C.\nCan anyone help?\n\nTHANKS\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Katja Doerschner", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<14e731f14e0bae.14e0bae14e731f@nyu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jan 25 23:07:53 2005", "email": "kd462 at nyu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] converting floating point to RADIANCE HDR format"}
