{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\nCheck out the \"xshowtrace\" command.  It uses rtrace on an image to\nsuperimpose ray paths you select.  It doesn't show a side-view with the\ncamera in the image, unfortunately.  There's an exercise for the\nreader!\n\n-Greg\n\nHi,\n\nWhat I would love to do is to produce a graph depicting the rays a\nradiance rendering actually consists of, moving from the camera back to\nthe light source.\n\nWhat would be an appropriate way of doing so? Would a radiance holodeck\nfile do the trick, since from what I understood, its storing the actual\ntraced rays in a file format.\n\nThe other question would be how many rays such a graph should contain,\nprobably a 100k is more than sufficient for such a graph, while an\nactual radiance render would consist of many more. Looking forward\nhearing your suggestions!\n\n?Cheers,\n\nJelle.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: graphing radiance raytrace paths", "sender": "Gregory J.
