{"body": "\nHi,\n\nWhat I would love to do is to produce a graph depicting the rays a radiance\nrendering actually consists of, moving from the camera back to the light\nsource.\nWhat would be an appropriate way of doing so? Would a radiance holodeck file\ndo the trick, since from what I understood, its storing the actual traced\nrays in a file format.\nThe other question would be how many rays such a graph should contain,\nprobably a 100k is more than sufficient for such a graph, while an actual\nradiance render would consist of many more. Looking forward hearing your\nsuggestions!\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050125/ae76605f/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20050125213028.F01E51C00186@mwinf0412.wanadoo.fr>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jan 25 22:30:58 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] graphing radiance raytrace paths"}
