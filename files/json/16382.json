{"body": "\nDear List,\n\nThese days I am doing a lot of image processing with pcomb and expressions\nusing the -e option. I want to save the images I parse through pcomb for\nlater analysis.\n\nThe small problem with this is that pcomb removes the view information\nfrom the header. Right now the only option I can find is to manually\nappend my original view information to the new file's header. Is there, by\nchance, an option to maintain the view information when using pcomb? Its\nnot a problem for me to automate this, but it is nice to stay within the\nRadiance toolkit if possible.\n\nThanks very much,\nAlstan\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "J.
