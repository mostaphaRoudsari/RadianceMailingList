I just installed the latest\nversion (rad3R7all) on Mac OSX.4 and it is working\nfine (as long as I start X11 first) with rad, rview,\netc.  I have downloaded and installed\nTclTkAquaBI-8.4.10.0.  I try to run trad from the\nxterm, and I get the following message:\n\n$ trad\ntrad: line 12: syntax error at line 16: `(' unexpected\n\nThanks for any help you might be able to offer.  I\nhaven't actually run any tcl programs on the mac\nbefore, so perhaps there is something I need to know\nabout that.  I tried installing the tcl launcher and\nthen running trad from the finder, but it didn't work\neither.\n\nThanks again,\n\n-mmatthe\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrea Matthews", "datetime": "Sat Aug  6 00:44:58 2005"}
