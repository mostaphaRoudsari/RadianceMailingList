{"body": "\nI think you should try Giovanni suggestion. Meaning not to listen to but really trying to do what he is suggesting.\nSo, start by converting image to HDR.\nHDR has 3 channels that contribute to luminance as Giovanni is saying.\nThe integral of the image (you can write your own script to do that, see IESNA handbook) will give you illuminance.\nThe same way a picture in radiance can give you illuminance. Just a conversion factor.\nIf the numbers are far off there is an issue with luminance calibration or simply with wignetting of the lens.\nWe have been doing this for years and it works? but we use posh Leicas to do so (we edit the exif file as lenses do not record f stops...).\nG>\n\n\nOn 27 Mar 2014, at 17:31, Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk> wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140327/b12dda6e/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<EFB28475-1F77-495C-9179-EDF2AB4E7CD9@create.aau.dk>", "sender": "giulioandrea antonutto foi", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<149810D1-04EC-4B0A-9CCF-A818D9A8F10D@me.com>", "refs": ["<9013E154BAB3F24D97C18A4FEAB61036BF353D19@ad-exchmbx2-2.aau.dk>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236113B3055@AMXExMb01.global.arup.com>", "<9013E154BAB3F24D97C18A4FEAB61036BF353F85@ad-exchmbx2-2.aau.dk>", "<36a8085461cb4d0dbb3d255360065b20@AM3PR02MB209.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>", "<7083F714-8211-4CF8-AAD1-B8BC6F851339@create.aau.dk>", "<7e1b955b99da483186412db20561519e@AM3PR02MB209.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>", "<EFB28475-1F77-495C-9179-EDF2AB4E7CD9@create.aau.dk>"], "datetime": "Thu, 27 Mar 2014 23:34:21 +0000", "email": "geotrupes at me.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Conversionof\tRGB\tirradiance\tvalues\tto\ta\tilluminance value"}
