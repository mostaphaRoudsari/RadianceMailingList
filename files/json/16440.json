The idea was to make Windows Radiance\neasier to install, without having to worry about a Perl interpreter as well.\n\nThe exe files were on my server for a while, but not realising that\nother Windows Radiance users might be interested in them too, I removed\nthem after my class was finished.\n\nSince I've been receiving a few emails enquiring about those exe files,\nI set up a web page where they can be downloaded:\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml\n\nHope this makes setting up Windows Radiance a little easier for some of you.\n\nIf you want to help with porting some of the old Radiance C shell\nscripts to Perl to make them work under Windows, please give me a shout.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Windows executables of Radiance Perl scripts", "sender": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A7E25FADF831E94DBBD5904D7E5848650E035177@GL-EXC-01.iesve.com>", "refs": ["<531C98C4.7090209@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 10:56:23 +0000", "email": "Axel Jacobs", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Windows executables of Radiance Perl scripts"}
