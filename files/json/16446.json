{"body": "\nHi Greg,\nThank you so much for the prompt reply! I want to generate some simulation\nimages for my project, but Matlab can't read in the .oct file or .pic file\ngenerated by oconv and rpict. So I was wondering what I should use to\noutput raw images with linear light coordinates and then extract the pixel\nvalues. As you mentioned  the gile generated by using rpict should be the\nraw format? Or I could use rtrace option to get the pixel values?\n\nBest,\nVera\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 20, 2014 at 10:40 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140320/d6b6ce76/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Raw images from radiance package?", "sender": "Vera Liu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CACxzXYz+uVrgit6Q+pOa_y9naTrNOsovR=jiLfoJnN3-Q10ONA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CACxzXYyY3u5ozbYy6bJiPVN8Qpb3PcvHM3WeFFyKKC7pKoDhyQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<E5494075-9D6B-41EA-9FF6-B5574D39566C@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Mar 2014 12:11:00 -0700", "email": "lizzielyh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Raw images from radiance package?"}
