{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nLooking at the command you quoted, the \"-opn\" option to rtrace should be \"-opN\" for better efficiency, but this isn't what's causing the \"broken pipe\" error.  That indicates that rcontrib is refusing input before rtrace is done supplying it.\n\nThe only think I can think of is that you are running out of file descriptors.  If using \"-e MF:2\" instead of \"-e MF:6\" solves the problem, then this is the most likely cause.  The MF:6 setting requires 5186 descriptors.  Quoting Thomas Bleicher from a Feb. 2007 post:\n\n\nUnfortunately, the method for changing the number of allowed descriptors varies from one system to the next.  Good luck!\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140303/fb88f4ec/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF orientation and implementation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3444C9DE-98EA-4D63-A8A2-5B1F61CF9E78@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC20EDF9EF@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>", "<CAOG+Niz40ULk2xGWoKCKZ7MPRU21jUJABzip77SG_mU8_av1tQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAL-bo5G7G713kOt=EfhEBGVs6qwHiXg0R_3DstCdUj-taiN+hQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<CF340DB6.3B68%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC20EE5246@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>", "<CAOG+NiyH1ktqVgA3qSXABVPDhDGH+BGam0mMGjUH0zvpRSeWNA@mail.gmail.com>", "<CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC20EE551D@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 09:46:45 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF orientation and implementation"}
