{"body": "\nIs there any trick to compiling/using bsdf2rad? I?ve compiled from the HEAD as recent as 3/18 and it did not get compiled and/or copied over.\nFrom my build, all make did was copy the following files from the ray/src/cv directory: ies2rad nff2rad lampcolor tmesh2rad obj2rad mgf2rad rad2mgf mgf2meta mgfilt mgfinv 3ds2mgf pabopto2bsdf bsdf2ttree bsdf2klems pkgBSDF epw2wea\nI see that bsdf2rad is listed in the Rmakefile under ray/src/cv, but not included in the ?PROGS? listing (the files above are). Does this need to get edited to properly install bsdf2rad?\n\n\nWhat is the usage of bsdf2rad? I don?t see any man page online and didn?t find one with the typical documentation in the build.\n\n\nAny help/suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nChris\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\nTel: 212.334.2025\nDirect: 212.616.0254\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n\n\nThis transmission is confidential and intended solely for the person or organization to whom it is correctly addressed.
