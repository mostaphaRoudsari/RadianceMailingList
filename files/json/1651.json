{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am not sure if this is the correct forum to ask for something like that.. or this forum only deals with radiance software... but i decided to post my question in case that you can help me.\n\nI would like to know what softwares are there, which can found out/compute light sources (and probaply their direction) from hdr image.  Are there any other softwares doing this? If they are many, is there anywhere that I can find some information for their differences?\n\nDoes Radiance compute light sources from hdr images?\nThe only software I know doing this is lightgen, a plugin for hdrshop.\n\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n\np.s. By the way, is there a known problem with hdrgen (for linux) alignment algorithm? I captured perfectly aligned photos (using remote capturing - connect camera with computer) and using alignement with hdrgen (not use of -a option) results very bad hdr image. Althought when alignement was disable, the result was perfect!\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050121/f02f1b7f/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Despina Michael", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY22-DAV16A7C6BBEAEE2FDACAAAB790820@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 21 14:28:31 2005", "email": "despina_m81 at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] softwares to compute light sources from hdr image"}
