{"body": "\nHello everyone!\n\nI found a similar discussion on this link:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-December/001383.html\n\nBut still couldn't figure out. What could be the reason?\n\n*When I try bgraph command, I get an error that .plt file is not found.*\nbgraph lux.plt | x11meta\ninclude=line.plt\nbgraph: lux.plt: File not found: line.plt\n\n*Here is the lux.plt file:*\ninclude=line.plt\ntitle=\"Working Plane Illuminance\"\nxlabel=\"Distance from Window\"\nylabel=\"Illuminance [lux]\"\nAdata=lux.csv\nAcolor=2\n\n*line.plt file is present in:*\n/usr/share/radiance/meta\n\n*RAYPATH is set to:*\necho $RAYPATH\n.:/usr/share/radiance:\n\n*When I copied the line.plt file to working directory, the error is:*\ninclude=line.plt\nbgraph: lux.plt: File not found: line.plt\n\n*When I gave absolute path of line.plt file in lux.plt file, the error is:*\nbgraph: Cannot open: /usr/share/radiance/meta/line.plt\n\n*Radiance version is:*\nRADIANCE 4R1+20120125-1+b1 (Debian package) 32bit\n\nSo the question arises, Where does bgraph look for .plt files?\n\nThank you!\n\nVaib\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140415/145d393f/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Vaib", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD7gt0WfTisi0_D4HkxP+g3UxCisjBmBT3pJDrN5wt7Si_NWGQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 18:16:28 +0200", "email": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Where does bgraph look for .plt files?"}
