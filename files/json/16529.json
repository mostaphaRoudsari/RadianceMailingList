{"body": "\nHello list,\n\nI have a question related to Chris Coulters question about BSDF orientation\nand implementation earlier this month.\n\nI have a BSDF, placed in a skylight, with normal vector, vp of: -0.09 0.26\n1 (The skylights are oriented counterclockwise 335?N, and with tilt of\n15?).\n\n\n\nNow I come to the more tricky part ? at least for me ? considering the\n?view up?:\n\nThe clockwise rotation of the BSDF in the plane of the glass is 55?.\n\nThe default vu is 0 0 1. Doing some right-hand gymnastics, the coordinate\nsystem of the BSDF-plane is translated as the (x,z) coordinate system with\nthe ?top? of the default-BSDF in 0 0 1 ?. Since the BSDF I?m about to\nsimulate is oriented 55? clockwise in this coordinate system my ?vu vector\nwill be (-0.82 0 0.57). The kbin for my view matrix then turns into\nkbin(-0.0936,0,0.2578,-0.82,0,0.57). I have tried to sketch this on a very\nsimple hand drawing located here:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9713279/20140422145308628.pdf\n\n\n\nMy question is ? is my understanding of the view up right ?\n\n\n\n\n\nMed venlig hilsen/Best regards,\n\nAnne Iversen\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\nAnne Iversen\nPhD, MSc Energy, Sustainability Engineer\n\n\nDirect tel +45 8233 3049\n\nMobile +45 6035 2049\n\nHenning Larsen Architects A/S\nVesterbrogade 76\n1620 Copenhagen V\nDenmark\n\nTel +45 8233 3000\nwww.henninglarsen.com\n____________________________________________\n\nnyheder fra Henning Larsen Architects.\n<http://da.henninglarsen.com/nyheder/nyhedsbrev.aspx>\n\nupdates from Henning Larsen Architects.\n<http://www.henninglarsen.com/news/newsletter.aspx>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140422/f9c83ec5/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 21366 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140422/f9c83ec5/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: How to interpret the -vu for genklemsamp ?", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CADq2N7OsuowxzaZ06jxdPWNPcNiv1W48NfsSmRVEPDr0Ew5S5g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<C1D00D3E2C274049B1266DDAC224DFCE0140BDEAA990@vmVbg-EX.cph01.hlt.dk>"], "datetime": "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 15:37:36 +0200", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fwd: How to interpret the -vu for genklemsamp ?"}
