{"body": "\nHi Aris,\n\nI am puzzled by your use of the -I+ option to rcontrib (first command) and -i option to rsensor (second command). These options are very different from each other, and I don't think you really want to use either.  The -I+ option tells rtrace to interpret its 6 input values as virtual illuminance point and orientation, rather than ray origin and direction as produced by rsensor.  Using the -i option in the second rsensor command tells the program to evaluate surfaces in your scene as if they were all Lambertian with 314% reflectance.  Again, probably not what you had in mind.\n\nTry taking these options off and seeing what you get.  The rest of it looks OK as far as I can see.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rsensor/rcontrib", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<88574D3F-32C4-40F7-A1F4-05B90A44324E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<20140429194344.Horde.3iCnNz7CS6-fsD1EgB3uhw1@webmail.uth.gr>"], "datetime": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 10:21:38 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rsensor/rcontrib"}
