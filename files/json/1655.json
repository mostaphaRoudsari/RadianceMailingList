{"body": "\nJack,\n\nI have only done images up to 28800x28800 (3 GB file), and\nalways by using rpiece or the method that you suggest.\nUnfortunately, I have always done pfilt on the whole image, so I\nhave no experience with pfilting beforehand.\n\nI can imagine that you could cobble together a script that would\nread data from the adjacent images and attach a thin border\naround each piece, allowing you to pfilt first. Then you could\ntrim the extra border off and assemble the full image later.\n\nYou've probably thought of this, though.\n\nMark\n\nOn Thu, 20 Jan 2005, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] super high res images", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.61.0501201405310.6869@smith.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": ["<41EFFEFF.2030805@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 20 20:11:20 2005", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] super high res images"}
