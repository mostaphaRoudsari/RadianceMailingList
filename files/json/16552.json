{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI think the answer to your question is 'yes,' but you probably want something more specific.  Unfortunately, I don't understand your format well enough from your description, so it's difficult for me to instruct you.  If your 6 points each have 3 values for RGB and you just want to arrange them into rows that look like this (ignore labels before the colon):\n\nhour1:\tR1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2 R3 G3 B3 R4 G4 B4 R5 G5 B5 R6 G6 B6\nhour2:\tR1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2 R3 G3 B3 R4 G4 B4 R5 G5 B5 R6 G6 B6\n....\nhour8760:\t\tR1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2 R3 G3 B3 R4 G4 B4 R5 G5 B5 R6 G6 B6\n\nThis can be achieved with a simple rcollate command, here assuming no header:\n\nrcollate -h -oc 6 input.txt > output.txt\n\nIf instead, your input is ordered with 8760 RGB values for sensor 1, followed by 8760 RGB values for sensor 2, etc., you'll need to transpose using:\n\nrcollate -h -ic 8760 -ir 6 -t input.txt > output.txt\n\nI hope this is clear enough, but I realize it's confusing.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140416/a5300e68/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcollate troubles in Five-Phase CFS tutorial", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B222A2E9-7D70-4AD2-B56A-EC74C344056D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC212FC649@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>", "<DE9A1AB0-11B5-49B7-B935-311860702D4B@lmi.net>", "<CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC212FD67D@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 11:02:14 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcollate troubles in Five-Phase CFS tutorial"}
