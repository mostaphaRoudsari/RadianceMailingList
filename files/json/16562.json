It is the only other variable you need set in Radiance, as these plotting tools predate any of the others.\n\nOnce you find where these files are located (try \"/usr/share/radiance/meta\" for starters), set your environment variable like so:\n\nexport MDIR=/usr/share/radiance/meta/\n\nThe trailing '/' is necessary in this case.\n\nGood luck!\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140415/f4b65310/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Where does bgraph look for .plt files?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7F2DA804-837E-41E7-B928-F0561FBA1D95@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAD7gt0WfTisi0_D4HkxP+g3UxCisjBmBT3pJDrN5wt7Si_NWGQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 09:38:38 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Where does bgraph look for .plt files?"}
