The two other HEAD\narchive formats, cpio and zip,  had been unaffected by this.\nSince this afternoon, the archives are generated by a locally compiled\ncpio version 2.6, which has the above bug fixed.\n\n-Peter\n\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modifications dates in HEAD tar archive", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<41EFFF57.1000905@pab-opto.de>", "refs": ["<348B896C-6A54-11D9-9E74-000A95BB392A@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 20 20:00:03 2005", "email": "apian at pab-opto.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modifications dates in HEAD tar archive"}
