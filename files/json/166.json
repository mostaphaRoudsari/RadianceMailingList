{"body": "\nhi,\n\nI hope this isn't a stupid question..\nI have a room with transluscent skylights.\nWhen I simulated the room with clear sunny sky, the illuminance values\ninside the room were reasonable and expected, around 400 Lux.\nWhen I simulated a cloudy sky or a intermediate sky without a sun, the\nilluminance values inside the room were way too low, <30 Lux.\nWhy is this?  I usually use sunny sky and so never came across this\nproblem before.\n\nThus far I have changed the skylight material around several times to\nmake\nsure that I didn't create a really bad example of a trans, I am running\nmkillum\nand surface normals are correct, and I have also increased the rendering\n\nquality (to see if more light can be found) but nothing is working.\n\nAny help for this would be great.\nthanks,\n\njudy\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "judy lai", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3C1554F3.CD444497@lbl.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Dec 2001 16:36:03 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trans material with sunless sky"}
