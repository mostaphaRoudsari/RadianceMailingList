(http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/calc.1.html)  There\nare some good examples in Chapter 4 of \"Rendering with Radiance,\" which\nI naturally recommend to anyone who is using this system.\n(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604995/qid%3D1019140007/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F0%5F1/\n102-0825924-1038525)  You should also browse the initialization file in\nray/src/rt/rayinit.cal, which defines and describes the variables and\nfunctions you have access to within the ray tracer.\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: .cal files", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 18 Apr 2002 07:30:26 -0700"}
