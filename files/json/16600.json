{"body": "\nDear Radiance Community,\n\nAs probably some of you remember I showed Honeybee as a work in progress\nduring the last Radiance Workshop: (\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wexas-XWMWaQdEVpOmPP8oVTR3D2xRhNtLAw7M-UzsA/edit#slide=id.ge3cf2cba_673\n).\n\nWe released daylighting components last month and obviously from that day I\nwanted to send an email and ask for your help and feedback. It never\nhappened as I never get the chance to capture an illustrative video.\n\nThis Sunday (April 6) I will be teaching a workshop to cover the essential\nworkflows for conducting effective daylighting analysis with Honeybee.\n\nWe will stream the workshop live. It should be a good place to get started\nuntil I capture a number of short videos.\n\nHere is a video that shows what current version of Honeybee does (\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5WNxkgL0hc).\n\nIn case you are interested check this link to find more information about\nthe workshop:\nhttp://www.mebd-penndesign.info/Honeybee-MEBD-Workshop-PennDesign\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nCheers,\nMostapha\n\nPS: In case you haven't heard of Ladybug and Honeybee and you haven't click\non any of the links above here is a short description:\nHoneybee is an open-source plugin for Grasshopper3D that connects\nGrasshopper/Rhino to Radiance, Daysim, EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. Currently\ncomponents for Radiance and Daysim are released to the public. You can read\nmore about Honeybee here (\nhttp://core.thorntontomasetti.com/honeybee-is-out-and-flying/) and check\nthe source code on github (https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/).\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140404/be3ccf5d/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAAd_PgSAZ6_iVnDTW=qzH7UvZ04vJb_i5zMWvG37LeqJRWthGg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 4 Apr 2014 13:33:46 -0400", "email": "sadeghipour at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Honeybee Daylight Analysis Webinar - April 6"}
