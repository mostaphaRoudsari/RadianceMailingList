{"body": "\nHiroaki,\n\nI agree with Greg that it's not clear what you're doing, but I'm assuming\nthat you're using the climate data to create a sky file and then comparing\nthe horizontal direct illuminance to horizontal direct calculated from\nsolar angle and the climate data.\n\nIntegrating over pixels of a rendering is a round about way of getting at\nilluminance. There's also potential error introduced by the pixel\nresolution of the sun in the image. To address this you should make your\nimages very large (~4000x4000 pixels). Also I think you want to multiply\nthe result by 4, not 16, in your rcalc command (you have to multiply by\n4/pi to counter the effect of the black edge pixels and also multiply by pi\nas part of your hemisphere integration - pi cancels and the 4 remains).\nThis plus fixing your view as Greg suggests should give agreement.\n\nYou might consider instead using rtrace with -I+ (capital i) and -ab 1 like\nso:\n\nrtrace -h -I+ -ab 1 -aa 0 -ad 10000 -lw 1e-5 sky.oct\n\n\nAlso gendaylit is probably a better option than gensky for creating a sky\nfrom a weather file. Gensky will give agreement in this test, but the sky\ngenerated won't as valid as one generated by gendaylit.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Fri, May 2, 2014 at 12:39 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140502/b2c000bc/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<540FBAAB-320D-4A20-A78F-A788905F4EF3@lmi.net>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixB8tVkkdzRwMVMkvjx-A3PZA88W8HBqRELS0x4ep2_sA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CA+8HjZfFQXcC=c+1yDT1RHfhCFa7hnUy0iyTSV=XtrjvpuXsaA@mail.gmail.com>", "<540FBAAB-320D-4A20-A78F-A788905F4EF3@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Fri, 2 May 2014 14:07:28 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Difference between climate data and Radiancedata."}
