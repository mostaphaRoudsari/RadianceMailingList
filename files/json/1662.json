I tried looking through the archives, but could\nnot find anything specific I might have to do when compiling or installing\nRadiance to take advantage of the 64 bit processing. What is the best\napproach that people have found to build and run Radiance on a 64 bit\nmachine? I'm not a Linux expert by any means, so any little tidbits of\ninformation would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks,\n\nDave\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] AMD 64 Compile/Insta", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
