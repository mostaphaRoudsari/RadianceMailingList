{"body": "\nThank you for your reply.\n\nMy view file was wrong. And it was a simple mistake.\nThough I should have turned a viewpoint below, I took an upswing.\n\nI'd like to study the distribution of solar radiation.\nAs a result of having noticed a mistake, I could get good result as follows.\n1. Got parallel view by Radiance.\n2. Picked original data by pvalue.\n3. Calculated solar radiation (W/m2) by (R+G+B)/3*4*0.8\nThe value I got was same as the value that I input in gensky command.\nBut I did not know why it was necessary to multiply 0.8.\nSomeone, please tell me.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHiroaki\n\n2014-05-03 6:07 GMT+09:00 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140508/383c7554/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAOG+NixB8tVkkdzRwMVMkvjx-A3PZA88W8HBqRELS0x4ep2_sA@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "=?UTF-8?B?5r+x55Sw6KOV56ug?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+8HjZdyuj45DS1f2UB7fXf2L84gaLky26L=9uksoj0vRz+AbQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CA+8HjZfFQXcC=c+1yDT1RHfhCFa7hnUy0iyTSV=XtrjvpuXsaA@mail.gmail.com>", "<540FBAAB-320D-4A20-A78F-A788905F4EF3@lmi.net>", "<CAOG+NixB8tVkkdzRwMVMkvjx-A3PZA88W8HBqRELS0x4ep2_sA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 8 May 2014 17:36:24 +0900", "email": "hiroaki.mp.3 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Difference between climate data and Radiancedata."}
