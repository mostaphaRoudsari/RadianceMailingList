{"body": "\nHi Richard and rest of community,\n\nwe are actually working on a research project, dealing with user\nassessments with special focus on glare from daylight in office spaces.\nWe have already tested 100 subjects at two different locations under\nvery different conditions (facade systems, window sizes, viewing\ndirections...).\n\nAs a first result I can summarize, that all existing formula like dgi,\nugr, cie, vcp show a pearson correlation less than 0.15. Values less\nthan 0.5 can be also achieved by chance...\nTherefore I can not advice you to use these indices.\n\nI can already announce, that we will come up with a new, much more\nreliable index, which will be called \" daylight glare probability dgp\".\nThis dgp will model the probability, that a person in an office will be\ndisturbed by daylight glare. The publication on this will be submitted\nby me and Jens Christoffersen in few days to an special issue on\ndaylighting in \"energy and buildings\" and will hopefully published end\nof this year.\n\nAdditionally, we will come up with a new tool called \"evalglare\" , which\nis based on the RADIANCE picture format and will be available in mid  of\nthis year\nThis tool has some new features compared to findglare and will have the\nnew index implemented, too. (see also\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop3/cd/Wienold_extabs.pdf).\nAs soon as it will be available I will announce it.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I would chose the vertical eye illuminance as a\nmeasure for the glare - for this value we found reasonable results\ncomparing this to the percentage of disturbed persons.\n\nJan\n\n\nfurry@ihug.com.au wrote:\n\n\n--\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\no -\n| \\            Jan Wienold\nFraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nSOLAR BUILDING DESIGN GROUP - DAYLIGHTING\nHeidenhofstr. 2\n79110 Freiburg\nGERMANY\n\nIn office:\nMo, Tue: 9:00-18:00\nWe-Fr:  8:30-14:00\nPhone: ++49 - (0) 761 - 4588 -5- 133\nFax:   ++49 - (0) 761 - 4588 -9- 133\nEmail: jan.wienold@ise.fraunhofer.de\n\nInternet:\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Discomfort Glare - How do I evaluate", "sender": "Jan Wienold", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<41EF80A1.6090400@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "refs": ["<E1Cr1np-0005nj-00@noir.ihug.com.au>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 20 10:58:14 2005", "email": "jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Discomfort Glare - How do I evaluate"}
