{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nI missed to mentioned that I tried -s a (auto) also. Also I tried to get\nthe peak value from pextrem. But I got skeptical as these values were about\n100 times more (for sunny sky) than what I saw in some research papers; and\nthe image was just one color. :)\n\nThat's why I came back to manually tracing the brightest pixel approach.\n\nCan you please elaborate on the \"log 2\" scale approach ? Thank you for your\ntime!\n\nBEst regards,\nVaib\n\n\n\nOn 23 May 2014 23:56, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140524/9203d1ca/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Zenith Luminance from rvu", "sender": "Vaib", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD7gt0VqHapvkj+u_VVAHCqrG57AM7G+h+5MRyDCU8F_q80-zg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAD7gt0XcRRJQJAK-uqSVOZNtY3g9LLb-7_Tq2o1_j=NBwWmF8g@mail.gmail.com>", "<CFA4ED75.7EFC%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Sat, 24 May 2014 00:27:31 +0530", "email": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Zenith Luminance from rvu"}
