I have billiard balls that\nare a \"plastic\" material and a large area light above them. For some reason\nthe area light appears in their reflections as a grid of squares (or\ncircles now that I've changed the roughness). The shadows even show this\nbreak-up of the area light.\n\nHere's a small sample:\nhttp://www.ian.testers.homelinux.net/dump/billiard_main4.weird\n(hosted on my ADSL line, be nice!)\n\nI've tried fiddling with -dj and -ds, and a few other rpict parameters, but\nthey don't seem to do much at all. Is this a bug in Radiance 3.7 or am I\ndoing something wrong? I've never had this problem with area lights in\nRadiance before.\n\nthanks,\nbye\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ian Tester", "datetime": "Tue Aug 23 21:30:19 2005"}
