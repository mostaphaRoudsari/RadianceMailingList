{"body": "\nHi Bshara (& Rob),\n\n\nFor a real-world setting (with trees!), I'd say you were doing pretty good to get within 30%.  Is that repeatable for other times/days?  If not, it might be a 'lucky hit'.  Either way, comparison of simulation with measurements is a valuable exercise I'd recommend to anyone new to Radiance (or any lighting simulation program for that matter).\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<565DE1EC-C7BC-4C40-9B34-DCCC77D52EDD@lboro.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 9 May 2014 10:20:58 +0000", "email": "J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rsensor vs. rtrace"}
