{"body": "\nVera\n\nThis sounds like you are trying to create something like an \"ambient\nocclusion\" or \"clay rendering\"; the closer you are to an object the more\nobstructed the view of the sky is and so the ground gets darker.\n\nYou can indeed create this using a uniform sky but you have to use \"-ab 1\"\nfor your rendering or the sky will not contribute to the scene. The \"no\nlight sources found\" warning comes up because a \"glow\" material that is\nused for the sky technically does not count as a light \"source\" Radiance.\n\nIf you plan to use the rendering for analysis you can set the sky\nbrightness to a known quantity so that the rendering can be interpreted as\nan absolute value of the obstruction of the sky. I think John Mardaljevic\nwrote down the math for this in the Rendering with Radiance chapter on\nskies/daylight. You should also add \"-av 0 0 0\" or the added ambient value\nwill skew your results.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, May 4, 2014 at 9:50 PM, Vera Liu <lizzielyh at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140505/1cf67441/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Uniform sky", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k3a5wfzx0xJdALD2eADi6pfNxf_n4WuOr5eGX2a=bD05Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CACxzXYxU0YpUyK0D6a66ia7Es_ekrNJi5MtWuio1dbkZXypTog@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAGhWmF7OecfTGdOjGcPy-sxQSFj4wqnD3GL6ENeT0_f3o0eXpA@mail.gmail.com>", "<CACxzXYw69DtB4Fu7=J5UkM4vb1X5aNGN9svV0an7ZFS6NKBfsw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 5 May 2014 09:02:34 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Uniform sky"}
