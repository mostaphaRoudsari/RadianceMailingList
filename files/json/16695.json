{"body": "\nHi Radiance experts,\nI want to get the ground truth pixel values of a scene generated by\nradiance and I figured the best way is to use a uniform sky where the sky\nit's 1,1,1...everywhere. The way I'm currently using is by specifying a sun\n!gensky 4 1 12 +s -a 40 -o 98 -m 105\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\nThis results in shadows in the final scene. I found that -u option or -c\noption can give me a uniform cloudy sky and maybe give me the ground truth\nvalues. I tried both of them but always get 'no lighting source warning'\nand a very dark scene when I try to use rpict and pfilt on the .oct\ngenerated. I think I might be understanding something wrong. Could you\nplease give me a hint on this? The two options I tried are:\n!gensky 3 20 12 -a 40 -o 98 -m 105 -u -B 100\nand\n!gensky -ang 45 0 -c -b 1\n\nThank you very much!\nBest,\nVera\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140504/9bc105af/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Vera Liu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CACxzXYxU0YpUyK0D6a66ia7Es_ekrNJi5MtWuio1dbkZXypTog@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 4 May 2014 14:33:29 -0700", "email": "lizzielyh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Uniform sky"}
