{"body": "\n\nDear Greg,\n\nthanks a lot for the reply. So, piping data from rsensor to contrib  with\n-I+ , makes  rcontrib to use measurement point position and direction from\nthe view file (as expected)  but ignores the rays emitted in accordance to\nthe sensor file. That explains the fact that the results remained more or\nless the same when sensor file was replaced. Now comparing the results\n(narrow versus cosine corrected sensor, overcast sky) using rsensor/rcontrib\n3phase  method, without -I+, there is a difference (58%),  but it is\nmuch-much less than the difference observed using rsensor only command.\nConsequently, calculation of illuminance values  with 3phase method can be\ndone either using the standard method (measurement points to rcontrib with\n-I+ ) or with the combination of rsensor (cosine corrected sensor file)\n/rcontrib without using -I+ but with some \"handling\" of the rays emitted in\norder to get similar view matrix files.\n\n\nBest,\nAris\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org]\nSent: Wednesday, April 30, 2014 10:00 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

These options are very different from\neach other, and I don't think you really want to use either.  The -I+ option\ntells rtrace to interpret its 6 input values as virtual illuminance point\nand orientation, rather than ray origin and direction as produced by\nrsensor.  Using the -i option in the second rsensor command tells the\nprogram to evaluate surfaces in your scene as if they were all Lambertian\nwith 314% reflectance.  Again, probably not what you had in mind.\n\nTry taking these options off and seeing what you get.  The rest of it looks\nOK as far as I can see.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\nsurface located in the middle of a south facing room, three methods have\nbeen used (rtrace, rsensor and 3phase method using rsensor|rcontrib to\nestimate the view matrix) with the results difference been explainable.\nSensor file represents spatial resonse file of a cosine corrected sensor.\n(2x10 degrees) illuminance value using the 3phase approach was the same (~1%\ndifference) as in the case of the cosine corrected sensor.\n-f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -b kbinS -m glazing -I+ -ab 11 -ad 50000 -ds .1\n-lw 1e-5 test_r.oct>narrow10.vmx\ncosine corrected sensor file):\nnarrow10.dat  overcast.oct|rcalc -e\n\"$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)\">overcast_rsensor_10.dat\nsensor files and are in accordance with the spatial response.
