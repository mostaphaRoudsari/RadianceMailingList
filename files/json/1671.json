(I just checked.)\nYou can increase the -dj parameter to 1 and get a better result.\nDecreasing -ds also helps somewhat, but setting -ds 0 makes it look\nunnatural.  Increasing the roughness also alleviates the problem --\nit's just when you're on the boundary that you'll have trouble.\n\nAn alternative is to use a perfectly smooth material modified by a\nrandom texture function that simulates roughness without applying the\nBRDF model in Radiance, like so:\n\n# A glossy surface\nvoid texfunc ball_roughness\n4 gloss_dx gloss_dy gloss_dz gloss.cal\n0\n3 0.01 0.01 0.01\n\nball_roughness plastic white3\n0\n0\n5       0.9     0.9     0.9\n0.05    0.0\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  There are two relevant references for materials in Radiance, as\nRob mentioned:\n\nSIGGRAPH '92:    http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg92/paper.html\n\nMaterials reference:    http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/\nmaterials.pdf\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Aug 24 17:28:10 2005"}
