I want to change both the\nRGB propeties of the light source and the materials. After Radiance\nanalizes the scene one can obtain as the output data, the luminance of\nany point I select in my scene. Besides knowing what is the luminance\nin any desired point, I'm very interested in knowing what is the RGB\ncomponent also of any point of the scene (such as if I were measuring\nthe RGB spectral component in several points of a room with a\nspectometer). Is that possible? And if yes, what do you recommend me to\ndo in order to obtain this as an output data?\n\nI would appreciate any help.\n\nThan you,\n-adriana\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "alira@gsd.harvard.edu", "datetime": "Wed Aug 24 23:00:02 2005"}
