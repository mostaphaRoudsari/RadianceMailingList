{"body": "\nRoss,\n\nI think this is because you don't have the current working directory in\nyour RAYPATH.\nThis is a fault in the instructions on setting RAYPATH on NREL's installer\npage. I'd tell you how to rectify it, but I personally don't know how to\nindicate current working directory in a Windows environment variable (on\n*nix systems it's a period). a work around is to use the whole path in the\nrad file (starting with c:) but you have a space in one of your directory\nnames, so you'd have to do something to escape the space (on *nix it's a\nbackslash before the space - Don't know if it's the same on Windows).\n\nCan any Windows Radiance user help with including the current working\ndirectory in RAYPATH?\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 17, 2014 at 7:10 AM, Thompson, Ross <rt at cbgc.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140617/cc454963/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 124, Issue 12", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NixUA_FxLVKofio-MDgVi98JZGqnDr2z72RiM32LQDwN0A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<mailman.43.1403010712.1456.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<158985743D5CE54688E6CF19C8E978455683590199@UKCBGEX01.cbg.local>"], "datetime": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 11:08:22 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 124, Issue 12"}
