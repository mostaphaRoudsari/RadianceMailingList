{"body": "\nI think that a reasonable approach is to use the global illuminance reading to determine the direct + indirect integrated total, then compare this to the integration of the HDR sky dome recording.  You can then add in a solar source whose solid angle is enlarged to cover the \"clipped\" pixels in the HDR image, adjusting its radiance such that the new total:\n\nintegrated_masked_HDR + solar_source*adj_solid_angle*cos_theta = measured_illuminance\n\nThe larger sun that includes circumsolar will lead to slightly enlarged penumbras in some cases, but it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm sure a script could be made to automate the above process without too much effort.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140628/4c001524/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Sky Camera @ LBNL's Flexlab", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DBE681E1-DE58-4782-8510-2718AC6D579D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAOG+NiyM4q-bfcUKAPdCGhbunO_CRw_110D8RC5SrkgW1=7OeA@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAGhWmF7sHniEKq_w35wpgEme-MriJTjXR5WXoU9gc_8HGk-Tcw@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAK+g53CUg2cQ-uPUkm6TXmimD9_a2ma24xawwgG+ABJPsWaqVw@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAEkFE9hV9R1SQri9tCLsPRTKDfMzqmYbYpmqa=+=8XktgF7F2g@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAOG+NiwrEoAp9gtqZDsXhjrANqSxggnd=ZXwhzJEb63xxopKfw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 10:56:06 +0200", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR Sky Camera @ LBNL's Flexlab"}
