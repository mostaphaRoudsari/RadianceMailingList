{"body": "\nHi Vera,\n\nI love these sorts of questions, because it means I get to look at code I haven't touched in years...\n\nIn this case, I don't think the problem is with your spotlight specification per se.  Rather, I believe the vector orientation disagrees with whatever surface you have applied it to.  Radiance makes a check to be sure that the spotlight direction is not \"behind\" the surface you use it with, and this generated an error in your case.  Check the geometry you are using with your spotlight, and I think you'll find the problem.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140622/ad6ff9a8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Invalid spotlight direction", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A30C7D7F-6A21-42BD-9798-727CDD905BF0@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CACxzXYz7WaLyFs5hyJh+HfAOwa1U6n8Pb9A5BaZv=eebLE76JA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 10:58:38 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Invalid spotlight direction"}
