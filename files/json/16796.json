I'd tell you how to rectify it, but I personally don't know how to\nindicate current working directory in a Windows environment variable (on\n*nix systems it's a period). a work around is to use the whole path in the\nrad file (starting with c:) but you have a space in one of your directory\nnames, so you'd have to do something to escape the space (on *nix it's a\nbackslash before the space - Don't know if it's the same on Windows).\n\n\n\nCan any Windows Radiance user help with including the current working\ndirectory in RAYPATH?\n\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 17, 2014 at 7:10 AM, Thompson, Ross <rt at cbgc.com\n<mailto:rt at cbgc.com> > wrote:\n\n\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for the prompt responses.

There may be a\nbuilt-in limit for oconv or another process in Radiance. What happens if you\ncombine all the output files to a single file with the xform command?\n\nxform test.rad > test_combined.rad\n\n\nIf this works you can run oconv with the test_combined.rad file:\n\noconv test_combined.rad > test.oct\n\n\n\nBTW: Is there a specific reason to have so many materials in your scene?\nMost of your scene files contain only a few polygons. You can also try to\nexport the scene by group or by layer in su2rad. That (probably) reduces the\nfile count and can solve your problem.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 17, 2014 at 2:44 AM, Thompson, Ross <rt at cbgc.com\n<mailto:rt at cbgc.com> > wrote:\n\n<http://www.cbgc.com>\ndestroyed.\nus.\n----------------------------\nWe are proud to announce that CBG Consultants have been shortlisted for the\nCIBSE Building Services Consultancy of the year (up to 100 employees) Award\n2014.\n\nOxford:\nSouth House,\n3 Farmoor Court,\nCumnor Road,\nOxford OX2 9LU\nT: 01865 864500\nF: 01865 864584\nE: oxf at cbgc.com <mailto:oxf at cbgc.com>\n\nLondon:\nLector Court,\n151-153 Farringdon Road,\nLondon EC1R 3AF\nT: 0207 833 8815\nF: 0203 302 0050\nE: lon at cbgc.com <mailto:lon at cbgc.com>\n\nFor the latest CBG news visit www.cbgc.com <http://www.cbgc.com>\n\n\nCBG Consultants Ltd Registered No. 538 4147/VAT Registration No. 860 3120 63\n\nPlease consider the environment - do you really need to print this email?\n\nThe views expressed in this e-mail are those of the sender and not\nnecessarily those of CBG Consultants.\n\nThe content of this email is private and may be confidential for the\nintended recipient only.
