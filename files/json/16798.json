Also check in with Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg at IDL-Boise (http://www.idlboise.com/), as those guys developed a Python script a while back that would also do the calculations.\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 6/12/14, 3:43 PM, \"Sandy Houck\" <shouck at brummitt.com<mailto:shouck at brummitt.com>> wrote:\n\nHi Jill,\n\nI inquired about this to the Diva folks and they said that the recently released DAYSIM-PS does.  That version is not yet bundled into Diva and  I have not checked into it further at this point.\n\nThat?s all I know but hopefully we will get some more responses here with encouraging news!\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n\nSent: Thursday, June 12, 2014 6:34 AM\nTo: radiance-general\nHello Everyone,\n\nDoes anyone know of a software that can calculate the LEED v4 Daylight credit requirements for Option 1. Simulation? It requires Spatial Daylight Autonomy and Annual Sunlight Exposure per IES LM 83.\n\nThanks,\nJill\n--\n\nJill Dalglish, PE, LEED AP BD+C\n[cid:image001.gif at 01CF863B.E3F217C0]\nS/W/DBE Certified Business\nwww.dalglishdaylighting.com<http://www.dalglishdaylighting.com/>\n303-955-4945\n-------------- next part --------------\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "jill at dalglishdaylighting.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CFC48C1D.8A0F%robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jun 2014 10:02:30 -0600", "email": "Jill Dalglish", "subject": "[Radiance-general] LEED v4 calcs"}
