{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am now looking to use radiance after learning daysim. I have successfully completed the tutorial and am now looking to produce renders from scenes set up in SketchUp.\nHere is a link to the SketchUp output file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a\n\nMy approach is to apply the OCONV function to the ?test.rad? file.\nHowever unlike in the tutorial, materials and geometry are housed in separate directories.\nAnd I get the following errors:\noconv test.rad > test.oct\nxform: cannot find file \"objects/Material133.rad\"\noconv: warning - (!xform objects/Material133.rad): empty file\n\nI don?t quite understand why the file can?t be found.\nAm I using the correct approach?\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nRoss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss Thompson\n\nSenior Sustainability & Energy Engineer\n\nT: 01865 864500\n\nOxford:\nSouth House\n3 Farmoor Court\nCumnor Road\nOxford OX2 9LU\nPhone: 01865 864500\nFax:  01865 864584\nEmail: oxf at cbgc.com<mailto:oxf at cbgc.com>\n\nLondon:\nLector Court\n151-153 Farringdon Road\nLondon EC1R 3AF\nPhone: 0207 833 8815\nFax: 0203 302 0050\nEmail: lon at cbgc.com<mailto:lon at cbgc.com>\n\nFor the latest CBG news visit www.cbgc.com<http://www.cbgc.com>         [cid:imageb52106.PNG at 342faba9.40b27292] <http://facebook.com/cbgconsultantsltd>  [cid:imagebba53f.PNG at fbbf4f66.44ac669c] <http://twitter.com/CBGConsultants>\n\nCBG Consultants Ltd Registered No. 538 4147/VAT Registration No. 860 3120 63\n\n\n\n[cid:imagefebc64.PNG at 28e6e5db.4b951da0]\n\nPlease consider the environment - do you really need to print this email?\n\nThe views expressed in this e-mail are those of the sender and not necessarily those of CBG Consultants.\n\nThe content of this email is private and may be confidential for the intended recipient only.
