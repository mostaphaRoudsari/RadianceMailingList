{"body": "\nDear colleagues,\n\nI am working on the second volume of the Daylighting Handbook and for the simulation chapter I am looking for high quality Radiance visualization, preferably one that features great architecture and ideally some non-standard Radiance materials. If you have such a visualization and you are willing to share it with me for the book, please let me know.\n\nAll the best,\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 7714, f: 617 253 6152, creinhart at mit.edu<mailto:creinhart at mit.edu>\nSustainable Design Lab<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/> | Daylighting Handbook I<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069220363X> | DIVA<http://www.diva4rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://daysim.ning.com/> | mapdwell<http://www.mapdwell.com/> | umi<http://www.urbanmodeling.net/>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140612/5cab3a07/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Christoph Reinhart", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E806944E15F@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 12 Jun 2014 14:27:56 +0000", "email": "tito_ at MIT.EDU", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Something great!"}
