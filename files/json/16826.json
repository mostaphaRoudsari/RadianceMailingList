{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI am working with the 3 phase method (only from a few weeks) and I am\ntrying to understand the BSDF file format and how the 3 phase method read\nit.\n\nI have noticed that if I use the bsdf created with the command:\ngenBSDF -n 4 +f +b -geom meter material.rad blinds.rad > blinds.xml\nthe .xml file contain same geometrical dimension (height, width). In fact\nif I use the command:\npkgBSDF -s blinds.xml > blinds_pkg.rad\nthe output file contain the original geometry.\n\nInstead if I use the BSDF created or contained  in the database of WINDOW 7\nthese file do not contain a geometry.\nWith pkgBSDF I got an error.\n\nMy questions are:\n1.  in the equation i=VTDs the T matrix has to contain the window geometry\nor take knowledge of these from the other two matrix(V,D)?\n2.  I have understood that 3 phase method uses only the front transmission\ndata [A. McNeil, Three-Phase Method tutorial]  but in\nan other discussion [\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008969.html\n]  I have discovered that WINDOW and genBSDF use an opposite meaning of\nfront and back, so the front transmission regards radiance or window\nmeaning?And what part of the T matrix I have to use in the 3 phase method\nfor the respective cases (WINDOW or genBSDF)?\n\nKind regards,\n*Giuseppe*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140702/ba605659/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Giuseppe De Michele", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOn=hKFEOqarG-DV3AoGONwUzeBzX1_ynVRQ5bj13M3yk+mw3g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 17:54:09 +0200", "email": "giudm.87 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF question"}
