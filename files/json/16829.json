{"body": "\nGiuseppe,\n\nThe front/back inconsistency is mostly related to the BSDF material\nprimitive. For the 3-phase method you don't have to worry about front/back\nof the fenestration. (unless you want to use a BSDF backwards, which might\nbe impossible without manually editing the BSDF file).\n\nThe BSDF handling has matured quite a bit since the early days of the\nthree-phase method. These days dctimestep can use either front transmission\nor back transmission applying reciprocity principles for the three phase\nmethod.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jul 2, 2014 at 9:24 AM, CHI-German Molina <gmolina at hdlao.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140702/7a307dde/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF question", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Niw3QbK2MbS14otkUWhuAU14e135d7KZqk_cOcz24Z14yQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOn=hKFEOqarG-DV3AoGONwUzeBzX1_ynVRQ5bj13M3yk+mw3g@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAK+g53D6Stks_Y7XGB=S=Lricc4cn0SHN_z81TS9jLFQqo8G9w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 10:12:07 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BSDF question"}
