{"body": "\nDear Kyle,\nI downloaded the file that was in the link you attached for rendering hdr sky images. I tried it with two of my images, the first was a clear sky and the other one was an overcast sky.\nWith the overcast sky I didn't had any problems, it rendered fine, although the clear sky image render didn't come out well. There are two issues: the first is that in the HDR images the sky appears really dark, and in the TIFF image the sky looks good but the ground disappears.\nCould you give me some tips to improve the clear sky images? Have you had this problem when dealing with a clear sky render?\nThis is the link where you can see the results: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ujhiskn9ohks3vt/AAAjkOyAis6_MfCEHfXwwalea\n\nBest,\n\nM.
