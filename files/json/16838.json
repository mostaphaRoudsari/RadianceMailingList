{"body": "\nDear Everyone,\n\nI want to create the average radiance Tregenza 145 patches for certain sky model. So far, I know it is possible using genskyvec. The question is, is it possible to use genskyvec to  compute average radiances for a user defined sky model. Better to say, is it possible to pass a sky rad file to genskyvec?\n\nCheers, Ehsan\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DB798D6C-3314-4E6C-A0AC-7D52361DA245@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 9 Jul 2014 10:03:30 +0200", "email": "em.vazifeh at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genskyvec"}
