{"body": "\nHi all, Thanks for the answer to my previous question. I have some more questions regarding the steps to generate the BSDF representation of a light pipe using GENBSDF. I will be using this BSDF in a 3-phase-method to assess the light pipe performance. My light pipe consists of a straight vertical cylinder made of a highly reflective material with a clear glass pane on top (collector) and a diffusing glass at the bottom (diffuser). I have a BSDF of the diffuser provided by the manufacturer which I would like to include. This description consists on a series of files for different incident angles every 10 degrees. Below is an excerpt of the first of these files for an incident angle of 0 degrees:\n#pgII DSF data read from database by pab Ltd \"mountain\"#see http://bsdf.pab.eu for pgII gonio-photometer and BSDF details#mountain-version\t\"pab mountain V2.9.1\"#database-host\tpgdb#database-name\tpabpg#measured_at\t\"2014-01-18 12:34:22\"#data_read_from_db\t\"2014-01-30 21:26:23\"#database_id\t5383#datapoints_in_db\t259193#database_reference_id\t5379#integrated_value\t0.75\t6.3#sample_label\t\"ZTC014_0001\"#sample_name\t\"Velux_ZTC014_0001\"#lamp\t\"halogen1\"#beamshape\t\"inf,f=300,a=1\"#filterlamp\t\"IRcutoff\"#filterdet\t\"BG18,25mm\"#comment\t\"velux dataset1\"#mcomment\t\"$Id: do_meas_batch.c,v 1.33 2013/01/05 13:54:16 apian Exp apian $|daq serial[0]=\"007\t\" (channel minimum)|optfile=fullrot-30_broadT_50|userdata=$Header: /usr/local/pab_pg/etc/RCS/userdata.luna,v 1.22 2013/09/17 07:22:27 pgadmin Exp pgadmin $|cxtcounter=yes|bl_armB=0.0075|daq_ss=100|speedbend=(0.03,0.015)|lamp_cycles=155 poweron=34655 [h] last_change=164 [min]\"#column\tdaq#dump-host\tsun1#incident_angle\t0\t0#intheta\t0#inphi\t0#rear_integral\t0.751#mountain_minimum_angle\t0.1 [deg]#datapoints_in_file\t115477#format: theta\tphi\tDSF90.04250\t-100.19987\t6.031e-0490.23273\t-100.16634\t4.376e-0490.43701\t-100.12965\t4.245e-0490.62713\t-100.09495\t4.482e-04(...)\nMy questions are:1. How to include this diffuser BSDF as a Radiance material?2. Should I include the diffuser BSDF in the model that I will use to generate the BSDF of the whole light pipe? An alternative I can think of would be not to include it and then juxtapose both BSDFs as two parallel diffusers. Would both these options work well? 3. Lastly, I am a bit lost with the rtcontrib settings when using GENBSDF for this particular case, some help here would be much appreciated.\nThank you in advance.
