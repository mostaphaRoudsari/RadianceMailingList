{"body": "\nHi Kelly,\n\nThere are many, many ways to represent color, unfortunately.\n\nThere is no reason you could not apply the HSV formulas (say from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV>) to RGB values out of Radiance.  To get the actual color values from an image, you can use the \"pvalue\" program to convert to ASCII format.  From there, you can use the \"rcalc\" program to convert to other coordinates, e.g.:\n\npvalue -h -H -d render.hdr \\\n| rcalc -e 'iR=$1;iG=$2;iB=$3' -e 'cmax=if(iR-iG,if(iR-iB,1,3),if(iG-iB,2,3))' -e '$1=cmax'\n\nFor each pixel, the above command would tell you which channel was largest, 1 (red), 2 (green), or 3 (blue).  The complete formula to get to HSV is more complicated, but hopefully this will get you started.\n\nThere are already functions provided to get from XYZ color space to CIE Lab and Luv spaces.  However, these spaces require you to define a maximum \"white\" value, which you may or may not know.  If the maximum white is \"100\", you could use the following to compute Lab coordinates for each pixel:\n\nra_xyze render.hdr \\\n| pvalue -h -H -d \\\n| rcalc -f cielab.cal -e 'Xw=100;Yw=100;Zw=100' -e '$1=Ls($2);$2=as($1,$2,$3);$3=bs($1,$2,$3)'\n\nThe first command (ra_xyze) converts from an RGB to an XYZ picture, which you could also do with rcalc, but this way is probably faster and easier to show.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140728/732e6898/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HSV values from rtrace", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<256D0473-7139-4061-B3C0-5CB10C74E2D0@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CABUVJeSDPYzqKs0Va2zm=yaqN--zR8rQijHXukF3pRT-aP81Tw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 15:17:51 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HSV values from rtrace"}
