{"body": "\nHi Vayia,\n\nUnfortunately genBSDF assumes that the two apertures of your system are\nparrallel and rectangular, so i don't think your light pipe BSDF will be\nvalid. Greg has written a new tool, rfluxmtx, that will allow you to\ngenerate a coefficient matrix for a relationship between arbitrary\npolygons. Your model is a good example of what wasn't possible before that\nis enabled by the new tools.\n\nUnfortunately there's not much documentation of rfluxmtx other than the man\npage. I'm working on providing a three-phase simulation example using\nrfluxmtx hopefully ready by the workshop in September.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 31, 2014 at 4:53 AM, Vayia Koukouvayia <vaia13 at msn.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140731/b7c5de27/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight matrix - vu", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Niw1AtnYtSqOOP3nCD+p65b0Vdy=W4rs2=4YHYDQzRxaaA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<DUB127-W47AB393FFBD9442BDCA3C3D8E60@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 10:33:38 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylight matrix - vu"}
