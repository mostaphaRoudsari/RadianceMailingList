{"body": "\nHi Judy,\n\nIn what way do you qualify as a \"newbie??\"\n\nUnfortunately, there is no output facility from ximage.  The only way\nto get the image is with a window capture.  Fortunately, X11 has a\nutility for this, called xwd.  If your image file were named \"35b3\",\nyou could call the following command once it was up:\n\n% xwd -name 35b3 -out 35b3.xwd\n\nThe xwd program looks up the window by name, then dumps its contents to\nthe file 35b3.xwd.  Unfortunately, none of the mainstream programs will\nrecognize the little-used \"X-window dump\" format, so you'll have to\nload it into GraphicConverter or somesuch and save it out in a more\nconventional format.\n\n-Greg\n(Definite oldbie)\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] xglaresrc", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<76E6FBF1-63EF-11D9-9372-000A95BB392A@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<41E38D73.2020604@lbl.gov>"], "datetime": "Tue Jan 11 17:41:01 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] xglaresrc"}
