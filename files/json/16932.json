{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI've been using Radiance in some research, and for one experiment I would\nlike to look at things from a colour perspective.  The normal way I would\ngo about would be converting values to HSV, but because of the values that\nreturn from rtrace, I don't know how I would go about doing this.  Is such\na thing possible or is there another way to look at the colour of the light?\n\n\nThanks,\nKelly Moylan\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140728/65a96a7e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kelly Moylan", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CABUVJeSDPYzqKs0Va2zm=yaqN--zR8rQijHXukF3pRT-aP81Tw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 17:56:18 -0400", "email": "km07ok at brocku.ca", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HSV values from rtrace"}
