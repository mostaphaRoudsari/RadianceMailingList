{"body": "\nThanks Martin and Greg for the help for my question about the sun color.\n\n\nI have done some light research on of the sun's color temperature. I think\nMartin's may be the method that I would prefer in converting a color\ntemperature and luminance of the sun to the RGB used with the light\nprimative. I have had some problems running the script. In a comment line it\nstates:\n\n\nconverts a color temperature of degrees Kelvin into RGB given: color temp. T\nand the luminance YL of the source\n\n\nMy problem is that this script takes three variables (T, YL, and\nsolar_radiance) but the comment only mentions two variables (T and YL). What\nis the solar_radiance and how does it differ from the luminance of the\nsource (the source I am assuming is the sun)? Also, what are the units of\nmeasurement for the 3 variables? Do you have an example for this?\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus Jacobs\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Sun Color", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F27C9BC2F25793527E13CD9A4950@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Jan  8 02:11:58 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Sun Color"}
