{"body": "\nGreetings, light lovers!\n\nA fresh batch of packages (installers) has been posted to the NREL Radiance GitHub site:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.b.0\n\nA couple of noteworthy doodads:\n* These packages are based on Radiance 4.2.b, which now includes a new Hessian-based error control protocol for the ambient calculation\n* The stdout from gendaymtx has a new format, which breaks the OpenStudio daylighting routines. We are working on a fix.\n\nIn addition, the Radiance 4.2.a.4 Windows package was updated, and now includes the GUI applications, such as rvu.exe. This idiot regrets the omissions.\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4\n\nNow go throw some virtual photons around.\n\n- RobG ? NREL\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CFD994F1.97A3%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 10:52:33 -0600", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Updated Radiance Installers Available"}
