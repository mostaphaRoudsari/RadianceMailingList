{"body": "\nDear George, Greg,\n\nThank you both for your feedback, most helpful!\n\n\n\nGeorge,\n\nThe solution proposed by the author of the python Polygon package does\nexactly this; the complex polygon is split into a list of simple polygons,\nusing the center of gravity of the polygon. After the split it isn't\ndifficult to write it out to a .rad format!\n\n\nGreg,\n\nThanks for the sketched out algorithm, I was hoping for that kind of\nresponse! By no means was my mail intended as criticism for the lack of\nexplicit holes, just hoping for a way to get passed the problem!\nI'm sure your suggested algorithm will be helpful in further development of\nmy project.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20050107112506.1D1941C0038F@mwinf0603.wanadoo.fr>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan  7 12:25:25 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genprism | no explicit hole"}
