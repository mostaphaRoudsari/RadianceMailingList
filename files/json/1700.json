The new version should be in\ntonight's HEAD dump, or you can grab it directly from CVS:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/\nray/src/util/rtcontrib.c?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-csrc\n\nIt doesn't depend on any other changes in HEAD, so you can drop it\ninto src/util and run \"rmake install\" there if you've run \"makeall\ninstall\" previously.\n\nThis may be the cause of Francesco's mysterious problem using -f and -\no together on the PC.  I'm not sure about that, though.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Sep 21 06:48:54 2005"}
