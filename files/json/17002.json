{"body": "\nHi Shri and Andy,\n\nI think you can \"spread\" the \"direct\" component when applying a\nroughness to the trans material. Then, the scattered light is not\nlambertian any more. You can control the scattering \"width\" by the\nroughness.\nYou can see the difference then if you look directly onto the material\n(smaller or larger spot towards sun direction).  Getting different\npatches on the wall etc. is quite hard I guess. The reason for this is ,\nthat as soon as the \"direct part\" is scattered (when applying\nroughness), it is handled by the ambient calculation and it is not part\nof the direct calculation any more.\n\nUsing a BSDF with a fine resolution is in fact the best way to handle this.\n\ngood luck,\n\nJan\n\nOn 08/13/2014 01:26 AM, Andrew McNeil wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140813/3e830739/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans material - tspec comparison", "sender": "Jan Wienold", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<53EB4E46.5040702@epfl.ch>", "refs": ["<CABL0Rjd7xZCcP1czEmKR1+b=_SzKEgrw6jBFkdCz+WfZMnonUA@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAOG+Niya74D1mrc2C_3dzBV2H9_rdYo7Ua=iKv3-YSFscrfBiA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 13:38:46 +0200", "email": "jan.wienold at epfl.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trans material - tspec comparison"}
