{"body": "\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nUsing Radiance, I would like to evaluate daylighting in adjoint areas in an atrium.\n\nI could only find genblind that simulate Venetian blind. Would you please tell me commands that can simulate roller blind(diffuse reflection) and solar film blind(speculation reflection)\n\nIs it possible to have a solar sensor to trigger Up/Down motions of motorised roller blind and motorised solar film?\n\nWhere can I find examples of Atrium?\n\n\nThanks a lot!\nStanley\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "StanleyCheung", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<7DDF4252-7226-4F43-882F-8389573114E7@yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Aug 2014 03:10:56 +0800", "email": "stanleyshc at yahoo.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sun shading device in atrium"}
