Apparently, the Linux\nimplementation of the fseeko(3) library call is broken.  This means\nthat the recovery (-r) option in rtcontrib will not work with files\nlarger than 2 GB under Linux.  It also means that we need to compile\nrtcontrib with -Dfseeko=fseek for the time being, until they get this\nfixed.  (I wouldn't hold my breath, given how long it's taken them to\nfix other problems in little-used functions.)\n\nI have added -Dfseeko=fseek to the Linux rmake in makeall in CVS, and\nI recommend that anyone wishing to use rtcontrib under Linux modify\ntheir rmake script manually by adding this define to the MACH=\"\" line\nthere.  Then, using the latest rtcontrib.c, you can run \"rmake\ninstall\" in your src/util directory and all should be well.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.  I didn't think either of these problems\nwas worth a patch release, but I also want rtcontrib to work for\nthose brave souls who are trying it.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Sep 21 19:40:38 2005"}
