{"body": "\nHi Germ?n,\n\nThere is a man page for rfluxmtx, but that's about all we have at this point.  I sent Vayia some slides I plan to present at the workshop in London, and I can send this to others who are interested.  (I'm following my own recommendation not to include attachments in radiance-general posts, and my website is inaccessible at the moment for unknown reasons.)\n\nRfluxmtx was created to simplify common sampling operations used with rcontrib, and will ultimately be used to simplify the internals of the genBSDF script, which is a less general tool.  The only program rfluxmtx completely replaces is genklemsamp.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140821/2c230db3/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Three phase method", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A9430F17-C820-4FDA-95E7-ABE922BBCA65@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<DUB127-W79A32AF59EDC762614C7DBD8D20@phx.gbl>", "<CAOG+NiwmTKeHpkyX1gqpguzC_a1RRYQUE=bPtHG7ri+piNXMJw@mail.gmail.com>", "<DUB127-W430ADA2EB2D8C62BF962ACD8D30@phx.gbl>", "<CAK+g53DEAcYJBw6P7+UAr1Q3oUKEe+sYy2X4=fcvjdoQN=yohg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 21 Aug 2014 14:49:40 +0200", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three phase method"}
