I am still a little bit confused about aperture...\nDoes big aperture number (big depth of field) mean that you \"focus\" (if\ni can use this term) on the whole scene?\n\nthe opposite - the bigger the number (f 16), the smaller the aperture, and\nyet,\nthe larger the depth of field\n\nand does small aperture (small debth of field) mean that you focus only\non the foreground?\nbig aperture (f 2.8) = more light / less depth of field\nsmall aperture (f 11) = less light / more depth of field\n\nLook at this page - gives a decent demonstation of the relationships\nhttp://www.photonhead.com/exposure/exposure.php\n\nHTH\nRob\n\nIn my case I take photos of a mirrored ball in order to create a light\nprobe.\nWhat I really need to use for aperture? Small or big values as aperture\nnumber?\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n<<ATT476996.txt>>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Despina Michae", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B8DD8375FCE2C94B9F170D9277C1FA2B8C56EA@corvallis>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jan  6 22:58:00 2005", "email": "Despina Michael", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Problems using hdrgen for hdri generation"}
