{"body": "\nHi everyone.\n\nIs there anybody who knows how dctimestep works in three phase method?\nWhen I tried to multiply as a normal matrix (with python language), the illuminance result is not matched with dctimestep result.\nSo, I wonder if dctimestep doesn't use normal matrix multiplication.\nIf there is a specific method in dctimestep, please teach me.\n\n* let you know,\n1. I picked up one column out of the every RGB(view matrix and daylight matrix), so that I made a simple matrix multiplication.\n2. I created daylight matrix as a ASCII data instead of binary.\n\nThank you.\nJinsook\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140829/8639b9ab/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "jinsook kang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<569b51d05f7b3e7b2ad6444aaeec9c9@cweb18.nm.nhnsystem.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 01:27:09 +0900 (KST)", "email": "kjstotoro at naver.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] =?utf-8?q?Three-phase_Method_dctimestep?="}
