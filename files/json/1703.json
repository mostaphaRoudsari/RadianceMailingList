I am still a little bit confused about aperture...\nDoes big aperture number (big depth of field) mean that you \"focus\" (if i can use this term) on the whole scene?\nand does small aperture (small debth of field) mean that you focus only on the foreground?\n\nIn my case I take photos of a mirrored ball in order to create a light probe.\nWhat I really need to use for aperture? Small or big values as aperture number?\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050106/fee18cae/attachment-0001.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Despina Michael", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY22-DAV6ECEB37B040666D37E77090930@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jan  6 22:46:09 2005", "email": "despina_m81 at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems using hdrgen for hdri generationReferences: <BAY22-DAV7A0E5D631C9A893588A5990930@phx.gbl>"}
