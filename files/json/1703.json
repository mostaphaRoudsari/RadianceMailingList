The archives probably contain two or three\nthreads about this topic with respect to Linux.  I'd be really\ninterested to hear what Greg thinks of this new Apple tool, and its\npossibilities, though.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mac OSX, xgrid and RADIANCE", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Sep 22 00:49:47 2005"}
