{"body": "\n\n\n\nHello all,\nI have some more questions regarding the three phase method,\nI understand that I cannot simulate bending pipes with the genbsdf. However I also need to simulate straight pipes that I think is able to be done.\nMy question is if I need to specify the depth of the pipe somehow in any of the steps at the three phase method and how to do that.\nThe way I create the geometry used at the daylight matrix and view matrix (meaning the two ends of the pipe) are in the \"proper distance\". But is this the correct way to do it (?) or the \"entrance\" of the pipe at the view matrix should be at the same position as the \"exit\" of the pipe at the daylight matrix (?) and then I specify the length of the pipe (that the \"light\" will travel through the pipe) between the \"entrance\" and \"exit\"? I suppose that maybe this way I could generate one bsdf of a long pipe and then use it for different length of pipes?\nAnother question that I have is if I can use two different parallel BSDFs on one simulation.\nThank you in advance,\nVayia\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140820/28bcd8f9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Vayia V", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB127-W79A32AF59EDC762614C7DBD8D20@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 14:46:34 +0300", "email": "vaia13 at msn.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three phase method"}
