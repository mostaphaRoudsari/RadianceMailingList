{"body": "\nHi Trygve,\n\nyou can do it... :) Greg demonstrated an example where he used something\nsimilar to render caustics on the inside walls of a swimming pool. For\neach surface, create locations on it to achieve a sufficient resolution\nand render the illuminance at each location. Alternatively, for simple\ngeometry, you may find the location and extents of the surface, place a\nvtl-type camera just in front of it, and render an image (clipping all\npixels not belonging to the surface using the rtrace object id output).\n\nIt is a bit of work though... :D\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Texture Baking?", "sender": "Lars O.
