{"body": "\nHello, I use a device to measure the reflectance from 344 to 1045\nwavelength,\nHow could I convert these measured data into Radiance RGB,  and how could I\ncalculate the overall reflectance from the measurement?\n\nI try to use weights of RGB channels in Radiance, but which wavelength out\nof 344 - 1045 should I select for each channel?\n\nThanks,\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140903/c2b0bd9e/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jia Hu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CABzgtwqnkA8q0Uzp2VmSjWzDgxRpk=Sxfko25OhFQBfaMOvvMw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Sep 2014 15:02:35 -0400", "email": "hujia06 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reflectance data"}
