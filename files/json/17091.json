Is my simulation of result about A,B spot/sun=0.1785  different from Optics\nglass reflectance 0.178?\n\n2. You explain me 'Fresnel equations' about refraction right?\nDoes RADIANCE apply it?\nIf not, Could tell me which theory does RADIANCE apply?\n\nKind regards,\nTae Wook\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Tae wook", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<loom.20140915T143553-858@post.gmane.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 12:36:33 +0000 (UTC)", "email": "ytwman at hanmail.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Luminance and Incidence angle questionReferences: <20140912213802.HM.R000000000IgLNA@ytwman.wwl1486.hanmail.net>"}
