{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm working on an inverse rendering project and we're using Radiance to\ngenerate synthetic data for validation. Given a scene with diffuse\nsurfaces, we're using the radiosity formulation as the core of our inverse\nprocess, namely that at any given scene point:\n\nradiosity at point = (reflectance at point) x\nsum_over_scene_points(radiosity at scene point x form factor between points)\n\nThe sum is calculated using a hemicube method (with suitably high\nresolution) and the radiosities are obtained from reprojecting the .hdr\noutputs of Radiance onto the scene geometry.\n\nMy problem is that even in simple box scenes this equation doesn't hold.\nMost of the time, the reflectance estimated from this equation is too low.\nI've used enough ambient bounces that the Radiance output has converged,\nbut I'm wondering if there are other Radiance rendering options that might\nbe causing these problems.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nEdward\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140924/47c928f6/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Edward Zhang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAGM_O-qSSFScdZ8q9ysUtRYoeZBgL03UD_MfDXk4rq1N6-Wu-g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 15:04:03 -0700", "email": "edzhang at cs.washington.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance output not satisfying radiosityequations"}
