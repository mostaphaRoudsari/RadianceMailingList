{"body": "\nHi German,\nSorry to have taken so long to respond. When I first read your email I\ndidn't have time to dig in and planned to come back to it. Then I promptly\nforgot about it.\n\nThe one thing that stands out, and could be a major source of error for a\nclear sky is the ground reflectance. You're using 70% in the rtraced model,\nbut you aren't using it in the 5-phase method. Though if you have large-ish\nlocal ground plane defined in scene.rad (which you always should, but even\nthe best of us sometimes leave out) this will be less of a problem.\n\nYou can specify ground reflectance in gendaymtx with the -g argument. The\ndefault is -g 0.2 0.2 0.2 (which is a lot different from 70%). You\ngendaymtx command would look something like this:\ngendaymtx -h -g 0.7 0.7 0.7 -m 1 Santiago.wea > full_sky.skv\n\nLet me know if this doesn't improve things and I'll dig in further.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 9, 2014 at 8:41 AM, CHI-German Molina <gmolina at hdlao.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140924/4986d5db/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAK+g53CW1Ge8qoC2xWA8ZPObQLv56zsUNuVbmQvqB4H8km2__w@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NiyetJ6Uone0Pa-NADu5WmZPS+FbnmjxeqpCkyHjErVC3Q@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAK+g53CW1Ge8qoC2xWA8ZPObQLv56zsUNuVbmQvqB4H8km2__w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 10:42:00 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] comparing RTRACE vs DAYSIM DaylightCoefficients"}
