{"body": "\nHello,\nI am a student in Vienna and working on a daylight simulation with pipeflow:  IDGB#optics6#window7.2#ecotect2011#grasshopper#radiance#daysim3.1\nAsking with un unease, since you must also have a tight schedule,  still I need to post two question:\nWhat are\nthe steps creating double glazing material with coating for Radiance?\nAfter generating the *.rad files from optics do you manually correct the material in Radiance editor?\nHow do I apply optics2glaze with the glazing script in Perl script or would you recommend just the Optics6 export in rad?\nhere is one of the glazing systems:\n1st layer: pane 4mm\nPVB coating 0.78mm     6mm glass pane#cool lite skn 174  22mm Argon 90%  2nd pane : 4mmTn = 64%  (IGDB source)\nManufacturer value of the system\nTn=68%     R(outside)=13%     R(inside)=11%\nFor my understanding tried to compare some values from manufacturer with my Window output - and the discrepancy is too big.  The PVB is missing, though.\nHow would you proceed when you solve this problem elegantly?\n\nAny comments are highly appreciated.\nKind Regards from Vienna,  Niya\n\n\n\n\n\nvar m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/dbe69366/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Todor Syarov", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<328512074.96609.1412262805455.JavaMail.apache@nm51.abv.bg>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 18:13:25 +0300 (EEST)", "email": "thodor at abv.bg", "subject": "[Radiance-general] optics2glaze_glaze script"}
