{"body": "\nHi all, I am assessning DF levels in a 4th floor of a building in an unobstructed area, so I am not considering any surrounding building just a ground plane that I modeled as a circle.Almost by chance I discovered increasing the size of my ground plane has a significant effect on my DF. Using a ground plane of 500m radius I had an average of 3.34%, if I increase it to 1000meters I get over 12%. As long as I understand, this should not have such a big effect, should it? Could I be doing something wrong? Can I do something to make sure I get reasonable values?I am running the simulation though DIVA for Rhino in Grasshopper. My radiance parameters are: -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 256 -aa 0.1. My ground plane reflectance is 0.25. Thanks in advance, Alejandro\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141016/c1ed5186/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?B?QWxlamFuZHJvIFBhY2hlY28gRGnpZ3Vleg==?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB128-W38979A812746250D34F338CAAB0@phx.gbl>", "refs": ["<DUB128-W29613AE29E6791D795B5DDCA0A0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 10:36:56 +0200", "email": "paxeco2205 at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane"}
