{"body": "\nWell, pfilt hasn't changed in 4 years and pcond hasn't changed in 8, so my only remaining guess is that the new way we're calling popen() under Windows is somehow at fault.  This call that was hand-written by Georg Mischler was recently replaced under Microsoft's Visual-C compiler, and I think the issue is that I'm not explicitly setting the binary file type in pcond.  Schorsch's win_popen() must have done this for me without my realizing it.\n\nI have checked in the new module and it should get recompiled at some point.  My apologies, and I hope this solves the issue.\n\nIn the short term, just use the older version of pcond.  It's the same, anyway.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141020/7c673ced/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<5444DDA1.2@epfl.ch>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A59C9A5E-85FF-4954-9F4A-E42B80D94619@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAAd_PgT7-gnNC6c2YUXEX0+i3kPih5KgqmxDvxGH5OkkSj8MBQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<5444DDA1.2@epfl.ch>"], "datetime": "Mon, 20 Oct 2014 08:43:53 -0500", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pcond: error reading from pfilt process infovimage"}
