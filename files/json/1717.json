I guess your points are\nin a horizontal plane, so the spawned rays will not see the ground\nglow and you can leave it in the description.  Set the following:\n\n-ab 1    You need the first level of hemispherical sampling so that\nrays are sent to the 'glow' sky.\n-aa 0    This switches off interpolation and is likely to give you\nmore precise results (generally not advised when ab > 1).\n-ad 1024 then 2048, if there's a significant difference, proceed to\n4096 and so on...\n-as 256 or thereabouts.\n-av 0 0 0\n-ar - doesn't matter because aa is 0\nNo need to bother with the ae or aE parameters for the direct sky\ncomponent.\n\nAnd, of course, you have rtrace set to predict irradiation.\n\nI would (strongly) advise against using mkillum to predict the direct\nsky component.  You can get arbitrarily high accuracy in your\npredictions with -aa 0 and cranking up -ad until the results have\nconverged to whatever degree you think is sufficient.\n\nShameless plug for CIBSE Daylight Group session of possible interest:\n\nWednesday 12th.
