{"body": "\nI wonder if I could ask if it is possible to use Radiance to assess the albedo of an urban setting, e.g. a street gorge, where Radiance can take into account the near infra-red component of the solar spectrum as well as the visible one, please? Perhaps the visible component would have to be assessed first, and then the IR on a second run, after modifying the surface reflectances? Could Radiance be used like that?\n\nRichard Watkins\nKent School of Architecture\nUniversity of Kent\nKent, UK\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141022/75a26227/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Richard Watkins", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<36E58ACF2BA61641A0EB4F54EF3D55E5010CAEF136@EX10-LIVE-MBN1.ad.kent.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 13:18:48 +0000", "email": "R.Watkins at kent.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Use of Radiance in the infrared"}
