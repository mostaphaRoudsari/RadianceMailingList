However, rcontrib (and rtrace) don't apply run-length encoding to their output due to the way the programs are structured, so the simple calculation method works.\n\nTo apply the same trick to rpict output, you would have to run it through pfilt and see what it tells you in terms of %age complete.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141027/838ef67a/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcontrib progress report", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<96AC115D-32AD-4AF2-99C1-539A1EFAD345@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAK01WzZ-s-_0ZXUc63cmuK2gFQpqTrb=DQdT=e7ptj4FTGzgkg@mail.gmail.com>", "<EEA01A96-999E-4232-9BC3-3B00C4D037FE@lmi.net>", "<etPan.544eb091.12200854.172@explosivo-3.local>"], "datetime": "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:00:30 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcontrib progress report"}
