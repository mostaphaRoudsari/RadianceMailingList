Basically, instead of\nhaving a uniform colored object, I want to add some other color to the\nobject but the object is made of uniform material. Can I generate a\n.cal file and directly manipulate the color at specific location using\nlocal coordinates and use colorFunc to add the pattern? It sounds\ntrival to do but I m having trouble generating it right. Thank you\nvery much.\n\n--\nalways on full sail during high tides\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "bei.xiao@gmail.com", "datetime": "Tue Sep 27 01:42:08 2005"}
