Cool!?\n\n-Rob\n\nFrom:?Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\nReply:?Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nDate:?October 27, 2014 at 3:00:51 PM\nTo:?Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nSubject:? Re: [Radiance-general] rcontrib progress report\n\nHe knows too much, and must be eliminated!\n\nYou are correct Rob, for normal picture output. ?However, rcontrib (and rtrace) don't apply run-length encoding to their output due to the way the programs are structured, so the simple calculation method works.\n\nTo apply the same trick to rpict output, you would have to run it through pfilt and see what it tells you in terms of %age complete.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nI thought due to RLE, output file length was an unreliable predictor of time remaining. What am I getting wrong now?\n\n-Rob\n\nFrom:?Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\nReply:?Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nDate:?October 27, 2014 at 10:43:50 AM?\n\nYou can look at the length of each output file as an indicator of percent completion. ?A 1920x1080 picture file will be approximately 1920x1080x4 bytes long when finished. ?\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\nFolks\n\nIs there a way to know the progress of the rcontrib run? I am creating images with rcontrib, and all I can see is the 2000+ images being updated every now and then, without knowing when is this going to end.\n\nThanks\n\nEry\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141027/5db90b68/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcontrib progress report", "sender": "ery.mailinglist at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<etPan.544eb3af.216231b.172@explosivo-3.local>", "refs": ["<CAK01WzZ-s-_0ZXUc63cmuK2gFQpqTrb=DQdT=e7ptj4FTGzgkg@mail.gmail.com>", "<EEA01A96-999E-4232-9BC3-3B00C4D037FE@lmi.net>", "<etPan.544eb091.12200854.172@explosivo-3.local>", "<96AC115D-32AD-4AF2-99C1-539A1EFAD345@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 15:05:51 -0600", "email": "Ery Mailing-List", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcontrib progress reportDate: October 27, 2014 4:36:39 AM PDT"}
