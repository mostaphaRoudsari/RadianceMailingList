The best answer gets voted to the top. Or you can search on your topic\nand you might find that your question has already been asked and answered.\nAnd it?s always good to give back to the community (while showing off your\nexpertise and earning good ?karma?) by helping other modelers with their\nquestions.\n\nAt Unmet Hours, you can ask questions about any modeling topic or software\ntool, including Radiance\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:radiance/page:1/>.\nNumerous experts are standing by, eager to help, and ready to answer your\nquestions--big or small. There are already more than 240 registered users,\nmore than 90 questions, and more than 170 answers on the website.\n\nUnmet Hours offers many capabilities that make it a powerful resource for\nthe building energy modeling community:\n\n\n-\n\nEach individual question is kept together with its answers on one web\npage that can be easily referenced with a unique URL.\n-\n\nAnswers are peer reviewed and voted on by the community to reach a\nconsensus on which ones are most likely to be helpful or ?correct?.\n-\n\nQuestions are easily searchable on the website. All content is indexed\nby Google and other search engines.\n-\n\nQuestions are tagged with category labels such as ?infiltration\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:infiltration/page:1/>?,\n?daylighting\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:daylighting/page:1/>?,\nor ?radiance\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:radiance/page:1/>?\nmaking it easy to find topics of interest.\n-\n\nQuestions can be tagged across multiple categories for cross-cutting\nproblems, for example, ?ashrae-90.1\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:ashrae-90.1/page:1/>?,\n?hvac\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:hvac/page:1/>?,\nand ?openstudio\n<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:openstudio/page:1/>\n?.\n-\n\nTags or individual questions can be ?followed? to receive email updates\nwhen there is new or changed content.
