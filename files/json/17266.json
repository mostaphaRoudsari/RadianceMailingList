{"body": "\nHi,\nAnother possibility is that the larger ground plane is increasing the interpolation distance and you are getting more values from outside spilled in the calculation. You could try increasing ar or reducing aa to see if it converges. (provided that you have the infinite source, as Raphael says)\nSantiago\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 16 October 2014 10:23\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi\n\nAre you sure you have also modelled the \"infinite\" ground plane as a glowing source ? This has to be modelled even if you also put a large disk for the ground plane.\n\nRapha?l\n________________________________\nDe : Alejandro Pacheco Di?guez [paxeco2205 at hotmail.com] Envoy? : jeudi 16 octobre 2014 10:36 ? : radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane\n\nHi all,\nI am assessning DF levels in a 4th floor of a building in an unobstructed area, so I am not considering any surrounding building just a ground plane that I modeled as a circle.\nAlmost by chance I discovered increasing the size of my ground plane has a significant effect on my DF. Using a ground plane of 500m radius I had an average of 3.34%, if I increase it to 1000meters I get over 12%. As long as I understand, this should not have such a big effect, should it? Could I be doing something wrong? Can I do something to make sure I get reasonable values?\nI am running the simulation though DIVA for Rhino in Grasshopper. My radiance parameters are: -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 256 -aa 0.1. My ground plane reflectance is 0.25.\nThanks in advance,\nAlejandro\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane", "sender": "Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ACF98A76D0047542A29FEB2F3EB0DAA1329AAB@E-AEXMBX02.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<DUB128-W29613AE29E6791D795B5DDCA0A0@phx.gbl>,", "<DUB128-W38979A812746250D34F338CAAB0@phx.gbl>", "<A6691D7EACBAC74589C1134EB0758B7FCF4F961B@HEFRMBX01.sofr.hefr.lan>"], "datetime": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 11:01:32 +0000", "email": "Compagnon Rapha?l", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane"}
