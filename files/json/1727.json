As I am now beginning to\nexperiment with more shell programming, the question is, are there\nparticular aspects of RADIANCE that make programming it in a\nparticular shell more advantageous to others?\n\nI was using tcsh (the Mac OSX former default) but am at the point\nwhere I want to explore other options.\n\nThanks for the input - I know this can be a highly personal and/or\napplication-specific decision, but all thoughts welcome.\n\nkirk\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
