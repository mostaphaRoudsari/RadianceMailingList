{"body": "\nHello,\nI was wondering is there a way to increase the resolution of the output of the BSDF material. I generated an xml file that when light is perpendicular on the surface it behaves in a vertical linear direction using the klem patches, however this is not the case when I simulate it using radiance; the transmitted light has an abnormal behavior with light spots all over the receiving surface.\nI was wondering if the problem is in the genBSDF line i wrote or the geometry I created for the bsdf of the geometry  used in the simulation.\nHere are some of the points I applied:\n1. The genBSDF line:genBSDF.exe -c 16000 filename.rad > newfilename.xml\n2.The surface geometry:0.1 x 0.1 x 0.01 [meters]\n3. The simulation environment geometry:0.4 x 0.4 x 1 [meters]\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/9d03b929/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: To radiance.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 145147 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/9d03b929/attachment-0002.jpg>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: To radiance.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 145147 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/9d03b929/attachment-0003.jpg>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Islam Mashaly", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB128-W68FAAC2E56634085E1B53DFCB90@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 11:51:57 +0200", "email": "islam.akm at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Higher Resolution BSDF"}
