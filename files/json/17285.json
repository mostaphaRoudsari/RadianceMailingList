But you will not get good results trying to model a laminate in WINDOW.\n\nOn Oct 2, 2014 8:42 AM, \"Todor Syarov\" <\nthodor at abv.bg > wrote:\n\n\n\n\nThank you Robin for writing back,\n\n\n\n\n\nI am reading that a coating touching an interlayer is not possible in Optics5.\n\n\nI am using Optics6 yet I could not find within the IGDB a PVB coating.\n\n\nHow do you solve such cases?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system Im working on is:\n\n\n\n\n\n1st layer: pane 4mm\n\n\n\nPVB coating 0.78mm\n\n\n6mm glass pane#cool lite skn 174\n\n\n22mm Argon 90%\n\n\n2nd pane : 4mm\n\n\n(IGDB source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbest,\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n\n-------- ?????????? ????? --------\n\n??: Robin Mitchell\nrdmitchell at lbl.gov\n\n???????: Re: [Radiance-general] optics2glaze_glaze script\n\n??: Radiance general discussion <\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org >\n\n????????? ??: ?????????, 2014, ???????? 2 18:23:34 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know anything about Radiance, but in terms of what you are trying to model, it appears to be a laminate. You can't model that in WINDOW. You need to model it in Optics and then import it into the WINDOW Glass Library as a monolithic layer. There are detailed instructions about how to do this on our WINDOW Knowledge Base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/software/NFRC/NFRCLaminates.html  -- click on the first link called Laminate Procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\nRobin Mitchell\n\nBuilding Technology and Urban Systems Department\n\nEnvironmental Energy Technologies Division\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 8:13 AM, Todor Syarov\nthodor at abv.bg >  wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a student in Vienna and working on a daylight simulation with pipeflow:\n\n\nIDGB#optics6#window7.2#ecotect2011#grasshopper#radiance#daysim3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking with un unease, since you must also have a tight schedule,\n\n\nstill I need to post two question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are\nthe steps creating double glazing material with coating for Radiance?\nAfter generating the *.rad files from optics do you manually correct the material in Radiance editor?\n\nHow do I apply optics2glaze with the glazing script in Perl script or would you recommend just the Optics6 export in rad?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhere is one of the glazing systems:\n\n\n\n1st layer: pane 4mm\n\n\n\nPVB coating 0.78mm\n\n\n6mm glass pane#cool lite skn 174\n\n\n22mm Argon 90%\n\n\n2nd pane : 4mmTn = 64%\n\n\n(IGDB source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer value of the system\n\n\n\nTn=68%\n\n\nR(outside)=13%\n\n\nR(inside)=11%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my understanding tried to compare some values from manufacturer with my Window output - and the discrepancy is too big.\n\n\nThe PVB is missing, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would you proceed when you solve this problem elegantly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments are highly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind Regards from Vienna,\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/04ab7f07/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Todor Syarov", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<109167422.98099.1412265392137.JavaMail.apache@nm51.abv.bg>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 18:56:32 +0300 (EEST)", "email": "thodor at abv.bg", "subject": "[Radiance-general] optics2glaze_glaze script"}
