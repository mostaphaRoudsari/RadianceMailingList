You\nneed to model it in Optics and then import it into the WINDOW Glass Library\nas a monolithic layer. There are detailed instructions about how to do this\non our WINDOW Knowledge Base.\n\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/software/NFRC/NFRCLaminates.html -- click on the\nfirst link called Laminate Procedures.\n\nRobin\n--\nRobin Mitchell\nBuilding Technology and Urban Systems Department\nEnvironmental Energy Technologies Division\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\nOn Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 8:13 AM, Todor Syarov <thodor at abv.bg> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/5d26138a/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] optics2glaze_glaze script", "sender": "Robin Mitchell", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CACF39SvYKa-qp3G-kBVRtrYN320J2ycT-+hovh9KoF3yKhHe0A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<328512074.96609.1412262805455.JavaMail.apache@nm51.abv.bg>"], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 08:23:34 -0700", "email": "rdmitchell at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] optics2glaze_glaze script"}
