{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nthanks for your reply.  Yes, MGF is still alive and kicking--now\nofficially endorsed by the IESNA as far as I understand.\n\nThe product I'm looking at is this:\nhttp://products.iguzzini.com/iway_round\nwhich is why I want to get rid of the top and bottom bits of the\nies2rad geometry.\n\nWhat I was hoping to be able to do with MGF is tell it what the\nfitting looks like.  In this particular case, I'd model 3 stacked\ncylinders, enclosed with a disk at the top. Only the middle cylinder\nwould act as an emitter.  Does that make sense?\n\nBest\nAxel\n\n\n\nOn 5 November 2014 14:33, Guglielmetti, Robert\n<Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+dqh61B+CeWTpG7qP2wrNCfzijmBcnCtyYfYTZcYMVdVE99_A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CA+dqh63eZpsBikW9kJh4FDv_5QTybPi2z6EQkUecqZLOoKKVvg@mail.gmail.com>", "<D07F80A9.124A6%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 15:03:15 +0000", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry"}
