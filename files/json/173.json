{"body": "\nWe have solved the problem.  I feel a little foolish since it was a problem not really related to ximage, radiance or Suse7.3, still though, it's good to know for\nanyone else who has the same setup.  I access our linux machines through a VNC viewer, part of VMware Workstation.  When we performed the upgrade from Suse 7.2 to\nSuse 7.3 it overwrote my VNC settings, include the color/display settings.  This changed the settings back to something like 8-bit which was not nearly enough to\nview my Radiance pics.  After changing this setting everything works fine.  Thanks Peter for your help!\n\nRegards,\nZack Rogers\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3C448FDA.8EE03CBD@archenergy.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 15 Jan 2002 13:23:54 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general digest, Vol 1 #47 - 1 msgReferences: <200201071104.g07B4HJ19670@darkside-animation.com>"}
