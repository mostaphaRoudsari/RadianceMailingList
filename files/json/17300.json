The IES luminaire standard had some odd ways of specifying geometry, involving negative dimensions in the (height,width,depth) fields, and all geometry was assumed to be closed.  The current source.cal file has projection calculations needed to convert candelas (as given in the IES file) to radiance (watts/sr/m^2) as needed for rendering, but only for closed cylinders.  You would have to roll your own if you wanted to remove the end caps to have the correct factors in there.  The current projected area is approximated as:\n\ncylprojection = A2*A3*sqrt(1-Dz*Dz) + PI/4*A2*A2*abs(Dz);\n\nThis is only valid for far-field -- I don't have a local projection factor for cylinders in there, like I do for boxes.  You probably need one in your case, but I'm not sure off-hand how to compute it.  The far-field approximation for just the cylinder section would be the first term, above.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n++++++\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ea918a377da4486f8d6a852b8855ce67@mbx080-e4-va-2.exch080.serverpod.net>", "refs": ["<CA+dqh63eZpsBikW9kJh4FDv_5QTybPi2z6EQkUecqZLOoKKVvg@mail.gmail.com>", "<D07F80A9.124A6%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CA+dqh61B+CeWTpG7qP2wrNCfzijmBcnCtyYfYTZcYMVdVE99_A@mail.gmail.com>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236272B26B7@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "<657090B4-17D9-4B9A-AE76-7B9C69F33ED9@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 16:30:52 +0000", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry"}
