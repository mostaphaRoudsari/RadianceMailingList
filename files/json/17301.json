{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nI only know about this MGF embedding from the ies2rad man page, and\nthought it might solve my problem:\n\n\" -i rad    Ignore the crude geometry given by the IES input file and\nuse  instead  an  illum\nsphere  with radius rad.  This option may be useful\nwhen the user wishes to add a\nmore accurate geometric description to the light\nsource model, though  this  need\nis  obviated by the recent LM-63-1995 specification,\nwhich uses MGF detail geome-\ntry.  (See -g option below.)\"\n\nThis sounds rather more positive than the situation appears to be now.  Oh well.\n\nAs you say--I would need near-field for my bollard.  Thank for sending\nthe projection formula.  With the NF-correction for boxes already in\nthe code, would a square bollard (again w/o bottom and top) be any\neasier to describe?  A square imposter is still a lot better than a\nhovering crystal ball.\n\nMany thanks\n\nBest\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 5 November 2014 16:00, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CA+dqh633XoTGsZCiE+9SGC_wy9Q8E2YjqSv+yoWrQP21NoYnCA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CA+dqh63eZpsBikW9kJh4FDv_5QTybPi2z6EQkUecqZLOoKKVvg@mail.gmail.com>", "<D07F80A9.124A6%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CA+dqh61B+CeWTpG7qP2wrNCfzijmBcnCtyYfYTZcYMVdVE99_A@mail.gmail.com>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236272B26B7@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "<657090B4-17D9-4B9A-AE76-7B9C69F33ED9@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 16:57:01 +0000", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry"}
