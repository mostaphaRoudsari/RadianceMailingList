We are currently considering dates in the late August/September time frame.\n\nIf you are thinking of going and might be able to make it one time but not another, please make yourself heard at this time.  Also, if anyone is aware of competing or complimentary conferences during this period, that would be helpful.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 2015 Workshop date poll", "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<d17aa5b6530d4d27a12794b6c03bcc09@mbx080-e4-va-2.exch080.serverpod.net>", "refs": ["<6F6BD098-B8F5-46B7-8E5E-4B90BEAE501C@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 16:41:37 +0000", "email": "Gregory J.
