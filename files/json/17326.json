{"body": "\nZack Rogers developed a module for Python (IES_gensky.py) that is part of\nSPOT and updates the gensky model.\n\nI also seem to remember that in one of the early Radiance workshops there\nwas a reference to an updated CIE sky generator that could produce all 15\nstandard sky models. I don't think it ever got a public release but the\nsource files were exchenged off-list now and then.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Mon, Nov 17, 2014 at 2:09 PM, Ehsan <em.vazifeh at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141120/7a3abe62/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] CIE version in gensky", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k3yD1oSmr0BvWJ6Z6i3iLE6DdD94J2tgk2c-JW=wzfjqw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAJeoGJ627Z2m=89yu2fw6_9xocvWFFZypiszozXf=jcBPpt5Jg@mail.gmail.com>", "<077F5EAE-0CBA-4669-8787-05D33028B414@lmi.net>", "<C0393269-54D8-4F53-B4CC-C36840C471E8@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 08:24:46 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] CIE version in gensky"}
