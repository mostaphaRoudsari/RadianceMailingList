{"body": "\nHi David,\n\nI am copying this email to the Radiance-Daysim list as well. There are two\nmore streamlined ways to go about this right now: using Daysim or using\nthe Radiance three or five-phase methods.\n\nFor using Daysim, there is a lot of information I can provide:\n- Tutorial from NRCAN:\nhttp://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/daysim-tutorial (slightly\nupdated by Harvard)\n- Daysim Documentation page: http://daysim.ning.com/\n- A presentation I gave in 2012 on Daysim:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day1/Jakubiec/jakubiec,reinhart_radiance-workshop-presentation_daysim.pdf\n\nIf you are using DIVA on Windows, there are Daysim batch files you can\nopen from the c:\\DIVA\\Temp\\RhinoFileName\\ folder after running a\nsimulation in order to see how the programs are called.\n\nFor the 3/5-phase methods, I am no expert, but a good place to start is\nhere,\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf\nOthers on the mailing list are highly expert in this.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\nOn Sat, 22 Nov 2014 15:24:16 +0800, David Davidson\n<this.is.david.davidson at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141122/9917c08b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CABr=F_i_i61W6=xYnQmDLEYyjKehrvUACEZ8qkUieT5+tbZfjg@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "J.
