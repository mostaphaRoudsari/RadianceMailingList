I have created the building in ECOTECT but unable to model the light pipes exactly. Is there any reference document for the same? Or if anyone can guide me in detail how to model the same?\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nMany Thanks,\nBhartendu Awasthi\n_______________________________________________ Radiance-general mailing list Radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141117/a3de33d9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Light Pipes Simulation", "sender": "bhartendu.awasthi90 at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D090C7C4.7BF44%v.garciahansen@qut.edu.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 15:35:13 +0530", "email": "Bhartendu Awasthi", "subject": "Light Pipes Simulation"}
