{"body": "\nDear List,\n\nWe're in the early stages of planning next year's workshop, which will be held at the Penn State University's Naval Yard facility in Philadelphia, PA.  We are currently considering dates in the late August/September time frame.\n\nIf you are thinking of going and might be able to make it one time but not another, please make yourself heard at this time.  Also, if anyone is aware of competing or complimentary conferences during this period, that would be helpful.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Gregory J.
