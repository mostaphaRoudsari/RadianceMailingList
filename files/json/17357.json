{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\nInteresting results.  The correction of removing the third term for the local box correction would make the most difference in the upwards and downwards direction, so the sparse output there is why you don't see anything in your falsecolor comparison.  You could try computing a difference image using src/cal/cal/picdiff.cal.\n\nAlso, the differences between using a large sphere and the lboxcorr won't be noticeable until your surfaces are up close.  What did you set -dj to in your runs?  This will also make a difference, and could show up artifacts in some of the simpler methods.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<11804ED3-7C6E-4C7B-8167-5C7AEA4481A2@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CA+dqh63eZpsBikW9kJh4FDv_5QTybPi2z6EQkUecqZLOoKKVvg@mail.gmail.com>", "<D07F80A9.124A6%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CA+dqh61B+CeWTpG7qP2wrNCfzijmBcnCtyYfYTZcYMVdVE99_A@mail.gmail.com>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236272B26B7@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "<657090B4-17D9-4B9A-AE76-7B9C69F33ED9@lmi.net>", "<CA+dqh633XoTGsZCiE+9SGC_wy9Q8E2YjqSv+yoWrQP21NoYnCA@mail.gmail.com>", "<742DAFA6-13AE-40F9-BCEE-183788C17A7F@lmi.net>", "<CA+dqh63zO-emtdC6bdVkawBshP8dC2ccrf7obXBZe83EWx2R2A@mail.gmail.com>", "<CA+dqh63WhfZm7b-gvJB53j2mKrNEsxrGy5aHrbtQq9oRvOye9g@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 07:52:34 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry"}
