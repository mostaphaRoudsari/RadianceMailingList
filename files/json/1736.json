I don't think any of these\nshells is particularly good for Radiance because they all\nprovide the basic shell environment which makes Radiance\nso flexible (pipes, redirection, filter etc.).\n\nIf you want to create scripts that should be used by more than\none person keep them well documented. Anyone knowing anything\nabout shell scripting should then be able to understand what\nyou are doing. If you want to share your scripts as well you\nshould try to aim for POSIX compliance and avoid shell typical\nenhancements. This will help others to reuse your scripts on\nother platforms/shells/implementations of your shell.\n\nKnowing a bit about *sh is essential to get anything done but\neven small tasks may be worth a \"proper\" programming language:\n\n1) For more complicated things (name rewriting etc.) you will\nhave to use sed/awk/perl (that's the unix way to do things)\nmore sooner than later. So you'll have to know their syntax\nas well and your co-admins will have to know them, too.\n\n2) Python/Ruby/TCL/Perl(!) are better to understand for non-gurus\nthan esoteric shell constructions are. (Readability does not\ndepend on the language but on your style, though).\n\n3) Perl, TCL and Python are available on nearly all platforms\nnow and typically installed by default.\n\n4) You can extend simple scripts with GUIs and output processing\n(PDF, visualization) better (if there are libraries available).\nShell scripts will meet their limit pretty soon.\n\n5) If everyone would focus on Python we could collect some money\nand pay Schorsch to write a proper library for Radiance. That's\nonly my biased opinion, of course ;)\n\n\nOn the whole I'd recommend one of Python/Ruby/Perl for more ambitious\nscripting. For simple throw-away-scripts any shell will do and it's\nbasically a matter of your personal preference.\n\n\n\nEnjoy the freedom of choice,\n\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RADIANCE and Unix shells", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Thu Sep 29 23:11:18 2005"}
