Your issues with\ncrashing & resuming and such, well, you're right that Cygwin doesn't\nhave the ability to resume, but Radiance actually does. If you crash or\nthe system goes down, you just restart the job and Radiance picks up\nwhere it left off. One of the nicer things about it.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\nNiloofar Moghbel wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050929/11cd2348/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Windows enabled Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "datetime": "Fri Sep 30 03:12:06 2005"}
