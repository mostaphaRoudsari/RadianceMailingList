{"body": "\nIt appears that Bayer's Makrolon polycarbonate material has been sufficiently characterized; Bayer has done scattering studies, which can be found in this report:\nhttp://www.plastics.bayer.com/~/media/Product%20Center/PCS/Images/5_Library/Broschueren/Optical%20properties%20of%20Makrolon%20and%20Apec%20for%20nonimaging%20optics.ashx?la=en\n\nIs anyone aware of a Radiance material type for Makrolon? I will also be contacting a rep, and find out if perhaps Bayer already has files I can use. If all else fails, can someone offer me advice on converting that data in that file to a BRTDF description?\n\nRandolph M.

I have a sort-of-light-shelf application that I would like to simulate, and so far I haven't found a material that does the job.\n\nRandolph M.
