{"body": "\nHello all,\n\n\n\nA question regarding false color and luminance values. Starting with an\nimage created via rpict, and using the photosphere histogram, the max\nluminance value is 351 nits. Selecting a small area around the top outer\ncorner of the shelf results in a mean around 302 nits. This agrees fairly\nclose to a measurement with a spot meter on the outer corner of a physical\nversion of the scene, so far so good.\n\n\n\nCommand: rpict -vtv -vp 0.75 .75 5.5 -vd 0.3 1.0 -0.6 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 45 -vv\n45 -vo 3 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -av .1 .1 .1 -x 2000 -y 2000 -ab 2 -aa .1\nshelf.oct > shelf_rpict.hdr\n\n\n\nFile: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_rpict.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a false color version, the histogram max luminance however is 177 nits,\nthe small area mean is 131 nits. Im not sure why the luminance values\nbetween the two versions are different?\n\n\n\nCommand: falsecolor -ip shelf_rpict.hdr -e -s auto -n 16 -lh 1000 -lw 225\n-log 4 -l > shelf_false_log_norm.hdr\n\n\n\nFile: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_false_log_norm.hdr\n\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150104/9aefc263/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Brian Karr", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001901d0283f$f44ad520$dce07f60$@yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 4 Jan 2015 12:00:31 -0500", "email": "brianakarr at yahoo.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] False color and luminance values"}
