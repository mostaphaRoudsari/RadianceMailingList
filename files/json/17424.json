{"body": "\nIf you used the \"makeall\" script, you need to make sure that the path location(s) match what you selected in that step. However, your last error message about the X11 header file not being found, makes me think you don't have a complete set of binaries anyway. I'd recommend you install the binaries we have available at the NREL Radiance GitHub site, and then change the paths thusly, in your \"~/.profile\" file:\n\nexport PATH=/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH\n\nexport RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib\n\nexport MANPATH=/usr/local/radiance/man\n\nThis way we can eliminate any build/compile errors from the scenario and just focus on getting your system pointing to Radiance. How's that sound?\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 1/20/15, 9:45 AM, \"Todor Syarov\" <thodor at abv.bg<mailto:thodor at abv.bg>> wrote:\n\n\n!Indeed\ni get no files/directory found\n\neventough I see the radiance package unpacked under:\n\nApplications/Radiance/HEAD\n\n\nmy paths are set to:\n\npico ~/.profile\n\nexport PATH=/Applications/Radiance/HEAD/ray/OUTPUT:$PATH\n\nexport RAYPATH=.:/Applications/Radiance/HEAD/ray/lib\n\nexport MANPATH=/Applications/Radiance/HEAD/ray/doc/man\n\n\nas in the video tutorial by Andy McNeil/\n\nI believe I am missing something that might be obvious enough, not for a new Mac user,though\n\nRobert, how would you proceed to solve such problem?\n\n\n\n-------- ?????????? ????? --------\n??: \"Guglielmetti, Robert\" Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n???????: Re: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n??: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\n????????? ??: 20.01.2015 18:29\n\nWhile the benchmark is a nice way to test out various pieces of the Radiance codebase, it is in some ways abstracted from the bare metal installation of Radiance. Might be better to just try asking your system where it thinks your installed binaries are, e.g., \"which rpict\" should print the full path location of rpict on your system, like:\n\n$which rpict\n/usr/local/bin/rpict\n\nIf that command returns nothing, then your system doesn't know where Radiance is (which seems to be what the benchmark script is saying too). Double check that your paths are set properly, and that you are running the benchmark script from a NEW terminal window, not the one you used to compile Radiance and set the paths.\n\n\n\n\nOn 1/20/15, 9:04 AM, \"Brian Karr\" <brianakarr at yahoo.com<javascript:%20internSendMess('brianakarr at yahoo.com')><mailto:brianakarr at yahoo.com>> wrote:\n\nI believe you can just delete the install directories to start from new.
