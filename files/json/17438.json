We would like to get some things fixed and updated in the OpenStudio code, prior to revising the docs. Of course if you are merely looking for Radiance, the link above will get you where you need to go straight away.\n\n-Rob\n\nOn Jan 21, 2015, at 7:07 AM, \"Giuseppe De Michele\" <giudm.87 at gmail.com<mailto:giudm.87 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nHi Jiajie,\n\nI am agree with Germ?n. I also use Radiance in Windows OS (but 8) and the only thing required (in addition to the Radiance execution file) is a Perl interpreter (i.e. Strawberrya and Raspberry), which is needed in order to run some commands, such as genklemsamp.\n\nTake a look at this discussion:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010431.html\n\nPS: There was also a tutorial about the Radiance Installation on window SO (I guess by NREL) called \"Getting Started with Radiance\", but it seems to be disappeared.\n\nCheers,\nGiuseppe\n\n2015-01-21 12:18 GMT+01:00 Germ?n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com<mailto:germolinal at gmail.com>>:\nHello Jiajie,\n\nAre you aware of the NREL precompiled WINDOWS Radiance<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases>? I have succesfully used them at work along with Raspberry Perl. If that does not convince you, I guess you can keep trying Cygwin... but I have no idea how to help you there.\n\nBye!\n\nGerm?n\n\n2015-01-21 8:05 GMT-03:00 Jonathan Zhu <jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com<mailto:jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com>>:\nhi everyone,\n\nI am a student and i am completely new to Radiance.\nI have already installed Cygwin and downloaded the latest source code.\nCould someone tell me how to install Radiance on my windows 7 system in detail?\n\nmany thanks,\nJiajie\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n--\nGiuseppe De Michele\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance on windows 7", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<80858F67-B438-4028-89FB-93E4A734909A@nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<CABe4m-LfJtuCyn25JG4Md=ZfVvc7ku29LZoMqwi8E-PBtnTf4w@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAF-iH4L80p39msmac1_BZoNYNOtKihaMeyYZReiACj2wxmR4-A@mail.gmail.com>,", "<CAOn=hKEOmhaa0FGsrpJOMXZ6szwF8vcs6Eqh4Y9Jye=vZvAt+w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 14:28:14 +0000", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance on windows 7"}
