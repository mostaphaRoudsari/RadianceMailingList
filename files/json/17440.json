{"body": "\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nYou might want to have a look at this document http://mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/ReferenceOffice/index.html which describe a reference office that can be used for the purposes described by you.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\n\nSent: Thursday, January 22, 2015 11:28 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear experts,\n\nI am involved in the design of an outdoor daylighting test facility.\n\nI am trying to evaluate the minimum depth of the lab in order to be able to study redirecting daylight systems (i.e. light shelves or complex lamella).\nCell height: 2.7 m and cell width: 5.5 m.\n\nOur idea is to cover, let's say, \"90%\" of the applications of these systems.\n\nDo you have experience in that field? Or can you suggest a modeling approach to answer this question?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nCheers,\nGiuseppe.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150122/6eac6cab/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility", "sender": "giudm.87 at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80C7191908@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": ["<CAOn=hKEa1zntuALKa+mfkP70X1UmMVWw_dvixS85=9XOCptJNQ@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 16:36:23 +0000", "email": "Giuseppe De Michele", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility"}
