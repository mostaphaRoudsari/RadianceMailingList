{"body": "\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nAt LBNL we find that our window test bed (10 feet wide by 15 feet deep)\nisn't deep enough to demonstrate all the full benefits of daylight\nredirection. In this facility the redirected daylight often hits the back\nwall.\n\nOur new FLEXLAB (20 feet wide by 30 feet deep) we believe these dimensions\nare deep enough, but we haven't yet tested daylight redirecting systems in\nFLEXLAB (coming this spring!).\n\nI like Christoph's suggestion of a standard reference office for testing\nsystems via simulation. And if physical test cells match the dimensions of\nthe simulation standard, all the better. A global network of identical test\ncells at different institutions would be amazing.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 22, 2015 at 8:36 AM, Christoph Reinhart <tito_ at mit.edu> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150122/2b9d9e8f/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Niyd8Ucnwqw5R_ubKYzGBe5gfDMXC5KSLB4k9y9yRQxYtA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOn=hKEa1zntuALKa+mfkP70X1UmMVWw_dvixS85=9XOCptJNQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80C7191908@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>"], "datetime": "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 10:24:15 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility"}
