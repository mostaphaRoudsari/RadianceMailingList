{"body": "\nMike,\nOut of curiosity, at what image size (pixels) are you rendering, and are you using pfilt to filter down to the final image? I believe rendering many extra pixels with lower ?ad and filtering down by /5, /10, etc. is the typical approach for the sake of rendering time when setting ?aa 0. I?m not an expert in this, just recalling things I?ve seen in the distant past. I wonder if this approach would also reduce the size of those rendering artifacts.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150127/f54d8272/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pure monte carlo rendering tips", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236272FB63F@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CAMrvT8er5rAt-rvi3Qf7v7p0-+XNos=htsV39O8_y2_Q2Tk2PA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 14:10:57 +0000", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pure monte carlo rendering tips"}
