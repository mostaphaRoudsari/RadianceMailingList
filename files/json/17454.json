{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\nI am new to Radiance and I run it in the VMware workstation virtual machine\nwith Ubuntu.\n\nI have the book 'Rendering with Radiance' and at the end of the first\nchapter there is a tutorial to show what Radiance can do briefly.\n\nI am now following the instruction to input a simple room and input the\nfollowing code in Ubuntu terminal:\n\n\n\nvi room.rad\n\nvoid light bright\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3 100 100 100\n\nvoid plastic red_plastic\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5 .7 .05 .05 .05 .05\n\nbright sphere fixture\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4 2 1 1.5 .125\n\nred_plastic sphere ball\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4 .7 1.125 .625 .125\n\n%oconv room.rad>test.oct\n\n%getinfo test.oct\n\n%rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct\n\n%rview -defaults\n\n\n\nIn book it said that an image of a red ball can be seen on the screen, but\nfor me, nothing happened. I suppose it might be a graphic interfacing\nproblem but I don't how to solve it.\n\nBesides, I found a little strange that every time when I tried to input 'vi\nroom.rad', I cannot directly input the next line which is 'void light\nbright', I must input an 'o' first and then 'void light bright'. Can someone\nexplain this.\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nJiajie\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150127/f0e89187/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jonathan Zhu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<008601d03a56$a2fe7d10$e8fb7730$@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:28:16 -0000", "email": "jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] no Graph"}
