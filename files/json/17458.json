{"body": "\nJiajie,\n\nMy guess is that the intended action associated with each line in the\nexample you are following is not clear.\n\n*vi room.rad*\n\nThis opens a terminal based text editor. vi is notoriously difficult for\nnewcomers to use. I recommend nano for new users. To use nano type:\n\n*nano room.rad*\n\n\nThe following lines should be entered into the text editor. With nano you\ncan use copy/paste to enter the commands.\n\n*void light bright*\n\n*0*\n\n*0*\n\n*3 100 100 100*\n\n*void plastic red_plastic*\n\n*0*\n\n*0*\n\n*5 .7 .05 .05 .05 .05*\n\n*bright sphere fixture*\n\n*0*\n\n*0*\n\n*4 2 1 1.5 .125*\n\n*red_plastic sphere ball*\n\n*0*\n\n*0*\n\n*4 .7 1.125 .625 .125*\n\n\nAfter the text above is entered you should save the file and close the text\neditor. With nano this is accomplished using ctrl-o to save than ctrl-x to\nexit.\n\n\nThe following lines are commands that are entered at the terminal prompt,\nnot into the text editor. The % sign is intended to indicate the command\nprompt, and should not be typed into the terminal.\n\n*%oconv room.rad>test.oct*\n\n*%getinfo test.oct*\n\n*%**rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct*\n\n*%rview -defaults*\n\n\nAt the terminal type:\n\n*oconv room.rad > test.oct*\n\nThis creates a Radiance octree scene  file from your scene file.\n\n\n*getinfo test.oct*\n\nThis gives you information about the octree file. I get the following\noutput after running the command:\n\ntest.oct:\n\n#?RADIANCE\n\noconv room.rad\n\nFORMAT=Radiance_octree\n\n\nrview is the old name for the interactive scene viewer. It was renamed to\nrvu a few years back to avoid a naming conflict with a vi alias. So you\nshould type the following instead.\n\n*rvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct*\n\nThis opens an X11 window where you should see the red ball appear.\n\n\nIf you follow these instructions and don't get the expected output, write\nback including any errors reported in the terminal.\n\n\nGood Luck.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 27, 2015 at 1:46 PM, Jonathan Zhu <jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150127/3cd9fb60/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] no graph", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NizU0XQDNrO1TH3LB3YCi8xgQFgvVgVbBndP+B+-XuPyew@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<000201d03a7a$b53624f0$1fa26ed0$@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 14:35:00 -0800", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] no graph"}
