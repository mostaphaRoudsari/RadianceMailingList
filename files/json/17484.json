{"body": "\nGiuseppe et al\n\nFor more details about the FLEXLAB facility you can visit flexlab.lbl.gov\nAndy recently completed the first client study in the facility that\ninvolved daylight/energy/glare assessments with glazing, fixed shading,\noperable shading etc  but not specifically \"redirecting\" devices- study to\nbe published later this year;  as he noted we expect to be doing new\ntesting of daylight redirecting systems over the next year.\n\nSome additional examples of prior measuring and modeling of daylight\ncontrol and redirecting systems can be captured from\nhttp://facades.lbl.gov/daylighting-systems\n\nThe IEA SHC Task 21 on Daylighting published a 260 page book- \"Daylight in\nBuildings, A Source Book on Daylighting Systems and Components\"\nYou can download a 5MB PDF from our website:\nhttp://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/daylight-in-buildings.pdf\nThis is about 15 years old but the sun is much older and both R&D and\npractice move slowly so much of the info is still useful.  The Appendix in\nthe report describes 9 test facilities around the world ( as of ~2000) that\ndo/did daylight testing; with a semi technical description of their\nmeasurement capabilities.  We have some extra (physical) copies of the\nbooks on our shelves- if you still like hard bound books and daylight and\nare not too far away to send ( they weigh about 5 pounds) I can mail a\ncopy. There is also a CD-ROM that contains the book and some additional\n200MB of related files; I could post that on Dropbox if people are\ninterested.\n\nSteve\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nStephen Selkowitz\n\nBuilding Technology and Urban Systems Department             (510) 486-5064\n\nBldg.90-3111\nfax (510) 486-4089\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nSESelkowitz at lbl.gov\n\nBerkeley, CA 94720\nhttp://buildings.lbl.gov/ <http://BTECH.lbl.gov/>\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nOn Fri, Jan 23, 2015 at 9:21 AM, Giuseppe De Michele <giudm.87 at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150123/dcce4ef1/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility", "sender": "Stephen Selkowitz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAELHttPeDQzejaVhV8RvYcN3ZuCdYFLCEMBXXPjJvh19NqkrkQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOn=hKEa1zntuALKa+mfkP70X1UmMVWw_dvixS85=9XOCptJNQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80C7191908@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "<CAOG+Niyd8Ucnwqw5R_ubKYzGBe5gfDMXC5KSLB4k9y9yRQxYtA@mail.gmail.com>", "<D0E68F2B.1526A%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<CAOn=hKH8Ro-JHW=A9j+iGSyPp4dSHBrZG+6Vy551xa9_B7Cqkw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 23 Jan 2015 10:58:19 -0800", "email": "seselkowitz at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility"}
