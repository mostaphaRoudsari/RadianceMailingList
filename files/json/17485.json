{"body": "\nThank you at all for the precious help. We will take in account all your\nadvices.\n\nIn the next weeks I will update you with the project evolution.\n\nHappy weekend,\nGiuseppe\nFor another datapoint, the Research Support Facility here at NREL is rather\nwell daylit, and is 60' deep, but receives light from the north side as\nwell as the south, in addition to heavy use of daylight redirection from\nthe south. From experience (I've had a desk in the  middle of this building\nfor the last few years), I'd say that the daylight redirection devices\nprovide useful daylight as far back as 35' under ideal conditions, and on\naverage to 25' from the south wall. These devices can also paint the back\nwall - 60' away from the source - with daylight! While impressive, I still\nsay that *useful* daylight from those things (i.e. horizontal task\nilluminance >=250 lux) penetrates 35' or so at most; pretty much about as\ndeep as LBNL's new test space (FLEXLAB).\n\nI also like Christoph's idea for a standard office reference model for\nsimulation; liked it the first time when it was called CIE 171:2006, too.\n;) In all seriousness, I believe this Reinhart et al. model is a great idea\n-- especially product comparisons in simulation, across climates.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 1/22/15, 11:24 AM, \"Andrew McNeil\" <amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:\namcneil at lbl.gov>> wrote:\n\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nAt LBNL we find that our window test bed (10 feet wide by 15 feet deep)\nisn't deep enough to demonstrate all the full benefits of daylight\nredirection. In this facility the redirected daylight often hits the back\nwall.\n\nOur new FLEXLAB (20 feet wide by 30 feet deep) we believe these dimensions\nare deep enough, but we haven't yet tested daylight redirecting systems in\nFLEXLAB (coming this spring!).\n\nI like Christoph's suggestion of a standard reference office for testing\nsystems via simulation. And if physical test cells match the dimensions of\nthe simulation standard, all the better. A global network of identical test\ncells at different institutions would be amazing.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 22, 2015 at 8:36 AM, Christoph Reinhart <tito_ at mit.edu<mailto:\ntito_ at mit.edu>> wrote:\nHi Giuseppe,\n\nYou might want to have a look at this document\nhttp://mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/ReferenceOffice/index.html\nwhich describe a reference office that can be used for the purposes\ndescribed by you.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\n\ngiudm.87 at gmail.com>]\nSent: Thursday, January 22, 2015 11:28 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear experts,\n\nI am involved in the design of an outdoor daylighting test facility.\n\nI am trying to evaluate the minimum depth of the lab in order to be able to\nstudy redirecting daylight systems (i.e. light shelves or complex lamella).\nCell height: 2.7 m and cell width: 5.5 m.\n\nOur idea is to cover, let's say, \"90%\" of the applications of these systems.\n\nDo you have experience in that field?
