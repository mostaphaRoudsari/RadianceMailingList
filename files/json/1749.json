It's a bit complicated, but you'll probably end up\nwith something similar if you're building a parametric BRDF model.\n\nYou should be aware that Radiance doesn't do all it should with BRDF\nmaterials, in that the indirect component is approximated as\ndiffuse.  Only highlights use the BRDF, not secondary rays, for\nefficiency.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<43440B8F.6020206@cs.ucl.ac.uk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Oct  5 19:55:24 2005"}
