{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nTo define trees in Radiance, you can either use an impostor as you do in\nyour CAD system, and apply a \"colorpict\" to it, or (as I prefer), model\nthe tree as detailed geometry and compile into an octree for the\n\"instance\" primitive.  This is very efficient, since a single tree model\nmay be duplicated throughout your scene without adding to associated\nscene memory.  You cannot easily get holes in a tree otherwise, as you\nwould have to use the \"mixdata\" type with \"void\" as one of the\nmodifiers, and translate your texture into a large, ASCII data file.\nIt's doable, but the results won't look as nice as a real tree, and\nwon't be much faster to render, either.  Ray tracing is very fast at\nrendering complicated geometry -- much faster than a typical CAD program.\n\nThere is a pine tree in the standard Radiance distribution, but I never\ngot around to modeling anything more elaborate....\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Trees... and defining them in radiance (Lars O.
