This is something you need to have on your system in addition to XCode in order to build a few of the Radiance programs (rvu, image, etc.). Your build probably failed and you have a somewhat busted installation of Radiance, here.\n\n\n\n(Bias alert) may I suggest you try the Mac Radiance installer we have available?\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases\n\n\n\nThese have everything built already, and the installer puts everything in:\n\n/usr/local/radiance/bin\n\n/usr/local/radiance/lib\n\n/usr/local/radiance/man\n\n\n\n?and you can follow Andy's path setting tricks in that video you posted to get this all dialed in and working for ya.\n\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\nOn 1/20/15, 9:25 AM, \"Todor Syarov\"  thodor at abv.bg  > wrote:\n\n\n\nOne of the first messages I was getting before error 127\n\nwas:\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n\nx11image.c:26:11: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found\n\n\n\n#include\n\n\n\n---------------\n\n\n\neventhough i I had checked before installing the compatibility btw OS system and Xcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------- ?????????? ????? --------\n\n??: \"Brian Karr\"  brianakarr at yahoo.com\n\n???????: Re: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n\n??: \"'Radiance general discussion'\"  radiance-general at radiance-online.org  >\n\n????????? ??: 20.01.2015 17:46\n\n\n\nNot sure if this applies, when I installed on Mac this thread helped:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000221.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, January 20, 2015 10:02 AM\n\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI wanted to install on Mac/Yosemite/ Radiance\n\nrad4R2supp.tar.gz\n\n\n\nXcode is installed and updated for compatibility with OS Yosemite*\n\n\n\nfollowing the instruction : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68#t=137\n\nI believe I have done something wrong installing it:\n\n\n\n#after setting the Raypath , Path and Manpath as in the video\n\n#I have unpacked benchmark\n\n#typed  :make (command)// \"i have one processor\"\n\n\n\nand experienced the following error\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\n\nCHANGES\n\n\n\n2010-12-01  MJS  reworked Makefile and options so that same code will\n\n\n\nwork on any version of Radiance going back ~5 years\n\n\n\n2011-03-24  MJS  removed \"-pm 0.0\" from optionsbase because rpiece throws\n\n\n\nan error in 4R1\n\n\n\nNiyas-iMac:bench4 niya$ make\n\n\n\n/bin/sh: rpict: command not found\n\n\n\n/bin/sh: rpict: command not found\n\n\n\nrm -f serial.unf\n\n\n\ntime rpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o serial.unf scene.oct\n\n\n\nrpict: No such file or directory\n\n\n\n0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys\n\n\n\nmake: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you solve such problem in order to proceed with installing Radiance on Mac?\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150120/51235dc8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<D0E3D075.150D1%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "sender": "thodor at abv.bg", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1661622342.309879.1421772694004.JavaMail.apache@nm32.abv.bg>", "refs": ["<CABr=F_jnVW_tO+zRPdXeA9dtcgh2LZKjNJYymONMcYf3BxzL0g@mail.gmail.com>", "<436452946.112148.1421766107884.JavaMail.apache@nm31.abv.bg>", "<002401d034c8$48cc0c60$da642520$@yahoo.com>", "<1563575264.120512.1421771146442.JavaMail.apache@nm31.abv.bg>", "<D0E3D075.150D1%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 18:51:34 +0200 (EET)", "email": "Todor Syarov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127"}
