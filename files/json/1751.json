Of course, the C source is all there if you want to modify\nit, but there's quite a lot to figure out along the way, like how to\nsample the hemisphere for an arbitrary BRDF.  This is a difficult\nproblem, and one that has been tackled by various people over the\nyears, so there are some precedents.\n\nIf I were to do it myself, I would investigate something like a\nmedian cut algorithm or kd-tree on the hemisphere, which would\nrequire presampling the BRDF or performing lazy evaluation.  For\nsomething like the He-Torrance model, you would likely spend hours\nand hours (perhaps days) just computing the BRDF before you ended up\ntracing your first ray.  This is why Radiance doesn't make the attempt.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<43441773.3000505@cs.ucl.ac.uk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Oct  5 20:20:39 2005"}
