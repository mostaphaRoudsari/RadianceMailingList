The first, called illum, should be the actual light\nsource for indirect calculation. That is well documented with mkillum.\nThe second is to \"seal\" geometry only. That means, the modified\nsurfaces are so small, that I can neglect them to reduce the number of\nlight sources in the indirect calculation. RwR chapter 13.1 suggests to\nseal such geometry with zero-radiance illums, but doesn't propose how\nto set them. So that is the point where I am, can I somehow give this\nzero-radiance as an option to mkillum?\n\nThank You, CU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
