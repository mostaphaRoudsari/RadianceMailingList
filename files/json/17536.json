{"body": "\nDear Andy,\nThank You for your interest, I must apologize, as I simply copied the command from a diva grid based illuminance simulation: I changed the input parameters to -W (Global Horizontal, Diffuse Horizontal)and the output to irradiance \"-O 1\"(Watt/m2); of course having some mist doesn't make any sense as it is already accounted in the parameters I have as input (which are from a weather station nearby(meters away from the panel)).\nAbout the approximations I just completely trust who wrote the code for Diva, now I will try without any and keep you up to date\nThank You very Much\nMarco\n\nSent: 29 January 2015 20:11\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nMarco,\n\nPuzzling. I'd suggest starting by adjusting the simulation parameters to make sure all ambient rays and direct rays are traced.\n\nHere are the simulation parameters you used:\n-I -h -dp 2048 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -st .01 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -ab 2 -ad 1000 -as 20 -ar 300 -aa 0.1\n\nHere are the parameters I recommend testing:\n-I -h -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-5 -ab 2 -ad 2000 -as 1000 -aa 0\n\nIf that doesn't help I'd like to see your Solyndra.pts file.\n\nOn a side note, this is the second posting where someone is using the -ms parameter. Are people really using mist in daylight simulations these days?\n\nAndy\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150202/4a85d091/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Irradiation on a Solyndra solar module", "sender": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D857734053C3464DA57F588A3E63CB32684A63@SDCEMB01.unibz.it>", "refs": ["<D857734053C3464DA57F588A3E63CB326847A4@SDCEMB01.unibz.it>", "<CAOG+NiyG7N74BedZyLYgTfV3myLZpBFKYRLs=1rmsV63a9kKyA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 13:52:49 +0000", "email": "Andrew McNeil", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Irradiation on a Solyndra solar module"}
