{"body": "\nDear list,\n\nMay I ask advices on modeling trees in a Radiance scene?\n\nSuppose I can get a so-called \"*transmittance coefficient*\" value for a\ngiven type of tree through field measurement and then calculating the\naverage ratio of the irradiance below a tree to that above it for multiple\npoints below a tree under various types of sky conditions, what *surface\nparameter * can I specify in Radiance for a simplified sphere surface\nrepresenting a tree that can use this \"transmittance coefficient\" as a\nreference for simulation to understand the impact of the tree to the\nsurrounding environment in terms of shading?\n\nHope I explain myself clearly ...\n\nThanks!\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150205/cf0dec58/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Joe Smith", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAGhWmF6vbgPRNNGWHrKCc2HnL6sVWJ=9gtqSJ6sqeNjgRXQL6w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 16:41:24 +0800", "email": "the.oat.cracker at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radiance"}
