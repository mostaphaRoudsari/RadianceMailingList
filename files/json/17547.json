{"body": "\nHi Joe,\n\nThe setting of trans parameters is a bit tricky and an oft-visited question that should be the first in a FAQ, if indeed such a thing will happen if it hasn't yet after 25 years....  If you do a search on the Radiance mailing list for \"trans parameters\" or similar, I'm sure you'll find some choice entries.  Maybe someone can recommend a calculator for you, but the basic formulae are given in Section 5.2 on p. 325-6 of \"Rendering with Radiance,\" attached below.\n\nI like the concept of using a mixfunc with void and plastic on the outside and mist on the inside.  Working out the appropriate parameters to get a reasonable look would be a challenge, but the results might be worth it.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150206/651a0e93/attachment-0002.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: TransMaterial.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nSize: 81901 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150206/651a0e93/attachment-0001.pdf>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150206/651a0e93/attachment-0003.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radiance", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<441BBCAE-303A-4DE5-8F3D-F0FEE255C806@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CAGhWmF6vbgPRNNGWHrKCc2HnL6sVWJ=9gtqSJ6sqeNjgRXQL6w@mail.gmail.com>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236273424AC@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "<63A7FD7F-D204-4D00-8499-8F47A4EEA499@lmi.net>", "<CAGhWmF4cMvh0-GoHjsd4tLd8p6-sCEfpU2mfdwkoyq5ELWgw5w@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 07:46:14 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radiance"}
