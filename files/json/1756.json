It seems I introduced a bug in the total command when I\nadded the ability to read binary data back in June, and didn't notice\nit because it only happens when the -p and -m options are combined,\nas they are in compamb.\n\nDownload and compile the latest total.c from CVS by following the\nlink below:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/\nray/src/cal/total.c?rev=1.5&content-type=text/plain\n\nPut it in the ray/src/cal directory and rerun \"rmake install\" there.\n\nSorry about that, but thanks very much for finding this bug.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Compamb Problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
