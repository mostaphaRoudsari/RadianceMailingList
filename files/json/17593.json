{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nThe basic data and procedure for calculating CRI, CCT and others can be gleaned from this Matlab procedure:\n\nhttp://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightsources/scripts/NLPIP_LightSourceColor_Script.m\n\nExtrapolating from RGB to the required resolution is probably not for the squeamish.  I was going to try out the above-linked code to compare (Matlab) computed CRI & CCT with what the MK350 was giving me, but never got round to it.  For me, one of the 'take home' messages from tinkering with the MK350 (assuming the values are correct) was not to give too much importance to CRI or CCT alone -- much more informative to have the pair.  Better still, of course, the spectrum.\n\nThe SAGE Glass White Paper is available here:\n\nhttp://sageglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/How_to_maintain_neutral_daylight_illumination_wtih_SageGlass_EC_Glazing.pdf\n\nA journal paper on same has been accepted for publication by LR&T.\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n\n[cid:C466B438-CE0B-488D-A45B-024218BA7A1E at lboro.ac.uk]\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150226/d889b1a4/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: RAEng-vector.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 17432 bytes\nDesc: RAEng-vector.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150226/d889b1a4/attachment-0001.png>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D3536CF8-7086-4DCD-9BD9-BB5380BF1C85@lboro.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:28:15 +0000", "email": "J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] calculating CRI and CCT"}
