{"body": "\nhi,\n\nArtifice the company puts out a program called DesignWorkshop.\nThe free download version is DesignWorkshop Lite.  Available online is\na nifty widget program that can create 3d trees in varying complexity and\nshapes in their file format .dw that's exportable to .dxf. There might even\nbe a straight forward way from .dw to .rad but I think you have to buy\nDesignWorkshop Pro to have that functionality...\n\nAnyway, at http://www.artifice.com/machines/tree.html  is the tree machine.\nAt http://www.artifice.com/dw.html  is where you can get the free download\nof DesignWorkshop Lite.\n\nAfter customizing a tree using the online form, click to download the tree.dw,\nthen open up tree file using DesignWorkshop Lite, export tree into dxf format\nand then into your CAD program.  Quite a few steps, but I think these trees\nlook pretty good...\n\njudy\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "judy lai", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3C5360A5.A53E3DA9@lbl.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat, 26 Jan 2002 18:06:29 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: treesReferences: <200201261110.g0QBA2Q02962@darkside-animation.com>"}
