I have used mkillum to add\nsome illum planes in front of the windows of my scene, and sealed the\nsides using zero-radiance illums. I am rendering the illums with -s=8\n-d=8, and in total there are about 400 calculated illums (and many more\nzero-radiance illums).\n\nNow, I am experiencing even slower calculation with rpict. I guess it\nis because of all the illum sources. I think that I can reduce the -ab\nbounces because of the illum useage, which will give faster rendering\ntimes. But still I wonder if there is some kind of a magic limit of the\nnumber of illums to use. I mean, is there a number of illums where\nrendering speed decreases instead of increasing by the useage of the\nmkillum-tool ?\n\nAre there any other ambient-parameters that I can change now that I\nhave illums? I am thinking of ad, ar, aa, as the light environment is\nquite different now?\n\nYou see, I am still quite a beginner in this mkillum stuff, and a bit\nworried. Thanks for any help and hints, CU\n\nLars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
