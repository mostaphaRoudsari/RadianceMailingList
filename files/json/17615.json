{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI don't think there's an easy way to do this with Radiance.  If you have complete spectral information for the sky, you can perform a multi-pass spectral calculation by substituting the appropriate components and material reflectances/transmittances for your subdivided spectrum.  There are a few posts related to this in the list archives.  Try searching on \"spectral\".\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating CRI and CCT", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DEA021DE-385E-440E-9B0D-8D89AFFCD54E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<mailman.1.1424462400.71839.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<DB4PR05MB0688594BD00B6B436CEB024BF4290@DB4PR05MB0688.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>", "<A53A944B-E2BC-40B2-9706-0D2219E93192@lmi.net>", "<881329C5-3338-4CA9-B840-58123F02DE5B@christianhumann.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 11:10:08 -0800", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] calculating CRI and CCT"}
