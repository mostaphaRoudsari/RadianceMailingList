{"body": "\nJoe\n\nI don't have a solution for your problem but on some previous versions of\nMac OS X the standard Python installation had \"issues\". You could try\ninstalling a custom version from python.org.\n\nAlso, I recommend switching to os.popen instead of os.system. You have much\nmore feedback from the output stream and any errors that show up.\nConverting the code is usually very easy.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Wed, Feb 18, 2015 at 10:43 PM, Joe Smith <the.oat.cracker at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150219/eb8d541f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<CAGhWmF5vVM=HP=L_Zg6e8gHimy5JOV2s_4eZ6ouDAAdhpu_GKw@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k2tchrdFcUPAwvmxP9yvmzvBLB5F4g0d286zYunEbErWg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAGhWmF7R33E8d1O-gm6NfoqbiSAKNG9Yf9qkLLUYjH4ndh-sjg@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAGhWmF5vVM=HP=L_Zg6e8gHimy5JOV2s_4eZ6ouDAAdhpu_GKw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 11:21:18 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] problem of gencumulativesky driven throughPython"}
