{"body": "\nDear Joe and Greg,\n\nI was trying to emulate a micro perforated metal the other day (I do not\nwant to draw thousands of little holes!)... I tried to use TRANS equations\nto derive the parameters I needed, but it did not seem to work. I think\nTRANS properties vary with the ngle of incidence??\n\nI ended up using a mixture between VOID and a Plastic material, on which I\nvaried the percentage of \"Void\"... I am not sure, maybe that trick would\nalso help modelling trees.\n\nAm I correct? Is, what I did, legally from the physical laws of lighitng?\nHi Joe,\n\nIf you want to model your tree as a sphere (on a stick?) with a certain\ntransmittance, the \"trans\" material type should suit your purpose.\nParameter setting is a bit tricky, but since you don't have any reflection\nor scattering to consider, simply set values according to your\ntransmittance T:\n\nvoid trans treeT\n0\n0\n7 T T T 0 0 1 1\n\nI hope this addresses your question.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n*From: *Joe Smith <the.oat.cracker at gmail.com>\n\n*Subject: *[Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radiance\n\n*Date: *February 5, 2015 3:41:24 AM EST\n\n\nDear list,\n\nMay I ask advices on modeling trees in a Radiance scene?\n\nSuppose I can get a so-called \"*transmittance coefficient*\" value for a\ngiven type of tree through field measurement and then calculating the\naverage ratio of the irradiance below a tree to that above it for multiple\npoints below a tree under various types of sky conditions, what *surface\nparameter * can I specify in Radiance for a simplified sphere surface\nrepresenting a tree that can use this \"transmittance coefficient\" as a\nreference for simulation to understand the impact of the tree to the\nsurrounding environment in terms of shading?\n\nHope I explain myself clearly ...\n\nThanks!\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150205/72e690f6/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radiance", "sender": "=?UTF-8?Q?Germ=C3=A1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4J+Bdenmt2Y8a6v+qqSh563CX3vm9g17AXdzg1diifYGQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAGhWmF6vbgPRNNGWHrKCc2HnL6sVWJ=9gtqSJ6sqeNjgRXQL6w@mail.gmail.com>", "<BCB3203E-5715-48FA-9953-DCB44599539A@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 09:46:26 -0300", "email": "germolinal at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radiance"}
