{"body": "\nThe xform command can shift, rotate, tilt, and array the .rad file definition that gets created from ies2rad. Please write again if you have any trouble finding the manual page for it.\n\nThe .rad file that comes from ies2rad represents the geometry of the IES file ? and makes reference to a data translation of the luminaire intensity. You should also get such a .dat file out of ies2rad, but shouldn?t have to perform any actions on this because it?s a data reference into the .rad file rather than a geometry that must be rotated.\n\nThere?s also the replmarks command which can be helpful for locating light sources if you?re exporting a model from some other modeling software.\n\n\n\nCan I ask, If there is any programe to tilt the actuall IES file and than put it into Radiance or is there any possibility to rotate or tilt an IES file in Radiance ? Any tips and hints?\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150302/98c6ddc9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files-rotation/tilting", "sender": "petozatko89 at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF619982362736B146@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CAChZdE3gqgudGP8hMGLbffk7-UyP-J48i1ouVjJh9t4Q2XU6sg@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 14:38:21 +0000", "email": "Peter Za?ko", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES files-rotation/tilting"}
