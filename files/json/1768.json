But if you have polygonal surfaces\n(which means that there may be more than 4 vertices), 3dfaces cannot\nrepresent these any more without first splitting them to triangular or\nquadrangular faces, if I understood the dxf-faces right. Am I wrong\nhere? And triangular faces are the worst to use for mkillum.\n\nClosed polylines might work, but as you can see from Schorsch's mail,\nthere is again a difference between 2d and 3d polylines. And here, if\nyou are not working with Autocad, it is really difficult to find out\nwhat kind of polylines are written to your dxf...\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: text/enriched\nSize: 783 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051011/189b68f2/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
