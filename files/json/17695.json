On Wednesday, April 8th at 6.30PM, I will be giving an overview lecture on daylighting<https://pge-web.ungerboeck.com/classcalendar/Details.aspx?OrgCode=10&EventId=11612> covering topics from rules of thumb for urban massing studies to a review of a century of daylight modelling techniques. On April 9th the center will host a full day workshop on daylight simulations. Details and registration information for the latter can be found here<http://registration.daylightinghandbook.com/>.
