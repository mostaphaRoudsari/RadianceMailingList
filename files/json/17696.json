{"body": "\nHi Robert,\n\nusing gensky in that case would not really be brute force. You can use Radiance's cnt tool to provide you with intervals of any wanted duration, translate these into time stamps as expected by gensky using the unix date command, and generate the sky vector from gensky's output. That allows you to easily apply the three-phase method using the synthetic sky distributions.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n--\nDipl.-Ing. Lars O.
