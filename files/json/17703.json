{"body": "\nThe next major release of OpenStudio (v 1.7.0, to be released at the end of March) does all of this work for you automatically. The basic workflow is in the current iteration release, in fact; OpenStudio will take an OpenStudio model and group all the window polygons by orientation, transmittance, and shading control, and all the required rfluxmtx headers are written to the window input files. This is all in OpenStudio v1.6.3. While there was an issue in the annual simulation workflow in v1.6.3, this has been fixed for v1.7.0 (and can be downloaded from the OpenStudio GitHub today).\n\n</shameless_plug>\n\n\n\nOn 3/12/15, 12:22 PM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nHi Reinier,\n\nAre you being sure to group your same-material surfaces together when passing them to rfluxmtx?  The program isn't smart enough to group them for you, and I suppose this requirement needs to be mentioned explicitly in the man page.  That was an oversight on my part...\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI'm running a three phase method...\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcontrib: fatal - duplicate modifer 'M-nor'", "sender": "reinier.zeldenrust at atelierten.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D12747B1.171E2%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<DB4PR05MB06883B1563D0C478BDAED8A7F4060@DB4PR05MB0688.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>", "<61DEAF8A-B02D-49F3-8425-45CE2EBDADD8@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "March 12, 2015 1:38:37 PM EDT", "email": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcontrib: fatal - duplicate modifer 'M-nor'"}
