{"body": "\nDear experts,\nI try to create a handmade, virtual weather file for a complete year of\nwonderfull clear skies. The goal is a direct-insolation study, somehow the\nmaximum potential for a given site. So I am interested only in direct and\ndiffuse irradiance values in the fake .epw.\nA) Is there a nice way to create a fake .epw for an arbitrary location for\nclear sky all year long? (I would head for looping through the year with\ngensky, but that's brute. And the following steps, rework of my fuzzy\nconcept are unclear to me, today.)\nB) What would you suggest for sizing down the timesteps in the epw....\ndctimestep calculation (two.phase method...thx to andy' s pdf and David).\nThe insulation study should give data more frequently than hourly.\n\nMany thanks,\nRobert\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150311/44c3befa/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Robert Weitlaner", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAFNnwkv+kfW5aSy=UqG4zMgtAbq7_7jH3TTVB3q3gUzDr=n6Jw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 22:59:07 +0100", "email": "r.weitlaner at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Virtual (fake) weather file > .*wea> *.smx"}
