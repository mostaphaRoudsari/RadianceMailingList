{"body": "\nDear Everyone,\n\nI am trying to use gencumulativesky, but I have encounter some issues that\nI would like to share, just in case anyone can help me... I searched a\nwhile, but I found nothing like really useful.\n\nMy doubts are basically in every step, haha... sorry this will be long.\n\n\n- *gencumulativesky*\n\nI compiled gencumulativesky as mentioned in the \"Readme\" file, and it\nworked perfectly well. However, when I intended to use it,\n*I got a segmentation fault. what could be causing it?*\n\nMy data was obtained from an EPW file, obtaining 8760 lines organized in\ntwo columns (Global Horizontal and Diffuse Horizontal Radiation) separated\nwith tabs:\n0    0\n0    0\n0    0\n0    0\n0    0\n3    3\n69    61\n267    155\n...\n\nWhen I found out it did not work, I thought on an alternative option that I\nwould like to know if it is ok.\n\nWhat I did was to generate de daymtx (i.e. gendaymtx -O1 -...) and then,\nusing a perl script, add all the values for each bin, obtaining a vector...\nthen, write it on a .cal file (based on Reinhart.cal) as:\n\n{   MODIFIED WARD's REINHART.CAL\n\nAUTOMATICALLY GENERATED USING cSKY by GERMAN MOLINA\n}\n\n...\n\nrbin = if (-alt, 0, raccum(r_row) + r_azn + 1);\n\n...\n\nskybright = select(rbin,bin1, bin2, bin3, ...... binN); {this is the vector}\n\nI am using a gray sky, so the patch value added considers only the red\nchannel... that is, the value of bin1, bin2, bin3, etc. is the sum of all\nthe red values for each bin along the year (i.e. not doing the\n179*(R*0.265+G*0.67+B*0.065))\n\n- *rendering*\n\nI am rendering using rpict -i+\n\n-\n*pfilt *\n\nAs mentioned in the documentation provided with gencumulativesky, I had to\nmodify the -h option for it to work... *Does that affect my results?* (i.e.\nunits)\n\n- *falsecolor*\n\nHere I am just applying Falsecolor doing:\n\nfalsecolor -l kWh/m2 -s a -m 0.001 #change the multiplier in order to get\nkWh\n\n- *Analysis*\n\nDoing this... are my units correct?\n\n\nThat is basically it.\n\nHere are picture of some results\n<https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2NfkTSl19hQaXo2TmNiX0ZJcEk&usp=sharing>...\nI do not even know if the values make sense...\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH IN ADVANCE, SORRY FOR THE LONG E-MAIL\n\nGerm?n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150304/357389d7/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?UTF-8?Q?Germ=C3=A1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4Lo2Mb9nb-6vWSG7sJkVmFdMaKycCncGiD9vB7Z=5QY6g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 10:57:46 -0300", "email": "germolinal at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question: epw file --> gencumulativesky (ish)-->rendering --> pfilt --> falsecolor --> Analysis"}
