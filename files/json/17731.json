{"body": "\nNasa? Awesome... haha.\n\nAnyway, I did not really finished reading, but I have some questions\n\n1. Radiance already has a virtual photogoniometer... genBSDF program.\neasy yo use and, I would say, very optimized. Why is that you do not want\nto use it?\n2. Radiance also has some programs that allow you to give a BSDF\n\"function\" into a BSDF matrix or tensor tree: bsdf2klems, bsdf2tensortree,\nor something like that.\n\nWere you aware of this? is there a reason not to use them?\n\nBest,\n\nGerm?n\n\n2015-04-09 11:38 GMT-03:00 Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.
