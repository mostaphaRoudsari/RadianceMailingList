{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm pretty sure the scons build system hasn't been updated in a while. The Radiance source hasn't been build-able for Windows these last couple weeks anyhow. The good news is, the Windows issues were fixed as of this commit, yesterday:\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/e5017d45dddb919079d5ced7a914f463f8a86f2a\n\n?and so you could use CMake/MSVC with this vintage of the source code to make your own Windows binaries:\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/e5017d45dddb919079d5ced7a914f463f8a86f2a\n\nI'm gonna do a couple tests this morning and then make a new set of packages for all platforms, including Windows, so there's always that option. I'll post something here once they're all available.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 4/23/15, 11:51 PM, \"????\" <503271081 at qq.com<mailto:503271081 at qq.com>> wrote:\n\nHi,erveryone\nWhen I build up radiance using scons ,following errors are shown:\nTypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, function found:\nFile \"/home/zhaoyongqing/Radiance-5.0.a.1/SConstruct\", line 57:\nload_plat.load_plat(env, ARGUMENTS, platform=None)\nFile \"/home/zhaoyongqing/Radiance-5.0.a.1/build_utils/load_plat.py\", line 78:\nread_plat(env, args, pfn)\nFile \"/home/zhaoyongqing/Radiance-5.0.a.1/build_utils/load_plat.py\", line 12:\ncfig.read(fn)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/ConfigParser.py\", line 305:\nself._read(fp, filename)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/ConfigParser.py\", line 554:\noptions[name] = '\\n'.join(val)\nwhich is why?My radiance source package version is 5.0.a.1,and phython version is phython2.7.\n\n------------------\nYongqing Zhao\nChangsha Green Building & Energy Saving Technology CO.,LTD\nNO.438,Shaoshan Road,Changsha,Hunan,China\nTelephone:13574805636\nEmail:zhaoyongqing1987 at 126.com<mailto:zhaoyongqing1987 at 126.com>\n503271081 at qq.com<mailto:503271081 at qq.com>\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Build up radiance error", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D15FB16C.18535%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<tencent_0C5640C3267AFABA3701B50E@qq.com>"], "datetime": "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 15:32:23 +0000", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Build up radiance error"}
