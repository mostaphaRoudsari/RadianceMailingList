{"body": "\nHi David,\n\nThe EPW weather file should contain total solar irradiance values in watts/sq.meter.  Radiance also reports values in watts/sq.meter, but only over the visible spectrum.  Therefore, we normally include an \"efficacy\" calculation that converts the EPW's radiometric values into these semi-photometric values.  (It's a bit confusing, but suffice it to say that Radiance's units have a relation to photometric units that employs a predefined efficacy/conversion value of 179 lumens/watt.)\n\nIf you want Radiance to actually give you total solar irradiance, then you should employ the -O1 option of gendaylit and gendaymtx.  This should forgo the usual correction factors.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150426/3b7f80e8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] unit of irradiance using epw as input", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<24DA913E-7FF3-4ACC-B80A-95DCADC368FC@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<CABr=F_hzdi++Ca=jhDa8prfGPYg=PthTn+fiv9rqeA9Gk6t2BA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun, 26 Apr 2015 10:56:18 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] unit of irradiance using epw as input"}
