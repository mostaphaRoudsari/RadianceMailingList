{"body": "\nHi Jasper,\n\nwhy are you using -vth -vh 140 -vv 80 when in your header of the HDR\nimage the view is specified as  -vtv -vh 98.797409 -vv 75.402067 ?\nManipulating the lense type is really dangerous - in that case you\nchange from a perspective view to a hemispherical fish eye view, without\nchanging the image!!\n\nIf I apply evalglare for your image I get 0.17 as DGP (which is still\nvery low, but you have only 2000cd/m2 as maximum value, so this can be\nexpected). Be aware, that DGP accounts only for glare from a high amount\nof daylight and/or spots of extreme luminances (>50000cd/m2), but not\nfor contrasted glare between task (e.g. Monitor) and immediate\nsurroundings for lower adaptation levels. This is subject of current\nresearch (also here at EPFL) and there might be an extension of the DGP\nin future, depending on the outcome of new experiments.\n\nBack to the lens-type:\nIt is extremely important, that the right view type is given to\nevalglare, otherwise ALL calculated values (it doesn't matter if this is\nevalglare or findglare) are wrong. These errors could be huge, more than\n100% for calculating the illuminance out of a 180 degree image.\n\nIf you manipulate an image by pcomb, in general the view is marked as\n\"invalid\" in the header, because with that tool you could manipulate the\nimage in a way, that the original view is not valid any more. This is\nwhy from evalglare version 1.0 on a check on the header was included,\nbecause many people were creating wrong headers without knowing it and\nthen evalglare was calculating wrong values, when the header was invalid.\n\nIn addition for calculating the DGP it is important to have the\nilluminance at camera level. evalglare calculates this value out of the\nimage. But if the image does not cover 180 degree, then the calculated\nvalue for the illuminance is too low. For that reason, the -i option was\nincluded, so you can provide the illuminance to evalglare (when you\nmeasure it with an illuminance sensor).\n\nSo in your case, you should measure the illuminance just besides the lens.\nThen (in case this is the right lens description) you should use\nevalglare -i LUXVALUE -vtv -vh 98.797409 -vv 75.402067 IMAGE_NAME\nor better, if your task is always at the same place:\nevalglare -i LUXVALUE -vtv -vh 98.797409 -vv 75.402067  -T 395 230 .6 -c\nCHECK_FILE_PICTURE IMAGE_NAME\n\ngood luck!\n\nJan\n\n\n\nAm 4/30/15 um 6:04 PM schrieb Jasper Overduin:\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
