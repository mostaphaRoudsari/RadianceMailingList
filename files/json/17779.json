This should keep you from trying to access a negative entry in\nostable. Change lines 182-183:\n\nint  osentry, ntries;\nlong  hval;\n\nto:\n\nunsigned int  osentry, ntries;\nunsigned long  hval;\n\nFor good measure, you might also change line 197:\n\nosentry = (hval + (long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n\nto:\n\nosentry = (hval + (unsigned long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n\nI'd suggest moving this thread over to the radiance-dev list. I'm\ninterested to hear how your large models go.\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 27, 2015 at 2:36 PM, Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.\nSCI. & ENG.] <andrei.kolomenski at nasa.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150427/8edd9c1d/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047C5B84@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>", "sender": "Nathaniel Jones", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAJR73tvq34u2UsDQT_rWNPfOJK6-QtvEBsNN_bP91xF4cWug3w@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<D15C23CC.182F4%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047C19EA@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>", "<D15D0F00.18324%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047C5B84@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>"], "datetime": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 16:01:35 -0400", "email": "nathanieljon at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general]=?utf-8?q?OConv_=26_Rpict_Runtime_Error_=C2=AD?="}
