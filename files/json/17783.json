{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\nI want tosimulate skies during a period very close to sunrise and sunset when the globalhorizontal skylight is between 100 and 1 lux).\n\nI tried touse Daysim and Meteonorm 6.0 to create a weather data file with 1 minuteintervals, but both of them are based on watt and their minimum value is 1 watt.When converting from irradiance to illuminance, it gives me around 140 lux asminimum. (I use ?gendaylit.exe 3 21 12.0 -a 59.7 -o -18.0 -m -15.0 -W 0.0 1.0-O 2? to create a sky with only 1 watt horizontal diffuse irradiance)\n\n\nHowever Ineed to estimate the times that the skylight is less than 100 lux.\n\nI use Genskyto produce automatically the sky file for the times that the sun altitude isclose to horizon (below and above horizon), but it gives me much higher valuesthan I expected. I checked the IES handbook and it says that to estimatediffuse skylight (the Sky ratio method is not accurate for low solar altitude,and I guess that Gensky use the same method).\n\nTherefore, Ireally appreciate if anyone can help me to produce a series of sky with 1minute intervals for the time the sun is very close to horizon (below or abovehorizon)\n\n\nBest,\n\nMajid\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150427/3df51461/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Majid Miri", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<624557036.4989626.1430126094586.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 09:14:54 +0000 (UTC)", "email": "majid_miri at yahoo.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Creating sky files for low solar altitudes"}
