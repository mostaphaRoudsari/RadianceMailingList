{"body": "\nHi Jasper,\n\nI briefly looked at your image - for sure you get a low DGP value if\nyour illuminance at camera (or eye) level is only about 300lux... It is\nnot the matter of the fish eye lens it is a matter of your lighting\ncondition.\nWhen I remember correctly, for the experiments I did for my PhD, the\npeople adjusted the blinds in a way, that they had 2500-3000 lux at the\neye level and they were less than 20% of them dissatisfied. So a value\nof 300 means one order of magnitude less light at the eye level and a\nmuch lower adaptation level.\nSo I definitely understand the low DGP value in that case. The images\nthemselves look reasonable, so I don't think there is a problem in\ncalibration/processing so far (at least not for these low luminance\nlevels-it might be more tricky to calibrate for the high luminance\nvalues when you get stray-light from the multiple lenses).\n\nIf all your images are like that it means you have a very low daylight\ncontribution at the place you measure. I'm not sure if DGP is then the\nright way to measure glare in that case - as I wrote it is made more for\nthe daylight oriented workplace with higher levels and also to take into\naccount very high luminances (e.g. sun or specular reflections of the\nsun). DGP might be modified in future, but these experiments are just\nstarting.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 4/30/15 um 10:41 PM schrieb Jasper Overduin:\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
