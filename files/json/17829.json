{"body": "\nHello,\nI am trying the 3 phase method example of the pipe that Andy made in the presentation. I am doing it using the sensor points method. It went smooth in the (Daylight Matrix, View Matrix, both BSDF.xml files) however there is a problem in the \"pipe transmission matrix\".\nI am not sure when he meant in this line:\nrfluxmtx -n 8 -ab 12 -ad 1000 -lw 1e-4 objects/LP_bottom.rad objects/LP_top.rad materials_glow.rad objects/LP_sides.rad  > results/LP_trans.mtx\nwhether i should give the pipe a glow material or should i give it to the \"top part\" the glow material?\nAnother thing, do I have to insert the whole model.rad or the Light pipe sides should work fine?\nI tried several options:\ngiving the sides a glow material, however when it ran it gave me several errors and a warning\nrfluxmtx: internal - sample behind all sender elements!rcontrib: warning - partial accumulation in final recordrcontrib: fatal - unexpected EOF on input\nI wish I could know why each error appears.\nBut in the end it generates a matrix file but the numbers inside seems irrational as they are all nx10^-5\n\nHowever when I put glow materials to the top of the pipe only it gives me the following warning:\nrcontrib: warning - aiming failure for light source \"ttttttttt.nnn\" t= text n=numbers\nand it seems to be frozen and does not generate any matrix.\nIs there any advice on what should be done to generate a pipe matrix and what materials to use?\nThanks for you assistance,Islam Mashaly.\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150503/1ab95e24/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Islam Mashaly", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB128-W84E6AAC37CB42FAE18D8C3FCD30@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 3 May 2015 22:44:27 +0300", "email": "islam.akm at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Pipe Transmission Matrix in 3 Phase Method"}
