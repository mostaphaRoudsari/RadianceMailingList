{"body": "\nHello,\nI have a question about acrylic materials. i wanna to modelling a\ntrapezoidal shape with acrylic material. I hope Radiance can simulate the\nbehaviour of light direction, such as refraction dan internal reflection.\n\nI have tried to give dielectric material, but failed.\nand then i wanna give a prism material, but in prism materials the shape\nmust be a planar shape. but the shape that i want is trapezoidal.\nthe image of example room with shading acrylic can be downloaded in\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2kswj2ws0x0e6ni/room.jpg?dl=0\n\nthe image of shading acrylic that i want can be downloaded in\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qk2ozpjktc3k1ol/acrylic%20material.jpg?dl=0\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nBest Regars,\n*Christy Vidiyanti*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150505/236cad4b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "christy vidiyanti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CABYweP3JgBM6uB3C2EN6m_nBYCk5BzMVOsWsWQ31rxGKqpgPYA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 5 May 2015 10:31:57 +0700", "email": "christy.vidiyanti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Acrylic Material"}
