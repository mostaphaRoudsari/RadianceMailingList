It just keeps on chugging through the calcs though.\nGreg?\n\nHere is a link to my Radiance-IBL tests with the Debevec scene and some\nof my homegrown HDR's (thanks to Debevec's HDR shop and Greg's\nPhotosphere).\n\nhttp://www.3dfightclubforum.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4328\n\ngood luck\n\nkirk\n\nOn Feb 11, 2005, at 12:38 PM, Tarik Rahman wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Divide by zero with colorpict", "sender": "Kirk Thibault", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<16c21401f644b4eae0f565613b864c65@biomechanicsinc.com>", "refs": ["<1108143490.420ced824e3b0@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Fri Feb 11 20:13:24 2005", "email": "kthibault at biomechanicsinc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Divide by zero with colorpict"}
