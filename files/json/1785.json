See below example from chapter 1 pp 29 & 32 of RWR\n\nFor Pilkington Optifloat Clear 3mm glass the Visible Light Transmission is 89% (http://www.pilkington.com.au/resources/pilkingtonperformancedatasingleglazing.pdf)\n\nThe transmissivity is calculated using:\nicalc /usr/local/lib/ray/src/cal/cal/trans.cal\nTn=0.89\ntn\n$1=0.969269687\n\nTherefore for a glass definition you would use something like:\nmod glass window_glass\n0\n0\n3 0.97 0.97 0.97\n\nBut when you use mkillum (Rwr chapter 1, page 32 with alteration of the transmission value from 0.88 to 0.89 and transmittance from 0.96 to 0.97) the illum uses the visible light transmission value.\nmod glass window_glass\n0\n0\n3 0.97 0.97 0.97\n\nskyfunc brightfunc window_dist\n2 winxmit winxmit.cal\n0\n0\n\nwindow_dist illum window_illum\n1 window_glass\n0\n3 0.89 0.89 0.89\n\nwindow_illum polygon window\n0\n0\n12 ...\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design Curtin University of Technology GPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845 Western Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Terrance McMinn", "datetime": "Mon Oct 17 06:29:45 2005"}
