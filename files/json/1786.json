In contrast, the illum\nprimitive doesn't account for these, which are reintroduced using the\nwinxmit.cal pattern.  This pattern is normalized to 100%\ntransmittance, and must have normal transmittance as a multiplier on\nthe material.\n\nI don't know how to make it clearer than that -- I realize it's a bit\nconfused, but it is correct.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mkillum Questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Oct 17 07:23:19 2005"}
