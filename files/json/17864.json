{"body": "\nHi Zack,\n\nMany thanks for your advices.\n\nRegarding SPOT Pro, it seems that it can work out annual simulation for CFS with BSDF but for grid points we still need to use command-line (as you clarified). Also, we still need to use command-line (radiance) to generate BSDF that will be used with SPOT Pro . Is that right?\n\nAlso, what is the difference between SPOT Pro and Daysim tools in terms of accuracy and flexibility (as both using Radiance engine)?\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 13 May 2015 15:26\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

A new version, SPOT Pro, was just released and is now available for download at the above website.\n\nSPOT Pro provides an interface to Radiance and has the capability to perform annual daylighting simulation using BSDF files to describe Complex Fenestration Systems (CFS) and allowing you to schedule automated and/or manual control of the window treatments.  The SPOT interface allows you to build simpler orthogonal geometry, assign materials and render or simulate throughout the year.  Importing from sketchup can be done behind the scenes and will be available soon.  SPOT also allows for further analysis and optimization and photosensor systems in your daylit space if desired.\nCalculation of vertical illuminance grids, or other directional illuminance points, if needed, are not built into the program but can certainly be calculated behind the scenes of a SPOT model without too much command line interface.\n\nThe software is in a final Beta testing stage where we are testing downloads, installation and operation on different machine types, operating systems, and MS Office versions.  If the trial version downloads, installs, and starts up on your machine - chances are you are good to go.  If not, please report issues to spot at daylightinginnovations.com.\n\nGood timing for your questions - SPOT Pro was just posted and I was just about to send out such an announcement to the list.\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\nOn Tue, May 12, 2015 at 8:40 AM, Ikrima Amaireh <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk>\nwrote:\n\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n808 S.

Try typing:\nximage -e auto window_000.hdr\n\nThis will automatically adjust the exposure of your image upon initially opening the file. It could be that your image does have non-zero values but the exposure is skewed in your viewpoint making it look black with the default exposure value.\n\nOr type\nximage window_000.hdr\nthen hit the ?a? key while ximage is active to view it with automatic exposure\nwhile ximage is active you can also hit the ?=? key and click a point in the image to adjust the exposure according to various points in the image\n\nSent: Wednesday, May 13, 2015 5:01 AM\n\n\nHowever, generated window_000.hdr file does not have light.
