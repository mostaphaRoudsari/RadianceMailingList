Can you copy all the text from when you started to\ncompile alll the way to the end into an email? Just use copy paste rather\nthan attaching screenshot images.\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\nOn Wed, May 13, 2015 at 9:10 AM, zhekong <kongzhewode at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150513/0a6173c8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "<6A7D8C0C-0B25-437B-AC46-EDA351935C78@gmail.com>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+NizehsjneY2PEGNghWG6mqkBRY1BNjRNxX6WM4aozBFiiQ@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<6A7D8C0C-0B25-437B-AC46-EDA351935C78@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 13 May 2015 11:14:17 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question concerning installing Radiance inMac"}
