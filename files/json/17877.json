Can I do them using the radiance (have just installed for Win32) or shall I install the one for Linux?\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 14 May 2015 19:47\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

I am not sure, but I believe Ecotect is providing an interface to Radiance for simulation and maybe has its own sun path and solar shading design tools.\n\n\nI believe good representative BSDF data, or just a good model of the fenestration system itself, would still be very important to get a good calculation of daylight coefficients (which is as challenging of a calculation as illuminance).  Using Radiance based tools is not necessary as there are other Ray-tracing and Radiosity based tools that can do similar calculations.  One convenient thing is that the Radiance based tools use this standard XML BSDF definition now which aligns with the Windows 7 software giving greater access to these definitions.\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n808 S.

You can test this by going to a command prompt and typing:\n\nrtrace.exe -version\n\nYou should see the Radiance version printed. If you get a \"rtrace.exe is not recognized...\" error, then your paths are likely not set up correctly.\n\nHaving said that, I recommend you try out the latest v5.0 release of Radiance. There are some important bug fixes and new features, including 64-bit Windows binaries. We posted new installers just the other day, here:\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 5/14/15, 12:25 PM, \"Ikrima Amaireh\" <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk<mailto:ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk>> wrote:\n\n\n--------\nWARNING: At least one of the links in the message below goes to an .exe file,\nwhich could be malicious.
