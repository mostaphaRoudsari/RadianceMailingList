{"body": "\nWelp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with Windows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with other internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat'). As they say: WTF?\n\n- Rob\n\nP.S. The wildcard does expand correctly with pcompos in a Cygwin shell, so there's that.\n\nP.P.S. You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing Git for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell in Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.\n\nOn 5/15/15, 9:23 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nI'm probably not the one to answer this, as I don't use Windows and haven't seen this error, but did you check to make sure there are files that match \"window1_*.hdr\" in the directory where pcompos is executed?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\nHi Greg,\n\nThanks!\nNow, I will try to solve the problem with pcompos (window1_*.hdr, invalid argument)\n\nC:\\Radiance\\test\\20150505\\vmx\\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1 window1_*.hdr > al\nlwindow1.hdr\nwindow1_*.hdr: Invalid argument\n\nBest wishes!\nUrtza.\n\n\nGreg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> escribi?:\n\nHi Urtza,\n\nYou should not be using the file \"klems_ang.cal\" but something like \"klems_full.cal\" or klems_int.cal.  This is why Nkbins was undefined, and probably at least one reason your simulation is not working.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nFrom:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu<mailto:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu>\n\n\n\n\nHello Christopher,\n\nThank you for your response.\nI think that in the radiance-4.2.2-win32.exe there is not the ximage program. I usually use RadianceIV.exe program from Ecotect.\n\nC:\\Radiance\\test\\20150505\\vmx>ximage window_000.hdr\n\"ximage\" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo,\nprograma o archivo por lotes ejecutable.\n\nHowever, I find klems_full.cal file that it has all information about kbinS and Nkbins.\nNow I have 145 .hdr files. They have light source, but the room walls are black (is it usual?)\n\nIn reference to pcompos, window1_*.hdr is invalid argument. Do you know why?\n\nC:\\Radiance\\test\\20150505\\vmx\\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1 \"window1_*.hdr\" > al\nlwindow1.hdr\nwindow1_*.hdr: Invalid argument\n\nThank you in advance,\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n\n\nChristopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com<mailto:Christopher.Rush at arup.com>> escribi?:\nWhat do you use to view the HDR image? Try typing:\nximage -e auto window_000.hdr\nThis will automatically adjust the exposure of your image upon initially opening the file. It could be that your image does have non-zero values but the exposure is skewed in your viewpoint making it look black with the default exposure value.\nOr type\nximage window_000.hdr\nthen hit the 'a' key while ximage is active to view it with automatic exposure\nwhile ximage is active you can also hit the '=' key and click a point in the image to adjust the exposure according to various points in the image\n\n\nFrom:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu<mailto:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu> [mailto:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu]\nSent: Wednesday, May 13, 2015 5:01 AM\n\n\nHowever, generated window_000.hdr file does not have light. It is a black image, even though, the render generated by rvu of the room it is ok.\nDo you know why does it happen?\n\nThank you!\nKind regards,\nUrtza\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<77C63F56-BEF4-4759-91CE-D379489FA7F1@lmi.net>", "sender": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D17B715C.190DE%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": ["<20150513110053.Horde.1O0-DjLTpl635sCmpflrS55@correu.upc.edu>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236273D0E61@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "<20150513171416.Horde.wtkTeO3pN7y-3Fest7wtdOc@correu.upc.edu>", "<AB56DF57-87BB-4DD5-9D28-41FC3B68E213@lmi.net>", "<20150514115137.Horde.aVsh6bcxDEA4ziFxCAO5722@correu.upc.edu>", "<77C63F56-BEF4-4759-91CE-D379489FA7F1@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "May 13, 2015 8:14:16 AM PDT", "email": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Fwd: rcontrib for rendering - missing required modifier argument"}
