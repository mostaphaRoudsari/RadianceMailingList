The -ps 8 option you specify is\nalso going to aggravate sampling errors in your image.  I also think you\nshould use a larger value for -lr -- 1 is awfully limiting.\n\nIf you want to minimize sampling differences, you can explicitly turn\noff some of the randomness in Radiance with:\n-dj 0 -sj 0\nYou will lose penumbras and soft specular reflections in the process,\nunfortunately.\n\nI agree with Peter that pinterp will speed things up considerably, along\nwith the -af option. (INTERPOLATE=4 is a good starting value).\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: animati", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 9 May 2002 22:02:00 -0700"}
