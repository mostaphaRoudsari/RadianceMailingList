{"body": "\nHi Urtza,\n\nI think you are right to suspect that you need to change the -m option parameter sky_glow to sky_mat with the change in your file.  Otherwise, I think your results in \"south.dmx\" might be missing.  What is the size of this file, and does it contain any data?\n\nIt's also untrustworthy to use binary file times under Windows.  I would remove the \"-faf\" option to rcontrib for that reason.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150521/6d938841/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] fatal - unexpected EOF in header_dctimestep", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1281FBAA-8B79-40DD-B169-27BDAA6E5665@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<20150521160252.Horde.HULG5Etaa2aLg0K-RVpBby1@correu.upc.edu>", "<D1834CA3.199D5%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<20150521172147.Horde.yKlc2bO60LL67QgF7DxG4th@correu.upc.edu>"], "datetime": "Thu, 21 May 2015 17:49:34 +0200", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] fatal - unexpected EOF in header_dctimestep"}
