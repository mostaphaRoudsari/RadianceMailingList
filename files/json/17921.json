{"body": "\nHello Dear Radiance Community,\n\nI'm curious if it is possible to identify a specific geometry primitive identifier name in a .rad file given an .hdr image of the octree that uses this geometry .rad file? I have a .rad geometry file that contains numerous polygons and it would be helpful to be able to identify a specific polygon identifier name by simply clicking on its surface within an .hdr image. This is useful for debugging purposes, where the geometry consists of a large number of geometry primitives.\n\nIf anybody has developed a Radiance utility that performs this task, I would greatly appreciate it you could share it or give some insight into the procedure.\n\nBest Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150527/9bc2e67b/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047E03FC@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 27 May 2015 15:53:32 +0000", "email": "andrei.kolomenski at nasa.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Utility to Identify Geometry IdentifierName"}
