If you are\nusing a flatbed scanner, set the exposure to manual and fix it at a\nsingle value.  If you are using a camera, set it on manual mode and\nuse a constant illumination with the chart in the same position as\nthe swatches in your two photographs.  I often shoot outdoors to\nassure even illumination.\n\nThis is the most likely culprit.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Macbethcal Reflectances", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Oct 18 23:41:36 2005"}
