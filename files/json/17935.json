{"body": "\nDear List,\n\nI'm running into a bit of a frustrating issue, and I am not sure what\nthe cause might be. I am creating a sky model using gendaylit with a\nhigh amount of direct solar component as seen below,\n\nThe issue is that when I render my scene using -ab 1, I can see the\nsolar disc. When I render it with a higher number of ambient bounces,\nsuch as 4, the solar disc is absent from the final visualization. You\ncan see the results here: 1 ambient bounce\n<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab1.png>, 4 ambient bounces\n<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab4.png>. You will notice\nthat in the rendering with 4 ambient bounces, the shadows are still cast\nproperly as if the sun is present.\nI am using a slightly older version of Radiance right now (RADIANCE 4.2a\nlastmod  by  on w015t-001), but I suspect that isn't the root of the\nproblem. This issue also occurs when I use gensky\n<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab4_clsky.png>. I have\nnever seen this kind of behavior before from Radiance. Does anyone have\nthoughts as to what might cause this?\n\nThank you,\nAlstan\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150601/ef594bed/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "J.
