{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\n\n\nI have around 18 luminaire rad files and I want to run rtrace on all of them with the same set of ray inputs( which are in a text file). Since the room geometry will remain the same in each case, my octree will comprise of : room materials, room geometry and luminaire(18 of them, one at a time). So, I want to implement a loop where I can call oconv each time and  pipe the output directly to rtrace without writing the octree to disk.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example in the man page is :  rtrace ?ov scene.oct < samples.inp > radiance.out\n\n\n\nIs it possible to do something like : rtrace samples.inp <scene.oct>radiance.out. ? If yes, is there a specific flag that I should be using for the ray file(samples.inp) ?\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been able to make this work with rpict for images with something like : oconv  radfiles | rpict ?vf viewfile ?ab etc.. | pfilt | ra_ bmp etc, however I couldn?t find a way to create a similar pipe with rtrace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150530/3374c961/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sarith Subramaniam", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000001d09b38$596db420$0c491c60$@psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat, 30 May 2015 20:25:51 -0400", "email": "sarith at psu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Can rtrace be run by directing octree throughstdin ?"}
