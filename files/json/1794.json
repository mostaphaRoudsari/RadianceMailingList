I'm using radiance 3.6 at the moment.\n\nThe strange about it: I sucessfully rendered the scene before, and now,\nafter changing some setting, I get this error. In fact, the geometry\nhad been changed, but not the object that is reported to cause the\nproblem.\n\nI use oconv with -r 4096 -n 12. Is it possible that this problem occurs\nas a result of a low -r oconv resolution?\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
