{"body": "\nWell, if you make sure your luminaire (*.rad) and data (*.dat) files are uniquely named, you can just store everything together in a separate directory and put it in your RAYPATH environment variable as I suggested.  Since the xform command will look in your RAYPATH directories and so will Radiance, you don't need to have them in your current directory at all.  Everything can live somewhere else.  You can even use the \"-l\" option of ies2rad to put files there for you.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150520/803c1821/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Hard-coding .cal and data files", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<9DD3CBB0-F48B-4118-85D2-9381523A5DC5@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<001601d09316$17948f80$46bdae80$@psu.edu>", "<D3734D45-E6AD-46F5-B3C4-2FE90AB68D97@lmi.net>", "<001101d09328$f28ce800$d7a6b800$@psu.edu>"], "datetime": "Wed, 20 May 2015 21:58:24 +0200", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Hard-coding .cal and data files"}
