{"body": "\nRob,\nGetting off-topic, but not sure if it warrants a separate thread... you imply that we can run Radiance commands in the Git for Windows bash shell. Is there an advantage to doing so, in comparison to Cygwin (which I have used in the past)? Both would have the clear advantages of being able to use more powerful scripted commands when compared to the Windows cmd prompt, but Git-bash is more lightweight while Cygwin would be more powerful (for things unrelated to Radiance?)? In both cases install according to normal Windows Radiance installation and adjust paths as necessary in each environment?\n\n-Chris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, May 15, 2015 11:55 AM\n\nWelp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with Windows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with other internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat'). As they say: WTF?\n\n- Rob\n\nP.S. The wildcard does expand correctly with pcompos in a Cygwin shell, so there's that.\n\nP.P.S. You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing Git for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell in Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<D17B715C.190DE%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "sender": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236273E0E2F@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<20150513110053.Horde.1O0-DjLTpl635sCmpflrS55@correu.upc.edu>", "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236273D0E61@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "<20150513171416.Horde.wtkTeO3pN7y-3Fest7wtdOc@correu.upc.edu>", "<AB56DF57-87BB-4DD5-9D28-41FC3B68E213@lmi.net>", "<20150514115137.Horde.aVsh6bcxDEA4ziFxCAO5722@correu.upc.edu>", "<77C63F56-BEF4-4759-91CE-D379489FA7F1@lmi.net>", "<D17B715C.190DE%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Fri, 15 May 2015 17:40:49 +0000", "email": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rcontrib for rendering - missing requiredmodifier argument"}
