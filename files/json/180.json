It works on\nmy version of X11 for OS X, which is the same as yours, as you told me\nhow to install it!  Also, take a look at the rholo program and see if\nyou can figure out how to work it.  This gives you a more flexible way\nto move around your scene than rview.\n\n\nI'm way out of my depth, here, but have you looked at the replmarks\nprogram that comes with Radiance?  I would think Georg would have\nmentioned it in his reply unless he had a reason not to, so maybe it's\nirrelevant.  Anyway, replmarks replaces triangular placeholders with\nRadiance instances or objects, and it shouldn't be too difficult to\nadapt this to work with AutoCAD blocks, though I admit that I'm not sure\nwhat these are.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Too many questions to fit in the subject", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 9 May 2002 22:13:56 -0700"}
