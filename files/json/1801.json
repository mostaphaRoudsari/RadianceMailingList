I always used just plain -I, without +/-, and it worked.\nI am indeed after illuminance.\n\nLet me repeat this:\n- rtrace -defaults: -i- (so illuminance is off, hence luminance)\n- -i/-I is a boolean switch (or are they two independent boolean switches?)\n- I have -I in my rtrace command line. This toggles the default, turning\nit on.\n- with i/I set to on, the origin should be set to the input, no?\n\n\nNo, just -I\n\n\nI think I understand the subtlety of measuring luminance vs. illuminance,\nso the added '1' and the inversed direction doesn't worry me. The\n'toggling' is, though.\n\nThanks for your reply, anyhow.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -oo adds direction to origi", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Mon Oct 24 18:24:11 2005"}
