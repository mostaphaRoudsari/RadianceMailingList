{"body": "\nHello Everyone,\n\nI an architect and am doing a glare analysis and need to accurately simulate different finishes of stainless steel as options.\nI am currently using the following material definition to simulate Stainless Steel w #4 Finish:\n\n# material name:STAINLESS_4\n# material type: reflective\n# comment: stainless_4\n# author: az\nvoid metal stainless_4\n0\n0\n5 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.9 .125\n\nIm looking to simulate the following types of metal using the the appropriate different specular and roughness values, but don't have any way to accurately test the materials my self\nI have had a very hard time finding this information, and do not have the equipment to measure actual samples.\n\n1) Stainless Steel Polished\n2) Stainless Steel #4 finish\n3) Stainless Steel Sandblasted\n4) Zinc\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts what the reflectance/roughness values for these type of materials and finishes may be?  Thanks so much for any help\n\n\nBest,\n-Aaron\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Aaron Zeligs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<22AD1AD01D86F649B7F468A935BDAEF5BC8CBF5596@CCRD007.mail.lan>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 11 May 2015 11:06:02 -0400", "email": "aaron.zeligs at som.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] stainless specular values"}
