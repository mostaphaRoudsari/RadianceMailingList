Perez sky gives the luminance\nvalue at a certain point, but I guess in order to multiply the\ncontribution of a certain section of the sky, I need to integrate the\nluminance values inside that section. Is this correct? Can anyone\npoint me to any reference where this might be explained more? Any\nideas about how to implement this in a script?\nThank you in advance. Best regards,\n\nSantiago\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Santiago Torres", "datetime": "Sun Oct 30 23:23:00 2005"}
