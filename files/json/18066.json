{"body": "\nHi Giuseppe\n\nThanks for reporting this problem. The 1.0 version (I assume it's\n\"1.0alpha\") is a bit old and some issues might have been fixed in more\nrecent updates. Please try to download the latest release from this Dropbox\nlink:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pewocv4df0i2i05/su2rad_2014.0.0.rbz\n\nI am currently migrating my projects to GitHub as Google Code is shutting\ndown project hosting. The source code is already migrated but I still need\nto update my upload scripts and create a new documentation page. I hope to\ncomplete the migration shortly and will disable the old code.google.com\npage to avoid any confusion.\n\nPlease report new issues via the GitHub repository bug tracker:\n\nhttps://github.com/tbleicher/su2rad/issues\n\n(I just noticed that a new issue has been reported there but I never got a\nnotification. Still requires some fine tuning.).\n\nAnyway, I hope your issue is fixed in the 2014 release. If not, let me know\nand I'll review the code.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 11, 2015 at 4:20 AM, Giuseppe De Michele <giudm.87 at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150611/dfb966b8/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] su2rad - assign material to layer", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k1u3umS3YTDwTonD2Y07B6+AwSK2UrUmGwu+_EB_5w1mw@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAOn=hKE+vHqDm+LE7WjVYTEQZN8yO=u8FQcZwxmVeK=EY8ONPw@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 08:36:41 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad - assign material to layer"}
