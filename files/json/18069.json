{"body": "\nHi,\n\nCan someone help me to set the Radiance parameters to eliminate blotching in my images? I am running renderings, DGP and glare simulations for a simple geometry. I have had no issues with the images when I use clear glazing. One of the tests that I am conducting, however, uses translucent glazing with the following parameters:\n\nvoid trans testTrans007 0.478 0.478 0.478 0.000 0.010 0.178 0.635\nI've run radiance with two different parameter sets, the first with\n_av_ is set to 0xScale is set to 2_ab_ is set to 6_dc_ is set to 0.5_aa_ is set to 0.2_ad_ is set to 2048_st_ is set to 0.5yScale is set to 2_ps_ is set to 4_ar_ is set to 64_as_ is set to 2048_ds_ is set to 0.25_pt_ is set to 0.1_dr_ is set to 1_pj_ is set to 0.9_dp_ is set to 256_dt_ is set to 0.25_lr_ is set to 6_dj_ is set to 0.5_lw_ is set to 0.01\nresulting in the image named Blotching001\nThe second case has the following parameters:\n_av_ is set to 0xScale is set to 6_ab_ is set to 6_dc_ is set to 0.75_aa_ is set to 0.1_ad_ is set to 4096_st_ is set to 0.15yScale is set to 6_ps_ is set to 2_ar_ is set to 128_as_ is set to 4096_ds_ is set to 0.05_pt_ is set to 0.05_dr_ is set to 3_pj_ is set to 0.9_dp_ is set to 512_dt_ is set to 0.15_lr_ is set to 8_dj_ is set to 0.7_lw_ is set to 0.005\nresulting in the image named Blotching002. I have also attached an image with no blotching. This case uses glazing with 65% light transmittance.\nAlthough the second case is much better, it is still very bad for hours when the sun is lower in the sky. The two above images are rendered for a clear sky at 18:00 in Germany.\n\nCan someone help?\n\nKind regards,\nOrn Erlendsson\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150612/8264cc96/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Blotching002_6_21_18_IMG_Perspective_0.GIF\nType: image/gif\nSize: 72521 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150612/8264cc96/attachment-0003.gif>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Blotching001_6_21_18_IMG_Perspective_0.GIF\nType: image/gif\nSize: 75280 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150612/8264cc96/attachment-0004.gif>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: NoBlotching_6_21_18_IMG_Perspective_0.GIF\nType: image/gif\nSize: 75210 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150612/8264cc96/attachment-0005.gif>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?B?1nJuIEVybGVuZHNzb24=?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DUB125-W62D679CB82BFB284307C799BBB0@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 12:47:59 +0000", "email": "orn.e at live.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Blotching caused by translucent material"}
