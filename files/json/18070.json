{"body": "\nHi Orn,\n\nIt looks like the specular transmission component is sampled\nstochastically, this happens because you have non-zero roughness in your\ntrans definition. To reduce the blotches in your sun patches you'll need to\ncrank ad, reduce aa and set st to zero. I'd keep lw at roughly 1/ad because\nyou want to heavily sample the window but with so many rays you don't need\nthem to split much further. You could also consider turning off the ambient\ncache by setting -aa 0. This changes the effect from blotches to noise,\nwhich sometimes has a better appearance.\n\nOr you could change roughness from 0.010 to 0. I'm not sure how important\nthe roughness is to you simulation, but I don't expect it'll have much\naffect on your illuminance result. But if you're interested in simulating\nappearance accurately then the roughness is important.\n\nI'd also suggest double checking your trans definition. It has a very low\ntotal transmission (~9%) and is mostly specular.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 12, 2015 at 5:47 AM, ?rn Erlendsson <orn.e at live.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150612/9b50a8c5/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Blotching caused by translucent material", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAOG+Niw8aRgYaUGx96mmixeWOass-LS2XvS7fAinwQAgqEYHBg@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<DUB125-W62D679CB82BFB284307C799BBB0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 10:50:02 -0700", "email": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Blotching caused by translucent material"}
