{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm just trying to understand a few things about using a uniform sky.\n\n1. With a uniform sky, how can I determine the theoretical irradiance or\nilluminance at 0,0,0 looking straight up?  I'm currently testing a\npolygon on the z=0 plane and I get a slight variance in the illumination\nacross that surface, due to slight errors in the calcs I presume.  What\nI need is the theoretical exact value...\n\n2. With a uniform sky, will the position of my test plane matter?  ie.\nIf I translate the plane from the origin +10000 in the Z direction, will\nthe illumination on that plane still be identical?\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Christopher Kings-Lynne", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<421EF87A.7040906@familyhealth.com.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Feb 25 11:07:46 2005", "email": "chriskl at familyhealth.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Questions about uniform sky"}
