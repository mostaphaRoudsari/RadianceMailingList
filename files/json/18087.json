{"body": "\nWell, that was quicker than expected.  Just after sending this e-mail, Sarith wrote again and the problem seems to be resolved.  He had an old version of rcollate that didn't work when stdin was redirected from a file, but the latest works in that mode with -t but not from a file under Windows.  This was easy enough to fix, and the next NREL release should behave properly.  Meanwhile, Windows folks may have to redirect the input when transposing ASCII files with rcollate.\n\nA tempest in a teacup, really....\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150616/846a1090/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Errors while transposing with Rcollate.", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AEDA77D9-C39F-442F-B26B-D8CB3FE1B394@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<002f01d0a7c8$ada1bc20$08e53460$@psu.edu>", "<C0862AE1-5ED8-4F5D-B548-510872CE3249@lmi.net>", "<007001d0a7ef$55f00500$01d00f00$@psu.edu>", "<6729A88C-13CA-4E1A-9351-5E466586420E@lmi.net>", "<4CBA3F4FC743644B878E92A40FD348F9D7608A99@engr2k10node5.engr.psu.edu>", "<2E919FDD-C93C-4874-87EB-0889D63E89DB@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 12:16:08 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Errors while transposing with Rcollate."}
