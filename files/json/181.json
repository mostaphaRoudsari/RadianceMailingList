I appreciate it.  I'd like to follow up with\nsome of you separately, time permitting.\n\nReplmarks look interesting, I will look at the manpage in\nmore detail.  I can see how that truly could be a disaster\nin terms of version tracking, etc, but it's worth a shot.\n\nI must be a glutton for punishment, because now I'm off\non a new tangent -- thinking of installing Linux on the\nPowerBook. (!) I found out about a product called\nYellowDog Linux, which purports to be a no-brainer install\n(triple boot scheme with Mac OS9, OSX and Linux) on the\nPowerBooks.  My thought was that if I'm gonna have to\nultimately learn to manage Radiance installations on Linux\nto have a render farm, why not start sooner than later?\nThe down side is that YellowDog is based on... Red Hat.\nNow I know that some of the Radiance community is\nhaving success with Red Hat (Hi Jack!); could you explain\nwhat the caveats are regarding trying to compile\nRadiance on Red Hat?  It's just a thought right now, I'm\nnot really excited about backing up my young system and\nrepartitioning the whole deal, but supposedly this\nYellowDog Linux really flies, and then I could try out\nPeter's rshow, and...\n\nTime to check on the status of my application for the 36\nhour day!\n\n====================\nRob Guglielmetti <rpg777@earthlink.net>\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri, 10 May 2002 11:07:26 -0400"}
