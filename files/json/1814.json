A lot\nof editors don't bother with it, but most Unix utiliities require a\nfinal EOL (linefeed).  I checked the script, and I think this is the\nmost likely problem.\n\nRegarding more than two layers, the math gets exponentially more\ncomplicated with each layer, so I'm not likely to  add capability in\nthis area any time soon....\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glazing modelling", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Nov  2 19:34:23 2005"}
