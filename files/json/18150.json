{"body": "\nHi Parisa,\n\nwhen we worked on the spectral evaluations back then, we were testing our\nspectral version of Radiance (which is unfortunately based on Radiance 3.8\nand has not been updated since then...). Our idea back then was to check\nwhether there are RGB coefficients that provide reasonable results for\ncalculating spectrally weighted values. With the coefficients as given in\nthe paper you can definitely get an estimation, but there are already\ndeviations from the correct spectral calculations if you only look at the\nlight source spectra themselves. This might even get worse if\ninterreflections significantly contribute to the illumination. This is also\ntrue for illuminances and color, which in fact are nothing else but special\nspectral weighting functions (see therefore Greg's paper \"Picture Perfect\nRGB Rendering Using Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries\" at\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/index.html or Arne's and mine\n\"Color-rendering indices in global illumination methods\" at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.3274623)\n\nSo, if you really need to be sure about your values (as far as this is\npossible within a simulation...), I would always suggest to use spectral\nrendering and use the c(lambda) weighting function (as also stated in the\nconclusion of the paper). Following the proposal by Ruppertsberg&Bloj you\ncan just run several 3-channel runs with a recent version of RADIANCE and\nput them together to you spectral result.\n\nBest,\nDavid\n\n\n\n2015-06-24 19:15 GMT+02:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
