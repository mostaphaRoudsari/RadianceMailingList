{"body": "\nHi Rapha?l,\n\nYour tutorial looks very useful. I am giving an introductory course on\nbuilding simulation this winter term at McGill and I am struggling to find\ngood tutorials for beginners. Maybe we should set up a central place, e.g.\non the Radiance online web site, which points to the various\nRadiance/daylight simulation documents that are out there?\n\nFor those interested, our tutorial on the use of Radiance/Daysim Simulations\nfor Sustainable Design is located under\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/daysim/DaysimTutorial.pdf.\n\nChristoph\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Raphael\nCompagnon\nSent: Friday, February 25, 2005 8:47 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi,\n\nYou may find some information regarding sky models, irradiance and\nilluminance calculations in my RADIANCE tutorial:\nhttp://www.eif.ch/~compag/ref/RADIANCE_tutorial_E.pdf\n\nHope this will be useful for you.\n\nRapha?l\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC3287125DBF77@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Feb 25 15:51:21 2005", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Questions about uniform sky"}
