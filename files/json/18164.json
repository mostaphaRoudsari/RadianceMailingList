{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\nI have two questions regarding the weighting factors (0.265, 0.670, 0.065)\nthat are used in the formula ( I = 0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB) with\nwhich one can convert the spectral irradiance triad to irradiance. My first\nquestion is: where these weighting factor come from? Do they incorporate\nthe spectral sensitivity of the human eye (so called V(?)) in the\nirradiance calculation? My second question is: should the summation of\nthese weighting factors be always equal to 1.\n\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nParisa\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150622/b50eabe0/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "parisa khademagha", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CAPysv6D_mcUiAH8xXWcZkEKrnnd+F-5EB4XLmaZZ86i24tx_2A@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 17:50:48 +0200", "email": "p.khademagha at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Weighting factors used in the irradiancecalculation"}
