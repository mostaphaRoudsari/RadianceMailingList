{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command that you suggested returns the usage options for rcollate in\nwindows. (ie.  Usage: rcollate [-h[io].....)\n\n\n\nEarlier, I had tried feeding the file to rcollate via stdin through using\npipe ( | ) as well as the 'type a.txt' shell command in windows but didn't\nget it work either way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, June 16, 2015 12:04 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nThis seems related to the broken handling of text versus binary files under\nWindows.  Try reading the file from stdin, instead:\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -t < a.txt > d.txt\n\n\n\nIf this works, let me know and I'll see if I can put in a fix.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\n\n\nI am trying to do a transpose with rcollate. My operating system is Windows.\nMy file contains rgb triplets arranged in a (8760columns x 60rows) matrix. I\neither get a \"error loading file into memory\" or an incorrect transpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nI found that I got the same results with a simple ASCII file with tab\nseparated values. My file contains:\n\n\n\n1          2          3          4\n\n5          6          7          8\n\n9          10         11         12\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following commands return \"error loading file into memory\":\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -t a.txt >d.txt\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -oc 3-t a.txt >d.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nI found that the '-t' flag was responsible for the error, so I tried\nexplicitly stating the values for columns and rows as:\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -ir 3 -oc 3 -ir 4 a.txt>d.txt\n\n\n\nThis gave me.\n\n1          2          3\n\n4          5          6\n\n7          8          9\n\n10         11         12\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150616/9e2bc5e7/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Errors while transposing with Rcollate.", "sender": "sarith at psu.edu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<007001d0a7ef$55f00500$01d00f00$@psu.edu>", "refs": ["<002f01d0a7c8$ada1bc20$08e53460$@psu.edu>", "<C0862AE1-5ED8-4F5D-B548-510872CE3249@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "June 15, 2015 5:09:13 PM PDT", "email": "\"Sarith Subramaniam\"", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Errors while transposing with Rcollate."}
