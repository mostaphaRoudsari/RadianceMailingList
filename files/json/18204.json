{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\n\n\n\n\nI am trying to do a transpose with rcollate. My operating system is Windows.\nMy file contains rgb triplets arranged in a (8760columns x 60rows) matrix. I\neither get a \"error loading file into memory\" or an incorrect transpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nI found that I got the same results with a simple ASCII file with tab\nseparated values. My file contains:\n\n\n\n1          2          3          4\n\n5          6          7          8\n\n9          10         11         12\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following commands return \"error loading file into memory\":\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -t a.txt >d.txt\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -oc 3-t a.txt >d.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nI found that the '-t' flag was responsible for the error, so I tried\nexplicitly stating the values for columns and rows as:\n\n\n\nrcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -ir 3 -oc 3 -ir 4 a.txt>d.txt\n\n\n\nThis gave me.\n\n1          2          3\n\n4          5          6\n\n7          8          9\n\n10         11         12\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150615/8cdee2e6/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sarith Subramaniam", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<002f01d0a7c8$ada1bc20$08e53460$@psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 20:09:13 -0400", "email": "sarith at psu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Errors while transposing with Rcollate."}
