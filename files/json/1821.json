I have a situation where I want to analyse typical spill lighting from\ncars on a road.  I will be comparing the spill light and potential glare from\ncar headlights before and after proposed road changes.\n\nThe trouble is that photometric data for car headlights does not appear to be\nas readily available as commercial interior/exterior lighting files are.  The\nonly data I have so far is the sample .rad files for Highbeam and Lowbeam\nlights as used in the road lighting examples in \"Rendering with Radiance\".  As\nI will be doing analysis in Radiance and other packages, I really need IES\nfiles for typical headlights\n\nSo, my question is, does anyone have any photometric data (IES files) for car\nheadlights of any sort?  Or, if not, does anyone have any suggestions for where\nI might be able to find some?  I am primarily concerned with the standard\nheadlights (ie. dipped beam, not high beam).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nRichard\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Richard Clibborn", "datetime": "Mon Nov 14 06:02:11 2005"}
