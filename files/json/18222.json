{"body": "\nHi Maryam,\n\nIt seems that no one has responded to your query, which is unfortunate.  We need a FAQ of some sort for these questions, but don't have one at the moment.\n\nRadiance runs best on some version of Unix, but there is of course an installer for Windows as you noted.  I do not know the current state of Ecotect or whether it is recommended.  There are other interfaces available, such as NREL's OpenStudio and DIVA.  There is a fair amount of information in the mailing archives on both, and they have websites you should find easily enough as well.\n\nBest of luck!\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150603/0452b268/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Question", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BE77C55C-BF58-4C53-83E8-AE8F12B78401@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1105788846.3401716.1433187666794.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 11:06:44 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question"}
