{"body": "\nDear Jiajie,\n\nThere are a number of video tutorials for DIVA (Rhino interface for Radiance/Daysim/E+) here: http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/getting-started/video-tutorials and we are adding more this week on this web site (http://mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/DIVATutorials/index.html).\n\nIn case you interested in exterior glare specifically, you might enjoy this publication by Alstan Jakubiec (http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/abs/10.3141/2449-13).\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 7714, f: 617 253 6152, creinhart at mit.edu<mailto:creinhart at mit.edu>\nSustainable Design Lab<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/> | DIVA<http://www.diva4rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://daysim.ning.com/> | mapdwell<http://www.mapdwell.com/> | umi<http://www.urbanmodeling.net/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEvents  Modeling Urban Sustainability<http://architecture.mit.edu/event/modeling-urban-sustainability-energy-daylight-and-walkability> | DIVA Day 2015 <http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015>\n\n\n\nSent: Wednesday, June 03, 2015 1:30 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHi,\n\nI am a final year college student in London and my final year project is about the exterior lighting simulation of Walkie Talkie building.\nI was asked to use Radiance to do this simulation and I have already installed Radiance in Ubuntu.\nI have a copy of the book Rendering with Radiance but I found the copy I have has a missing part, the 20 pages at the beginning of Chapter 6 Daylight Simulation.\n\nI would be very appreciated if someone could send me a scanned copy of this 20 pages.\nBesides, is there any new tutorials or materials for new learners? I have gone through the two tutorials in Chapter 1 & 2, a lot of code are now outdated but I cannot figure out.\n\nRegards,\nJiajie\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150603/81ca7a7a/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Exterior Daylight Simulation", "sender": "jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80D4F447C9@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>", "refs": ["<000c01d09e22$fb137f20$f13a7d60$@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 17:57:01 +0000", "email": "Jonathan Zhu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Exterior Daylight Simulation"}
