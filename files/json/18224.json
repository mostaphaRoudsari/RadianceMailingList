{"body": "\nHi Jiajie,\n\nI will send you the missing pages in a separate e-mail.\n\nThere is a link to tutorials from the front page of radiance-online:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials\n\nThere are additional links to be found at the old website, which isn't linked to this page for some reason:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framer.html\n\nSome of these are also a little out of date.  The man pages can sometimes help in determining the problem:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/whatis.html\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150603/50588211/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Exterior Daylight Simulation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<91058E8D-3737-4A57-B451-CFA7EAF11703@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<000c01d09e22$fb137f20$f13a7d60$@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 10:51:40 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Exterior Daylight Simulation"}
