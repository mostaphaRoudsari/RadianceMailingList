{"body": "\nHi Mike,\n\nUnless you're really, really careful, the communication with the FPGA\nwill kill any savings you make in the ray tracing times on a hardware\nimplementation.  This has been found time and again for the past\ndecades by the numerous people who have written or attempted\nray-tracing on hardware.  The literature is extensive in this area, and\nI suggest you start with one of the textbooks on parallel rendering\nalgorithms, such as:\n\nPractical Parallel Rendering\nby  Alan Chalmers (Editor), Timothy Davis (Editor), Erik Reinhard\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568811799/\nqid=1109613036/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-1366464-7333544?v=glance&s=books\n\nRegarding oconv, you might have better luck converting some larger\nmodels into a Radiance mesh, which uses less memory to represent\ntriangular tesselations.  Most CAD software these days spits out\nhundreds of thousands of polygons, even when they aren't needed, such\nas for large, flat surfaces.  Using Alias/Wavefront .OBJ as your export\nformat, obj2mesh can convert these models much more efficiently into\nRadiance.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Hardware accelerated radiance", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<c0427d7585d139e4c72e5a3353d48013@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<200502261059.j1QAxoG3097920@server.cityscape3d.com>", "<4222FF57.6030001@cityscape3d.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb 28 18:53:45 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Hardware accelerated radiance"}
