{"body": "\nDear all,\nActually, I am a new user of Radiance, so I have very basic questions regarding this software.?\nFirst, I wanted to know whether it can be installed and used on Windows operating systems or it should be used only on Mac.?\nAlso, the older versions of Radiance can be used as a plugin in Autodesk Ecotect. So I wanted to know whether using Radiance with Ecotect would give the same accurate results as using Radiance itself.\nRegards,Maryam\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150601/f51fc8fd/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Maryam Hamidpour", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1105788846.3401716.1433187666794.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 19:41:06 +0000 (UTC)", "email": "ma_hamidpour at yahoo.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question"}
