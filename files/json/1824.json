{"body": "\nHi there\nWhen composing a cube map on HDRShop I find that the walls don't line up\nproperly when mapped onto a 6 polygon room, e.g. east wall doens't line up\nquite right with north wall. Does anyone know what the best procedure for this\narea is (i.e. views and cam params). I've already tried using the light probe\n(angular map) with vh and vv = 10 degrees and am just experimenting trying to\nmake a cube vertical cross map using the same close up shot of the mirror ball\nin HDR shop.\n\nThanks for any help\nTarik\n\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Tarik Rahman", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1109614388.42235f3430feb@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Feb 28 19:13:16 2005", "email": "tarik.rahman at ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Cube vertical cross light maps"}
