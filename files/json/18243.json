{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nit should be possible to automate a viewpoint as \"view from the sun\nposition\" in order to generate a sequence of images over a day, for example.\nSadly, I was unable to find anything on the net or in Rendering with\nRadiance to this end. Does anyone know a good source - I would want to avoid\nhaving to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\nBest\n\nAchim\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150703/c8340dd6/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Achim Geissler", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<!&!LgAAAAAAAACXExkV/97zTZ3qht7yveTEAQAPQwmnWWepRKHjwZRpeWaYANRxfc5TAABGAAAAAAAAAJcTGRX/3vNNneqG3vK95MQHAA9DCadZZ6lEoePBlGl5ZpgA1HF9zlMAAIXA1vXvmalJuwzo5mxqYyYAAADa+/QAAAAAAAAQAAAA2lMvDIUmC0KUQFjH1+lQkRcAAABWaWV3IGZyb20gc3VuIHBvc2l0aW9uAA==@intergga.ch>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 3 Jul 2015 10:26:33 +0200", "email": "achim.geissler at intergga.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] View from sun position"}
