I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find\nfunction file \"rayinit.cal.\" I searched through the mailing list\narchives and found a few items on the placement of library files and\nsetting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I\nhave my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make sure\nthat rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables are\nexporting properly as I can see the paths when I \"echo $PATH\" and \"echo\n$RAYPATH,\" however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for some\nreason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nDave Maino\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problems", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
