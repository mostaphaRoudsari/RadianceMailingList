This command\nmakes it extremely easy to create terrain meshes, and I'm working on a\nproject that is located in a valley so I thought it'd be nice to be able\nto model the valley since the mountains provide some considerable\nshading in the morning and afternoons.  But of course now my octree\nbounding box is quite large, which leads me to this ditty from the\nrtrace manpage, regarding the -ar parameter:\n\n*\"*The maximum  ambient  value  density  is the scene size times the ambient accuracy\n(see the /-aa/ option below)  divided  by  the ambient  resolution.\"\n\nBy having such an expansive outdoor geometry, am I forcing a very high\n-ar in order to get good data from rtraces in an interior space, or if I\nuse enough -ab will this not matter?  A test render looked very flat\ntoo; I thought it was the mellow settings I used for the test render,\nbut now I'm concerned that without -ar's in the thousands (!), my\nrenderings will always look very flat.\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sat Nov 19 00:21:03 2005"}
