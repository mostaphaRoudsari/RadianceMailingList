{"body": "\nDear experts,\n\nI would like to calculate a Daylight Autonomy by annual data of Three-Phase\nMethod.?\n\nFollowing the tutorial of McNeil for annual results of illuminance by/\n//dctimestep/ command, RGB conversion is not used. I suppose that it is\nbecause it takes a lot of time. If I use RGB conversion as follow:\n\ndctimestep results/photocellsSouthWest.vmx\ndata/JK_ClearGlass_T70_emis2_0.077_VBlinds.xml results/southwest.dmx\nskies/Geneva.smx | rcalc -e \"$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)\" >\nresults/illum_vb20-smxklemsSW.dat\n\nwill I have problems? I would like to manage with sensorpoints x 8760 file.\n\nThank you in advance.\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n\n?\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150713/8c225029/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20150713123209.Horde.0WMub0YxTTSsrmWXhLL_fLR@correu.upc.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 13 Jul 2015 12:32:09 +0200", "email": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dctimestep_Annual results with a sky matrix"}
