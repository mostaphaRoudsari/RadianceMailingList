{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI?m trying to find the best way to model a perforated aluminium panel and struggling with antimatter materials and such like. Could someone please advise how to do this without ending up with a massive number of surfaces? I haven?t found many examples of how to use the antimatter material apart from the glass lotus in Rendering with Radiance.\n\nMy initial assumption was that the panel should be made with genbox then an array of antimatter holes should be added using cylinders of antimatter material, slightly longer than the thickness of the panel. Would it also be possible to genbox the panel then insert tubes into it or would the face of the panel still be present?\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn Ford.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Ford", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C0116EE6-B53E-4596-AC13-5D0AAED962DF@relume.com.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 13:35:44 +1000", "email": "john at relume.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modelling perforated materials"}
