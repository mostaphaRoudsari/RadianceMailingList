{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nHow big are the holes relative to the thickness of the material?  What percentage of \"holiness\" does the surface possess, on average?  Are the wholes aligned in a grid or a hexagonal pattern?  Are you going to be in a rendering position where you actually see the holes, or do you just want the correct average behavior with a minimum of noise?\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modelling perforated materials", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<433BE549-68E1-41FC-876C-D157A31E15BE@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<C0116EE6-B53E-4596-AC13-5D0AAED962DF@relume.com.au>"], "datetime": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 20:51:58 -0700", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modelling perforated materials"}
