Interpolation still takes place when surfaces are farther\napart.  To turn off interpolation altogether, you'd have to set -aa\n0, which is another (somewhat more drastic) approach to the scaling\nproblem.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] -ar and large scenes", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Nov 19 01:08:27 2005"}
