{"body": "\nHi\n\nSorry for replying late. I didn't have time for email yesterday.\n\n1) Perhaps your use of the \"glow\" material for the environment box stops\nthe direct calculation from reaching the light source? Can you post the\ndefinition of your light source? I know a combination of HDR mapped to a\nsky dome and other light sources can be done but I'm not sure if this works\nwith a box, too.\n\n2a) You can render the image of the environment map on the reflecting\nsphere separately from the main scene and then just combine the two images.\nYou won't have the lighting pattern on the mirrored object, though. Perhaps\nthere is a way to capture the lighting pattern with a lambertian material\nand multiply the values from both images? You'd have to make sure that your\nenvironment texture captures accurate lighting data.\n\n2b) Instead of reflecting a texture in the mirror ball you could just apply\nthe texture directly to the mirror. What real-world physical effect do you\nwant to simulate?\n\nOn Tue, Jul 21, 2015 at 12:24 PM, Minjung Kim <mkim85 at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150722/03cb2850/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering with environment maps", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAKGV-k2016ZMagY4tS59jvLeLJecyipZRnNY5Ai63fy0TTQTbA@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<CAKDBSuC2=+_ddOb4x-86pdBw0QKmjpEi2a5msjk29fNveAmAOQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAKGV-k3DXcoRu5vgAAx37qJ7kwiZm6jzB0=6fTSbdH60Bya5YQ@mail.gmail.com>", "<CAKDBSuAM954=_NM4fVimJLcEJG2Z82VPpaHgrOs23XhNM-jq-A@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 08:43:27 -0500", "email": "tbleicher at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rendering with environment maps"}
