{"body": "\nIkrima,\n\nGlad to hear you are up and running!\n\nI agree with Randolph, the RwR textbook is really important grounding in\nthe basics of Radiance. On the other hand, the newer tutorials written by\nAndy McNeil and the Radiance cookbooks by Axel Jacobs (the latter of which\nare still available, not to be confused with his original 3-phase\ntutorial) will get you up and running on the BSDF stuff which it sounds\nlike you are anxious to get rolling with. They do assume some familiarity\nwith the basics, which may trip you up in the beginning, however.\n\nGood luck!\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 7/16/15, 11:44 AM, \"Randolph M.
