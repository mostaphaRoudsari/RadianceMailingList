{"body": "\nLet's say I want to make a BSDF for a venetian blind, that I could attach to a polygon that is *not* a window, but rather a proxy surface (because I do).\n\ngenBSDF still needs a uniform polygon to sample from, right? But I want this polygon to be completely invisible to the simulation, it's just representing an area from which to sample. Could I use antimatter in this case? In other words my input geometry would just be the blind slats (all in the -z), with a single polygon to represent the interface, which would serve as the area for the sampling origins as well. It is this polygon that would be made of antimatter. The point is to make a BSDF that just represents the scatter of light passing through the blinds. It seems that in all the examples I see out there, the input geometry describes an entire window system, with glazing and frames and everything. My goal is to make a general BSDF for the blinds only, which could be inserted into any model (either as a BSDF material, or as a T matrix), applying it to a proxy polygon just inboard of the window/IGU.\n\nHelp.\n\nRob.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D1C5510A.1AEFA%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 16:37:58 +0000", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] genBSDF with blinds only?"}
