{"body": "\nOK so it sounds like you first tried the Windows installer (presumably a\nNREL-provided one such as this:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0.a.3/radiance-5.0.a-w\nin64.exe), and this most likely worked fine, you just had some issues\nactually *doing* anything with it. This is normal. =)\n\nI recommend you install Git for windows (https://msysgit.github.io/), as\nthat will add a little BASH emulator in your Windows system. This way you\ncan run most of the commands exactly as they appear in most of the\ntutorials out there that are written from a UNIX perspective (as you point\nout). If you run the \"Git BASH shell\" you will be able to try out all the\nmulti-phase methods, use and generate BSDFs, etc. Once you have Git for\nWindows installed, head over to Andy McNeil's tutorials for 3- and\n5-phase, fire up the Git BASH shell (it'll be in the Git program group in\nthe Windows start menu), and get started!\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that when running any commands that\nread/write data (e.g. rcontrib), be sure to use ASCII format rather than\nfloat. Windows has issues with float data (among many other things).\n\nGood luck!\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 7/10/15, 8:08 AM, \"Ikrima Amaireh\" <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D1C542EA.1AE88%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 15:52:23 +0000", "email": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 137, Issue 8"}
