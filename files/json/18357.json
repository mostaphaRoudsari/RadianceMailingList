{"body": "\nDear Radiance Community,\n\nWhat makes a Radiance release \"official\"?\n\nLooking at the Radiance Github site (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases), I see that version 4.2.2 is the latest \"official\" release, whereas 5.0.a.1, 5.0.a.2 and 5.0.a.3 are pre-release versions.\n\nWhat makes a Radiance release \"official\"? Is there a validation procedure carried out? If so, who is in charge of this and what are some of the test cases used for validation?\n\nThank you in advance,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150707/1c4312c9/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047F0A40@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 20:34:59 +0000", "email": "andrei.kolomenski at nasa.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance \"Official\" Release"}
