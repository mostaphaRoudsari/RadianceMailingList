{"body": "\nDear experts,\n\nI am trying to learn three-Phase Method for Simulating Complex\nFenestration.\n\nI have two questions of Sky Vector and Klems divisions of Daylight Matrix:\n\n1) Sky Vector:\nI am trying with Overcast Sky. I have done as following for Windows (I have\nUbuntu 14 now, but, I am checking the first steps done by Windows):\n\ngensky 12 21 15 -c -B 0.55866 | perl c:/radiance/bin/genskyvec.pl -m 4 -c 1\n1 1 > review/skies/12_21_15.skv\n\n(I do not know if is good) So, I am sure that for each time during the year\nit generates the same Sky Vector. However, I think that the \"genskyvec\"\ncalculation divided the sky in different parts in contrast with \"gensky\"\ncommand that generate void brightfunc material. Therefore,?the skyvector\ndoes launch different values for each sky division? If I rotated my model I\nget different illuminance date for only Sky Vector variable?\n\n2)?Klems divisions of Daylight Matrix:\nWhen there is a definition of \"kbin(Nx,Ny,Nz,Ux,Uy,Uz)\", is it because for\neach orientation there are some different values? I suppose that for each\norientation it uses the same divisions.\n\nExcuse me, but, I am trying with a rotated model and I want to ensure that\nI understand well the method. Sorry for the inconvenience.?Thank you in\nadvance.\nYour faithfully,\nUrtza.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150703/237c5c2d/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20150703114408.Horde.Vfppc_0JoTKRKMl7Os3ii_w@correu.upc.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 03 Jul 2015 11:44:08 +0200", "email": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method _ Sky Vector - Daylight Matrix"}
