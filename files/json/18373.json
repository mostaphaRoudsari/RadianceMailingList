{"body": "\nWithout knowing your scene configuration (sky type, windows, size of space, etc.), this is normal based on random sampling of rays traced if your calculation parameters are not detailed enough for your scene. Try adding -ad 3000 into your command after -ab 3 and see if that improves your problem. You should also read the manual page, search old forum posts, and/or read the Rendering with Radiance book regarding rtrace parameters ab, ad, as, ar which would affect accuracy of ambient inter-reflection calculations, and can improve consistency by reducing random sampling errors.\n\n\nThe question is: the results of rtrace is different for several running. i run that command for several times, but the result always different. Anybody know what happens?\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150701/404fdb1f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtrace result", "sender": "christy.vidiyanti at gmail.com", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF6199823627422DF8@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<CABYweP0Sn2yaN8RY7N2EmBut4hN=4Ot9T-RRX3auaVAgWvjMgA@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 14:00:43 +0000", "email": "christy vidiyanti", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rtrace result"}
