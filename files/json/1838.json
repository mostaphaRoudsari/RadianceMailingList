You should probably try to take a\nlook at the geometry and see if there is any extra/duplicate geomery.\nDoubled up geomery can oftern be a cause for a set overflow like this.\nYou should be able to control a lot with -r.\n\nGuilio's suggestion is also an excellent one. I have found that I can\ndeal with much more complex geometry sets with obj2mesh. And it looks\nlike the file size of the rtm is typically smaller than a corresponding\noct file.\n\n-Jack\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] set overflow", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon Nov 21 18:27:58 2005"}
