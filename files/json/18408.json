{"body": "\nFellow building simulationists,\n\nA new version of the Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool daylighting and\nlighting design software, SPOT Pro v 4.74, is now available!  Visit\nSPOT home <http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>\n\n\nto learn more about it and download the software.\n\nSPOT Pro is a Windows-based stand-alone lighting and daylighting design\ninterface to a powerful Radiance ray-tracing engine that sits, accessible,\nbehind the scenes.  SPOT Pro has a number of unique simulation capabilities:\n\n- *Optical daylighting system annual simulation* - SPOT uses \"system\nBSDF\" files to describe these optical or complex fenestration systems and\nperform annual simulation.\n- *Shade control simulation* - both automated/photosensor-based control\nand a range of manual shade control algorithms are available\n- *Annual metric reports* - compare various daylighting metrics with\nstandard daylighting reports for LEED (v4, 2009, v2.1), CHPS and\na SPOT performance report.\n- *\"Design Day\" calculations* - results showing average \"design day\"\nconditions (calibrated to climate data) rather than a specific weather\ncondition in an hourly weather file.\n- *Simulation of photosensor systems and electric lighting* - SPOT simulates\nthe actual photosensor system response, lets you refine the control system\nsettings, and provides an annual simulation of the interaction between\nelectric lighting and daylighting.  For those aiming for truly accurate\nsimulation of the interaction between daylighting and electric lighting,\nthis may be the *only tool* that does not use workplane illuminance (an\naverage or a point) as a proxy for the photosensor signals, and that\naccounts for the interaction of electric light feedback on common\nclosed-loop control systems.\n- *Output to DOE-2 and EnergyPlus* - After optimization and simulation\nof the photosensor system, SPOT provides annual LPD multiplier schedule\noutput files for both DOE-2 and EnergyPlus.  Direct output to HAP coming\nsoon....\n- *Internal Geometry Modeler* - The internal modeling tools are fairly\nrobust, with blocks, sloped ceilings, monitors, and sawtooth geometries\navailable, yet still easy and quick to use with no CAD experience\nnecessary.  Sketchup models can be imported into the software behind the\nscenes.\n- *Material Database and Editor * - New material database allows colors,\npatterns, glass, metals, and BSDF files to be assigned to your model's\nsurfaces.\n- *Improved Renderings -* The use of materials and patterns greatly\nimprove the quality of the perspective and sectional renderings.\n\nThe software is in its final weeks of beta testing with the official v5.0\nrelease coming at the end of August, 2015.  Commercial licenses bought\nduring this final beta stage are 1/2 off and will be valid for all SPOTPro\nv5.X releases (at least a 3 year cycle).  Reduced price educational\nlicenses are also available.\n\nThe SPOT user manual\n<http://www.manula.com/manuals/zrogers/spot-pro-v-5/1/en/topic/1-0-introduction>\n\nprovides detailed information about the software including screen shots of\nthe various aspects of the program and this SPOT webinar\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecBFe83HRSY> provides a good introduction\nto the software.\n\nThe next SPOT training webinars will be held at the Radiance workshop in\nPhiladelphia on August 18, 2015 (register at the workshop website\n<http://www.cvent.com/events/14th-annual-international-radiance-workshop/event-summary-9869b51ebebe45ad8cb25fdf2e31fd89.aspx>\n\n)  followed by a Performance.Network webinar on Sept 4, 2015 (register at\nperformance.network <http://www.performance.network/>\n\n).  E-mail spot at daylightinginnovations.com if you are interested in joining\nor scheduling a future SPOT webinar.\n\nHappy Simulating!\n\n[image: Inline image 3]\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n808 S.
