{"body": "\nDear Robert,\n\nThanks for making clear that using rcontrib and using 3/5 phase methods need a recent version of radiance. does that apply to using 2-phse (Daysim) or one can still use old versions of radiance (as I have a problem yet with installing recent versions of radiance and link it with Daysim tool)?\n\nMany thanks for you in advance:\n\nRegards,,,\nikriam\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 2\nTo: \"radiance-general at radiance-online.org\"\n<radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nThere is a daysim-specific mailing list that may be useful for some of your questions:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/subscribe/radiance-d\naysim\n\n\nI can tell you that if you're planning to use rcontrib and do 3- or 5-phase type stuff, you definitely should be using a recent version of Radiance. Either build from latest source, or use one of the NREL pre-built packages (I recommend v5):\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3\n\n\n\n\nOn 8/10/15, 9:14 AM, \"Ikrima Amaireh\" <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 138, Issue 15\n*************************************************\n\n\n\n\nThis message and any attachment are intended solely for the addressee\nand may contain confidential information.
