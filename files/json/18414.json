{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI have changed my lens to one with 180 circular view to do a contrast\nanalysis (hdrscope) and meanwhile the glare analysis in evalglare. If i use\nthe commands in evalglare getinfo i get the (HDR composed with photosphere\non a mac, calibrated with luminance pistol) i get a value for the lens -vv\nand -vh which is not over 100, with a lens of 180. I can imagine that the\nphoto ratio and the lens are not the same and that causes this problem. But\nwhen I enter the external measured Ev, the value the dgp goes somehow to\nzero. The fact that the gdp is zero with a maximum luminance of 5600 cd/m2\nand Ev of 2500 lux makes me a bit suspicious. How accurate is the result of\nthe dgp without external vertical lux? is it possible to use this value?\n\nhdr files and printscreens of evalglare\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/ei1y4d2v6hapdsr/AACgVMPd1o0EdK-0q8CFvUGga?dl=0\n\nGreetings Jasper\n\n\n\n*Jasper Overduin*\nMSc.
