{"body": "\nHi Richard,\n\nAs long as you are not relying on textures that derive from images of\nany kind, there is no inherent limitation in the precision of the\nlighting calculations in Radiance -- everything is carried out in\ndouble-precision floating point.  However, the accuracy of any Monte\nCarlo calculation is going to depend on a lot of different factors,\nsuch as number of samples and so on, and if you don't pass the output\nto pfilt to filter the result, you are likely to have samples with\noccassional large discrepancies to their neighboring pixels.\n\nAvoiding these variances requires turning off Monte Carlo sampling as\nmuch as possible, which probably requires no diffuse interreflection\nand only purely specular (polished) or diffuse surfaces.  I can give\nyou hints on how to do this if that is what you are after.\n\nTo get out a floating-point image without going into the 32-bit/pixel\nRGBE representation, you can use rtrace instead of rpict, like so:\n\n% vwrays -vf view.vf -x 1024 -y 1024 -ff | rtrace -ff -h [options]\noctree > picture.flt\n\nThis will produce a raw floating-point image with 96-bits/pixel (RGB\nfloats in scanline order).  The size of the image can be determined by\nrunning \"vwrays -vf view.xf -x 1024 -y 1024 -d\" as it won't be\n1024x1024 unless you give it a square view, as vwrays produces square\npixels by default.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] .pic precision", "sender": "Gregory J.
