{"body": "\nHi Jan,\n\nApologies for the -1 comment -- I didn't know it did anything special\nbeyond only returning DGP.\n\nAs for the version of evalglare, I was using v1.10 -- Doh! I installed\nDaysim last week to get the source for Linux, and it put an old version\nin my path. The 0 result issue doesn't happen with version 1.11.\nProbably the Daysim installer should be updated at some point.\n\ncorresponds to your lens. If your real lens is a hemispherical fish\neye and you provide  -vta as view string, the angles and solid\nangles are calculated wrong in evalglare and you get wrong results.\nSo make sure that you use -vta only if your lens is a angular fish eye./\n\nI can also second this. I ended up with an equi-solid fisheye lens, and\nthere is no small amount of effort converting the images into a -vta\ntype for Radiance use.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\nOn 8/12/2015 5:39 PM, Jan Wienold wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150812/44008c7a/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] help pfilt and low values dgp", "sender": "J.
