{"body": "\nDear Ikrima,\n\nDaysim comes with its own special version of the Radiance binaries that\ncan be downloaded at the Daysim website <http://daysim.ning.com/>. These\nget stored in c:\\DAYSIM\\bin\\ after installation on Windows.\nUnfortunately the binaries are based on an older Radiance version, so\nyou miss some options like using BSDF data. Still, Daysim is perfectly\nserviceable for most cases. I hope I understood your question.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\nOn 8/11/2015 11:09 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150811/db767220/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcontrib with 2-phase method?", "sender": "J.
