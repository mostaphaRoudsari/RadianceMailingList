That would explain why the \"jaggies\" are also visible on the\nleft edge of the mirror, where no photons reside. What worries me more is\nthat the\nlighting levels are too high.\n\nThe code has changed substantially in the course of this year, so it's\nhard to pinpoint the root cause offhand. I'll try reproducing this with a\n\"point\" source to check what's up. Failing that, could you send me the LED\ndefinition with IES file for testing?\n\nThanks & best regards,\n\n--Roland\n\n\n--\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSenior Research Associate\n\nLucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts\nSchool of Engineering and Architecture\nCC Envelopes and Solar Energy (EASE)\nwww.hslu.ch/ccease\n\nT direct: +41 41 349 36 26 (New)\nroland.schregle at hslu.ch\n\nTechnikumstrasse 21, CH-6048 Horw (Correspondence)\nEbenaustrasse 20, CH-6048 Horw (Office)\nT +41 41 349 33 11, F +41 41 349 39 60\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<150040962728120956200@conserver>", "sender": "Schregle Roland HSLU T&A", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<op.x266beqdgbjfop@radiance>", "refs": ["<150040962728120956200@conserver>"], "datetime": "Tue, 11 Aug 2015 11:36:40 +0200", "email": "roland.schregle at hslu.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Integrated photon mapping and materialroughness"}
