{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to calculate an irradiance map on the ground level in front of a\nconcaved building facade for an instant time at a specific location. Here is\nthe problems that I have:\n\n1.       If I use the glass type material for the building facade with -i\noption in rpict, there will be no facade in the final result. I have checked\nthe manual page that I know it is because of the Boolean calculation will\nignore the transparent surface in the final result. But I do need the facade\nto be seen in the final result, how can I solve it.\n\n2.       I found in the result that if I use the glass type material, no\nmatter how low I set the transmissivity values, there will always no\n'hotspot'/convergent irradiance on the ground level. It seems that the\nprogram just ignore the reflection process on the glass surface.\n\n3.       If I change the facade material to mirror type, I can find an\nobvious 'hotspot' on the ground level as well as the facade in the final\nresult. So I just wonder is it proper to modify the facade material into a\nmirror type if I am only interested in the exterior irradiance map of a\nbuilding. Besides, if mirror type material can be used in my situation, how\ncan I set the RGB reflectance values for mirror? For example, if the facade\nglass has a 40% transmittance, is it equivalent to set RGB values into 0.6\n0.6 0.6 for a mirror material?\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nJiajie\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150810/fb75f69f/attachment.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jiajie Zhu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<003301d0d389$f9c8a180$ed59e480$@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:31:13 +0100", "email": "jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Irradiance map"}
