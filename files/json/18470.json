{"body": "\nIkrima,\n\nStrictly speaking, Radiance always use ray-tracing. Whenever you call\nRPICT, RTRACE or RCONTRIB, there will always be a ray-tracing simulation\nperformed. However, when you want to perform annual simulations, you will\nwant to do as few ray-tracing simulations as possible since they take time.\nRTRACE, for example, is a method used to calculate the illuminance or\nluminance of a point (sensor) in a static scene. Doing this for a whole\nyear would require 8760 or more RTRACE calls, which means 8760 or more\nray-tracing simulations, which is slow.\n\nAccordingly, Daysim (which uses the 2-phase method) runs one ray-tracing\nsimulation that calculates the Daylight Coefficient matrix (this can be\ndone in pure radiance by using RCONTRIB). This matrix relates the sensors\n(workplane?) in the scene with the sky, mich means that you can modify the\nsky and quickly evaluate illuminance in the same points. This allows\nperforming annual simulations fast (only the sky changes in a static annual\nsimulation). 3 and 5 phase method are extensions to this that allow also\nmodifying the CFSs in the scene.\n\nHope that clarify a little bit.\n\nBest,\n\nGerm?n\n\n\n\n2015-08-10 8:51 GMT-03:00 Ikrima Amaireh <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk>:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150810/959f6779/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Ray-tracing with Radiance", "sender": "=?UTF-8?Q?Germ=C3=A1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAF-iH4LVHB_V+Vmy-mSiv2EtUE25KDxtTAyJfao5Mi6fzFDU1g@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<D697763F9F216044A99BC674C0056196135AD102B2@EXCHANGE1.ad.nottingham.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 10:19:18 -0300", "email": "germolinal at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Ray-tracing with Radiance"}
