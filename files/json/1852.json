Most likely, the trouble in your geometry is near\nthis surface.  If it's not overlapping or collapsed geometry, then it\nmight be a disk that's been converted to hundreds of triangles, all\nculminating at a single point, which cannot be resolved by oconv\nbecause there are more than 511 surfaces in an infinitesimal volume.\n\nIf you can identify all the triangles associated with this disk, you\nshould be able to replace it with a single \"ring\" primitive, or if\nthe edges need to match exactly, with a many-sided face primitive.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] set overflow", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Nov 30 00:38:13 2005"}
