{"body": "\nGreg,\n\nThanks for that.  I'm just a little unsure about the orientation of\nthis \"aligned with x-y plane\" in the header .. is this absolute (ie. the\nproject x-y plane) or does it automatically align with the surface it is being\napplied to.  Sorry if this is a stupid question, it's just I have had trouble\nbefore simulating fritting with mixfunc and different surface orientations.\n\nCheer,\nRichard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Richard Clibborn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E1D1IKr-0007Sd-00@noir.ihug.com.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb 16 07:07:07 2005", "email": "furry at ihug.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Angular selectivity of blinds"}
