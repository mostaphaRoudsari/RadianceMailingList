{"body": "\nDoes anyone have any suggestions which would be helpful for modelling blinds\nwhich let different amounts of light through at different angles of incident\nlight, an obvious example of this being a Venetian blind.  The particular case\nI am interested in is a woven wire blind where the light incident normal to the\nblind would be transmitted better than at an angle.\n\nAt the moment, I am modelling using BRTDfunc with a tranmittance value\nappropriate to the light at normal incidence, however I assume this is no\ndifferent really to modelling glass with the same transmittance value.\n\nThanks,\nRichard\nClibborn\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "furry@ihug.com.au", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E1D1HT2-0005fA-00@noir.ihug.com.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb 16 06:11:49 2005", "email": "furry at ihug.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Angular selectivity of blinds"}
