I did not implement calls to\nrpiece with the -N option, only parallel rendering of multiple\nviews.  Running rpiece properly and handling all the border cases,\nrecovery, etc., is a bit complicated.  It would be nice to do in rad,\nbut I haven't put it in there, yet.  Maybe when I have a 4-processor\nmachine, it will seem worth my while.\n\n\nIf you run \"rad -v 0 input.rif\", it will call oconv and mkillum to\ngenerate the octree, without doing any renderings.  You can then pick\nup the job with rpiece at that point.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] multiple processors", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
