If anyone is interested in picking up a copy,\nbe sure to order directly from Elsevier, as it will arrive a couple\nof weeks sooner.  Also, you will pay less by using the coupon on my\nwebsite (and the publisher and therefore the authors will still end\nup making more than if you ordered on Amazon):\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/REINHARD_Flyer.pdf\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  In case you're curious, I wrote the chapters on HDR image\nencoding, capture, and display, and provided some of the material for\nthe color chapter, which Erik Reinhard wrote.  Erik also wrote the\nintro. and chapters 7 & 8 on tone-mapping.  Sumanta Pattanaik wrote\nchapter 6 (also tone-mapping) and Paul Debevec wrote the chapter on\nimage-based lighting.  That and the color chapter are probably my\nfavorites.  (Though I like my chapters too, of course.)\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] High Dynamic Range Imaging: the book", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Dec  1 18:04:05 2005"}
