We'll be comparing floating point values within some delta,\nprobably over large images, and the existing tools should be sufficient\nfor that (pcomb, etc.)  We just need to create a few dozen test scenes,\na Makefile for generating results, and a generic script for comparing\nthem against the official results for each regression.\n\nIt's probably a 2-4 weeks effort to do it right.  It's always a\nquestion of who has the time, I suppose.  We could make assignments,\neach volunteer testing out their favorite aspect of Radiance.
