I generally specify a high number of ambient division\n(usually\naround 3072) and ambient super samples (500-1000) for my renders.\n\nThe first ones are these mysterious dark splotches:\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=4bcbre2.jp\ng&.src=ph\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=c76fre2.jp\ng&.src=ph\n\nI really can't figure out what's causing these. I am unsure if this is\ncaused by poor interpolation. Also, occasionally I have come across the\nfollowing bright spots:\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=e02ere2.jp\ng&.src=ph\n\nNo matter how many ambient divisions that I specify (I went up to 16,000\n\nambient divisions with 2000 ambient super samples),  I can't get rid of\nthese bright spots. The problem with these particular artifacts is that\nI\ncan not predict when it will occur. What I need the most when performing\n\nrenders is predictability. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacob", "datetime": "Mon Dec  5 19:49:44 2005"}
