You wouldn't be performing an overture\ncalculation with different -a* settings (in particular -ab and/or -\nav), would you?  The dark splotches look suspiciously like bad values\nin the ambient file at the start of the calculation.  Is that\npossible?  What are your rendering parameters?  It helps a lot in\ndebugging a problem.  Your floor looks overly bright and even\ncompared to the rest of the surfaces.  How is it defined?  Why aren't\nthere any shadows under the chair legs?  What is your overall scene\nsize (run oconv -d on the octree) and your -ar setting?\n\nThe bright splotches in your last example could be caused by the\nbright, narrow opening surrounding the skylight.  I would probably\ninsert a rectangle flush with the ceiling and use mkillum to compute\nits effective output distribution to eliminate this particular artifact.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] What's causing these artifacts???", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
