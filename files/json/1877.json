{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\nThis looks like a Rights to Light study, yes?  In any case, for the\ndirect sky\nfactor, whack up ad to whatever gives you a converged value - try a few\nin steps of two starting -ad 1024.  Turn interpolation off (-aa 0) and,\nof course,\nuse -ab 1.  If it's RTL, then a uniform sky is used rather than the CIE\novc and\nI seem to recall that the window is an aperture without any glazing.\n\nI really wouldn't bother with a source window for something like this.\n\nIf the grid was orthogonal, I'd be tempted to supply a grid of points to\nrtrace and process the results in my preferred crunching/display\nsoftware.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<400E767A-7A99-11D9-894E-000D93355E26@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb  9 13:52:13 2005", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sky illumination vs. mkillum"}
