{"body": "\nGood point about using the mixpict primitive -- I vaguely remembered\nprogramming something like this, but then didn't see it in the ray.html\nreference manual, so I thought I must have dreamed it.  I guess it's one\nof those things that didn't get updated when it should have because I\nwasn't sure that it was in the LBNL release or not.  Now that it's there\nin 3.4, I went and updated the HTML reference manual, but I know there\nare still a lot of man pages on the website that are in need of\nupdating...  Unfortunately, I don't have any of the tools I onced used\nto convert nroff into HTML and PostScript.  Sigh.  Guess that's\nsomething to do in my \"free\" time.  If something seems inconsistent,\nit's best to rely on what's in ray/man/man1 in the 3.4 distribution.\n\nI just compiled 3.4 for SGI machines, since most systems come without a\ncompiler license these days.  John Mardaljevic also reminded me that\nthere is a problem getting the TIFF library to compile under Solaris.\nThe \"install\" program on some Solaris systems seems to be broken, so the\nTIFF library fails to install properly, and the rest of the programs in\nthe src/px directory don't get installed as a consequence.  This can be\nremedied by manually installing the library from src/px/tiff/libtiff\ninto src/lib, but it's too bad I don't know of a better fix than this.\n\nI'm still planning to compile under Intel Linux, and will probably get\nto that in the next day or two.  If Lars beats me to it and sends me the\nbinaries, so much the better!\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance 3.4 release", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B2D031E0-1508-11D6-B8DE-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 29 Jan 2002 14:36:55 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance 3.4 release"}
