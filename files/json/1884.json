A backtrace isn't much help in this\ncase, I'm afraid, as it is not a problem with the program, but with\nthe system under which it is operating.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward@gmail.com", "datetime": "Mon Dec 12 10:22:40 2005"}
