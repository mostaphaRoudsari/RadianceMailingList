{"body": "\nAny advice on using the plasfunc material type?  I've searched the\nRadiance documentation, digests, etc., and the following was the best I\ncould come up with, but it doesn't seem to work.  Any advice would be\nwelcome.\n\nI think I should be able to define a material like this:\n\nvoid plasfunc myplastic\n2 refl mybrdf.cal\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nand then in a file mybrdf.cal, put an arbitrary definition for the BRDF\nfunction refl, something like this:\n\nrefl(x,y,z,area) = (x*Nx + y*Ny + z*Nz)^10;\n\n(This isn't actually the form of BRDF I'm interested in.)  Then, I\ndefine an object with material myplastic:\n\nmyplastic sphere ball\n0\n0\n4 0 0 .5 .5\n\nWhen I render this, though (with light sources, other objects, etc.\nadded), the sphere just looks Lambertian.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nThanks,\n\nRichard\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Richard Murray", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<0CC69F71-788D-11D9-9EBF-000A9599B040@sas.upenn.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Feb  6 23:19:06 2005", "email": "rfmurray at sas.upenn.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] plasfunc"}
