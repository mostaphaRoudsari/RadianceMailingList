Never did figure out what the problem was but it still works fine under XP.  With most of the binaries now available under windows, you might be able to use them instead.  Unfortunately I don't think the visual binaries are available for some reason.\n\nMark\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051212/5f721435/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark de la Fuent", "datetime": "Mon Dec 12 17:04:48 2005"}
