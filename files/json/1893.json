The tool will basically export a text file from AutoCAD containing xform rotation and transformation commands.\n\nSo far I've been approaching this problem using vectors (one at the fixture origin oriented down and one for the aiming direction based on the coordinate points of the source and target) and using the dot product to find the angles between the vectors. Unfortunately so far this only works for some cases.\n\nIs there a better way to approach this?\n\nThanks for any input.\n\nMark\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051213/49dada59/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "datetime": "Tue Dec 13 21:03:03 2005"}
