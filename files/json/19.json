{"body": "\nI don't know quite how to reply to a thread to get the subject right, so\nI entered this manually and it may end up in the wrong place.  (Help, Peter!)\n\nThe rpict error you are getting is due to a broken qsort() routine that\ninfiltrated the GNU library and keeps resufacing on various versions of\nLinux.  I'm not sure which ones have it and which ones don't, so the\nonly thing I can suggest is recompiling ambient.o using the following switch:\n\n-Dtracktime=0\n\nThis will turn off the ambient sorting optimization, which won't affect\nresults but will eliminate this problem.  The faulty zone in the .rif\nfile is not the problem.\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3B5F3717.2EBA2B59@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 25 Jul 2001 14:16:07 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: rpict error: address not found in avlmemi"}
