When you use the -fff and -omNp options, you\nwill\navoid all recursive ray calls and get a very fast calculation.  The rays\nfor any desired view can be generated with the vwrays command (new\nwith 3.4).  To generate the 10th view in the file \"anim.vf\", you could\nuse:\n\n% sed -n 10p anim.vf > frame10.vf\n% vwrays -ff -vf frame10.vf -pa 0 -x 3072 -y 2304 \\\n| rtrace -x 3072 -y 2304 -fff -omNp anim.oct > frame10.data\n\nSee the vwrays man page for more details and examples.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: animati", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 13 May 2002 10:47:26 -0700"}
