Basically, I recommend reducing\nyour -ds setting even further (to 0.1 or 0.08) in your final rtrace,\nin hopes of reducing the parallax error of the window sampling.  Even\nbetter would be to set -dj 0.9 and give the same point to rtrace many\ntimes, then average the result in a post-process.  This will\neliminate any direct sampling errors, which I suspect are the problem\nin your particular case.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  Very nice analysis and presentation of your results, by the way.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<1266074679.20051216221810@audice.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
