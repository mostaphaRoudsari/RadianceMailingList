This process is 2D image processing, using\nsome 3d\ndata that is 'stored' with the pixel.\nAlso this kind of image data allows us to separate objects in one image,\nto\nprocess them individually in 2D.\n...\n\nWill it work generally ? With specular/reflecting surfaces and shadows ?\nWill 2d processing be validated to have the same trust as Radiance now\nhas ? Maybe you're on the way towards Wavefront, Renderman or whetever\nthere is for professional animations, without actually getting their\nspeed or quality, but loosing a lot of Radiance.\nIMHO, speedups for animations in Radiance will be a side effect when/if\nthe core rendering is enhanced (photon map, direct caching maybe) and\nvalidated. Meanwhile, Greg's recommendation of using brute force and\nsome more CPUs sounds right to me.\n\nOr you may try to render texture maps through Radiance, which are then\nglued onto surfaces and final frame rendering is done by other rendering\nengines (which may have more inter-frame coherence too). At least the\ninterface would be well defined. Your mileage may very.\n\n-Peter\n\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Tue, 14 May 2002 10:01:51 +0200"}
