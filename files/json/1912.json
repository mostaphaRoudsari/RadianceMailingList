You'll have to manually edit\nthe materials file.  I've limited experience of 3D modellers, but\nSketchUp feels just right for the occasional user who needs to work\nup some geometry for Radiance.  And of course, on the Mac it's a\nsingle platform/OS workflow.\n\nmit freundlichem gru?,\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevi", "datetime": "Mon Dec 19 19:46:18 2005"}
