Revit makes very complete, well\ndetailed, and tight models.

So I think\nthe model is complete when I start, it's that stuff is getting lost out\nof 3D Studio upon export. But now that I know how 3ds2mgf behaves, I'm\ngoing to focus on getting my models out of 3D Studio intact first, see\nif that's the issue. If 3D Studio isn't exporting whole models that\noriginated within Revit, that's a large issue that will mess up any\nformat I try to use to get to Radiance.\n\n\nWhen you export out a 3D model from Revit, you can export as solids or a polyface mesh. The second option is better, and is what I'm using. Those meshes wind up as meshes in 3D Studio, I don't know what they wind up as in a 3DS file.\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\nBecause We Can, LLC\n(415) 505-4689\nwww.becausewecan.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance plug-in for 3DS", "tags": [], "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "datetime": "Wed Dec 21 18:46:39 2005"}
