There is an okino\npolytrans plug-in for Max for geometry conversion in/out. Though I do\nunderstand that the main issue is getting the material assignments from\nRevit as well.\n\nAlso here is something that I grabbed off of the following list:\nhttp://www.formz.com/forum/forum_archive/forumC/general/186.html\n\nThere are a number of limitations and features of 3DS format that we\nmust keep in mind. First and most important limitation is the 65535\ntriangle limit on any single object. The 3DS file also has an object\nlimit of 65535 objects.\n\n-Jack\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance plug-in for 3DS", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed Dec 21 19:24:54 2005"}
