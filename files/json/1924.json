{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nOver a year ago, there was quite a bit of talk on the dev list about\nsupporting ambient value sharing through Samba or coming up with some\nworkaround for busted NFS lock managers, but nothing was ever done\nabout it.  People on this list can tell you better than I what versions\nof Linux or NFS you need to look out for.  In general, I think OS X and\nFreeBSD are solid with respect to NFS file locking.  Solaris might be\ngood as well.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<B5C4B063-7530-11D9-8104-000A959DDB22@gmx.net>", "sender": "Gregory J.
