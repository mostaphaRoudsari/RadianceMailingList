Let's say I have a\nscript that performs some numeric analysis of a scene (rtrace) and then\ndoes some renderings as well.  I typically crank up the settings quite a\nbit for rtrace, but relax them a bit for images (usually).  My question\nis, can the rpict process(es) safely use the existing ambient cache left\nover from the high-accuracy rtrace run?  Could running the rtrace at\nlower accuracy settings degrade any of the previously cached values?\nJust curious.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Dec 22 00:16:02 2005"}
