In general, it's safe to run with reduced ambient\nsettings in subsequent renderings when you share an ambient file.\nSpecifically, it's OK to relax the -ad and -as settings, and -aa and -\nar as well.  You can reduce -ab (though -ab 0 won't use the ambient\nfile values at all), but I wouldn't recommend changing -av or -aw.\n(There is no speed advantage to doing so, anyway.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] sharing the ambient cach", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Dec 22 06:50:01 2005"}
