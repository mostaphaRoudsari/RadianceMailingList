Now I am _HAPPY_!\n\nThanks Greg and Carsten for your replies.\nThis morning the first thing I did was trying Greg's command line suggestions,\nI changed the output to ASCII to explore the results, and: this is exactly\nwhat I meant!\nI will work on this as much as time permits me to do, and I will share the\nresults. This might take a while, therefore I will thank you both at this\nmoment very, very much.\nCarsten, also your suggestions where to look in rpict (ray.h) are very\nhelpfull. For this moment I will start with Greg's suggestion. The syntax of\nthe command line is far less complicated as I expected, so this will work for\nnow.\nI changed Greg's line a little, so the output per pixel now is:\nmodifier-name value normal position\n( vwrays -ff -vf view01.vf -pa 0 -x 1000 -y 1000  | rtrace -x 1000 -y 1000\n-fff -omvNp model.oct > test.data ).\n\nThis is where I can start from, I let you know when I have some results (or\nquestions), but for now there is a lot to experiment with.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nIebele\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "datetime": "Wed, 08 May 2002 16:17:23 +0200"}
