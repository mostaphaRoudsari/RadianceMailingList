{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm thinking about setting up automated regression testing for my\nRadiance application.\n\nNow, the problem is for these I wish to make Radiance run\ndeterministically, so that I can run diffs of output against known good\noutput, etc.\n\nIs there a way of doing this?  Do I need to set a bunch of jitter\narguments to 0?\n\nCheers,\n\nChris\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Christopher Kings-Lynne", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4200D1F7.1050301@familyhealth.com.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb  2 14:15:25 2005", "email": "chriskl at familyhealth.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Deterministic calculations with Radiance"}
