For example:\n\nparameter\nfirst pass (overture at 64 or 128 pixels)\nsecond pass (whatever your next resolution is)\n-ad\n1024\n512 (1/2 of first pass)\n-as\n512\n256 (1/2 of first pass)\n-aa\n.15\n.25\n\n\nIn RwR, John does not recommend changing the other ambient parameters.\nHowever, I am intrigued to hear that Greg indicates that it would be ok\nto reduce -ar as well as -ab. It would be interesting to run some test\nand determine what good reduction parameters would be.\n\nNow, we use the parameter reductions mainly for \"pictures.\" I am\ninterested to consider what kind of parameter reductions would work when\nmoving from a tight grained high -ab quantitative simulation to\nsomething that could still use the ambient cache for producing\n\"pictures,\" which is more clearly what Rob is thinking about.\n\n-Jack\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] sharing the ambient cach", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Dec 22 17:23:36 2005"}
