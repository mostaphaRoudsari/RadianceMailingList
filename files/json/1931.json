The only way to reduce the noise is to increase your sampling\ndensity (initial rendering resolution).\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "gregoryjward@gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000b01c51e48$4895e9b0$53000080@pnac>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Mar  1 11:30:05 2005", "email": "\"Gregory J.
