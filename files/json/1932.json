{"body": "\n\nThanks for the advice. :)  I'm pretty sure that the memory capacities of\nFPGAs nowadays would allow me to store everything I need on the device,\nwhich should ensure communications overhead is relatively marginal. Most\nof the work I'm interested in doing with radiance is high-resolution and\nhigh-accuracy (10k renders, with high -ab & -ad)  so I'm hoping that the\ntasks would be computensive enough to give me sufficient performance\ngains as to make it worthwhile. Anyhoo, I'm off to the bookstore...\n\nI'll give it a go. Just for reference, the models I'm using have less\nthan 10k polygons so I'm not sure that that is the problem. (I've had\nproblems in the past with 1k models.)\n\nmike\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Hardware accelerated radiance", "sender": "Michael Kruger", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42245ADF.8050600@cityscape3d.com>", "refs": ["<200503011059.j21AxMVL073336@server.cityscape3d.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar  1 13:08:11 2005", "email": "mike at cityscape3d.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Hardware accelerated radiance"}
