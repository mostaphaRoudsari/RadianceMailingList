Clearly, I\nthought about this more carefully before, and there are good reasons\nfor not changing the -ar parameter in subsequent runs.  I think the\nartifacts you're seeing are due to the mix of new values and older\nones, both of which get included in the interpolation step.  The new\nvalues cover a wider area than the old ones (and wider than they\nshould).  The splotchy look is due to the way the interpolation\nalgorithm works, and is even worse than I'd expect from reducing the -\nab value.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] sharing the ambient cach", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Dec 22 21:03:31 2005"}
