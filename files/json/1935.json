It looks like it uses some Radiance algorithms.\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n\n__________________________________________\n\nAfter more and more research of render engine, I have finally got my hands on a new breed of rendering engine which should worth your time to look at. Maxwell Render - brought the us by the world famous NextLimit Corporation (the maker of RealFlow3, a real physical simulation software for Computational Fluid Dynamics). t is the first physical based rendering engine with a GUI. The approach is almost identical to Radiance, except I am not sure if it produces hard number calculations. One thing for sure, it does produce False-Color images. Please take a look at this,\n\nhttp://www.wahn.demon.co.uk/Maxwell/PhysicalSky/index.html\n\nhttp://www.maxwellrender.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1121&highlight=\n\nfor further description of the renderer, please see the following link.\n\nhttp://www.maxwellrender.com/product.htm\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMing Norman Tsui\n5th-Year Architectural Engineering\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n601 Vairo Blvd, Apt. 113\nState College, PA 16803\n201. 233.7871\n\nmxt906@psu.edu\nming.n.tsui@gmail.com\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 6125 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051223/f9717dc9/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Martin Moeck", "datetime": "Fri Dec 23 18:19:57 2005"}
