{"body": "\nHi\nDoes anyone know why inserting a diffuse object in an IBL scene, such as the\nred_plastic sphere in the Debevec tutorial does not reflect light properly,\ni.e. renders as black? It works sometimes and other times it doesn't, I don't\nunderstand why. The metal spheres such as the gold and steel ones and the\ncrystal  sphere all render perfectly but sometimes (not all the time) any\nobject with plastic material doesn't render properly.\n\nTarik\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Objects with plastic material in IBL scene", "sender": "Tarik Rahman", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1109758393.422591b98151f@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<1109614388.42235f3430feb@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Wed Mar  2 11:13:34 2005", "email": "tarik.rahman at ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Objects with plastic material in IBL scene"}
