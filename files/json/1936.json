I\ninquired with the President of the company a while back, about the\nability of Maxwell to both work with actual photometric files and to\nsupply real illuminance & luminance results. I received vague replies\nabout this.  It's the same old story, us lighting people don't get any\nrespect; we're the Rodney Dangerfields of the computer graphics world.\nA friend of mine who runs a CG news website has been asking similar\nquestions of them and getting similar runaround.  A similar fate\naffected another well-known physically-based rendering tool\n(Lightscape).  Maxwell does look very nice, but so far the promise of\nbeing able to use it for lighting analysis remains a promise, a\npotetially broken one, and I'm an excellent skeptic, even during this\nholiday time. =8-)  That said, I have not looked at their website in a\nwhile or made any inquiries.\n\nThat website link you sent was interesting; the Maxwell engine does\ndefinitely look like it uses similar algorithms as Radiance -- noise and\nall.  Have a look here:\n\nhttp://www.wahn.demon.co.uk/Maxwell/Images/\n\nHe's done a bunch of renderings of the tutorial scenes from RwR.  Very\ninteresting!\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Maxwell-Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri Dec 23 18:47:20 2005"}
