I used the\nsame steps that I used before. The software associated with the flatbed\nscanner has no direct exposure controls, however there is an option (which I\nselect) to do no color correction. This, I believe, prevents the enactment\nof the auto exposure feature. Here are the results (debug.pic) from my\nlatest scan Macbeth color chart scan:\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/MacbethColorChart_12212005002_templ.jpg\n\nAs you can see, many colors were out of gamut however the white and neutrals\nwere able to be calibrated.  After running pcomb with my color swatch, the\nreflectances were still high (0.80 < x < 0.95 on a scale from 0 - 1). Here\nis the paint color swatch before calibration:\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/Behr_White_before.jpg\n\nand after calibration\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/Behr_White_after.jpg\n\n\nI usually take the sample and the center of each. Do you believe that the\noverall reflectances are valid or out of range?\n\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Dec 23 19:45:39 2005"}
