{"body": "\nOn a separate but related note, is there some flag when using obj2rad\nor similar transformation which will instruct the renderer to smooth\nthe face normals for converted mesh objects?\n\nI recall seeing a \"-s\" option somewhere.  The basic idea is, I have\nthis externally modeled object, i convert it to obj, bring it into\nRADIANCE using obj2rad and then xform it into place.  During the\nconversion, the object is made into a mesh and I would like the mesh to\nrender smooth.\n\nThanks,\n\nkirk\n\nOn Mar 2, 2005, at 8:22 AM, Giulio Antonutto wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: text/enriched\nSize: 13141 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050302/81cc66f4/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] illuminate a 3ds with radiance", "sender": "Kirk Thibault", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<b0d0fcf3ee3f3feb12bec5becb33d8dd@biomechanicsinc.com>", "refs": ["<3D77044FDAF3694E995689FC920C53E650EE62@l-gnts05>"], "datetime": "Wed Mar  2 15:12:54 2005", "email": "kthibault at biomechanicsinc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] illuminate a 3ds with radiance"}
