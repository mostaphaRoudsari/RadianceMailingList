{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nthis was discussed here\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001926.html,\nbut if there was an answer that I understand, I missed it.\n\nI am working on the advanced tutorial again.\nCreated a falsecolor picture of the working plane illuminance in a room\nfollowing John M.'s technical note number 2 here\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-September/000405.html\n\nSee the tutorial for details:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/files/phatfile/radcourse_advanced.pdf\n\nI would like to map the falsecolor illuminance image back into the room\nonto a new surface at working plane height to make the result more\nunderstandable. For this, the background of the falsecolor contour line\nimage should probably be black, but this is no problem. The false colour\nlines would appear to be hovering in the room. I saw something similar in\na demo of some commercial lighting software, but don't remember where.\n\nI think my problem is the cal file (PAB named his one picture_UV.cal)\nwhich is often referred to, but never given as an example. Since my object\nis a nice'n'easy plane, would it be possible to use picture.cal that comes\nwith RADIANCE?\n\nThose are PAB's words of wisdom:\n\n--------------------- 8< - Schnipp -----------------\n\nvoid plastic mp1\n0\n0\n5 .01 0.01 0.01  0.35 0.1\n\nvoid glass mp2\n0\n0\n3  .9 .9 .9\n\nvoid mixpict mp\n15 mp1 mp2 digital1 sp.pic picture_UV.cal tpic_u tpic_v ...\n0\n0\n\n--------------------- 8< - Schnapp -----------------\n\nCould somebody explain the mixpict primitive a bit more?\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10201.213.58.101.145.1109805605.squirrel@213.58.101.145>", "refs": ["<422637B8.2000305@t-online.de>"], "datetime": "Thu Mar  3 00:12:50 2005", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)"}
