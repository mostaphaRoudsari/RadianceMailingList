If you click on any of the .hdr images\non this page:\nhttp://athens.ict.usc.edu/Probes/\nthe web server tells you it's a BIN file. Assigning a default application\ntherefor depends on the extension. This is .hdr on the page you quoted,\nbut no-one can stop me from serving HDR images with an extension .axl .\nThis is where the MIME type kicks in: Once my web server knows that both,\n.hdr and .axl (and maybe .pic) are of type X-HIGH-DYNAMIC-RANGE, for\nexample, it will dish out the proper MIME type, and not say it's a BIN\n(which is kinda saying \"I've no idea what I'm delivering here...\")\n\nThanks for the link.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR MIME t", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Tue Jan  3 20:04:09 2006"}
