{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\n\nAll this makes sense to me.\n\n\nSince the black is going to be removed anyhow, we could use the normal\npicture.cal like so:\n\nvoid colorpict fc_val\n15 red green blue sp.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 4 -rz -90 -t .5 5.5 0\n0\n0\n\nDoesn't seem to make any diff.\n\n\nThe glow intensity would have to be adjusted to 'look nice' with the\nambient light in the scene, right? It looks better in my scene with a glow\nof 2 2 2 0 or 3 3 3 0.\n\n\nExactly what I was missing. The FTINY thing is in case the black isn't\nreally black, isn't it? Or is it for internal rounding errors etc. With my\nperfectly back background (you wished you had this in a lighting lab...),\nI could drop this. Well, I did remove it and it still works, anyhow.\n\nYou've been a great help\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10229.213.58.100.238.1109880322.squirrel@213.58.100.238>", "refs": ["<422637B8.2000305@t-online.de>", "<10201.213.58.101.145.1109805605.squirrel@213.58.101.145>", "<5514a0e8e894d7e10db151b1683ba7d3@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Mar  3 20:57:41 2005", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)"}
