{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\nBeware, quick response ahead:\n\n\nTrue, but they you won't be able to change the definitions of fc_u and\nfc_v and have the colorpict line up with the mixpict.  I think it's\nbetter to use the same file for clarity.\n\n\nYes, you are right to adjust it for your scene -- should have mentioned\nthat.\n\n\nThe FTINY is in there as a guard against rounding errors, and I\nwouldn't recommend removing it.  It may work on your compile on your\nmachine, but another machine may not.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<e56c12a68cfd708e2a57ab22bcd08c3e@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<422637B8.2000305@t-online.de>", "<10201.213.58.101.145.1109805605.squirrel@213.58.101.145>", "<5514a0e8e894d7e10db151b1683ba7d3@gmail.com>", "<10229.213.58.100.238.1109880322.squirrel@213.58.100.238>"], "datetime": "Thu Mar  3 22:08:57 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)"}
