The old one was a bit of a\nchallenge to decode. Excellent document!\n\nAll\n---\nI've written down what I've learned from this threat in the Advanced\ntutorial under\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/files/phatfile/radcourse_advanced.pdf\n\nInspired by Andrews EcoTect presentation in Fribourg, I tried to find some\nways of putting RADIANCE results back into the scene. The results take a\nlittle bit of effort but look REALLY COOL! See sections 2.4.2 Transparent\nTextures and 4.6 Vector Illuminance in the above PDF.\n\nAlso new: 2.5 Using pcomb, 3.2 Using Ground Planes, 4.1 Non-standard\nviews, 4.5 Illuminance on a Virtual Plane.\n\nPlease send comments if you spot any errors or would like to contribute\nany personal experience/wisdom.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10253.213.58.101.254.1110233071.squirrel@213.58.101.254>", "refs": ["<422637B8.2000305@t-online.de>", "<10201.213.58.101.145.1109805605.squirrel@213.58.101.145>", "<5514a0e8e894d7e10db151b1683ba7d3@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar  7 22:56:12 2005", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Transparent textures (again)"}
