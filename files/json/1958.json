This is as close as it gets.\n\nJust pulling three lines out of this file:\nFocalLengthIn35mmFormat => 38\nFocalLength35efl => 7.8mm (35mm equivalent: 38.0mm)\nFocalLength => 7.8mm\n\nVoila! Your're in business.\n\nYou might want to take a look at the Reveal software which is available\nfor LINUX, MacOS, and even Windows:\nhttp://albumshaper.sourceforge.net/index.shtml\nIt's a GUI thing allowing you to read and edit the EXIF info.\n\nAnd of course there's alwas Perl::Image::Exiftool, if you're into\nautomating and scripting... Look on CPAN.org\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5280 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060105/974fb3a2/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Axel Jacob", "datetime": "Thu Jan  5 15:02:16 2006"}
