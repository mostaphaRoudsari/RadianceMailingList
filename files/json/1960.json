I am wondering about methods for generating a\ngood response curve for a given camera. The book gives a variety of tips\nand suggestions, however I am curious about good scenes.\n\nIn a prior email footnote from Greg (a faq item relating to camera\nresponse curves and Photosphere), he suggests shooting a scene looking\nout a window during daytime with about 10 exposures. What about shooting\na controlled scene such as a Macbeth Color Checker or a Kodak gray scale\nchart (can't remember the name of this) outdoors under daytime\nconditions or using some type of interior fixed lighting setup?\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDRI - Camera Response Curv", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon Jan  9 18:23:33 2006"}
