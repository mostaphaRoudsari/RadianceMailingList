Please try sending\nthem to me directly at <gregoryjward@gmail.com> and perhaps I can\nanswer your question.\n\n-Greg\n\nI am using desktop radiance in Ecotec.? I am trying to analyse the\nglare effect produced by applying different screen transparency on a\nwindow.? But when I applied the transparency in Ecotec?to the screen\nmaterial,? (i.e. 12% )? the material disappear from my renderings.?? I\nknow the material still there it is there since I can see the shadows\nit proyects on the floor.?? I enclose some of the images I got.?\n?\nFigure 1 shows the deskto radiance rendering view from an exterior\ncamera that faces the window of a room ?which has these exterior\noctagonal modules. The modules material that I chose is fabric with a\ntransparency of 0% for this case.\n\nFigure 2 shows the interior of the room and the shadows projected on\nthe floor by the modules.\n\nFigure 3 shows the same camera view as Figure 1. ?But in this case I\nchanged the transparency material in Ecotec to be 60% and the modules\nare not visible anymore as it can be seen in. ??However when I render\nwith desktop radiance?an interior view similar to the one in ?Figure 2,\nit turns out that the modules are actually projecting shade, see Fig 4.\n?It is quiet strange that the transparency material can be perceived on\nthe projected shadows but it is not shown on the material itself.\n\nAnyone has clue of what is happening?\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Transparency", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<e3addf19fec36c937a5899253b6d47f2@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<20050308104855.88691.qmail@web26505.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar  8 16:27:46 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Transparency"}
