Fixed aperture, varied exposure,\nand shoot from a tripod if you can.  The Canon Rebels are really nice\nbecause you can adjust the exposure with a little roller wheel; once you\nhave the WB and aperture set, you just roll the wheel & click, roll the\nwheel & click, etc.  My Olympus requires a lot more futzing with menus\nto do manual exposure and it's impossible to shoot a decent sequence w/o\na tripod.\n\n\n\nI dunno about validating a response curve, but I'd expect you could\nmeasure the scene with a luminance meter while you're shooting it, and\nthen compare those values to some samples from the hdr image.\n\n\nI just open the high & low images in Photoshop and look at the\nhistogram.  Are you trying to figure out a way to automate this step\nfrom the command line?\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDRI - Camera Response Curv", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon Jan  9 21:58:40 2006"}
