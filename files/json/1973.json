Unfortunately, Georg has really undermined this\nplan by creating the excellent diagram you refer to, explaining how\ntrans actually works, leading me to consider changing the parameters\njust to keep everyone guessing.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nIt does, but not for surfaces that are 100% specular or 100%\ntransmissive.\n\n\nThese are the diffuse reflection values for red, green, and blue, and\nthey will be 0 if either A4 or A6 are 1.0 due to energy balance\nconstraints.\n\n\nYes.\n\nBasically, the problem you point out has to do with the formulation\nin RwR, which relies on a non-zero value for the diffuse reflection.\nIf either A4 or A6 are 1.0,  then it follows that the diffuse\nreflection (Cr,Cg,Cb) must be zero for energy to balance, and the\nformulae for A1 to A3 give you 0/0, which is indeterminate (not\ninfinity).\n\nThis is the main reason why trans has the confusing specification it\ndoes (besides keeping me employed) -- its parameterization has well-\ndefined physical ranges.  All parameters except the roughness (A5)\nshould be between 0 and 1.0, and any combination of parameter values\nin this range yields a physically valid model.\n\nI hope this clears up your confusion.  If not, my rates are really\nquite reasonable....\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans - georg vs greg vs book", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Jan 10 03:01:04 2006"}
