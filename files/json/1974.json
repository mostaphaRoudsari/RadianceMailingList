{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI am trying to nail this one down, once and for all.\nWhat is your experience/approach? Feedback welcome.\n\nrefman:\n\"The transmissivity is the fraction of penetrating light that travels all\nthe way through the material.\nThe transmitted specular component is the fraction of transmitted light\nthat is not diffusely scattered.\nTransmitted and diffusely reflected light is modified by the material color.\nTranslucent objects are infinitely thin.\"\n\nBIG QUESTION:\nHow do CAPITAL indeces (RADIANCE) relate to\nlower case indices (PHYSICS)??? See below. Also for a lot more little\nquestions...\n\nmod trans id\n0\n0\n7 red green blue spec rough trans tspec\n#7  A1   A2   A3  A4    A5    A6    A7\n\nLet's talk about grey objects for now:\nA=179*(.265*A1+.65*A2+.065*A3)\n\n[hope you like ASCII art]\n!!!
