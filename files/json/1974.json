All \"transmittance\" values [0..1] are integrals over the BRTF\ntimes incident radiance, with the BRTF limited by [0...infinity] . In\ncase of an ideal specular BRTF (ideal glass), a \"specular transmittance\"\nis readily defined, but for all other cases it is necessary to specify\nover which solid angle the BRTF was integrated (that's why there's a\n*diffuse* transmittance under all circumstances, - that integral\nextends over the hemisphere). Specularwise it gets all very ugly and has\nbeen an efficient source for a lot of confusion. IMHO, the easiest way\nis to stick to the BRTF and even then it is worth clearly separating\nbetween an ideal BRTF (which may be a delta function) and\nmeasurements/simulations (which both deal with folded, aka integrated,\nBRTFs, so no delta-functions). This holds also true for \"trans\", whose\nBRTF gets more \"peakish\" (delta-like) with lower roughness values.\n\nhttp://www.pab-opto.de/pers/phd/apian_phd.pdf (in German, sorry for\nthat) lists the transmittance defs on (acrobat page numbering) page 31\nand the trans BRTF on page 131.\n\n-Peter\n\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Tue Jan 10 03:13:29 2006"}
