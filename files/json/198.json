{"body": "\nHi!\n\nAgain me... I'm spending quite a lot of time with radiance at the moment ;-)\n\nI want to print some renderings on a large format printer. If I simply print\na tiff (generated with ra_tiff), I get very bad colors (not enough\nsaturation, everything appears grey).\n\nNo I tried the macbethcal. I printed the macbeth-pic from the distribution\n(using the same print chain as I will do with the rendering), scanned it with\nan xrite 41, calculated xyY from x-rite's xyz-data (is there a converter /\nscript to do this out there???), made a cal-file (with some warning\nconcerning gamut of intermediate colors). But pcond says \"cannot grok\nmacbethcal file\", and something about inp-flags 077. What does it mean?\n\nMaybe someone may help? So long, I must use photoshop ;-)\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
