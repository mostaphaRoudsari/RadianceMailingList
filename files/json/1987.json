{"body": "\nHi Raphael,\n\nThanks so much for your feedback, that gives me a lot of insight!\n\nI tried to run\n[.]rcalc -e \"abs(x)=if(x,x,-x);cond=abs($7)+abs($8)+abs($9)\" >\nraytrace_sample.dmp\n\nBut rtrace & rcalc run into a standstill, and output is not being created.\nCould this be due the fact I'm a poor bugger on cygwin?\n\nI tried to run:\n\n$ rcalc -e 'abs(x)=if(x,x,-x);cond=abs($7)+abs($8)+abs($9)' pointdump.tmp >\ntest.dmp\n\nWhere rtrace output being located in pointdump.tmp, which runs without\nerrors, but the file created is empty... -a 7th/8th/9th variable being\npresent in the file-\n\nHowever, so far my script is just using $1 $2 $3 so also these lines haven't\nbeen showing up so far.\n\nThe suggested idea for counting bounces is brilliant, wouldn't have come up\nwith that! Thanks so much. I think I'll color rays in the graph according to\nhow often they bounce; the more often, the lighter they get since the light\nwill be more diffused accordingly.\n\n//One of these days I'll do myself a favor and get a linux box I promise ;)\n\nThanks again for your feedback!\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20050311175330.62F5C1C00329@mwinf0403.wanadoo.fr>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Mar 11 18:53:48 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] radiance graph | cygwin mess up?"}
