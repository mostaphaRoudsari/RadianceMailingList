{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nIn brief, I think that 40% reflectance for a wood floor is too high.\nAn off-white wall might have a 40% reflectance, but most wood floors\nwould be closer to 20%.  If you use macbethcal for your floor capture,\nthen it gives you back true reflectance values.  In such cases, I would\nnot pass the pattern trhough normpat.\n\nFurther comments below:\n\n\nHere you are multiplying your captured reflectance from the image by\n40%, which makes it 40% of what it should be (most likely).  Too dark,\nas you say.\n\n\nProbably because 40% is too high a reflectance for your floor.\n\n\nIf you were using macbethcal to create your floor pattern, this is the\ntechnique I would recommend (using the functions red() green() and\nblue() as the first three string arguments in your colorpict).\n\n\nI assume you mean clip_r(), clip_g() and clip_b().  The function clip()\nby itself would always return the red channel, and you would end up\nwith a gray-looking floor.\n\n\nAgain, I don't see how using noop() would give you this image, as\nnoop() expects a single argument, and if given three (r,g,b), will\nreturn the first.\n\n\nAgain, I suggest using macbethcal to capture your image, and don't run\nnormpat unless you have a measured reflectance value to use.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Color Bleeding", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1ce41fc8457a03a05277286f5f31bb9b@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BAY102-F17578E698928F45DBBB4BEA4530@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 14 03:26:36 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Color Bleeding"}
