It is really OSX that I love so\nmuch, more so than Apple, but their product design is quite pretty too\n(altho that magnetic power adapter looks a bit flaky).  Giulio, I hear\nya.  But it's been a long time since I've done the early adopter thing,\nand I've been putting off upgrading my PB for a while as well, so I'm\ngonna make the gamble.  I'll be sure and let you all know how it works\nout; I ordered mine last night!\n\n\n\nAlthough it seems as if they lost money having three sizes and decided\nto focus on the best seller, slightly increasing the size (15.4\" instead\nof the old 15\").  It just may be the sweet spot.
