{"body": "\nHi Tarik,\n\nI couldn't really follow your question:\n\n\nI first read this as if you had created the .pic in HDRShop, which\ndidn't make sense.  I assume now you are only viewing it with HDRShop.\nWhat do you mean that the pixel values aren't the same?  The same as\nwhat?  The same as eachother?  You are expecting them all to be the\nsame?  ??\n\n\nIgnoring the `if(s='green_plastic')` nonsense, which I'm hoping doesn't\ndo anything, this command might give you the luminance at each visible\npoint on the green surface, but not its reflectance.  If you want the\nreflectance, just look at the Radiance scene file.  It's right there in\nthe definition of \"green_plastic\".\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<1110894669.4236e84d92612@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<c215acf0e784f76c269e3a7049ea3455@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<20050312135318.2E372F1847@mx.unb.br>", "<1110637516.4232fbcd02795@webmail.unb.br>", "<BAY22-DAV7DB8A585914B00A35E19990560@phx.gbl>", "<423639E4.80407@t-online.de>", "<1110894669.4236e84d92612@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar 15 16:46:21 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Difference between .pic colours and traced raycolours"}
