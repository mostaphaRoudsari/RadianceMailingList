If I try to get better quality\nand higher\nresolution, rpict gives me an error:\n\n[...]rpict: 6581491 rays, 49,87% after... [...]\nrpict: consistency - address not found in avlmemi\nrad: error rendering view 1\n\nI did this on a netfinity with a lot of ram and two pIII-833. But in\nfact, the\nmachine is a fileserver... so is this error the result of insufficient\nmemory?\n\nI have installed 3r2p11. On Linux 2.4.4 (SuSE 7.0).\n\nBTW, as I know that Georg Mischler is on the list: dxf2rad is a great\nway to import\ndata from formZ!!! I wrote dxfr14 and translated it with dxf2rad, it\nworks perfectly!\nSo this is an alternative besides the obj-way and the\n3ds/mgf/rad-conversion.\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\nBTW: I just found patch 20, I never found it on the ftp. I will try\nthis, too.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Mon, 23 Jul 2001 22:45:06 +0200"}
