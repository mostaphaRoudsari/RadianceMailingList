Roland made this new version some weeks ago.\nI'm not sure, if this helps in your special case, but I never had such\nproblems with using photon-ports and I used it several times without any\nproblems (I always used the 3.28 version for RADIANCE 3.5).\n\nWe are actually reorganizing our web-pages and unfortunately the English\n(web)version is not available and the German version shows a bug in\ndirect linking. That's the reason, why I haven't posted it to the\ncommunity yet.\n\nAnyhow, it is already on a Web-page for downloading.\nYou can get it on:\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/german/fields/field6/mb4/index.html then\nfollow link on \"Lichtsimulation\", then \"RADIANCE\", then \"p-map\"\n\nGood luck!\n\nJan\n\n\nErico Rosa wrote:\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
