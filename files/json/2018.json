It's included in the Radiance distribution. Read the\nman-page about how to use it.\n\nAnd start learning bash.\n\n\nRayfront is one of the best front ends I know about. Perhaps\nyou can convince your department to invest in an educational licence?\nWould be good for the development of Rayfront, too.\n\nThomas\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trad - TclTk", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sat Jan 14 20:28:44 2006"}
