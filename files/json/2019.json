{"body": "\nDear colleagues,\n\nOne of my students wants to model a swimming pool in Radiance. She is looking for a Radiance material model for the water surface (something similar to what Jack de Valpine has done for the rendering on the Radiance online web site). Has anybody modeled water in the past and is willing to share the model with us?\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart, Ph.D.\nAssociate Research Officer                      National Research Council Canada         Institute for Research in Construction\nAdjunct Professor                                     McGill University                                     School of Architecture\n1200 Montreal Road M-24, Ottawa          Ontario K1A 0R6 Canada\ntel: (613) 993-9703                                  fax: (613) 954 3733\ne-mail:  <blocked::mailto:christoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca> christoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\n\nThe Lightswitch Wizard (initial design)     <blocked::http://www.buildwiz.com/> www.buildwiz.com\nDAYSIM (expert software)                         <blocked::http://www.daysim.com/> www.daysim.com\nRadiance Workshop 2005                         <blocked::http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005> http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050405/4c363518/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC328713582BF7@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr  5 21:48:16 2005", "email": "Christoph.Reinhart at nrc-cnrc.gc.ca", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance model water"}
