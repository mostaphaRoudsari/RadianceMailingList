And yes, you will have to write\na script for your problem. But it will be a simple script.\n\nFirst you have to organize your scene data:\n\na) everything that is static in the scene in one file\nb) a bunch of files containing everything that isn't\n(in your case 100 files with the description of 1 light\nsource each).\nc) definitions of i.e. viewpoints or render parameters\n\nThe basic steps to create one image are:\n\n1) Compile a scene octree from the static and one dynamic file\n2) Render the image with the created octree as input\n\nI don't know much about your light so I assume you have\ncreated a \"static.rad\" file, 100 \"dynamic.001\" etc. files\nand a file with render options \"render.opt\".\n\nCreating your images is as simple as:\n\nfor i in `seq -w 100`\ndo\noconv static.rad dynamic.${i} > tmp_scene.oct\nrpict @render.opt tmp_scene.oct > image_${i}.pic\ndone\n\nNot as bad as it sounds, eh?\n\nThere is plenty of room for improvements: in particular, you don't\nneed all the 100 files for light sources if the vary only in\nposition or in other small details. That could be done within\nthe \"for ...\" loop, too. All depends on your needs.\n\n\nFor a simple introduction to bash google for \"bash tutorial\"\nand try a few of the hits. It depends on you what's the right\nintroduction level. You can use any other scripting language\nas well (Python, Perl, TCL) if you already know one.\n\n\nHTH,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] splitting a render by light sources", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sat Jan 14 20:57:40 2006"}
