Typically, an interior is less than 10% as\nbright as the exterior during daylight conditions, and this is\n(roughly) the amount of light reflected by standard glass.\nTherefore, the reflections are intermixing with the light from the\ninterior, and it's difficult to see any details that aren't confused.\n\nThings are made better if you can get just blue sky or something\nwithout detail in the reflection, or use a polarizing filter and\nshoot near the Brewster angle, where all the reflected light is of a\nparticular polarization.  This would be a nice trick that Radiance\n(unfortunately) cannot do properly, as it lacks polarization in its\nsimulation.  (Well, we had to cut back somewhere...)\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sunlight through glass", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Jan 17 19:29:09 2006"}
