It appears\nthat there are some (mostly) architectural people who are claiming\nthat their business projects are being affected by the failure of\nNext Limit to release the newest beta version of their software.\nPersonally, I would consider basing the welfare and completion of my\nbusiness projects on beta software risky, to put it mildly.  Suffice\nit to say that a lot of the huffing and puffing seems to be\nprojection of some people's frustration with their own lack of\njudgement.  I believe these people think they have the \"right\" to\nsound off because they paid $495 and don;t ever seem to get any\nanswers as to when the next version will be out, etc.\n\nAnd yes, Rob, i can very well imagine the dialog you posted below!\nThere would be a whole thread dedicated to how Radiance sucks because\nof splotchiness and the fact that it doesn't make their coffee in the\nmorning.\n\nThe fact the Radiance attracts the user community that it does is a\ntestament to its creators and keepers.  Thanks folks.\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
