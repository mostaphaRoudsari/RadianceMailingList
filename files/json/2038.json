I am not exactly clear\non the problem that they are trying to solve though. But I think one\nthing to keep in mind is that a lot of people (architects, designers and\nthe architectural rendering folks) have a lot of pre-conceived ideas\nabout how light should behave and how a scene should appear. These\npreconceptions can lead to a lot of problems when it comes to evaluating\nor simulating physical performance.\n\n-Jack\n\nKirk Thibault wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060117/8c2adac0/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sunlight through glass", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Tue Jan 17 22:40:47 2006"}
