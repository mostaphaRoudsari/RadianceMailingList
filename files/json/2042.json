I just want the box so I subtract the empty room but the\nresult\ndoesn't seem to look like the box in the first picture, it's much brighter\nin\nsome areas and much darker in others. Am I missing something?\nThanks for any help\n\nTarik\n\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3D77044FDAF3694E995689FC920C53E650EF5D@l-gnts05>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr 12 15:56:12 2005", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] pcomb"}
