This has been fixed in the latest release (I think), but\nmaybe not the one you have.  The solution is to execute \"sudo ln -s /\nvar/tmp /usr\" and enter the administrator's password.\n\nThere should have been a note about this spat out by makeall, but\nmaybe you missed it.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] falsecolor troub", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
