This validation will be published in the reference book on\nLighting Engineering under the editorship of academician J.B.Aizenberg\nand I can confirm that only Radiance and AGi32 provide correct\nqualitative and quantitative results.\n\nWe've got 17.7% maximum relative difference with SuperLite 2 and\nhigher than 150% relative difference with Lightscape.\n\nWe wanted to test Inspirer from Integra Inc., Japan, because they\nclaim it provides phisycal accurate simulation results. But,\napparently, they didn't provide us with the package for evaluation.\n\nRG> Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n\nRG> Can I get an amen-ahh!\n\nRG> I got into it with a CAD/modeling pundit several years ago, when he\nRG> stated in a review that Viz was capable of producing renderings that\nRG> were \"95% accurate\".
