{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nNo, I don't think so. I checked everything this morning. The silly and\ninteresting about this is that I get the wall behind the affected\nsurfaces as some kind of mask. I attach one more rvu-screenshot to\nillustrate this. As you can see, the surface is black, if there is a\nwall behind, and bright (colorpict-modifier visible) if the window\nopening (or no geometry at all) is behind. So it seams to be some kind\nof geometry mess that I created here. Also, this behaviour changes with\noconv -r settings.\n\nI use instances heavily in my scene. I have been warned not to do so\n(and of course, most of my instances don't fit into a cube, but are all\nkinds of random geometries). On the other hand, the model is too huge\nto be rendered without the use of instances, and I also cannot divide\nthe model into some cube-like parts, as there is a logical structure of\nbuilding elements in this building which defines how the model is\nbuilt. So maybe I just corrupted the scene by using too many\n(overlapping) instances' octrees? This is the only explanaition I could\nimagine at the moment.\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: radiance_error.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 25054 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050418/b17a914e/radiance_error-0001.jpg\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] instance problem?", "sender": "Lars O.
