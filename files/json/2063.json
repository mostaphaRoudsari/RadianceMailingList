I collected illuminance data for a *'Desisti' 1 KW* incandescent\nluminaire in our lighting laboratory.\n2. I converted the illuminance values to luminance values and the color\ntemperature of 3200K to RGB 1.377 0.913 0.351\n-- I used the color temperatur conversion from the Radiance book p.431.\nI need to see the color temperature in the              pictures.\n3. Finally i created an '.ies file' and used 'ies2rad' to get Radiance data.\n-- Now i know, that instead i could have created  the' .dat ' file\nmyself by dividing the luminance data by 179 lm/w --\n4. I used 'rtrace' to measure my 'virtual' light source to verify my\ncollected data\n-- I used the same measuring distance as in the lab --\n5.  My lamp ( source is a 'ring' ) is at 1 0 4 pointing downwards at 0 0 -1\n6. at first i used 'rtrace' for the irradiance data:\n*\n*echo \"1 0 0 0 0 1\" |rtrace -I -h lux_test.oct\n\n/      4.154708e+01 2.754719e+01 1.059043e+01\n/*First question:  Are these irradiance values for RGB with the unit\n'w/square meter' ?*\n\n7. now i measured the illuminance:\n\n\n$ echo '1 0 0 0 0 1' |rtrace -I -h  lux_test.oct |rcalc -e\n'$1=*47.4**$1+*120**$2+*11.6**$3'\n\n*5397.84338*\n\n-- this value is really satisfying, my collected data is *5400 lux!*\n\n*Second question: Where do the factors of  *47.4/179 =* 0.26 , *120/179\n=* 0.67 and *11.6/179 =* 0.065 come from?\n\n*I only know the standard factors from video for the EBU - Phosphors.\nThere the luma value is: Y = 0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B\nI tried these ones, but the result worse, in fact it is *5334 lux*.\n\nMaybe someone can help me.\n\nBest regards,\n\nChristian\n\n--\nChristian Fusenig\nDiplomand, Medientechnik\nUndergraduate, Media Technology\nHamburg University Of Applied Sciences\n\naddress: Beim Schlump 27/07\n20144 Hamburg\n\nemail:    christian_fusenig@gmx.de\n\nmobile:  ++49 179 5975845\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Fusenig", "datetime": "Tue Jan 24 19:28:41 2006"}
