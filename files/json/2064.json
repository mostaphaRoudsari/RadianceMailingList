{"body": "\nHi again.\n\nI've changed the scripts which build my model. I had a hierarchical\nstructure of nested octrees (instances), which were not really good. I\nhad used this structure as I wanted to \"bundle\" geometry into some more\ncubic-like clusters. In fact, I did the opposite as I later \"invented\"\nthe use of ximage to repeat objects - the result was that the octree\ncontained not this \"cube-like\" block, but all the instances of this\nblock - and thus this octree was not cube-like any more.\n\nNow I use instances only on a lower level, for small objects, and use\nxform everywhere else. The errors are gone, as there are fewer\noverlappings of octrees now.\n\nCU and thanks a lot, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: Problem solved somehow.
