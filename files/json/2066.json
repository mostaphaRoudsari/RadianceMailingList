I have been using the Radiance Control Panel (part of EcoTect) as\nthe GUI front end to Radiance, and so far, everything seems to work\nsmoothly.\n\nThese are the steps I took:\n1. I copied the contents of each folder (bin, lib, obj, doc, and runs) from\nthe Mingwin binaries that Francesco compiled into the corresponding folder\nin C:\\Radiance. This allowed me to replace any updated binaries, while\nkeeping the older binaries of programs that were not compiled (ie. Anything\nthat requires xwindows)\n2. I copied RadianceIV (the image viewer that comes as part of EcoTect) into\nC:\\Radiance, and then renamed it winimage (the name of the image viewer that\nis installed as part of Desktop Radiance)\n\nI have by no means tested this installation to see if all programs work, but\nso far with the basic renderings I have run, I have had no problems\nwhatsoever. Also, because RadianceIV can post-process images, I have been\nproducing falsecolor images as well as contour line images directly from\nRadianceIV (aka winimage).\n\nSo, for those who, for one reason or another, can only work in the Window$\nenvironment, these binaries completely revamp Desktop Radiance.\n\nFrancesco, Greg, Lars, or John, would it be possible to maintain updated\nWindow$ binaries so that those of use stuck using Window$ can at least\nbenefit from the latest developments and fixed in the Radiance binaries?\n\n\nJohn An\n\n\nOn Oct 8 2005, Francesco Anselmo wrote:\nFor those of you who are interested in using Radiance with the Micro$oft OS,\nI've put some fresh binaries here...\n\nOn Oct 14 2005, Rob Gugliemetti replied:\nHey Schorsch, could these [wintel] binaries be \"dropped in\" to an existing\nRayfront installation?\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John An", "datetime": "Wed Jan 25 05:13:52 2006"}
