In my case here, it worked well because these are nighttime exterior\nimages but made with crude representations for the luminaires, and pcond's\nveiling glare treatment was not desirable for the purposes of these images\n(and for some reason switching that off (pcond -h -v-) gave me some odd\nartifacts).  It was about then that your email about normtiff showed up.\n\nThanks for the heads up though.  There should be a warning on the download\npage for Radiance: \"warning, entering DEEP water...\" (or deep\n*something*.)\n\n--\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ximage vs. pcond", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<56285.209.212.87.250.1113849832.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "refs": ["<0b25c4789fa28e67cc66aecc40220018@tuebingen.mpg.de>", "<9e21829bc9ffe8ca03db0197d7d20abc@gmail.com>", "<55736.209.212.87.250.1113848251.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "<7c2813a733f8017046cb55c2c43f05cb@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Apr 18 20:44:15 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ximage vs. pcond"}
