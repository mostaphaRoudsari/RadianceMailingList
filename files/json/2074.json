They were all created in\nRadiance (duh) and have been scaled down 5:1 or 6:1. I hope this\ncounts as \"giving back\" to the Radiance community in some way.\n\n(these are all temporary URLs and they are all > 1.2 MB JPEGs)\n\n\"Open House\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img04_2400.jpg\n\n\"Boil\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img05_1800.jpg\n\n\"Dynamo\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img31_2400.jpg\n\n\nIn other news, I have finally updated my Benchmark page with\nresults that were given to me up to 4 months ago. I welcome any\nnew contributions you may have. Parallel results may have to\nwait, as there are unresolved timing issues with the Linux\nplatform.\n\nThanks!\n\nMark\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Fri Jan 27 02:36:54 2006"}
