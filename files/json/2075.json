The tube's\norigin is in the center of the sphere and it ends at the top of the\nsphere. I have set the rtrace measurement points inside the sphere at\nevery 10 degrees (180 total), so I can transform that in an IES file\nlater on. The rtrace (and rpict) of the photon-mapping is running fine\nshowing the specular reflection on the bottom of the sphere.\n\nAs a next step, I added a \"diffuser\" at the origin of the cylinder,\ninside the sphere, using a \"trans\" material for an isotropic\ndistribution. The readings I get now show the same illuminance value for\nevery measurement point. This is the script:\n\noconv sky.rad scene.rad ports.rad > pipe80.oct\n\n\noconv -i pipe80.oct > i_pipe80.oct\n\n\nmkpmap -app pipe80.gpm 1000000 100 -t 60 -apc pipe80.cpm 1000000 -apO\n./ports i_pipe80.oct\n\nrtrace -w -h -I -ab 1 -ad 16384 -aa 0.01 -ar 512 -app pipe80.gpm -apc\npipe80.cpm 100 -e errors.rad i_pipe80.oct < points.inp | rcalc -f\nrcalc.rad > data.dat\n\n\nThe total luminous flux reaching the diffuser is bouncing from the\ncylinder. Is it a problem between the parameters and \"trans\", with the\npmap and \"trans\" or something else?\nErico\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060126/06dea62f/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Erico Rosa", "datetime": "Fri Jan 27 03:00:09 2006"}
