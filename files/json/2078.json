Amazing.  But, they just whet my appetite for more information.  What is the polygon count?  Rendering time?  Size of .amb file?  Origin of software used to generate the model?  Any more?\n\nAnd, what is the link to your benchmark web site again?\n\nThanks,\n-Chas\n\n====================\n\n\nMessage-ID:\n<Pine.LNX.4.63.0601262025410.27795@galaxian.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>\nContent-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed\n\nRadiance users,\n\nIn this, the final day before the SIGGRAPH Art Gallery deadline,\nI would like to share with whomever is interested some of the\npieces that I will be submitting. They were all created in\nRadiance (duh) and have been scaled down 5:1 or 6:1. I hope this\ncounts as \"giving back\" to the Radiance community in some way.\n\n(these are all temporary URLs and they are all > 1.2 MB JPEGs)\n\n\"Open House\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img04_2400.jpg\n\n\"Boil\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img05_1800.jpg\n\n\"Dynamo\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img31_2400.jpg\n\n\nIn other news, I have finally updated my Benchmark page with\nresults that were given to me up to 4 months ago. I welcome any\nnew contributions you may have. Parallel results may have to\nwait, as there are unresolved timing issues with the Linux\nplatform.\n\nThanks!\n\nMark\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060126/fd3d3631/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "mstock@umich.edu", "datetime": "Thu, 26 Jan 2006 20:35:13 -0500 (EST)"}
