In most lighting\ncalculations, there will be some small amount of light leakage,\nespecially across infinitely thin boundaries.  And, as Carsten points\nout, the ambient term will give you light even where there is none.  If\nyou want to avoid all such leakage problems, you would need to set -ar 0\nand -av 0 0 0.  However, the image would take longer to compute, and\nsetting -av 0 0 0 rather than to a good guess of the ambient level\nresults in a loss of accuracy over most of the scene.\n\n(There is a script in the 3.4 release called compamb, which computes an\nambient value for a rad input file automatically.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Strange problem using -vtl to cut sections", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 12 Jul 2002 11:16:44 -0700"}
