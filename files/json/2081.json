How did you create \"Dynamo\"?\n\nMartin\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Thu 1/26/2006 8:35 PM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nRadiance users,\n\nIn this, the final day before the SIGGRAPH Art Gallery deadline,\nI would like to share with whomever is interested some of the\npieces that I will be submitting. They were all created in\nRadiance (duh) and have been scaled down 5:1 or 6:1. I hope this\ncounts as \"giving back\" to the Radiance community in some way.\n\n(these are all temporary URLs and they are all > 1.2 MB JPEGs)\n\n\"Open House\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img04_2400.jpg\n\n\"Boil\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img05_1800.jpg\n\n\"Dynamo\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img31_2400.jpg\n\n\nIn other news, I have finally updated my Benchmark page with\nresults that were given to me up to 4 months ago. I welcome any\nnew contributions you may have. Parallel results may have to\nwait, as there are unresolved timing issues with the Linux\nplatform.\n\nThanks!\n\nMark\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 4744 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060127/65370cee/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Mark Stoc", "datetime": "Fri Jan 27 14:13:38 2006"}
