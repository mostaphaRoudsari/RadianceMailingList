I wrote most of it for\nmy job/post-doc for a small company in California. Instead of\nvortex sheets (my research), this code tracks the motion of\nvortex blobs/particles. In this case, the flow was confined to\nstay within a sphere. The snakes in the image are all\nstreamlines, traced along the local velocity at a fixed point in\ntime. There are 170909 spheres and probably just a few more\ncylinders/cones in total.\nThe ball is in a square and tall room which is mostly white. A\nwarm-colored area light is near the top, the floor is red, and\nanother light is inside of the ball.\nThe oconv must have taken up all 950 MB available on my best\nmachine. If I had more RAM, I'd make bigger stuff.\nIt was rendered in two parts:\nrpict -vtl @vp30 -ds 0.1 -dj 0.7 -ab 3 -aa 0 -ad 4 -as 0 -ps 1 -u\n-t 600 -x 14400 -vl -0.5 -vv 0.625 -y 7200 -o img31_1.pic scene30.oct\nrpict: 2495232691 rays, 100.00% after 31.838u 0.133s 32.122r\nhours on bacchus (flipped once, took 400 MB in RAM)\nThe other one (-vl 0.5 -o img31_2.pic):\nrpict: 2798392870 rays, 100.00% after 22.147u 0.001s 22.196r\nhours on zeus (flipped once)\npcompos -a 1 img31_?.pic > img31.pic\nra_tiff -e -1.75 img31.pic img31.tif\ngimp it down to 2400^2 to make img31_2400.tif\nI used Gimp for resizing because the \"-aa 0 -ad 4\" action creates\nsome very hot pixels, and I can't seem to get pfilt to lose the\nlight---it always bleeds into surrounding pixels. So, I drop the\npic to 8-bit, and smooth and resize in The Gimp.\n\n\nFinally, the URL for my Radiance benchmark page is\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html\n\nThanks!\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Thu, 26 Jan 2006, Charles Ehrlich wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New images and Benchmark updates (long)", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Fri Jan 27 15:42:40 2006"}
