Rtrace - without the diffuser\nand the same parameters from the first message - returned (by degree):\n\n00 > 11.1955674\n10 > 8.8419795\n20 > 8.90784897\n30 > 6.83318662\n40 > 7.42337007\n50 > 6.62742577\n60 > 9.50036401\n70 > 14.0475395\n80 > 1939.93779 (hot spot)\n90 > 23.4809313\n100 > 1893.626 (hot spot)\n110 > 18.7999635\n120 > ...\n\nThat's about what I expected. Then I ran another (new) rtrace with the\ndiffuser/trans material below (I tried to keep it simple) and rtrace\nreturned the 140 lux for every point mentioned above:\n\nvoid trans mat_dif\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0.8 0\n\nSo, my guess is that trans is scattering light evenly inside the sphere,\nwhich is odd since the diffuser is pointing down.\n\nErico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\nsphere\nrunning\n\n\nthe\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060127/f05d31c6/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Erico Rosa", "datetime": "Fri Jan 27 18:03:19 2006"}
