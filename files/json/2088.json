The good news is that the rad\nutility can be put to good use as you get started with Radiance.  rad\nmakes good guesses about proper parameters for your simulations based\non a few basic assumptions about your scene.  You can even save those\nassumptions to a file and reuse them in subsequent rpict and rtrace\nruns.  Refer to the manpage of rpict for more onfo on that.  There are\nalso some good discussions of this on this list's archives (I should\nknow, since I learned about this from this very list).\n\n=================\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance values", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40e60a09465f010d753b711843ffdadc@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<003401c54717$18b25f10$0100a8c0@mallah>"], "datetime": "Sun Apr 24 06:31:38 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminance values"}
