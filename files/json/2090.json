(i'm using the spotlight primitive, with penumbras turned off\n- so i should get a clean, sharp pool of light on the wall.)\nit looks to me much worse than aliassing, but i dont know whether thats\ntrue.\ni have tried pfilt on the .pic file, reducing the size and adding a\nlittle gaussian blur, but that doesnt fix the problem.\n\ndoes anyone have any suggestions?\nhere is my opt file for the rendering settings:\n-dp 2048\n-ar 64\n-ms 0.13\n-ds .2\n-dt .05\n-dc .75\n-dr 3\n-sj 1\n-st .01\n-ab 3\n-af theatre.amb\n-aa .125\n-ad 512\n-as 64\n-av 0.062 0.062 0.062\n-lr 12\n-lw .0005\n-av 0 0 0\n-ad 500\n-ab 10\n-aa 0.01\n\nand i'll happilly email anyone the .pic produced. (im assuming i cant\nput attachments on this list.)\n\nwhile i'm writing, im a bit confused by the exposure settings for pfilt,\nperhaps someone could shed some light on that for me. i seem to be able\nto run:\npfilt -e 1 image.pic, and get a very  bright image back, when i cant see\nanything but black in the original. - i thought that -e 1 would mean\nmultiply by 1, so no change, is that wrong?\n\nthanks for your help.\nwill\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] splitting a render by light sources - rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "william reynolds", "datetime": "Sun Jan 29 00:46:30 2006"}
