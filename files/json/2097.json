{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI'm a new user to RAD and now I'm using CYGWIN RADIANCE.

Could anyone\nplease let me know what was the cause of the problem?\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nBest Regards,\nSiritip H.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Siritip Harn.", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<b094d4d4050423130931ddf59a@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Apr 23 22:09:37 2005", "email": "missngao at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] xglaresrc question"}
