I assume this is\nbecause the UV\ncoordinates aren't available in the same way (with Lu, Lv) that works\nwith mesh objects.\n\nI've also tried making a polygonal mesh sky dome. That's easily textured\nbut creates other problems\n(shadows and other lighting effects on the sky) .\n\nThanks for any help or guidance on how to do this sort of thing!\n\n\n- Bob\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "bob coyne", "datetime": "Tue Jan 31 17:38:47 2006"}
