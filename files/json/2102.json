What material type are those blue\nbuttons?  Is the rendering issue related to the way the IBL is\nhandled during transmission through that specific material?\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn Feb 3, 2006, at 12:50 PM, Fitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Kirk Thibaul", "datetime": "Fri Feb  3 20:08:23 2006"}
