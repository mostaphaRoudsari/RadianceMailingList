{"body": "\n\nHi Greg and all,\nI`ve tried mksource a bit and it works wonderfully, it`s a great program\n(and just what I needed)\nI put a page with the first sample renders:\nhttp://home.att.ne.jp/banana/tiago/radiance/mksource.htm\nrpict was only with -ab 1, and all the rest defaults since I just wanted to\ntest the sources\n\nfirst I tried mksource with the default settings but it seemed to produce\ntoo few sources, and the render looked unnatural\n(don`t think this could be fixed with rpict settings)\nI tried changing the max angle to 0.5 (-a .5) but that was too small, and\nthe render took too long (at least for my laptop)\nso I tried other three values (5 deg, 2 and 1, after moving to a faster\ncomputer) and the differences are visible. The render with -a 1 took about\n15 hours, so I don`t want to imagine what would happen with -ab 3 -ad 5000\netc...\nI guess it`s a compromise, and maybe making the threshold higher would\nreduce the number of sources and allow a smaller -a?\nI will keep trying other settings and let you know how it goes.\nRegards\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mksource program", "sender": "Santiago Torres", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ABEIIOCILNBBDDEPEPICOEOACEAA.tiago@tkh.att.ne.jp>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Apr 20 10:08:45 2005", "email": "tiago at tkh.att.ne.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mksource program"}
