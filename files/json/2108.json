The first time I tried to create a calibration\nfile I got an \"out of gamut\" error, which I understand points to a\npoorly exposed gretag photo.  Before re-photographing everything, I\nthought maybe cropping my gretag image to the registration marks may\nhelp (lazy Sunday thinking).  But now, after cropping the photo and\nre-creating the pic file, I now get the following error when running\nmacbethcal (macbethcal -d debug.pic mbscan.pic colorcal.cal):\n\nmacbethcal: non-increasing neutral patch\n\nThe resulting debug.pic is 59 bytes and is useless.  Two questions: how\ncan I get a better image to avoid the out of gamut error, and what\ncaused the error above?  I was using northern skylight on a fairly\ncloudless day for my lighting, and f2.0 1/125 for all exposures.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sun Feb  5 19:38:16 2006"}
