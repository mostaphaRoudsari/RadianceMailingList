Remember that the y-coordinate from\nPhotosphere is reversed from that produced by ximage, which is what\nmacbethcal expects...\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  If you're still stuck, send me your image and I'll see what I\ncan do with it.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] macbethcal error", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
