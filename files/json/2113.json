{"body": "\nBear in mind that normtiff (and ximage -e auto) don't do everything\npcond can do.  In particular, they cannot simulate human loss in acuity\nand veiling glare, so if you really want \"pcond -h\", don't expect\n\"normtiff -h\" to work as a substitute.  Also, if you are converting\nanimation frames and want all the frames to use the same tone-mapping,\npcond -I works with the output of phisto, whereas there is no such\noption in normtiff.\n\nJust had to throw in some caveats.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ximage vs. pcond", "sender": "Gregory J.
