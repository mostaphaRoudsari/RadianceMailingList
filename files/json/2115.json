{"body": "\nHi Roland,\n\nPcond and ximage use completely different implementations of the\nhistogram adjustment operator.  By design, they should be reasonably\nwell matched if you use the default options for pcond and \"ximage -e\nauto\", or \"pcond -s -c\" to match \"ximage -e human\".  However, because\nthe histograms are computed in a slightly different way, you can\nsometimes get discrepancies.\n\nIf you want your output to match the ximage display, I suggest you use\nnormtiff rather than pcond, which performs tone-mapping using the same\nalgorithms in ximage, and converts to a 24-bit RGB TIFF output.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ximage vs. pcond", "sender": "Gregory J.
