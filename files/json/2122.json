You should be able to\ndo most anything you want with Perl. The main problem area can be if you\nare feeding data to into and/or out of radiance programs and end up with\nbuffering problems. For example I only recently learned that there is a\n'-u' switch for rcalc which causes output to be flushed after each\nrecord. This came in real handy for a perl program that uses open2 to\nboth write to and read from an rcalc process.\n\n-Jack\n\nPS, as others on this list know I am a pretty strong advocate of Perl.\nHowever, there is also a strong group who use Python for Radiance\nrelated scripting. Of course Greg is all about shell.... Nevertheless,\nas you indicate fairly good knowledge of Perl this might still be the\nbest place to try to get things working....\n\nJ.
