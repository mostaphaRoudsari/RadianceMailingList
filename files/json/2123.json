I guess I had been\nhoping that with some understanding of the gloss appearance metric there\nmight be a way back into at least some meaningful ballpark for roughness\nand specularity.\n\nOk, well on a related note, other than a full BRTD what would be the\nbest way to simulate a so-called metalic paint, that is a paint that\nincludes metal flakes...? Is this still best qualified as a plastic or\nshould it in fact be a metal?\n\n-Jack\n\nGregory J.
