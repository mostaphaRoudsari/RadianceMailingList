{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI am having some strange errors with a huge radiance scene here. As you\ncan see, some surfaces are rendered as black (the region over the\narches). These errors arise since I added more and more geometry. The\nmodel is made up of a lot (!!!) of instances, to get all the geometry\ninto memory, but I know that there is some problem with overlapping\ninstances. So is this a symptom for such problems, or am I experiencing\nsomething completely different here?\n\nI attach the small pic, which should be ok for the list. Thank you for\nany help, CU Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: still05e.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 13368 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050416/a25160e3/still05e.jpg\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
