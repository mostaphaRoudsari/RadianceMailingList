I am not sure that switching scripting languages is necessarily\nthe best thing to do as this just means there is more to\nlearn/control. Note though that the O'Reilly books on Perl and\nother languages are really good.\n3. perhaps there is a way to do what you want more simply (eg such as\ndirectly with rcalc), if you can give us more of an idea of what\nyou are trying to do then you may get back some good suggestions\nfor doing what you want. rcalc is the real radiance workhorse for\nprocessing data. The issue may be in figuring out how to code up\nyou algorithm in radiance's native functional language.\n\n-Jack\n\nJ.
