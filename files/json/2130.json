I will give Bodypaint a try, but I doubt if\nit does generate surface normals from a file that doesn't have them.\nAnyways, I wonder if the perforate.cal could be changed to work at once\non surfaces without UV coordinates.\nWhen mapping pictures it goed well, since I (not really me:) changed a\nfew lines in picture.cal :\n\npic_u = U;  //was: pic_u = Px;\npic_v = V;   //was: pic_v = Py;\n\nI don't know why this works, but it does....\nIf something like this could be done in the perforate.cal file, that\nwould be nice,\n\n-Iebele\n\n\nGiulio Antonutto wrote:\n\nBodypaint\neven\nsince\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3D77044FDAF3694E995689FC920C53E650EF6A@l-gnts05>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Apr 13 17:07:04 2005", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] perforate.cal"}
