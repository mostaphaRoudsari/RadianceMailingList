I have two situations, a clear sky with 30 and\n60 degrees solar angles - 75,000 and 40,000 Lux reaching the top of the\ntube - and would like to measure the transmittance of the pipe at its\nbottom, using materials with 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99% reflectance. Using\nmanual calculations I can fairly expect something between 52-88% and\n80-96% transmittance for the 30-degrees and 60-degrees sky,\nrespectively. I initially used the metal material which has given me\nvery low numbers. When I switched to the mirror material with a faceted\ntube (polygons) replacing the initial round tube, the numbers started to\nmatch (or at least sort of).\n\nFor measurements, I divided the ring in the bottom of the tube in\napproximately 200 measuring points and retrieved numbers that vary from\n5,000 to 150,000 Lux for the first tube and 9,000 to 400,000 Lux for the\nlater. Dividing the individual values for the number of measuring points\ngive me exact numbers for the \"30-deg\" tube, and numbers 20% higher (but\naccurate when reduced) for the \"60-deg\" one. Being a newbie at this, I\nam quite puzzled with the photon distribution and if the measurements\nare accurate.  Is it the bandwidth that is producing numbers that far\nlow and high? Is it bias that is distributing the photon like this?\n\nI am testing with an 80 degrees solar altitude clear sky and the results\nare 100% higher that I expected (but again, accurate when reduced).\n\nMy parameters are:\n\nmkpmap -appb <file> 1000000 50 5000 - apc <file> 1000000 -ds 0.001 -dp\n32768\nrtrace -I+ -ab 1 -ad 32768 -aa 0.001 -ar 32768 -app <file> -apcb 50 5000\n\nErico Naves Rosa\nDoctor of Design Candidate\nHarvard Design School\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5873 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060207/195f1e38/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Erico Ros", "datetime": "Tue Feb  7 22:31:50 2006"}
