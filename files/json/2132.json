{"body": "\nI would suggest to follow this route:\n\n-1- use obj to export your model with an UV mapping defined (Maxon Bodypaint\nis what I use to create the UV, works fine... but I am pretty sure that even\nBlender has something similar)\n\n-2- edit the cal file substituting Lu and Lv with Px Py, no need of Pz since\nwe are on a surface\n\n-3-\nDefine a mesh primitive\nDefine the material as usual\n\n-4- import the file with a mesh primitive and attach the material while\nimporting:\nObj2mesh -a materials model.obj > model.mesh\n\n\n\nOpen you file wit objview, just a quick check,\nHopefully all should be ok....\n\nI found this new feature really useful... all the old parametric textures\nare now UV... really cool!\n\nCheers,\nHope it works,\n\ngiulio\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of atelier\niebele abel\nSent: 13 April 2005 15:18\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi group,\n\nI use a file called perforate.cal (from Georg).\nIs it possible to change this file in such way that use it on surfaces\nwhich various normal directions ( not only through x, y or z plane) ?\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\nperforate.cal:\n{\nperforate.cal\nPerforation function for approximately horizontal sufaces,\nfor use in a mixfunc.
