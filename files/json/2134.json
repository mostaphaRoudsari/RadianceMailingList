I realize early on the need for the surface\nand my measuring points match the ring surface (plastic, 0.1 0.1 0.1 0\n0) on the bottom of the pipe. On the other hand, the pipe is open at the\ntop (well, there is the antimatter ring port on the top). Would clear\nglass do the job on the top?\n\nI am reading some of the early threads on the issue and on a previous\nmessage you mentioned:\n\n\"The quick instruction is:\n\n0. You can use the standard radiance description (except user defined\nBRDFs). ->rad and oct\n1. To distribute photon and store them in files (global and caustic\nphotons separately). e.g.\n~/bin/radiance/pmap/mkpmap  -apg f81_z.gp 700000 -apc f81_z.cp 700000\ntest.oct\n700000 is the number of the photos emitted, gp : global photons, cp\ncaustic photons\n2.

And how do you measure\nthe incoming flux?\nIf you put the measuring points not directly on a surface and use photon\n\nmapping, then it is not surprising that you get strange results.  Then\nphoton mapping calculates the density estimate of the nearest photons in\n\nthe scene (which are per definition always on a surface).\nSo  if you wanna get the transmission of a pipe, you should \"close\" the\npipe at its bottom by a disk and put the measuring points directly on\nit. This disk shouldn't be completely black - even knowing that it\nreflects the light back to the top.\nThe same must be done for the incoming flux, so you need an extra run\njust for that and should put a disk at the top of the pipe.\n\nIn that case, you should get reasonable results also by using the metal\nmaterial.\n\nHey Roland, what's your opinion!?\n\nJan\n\n\nErico Rosa wrote:\n\nand\nto\nthe\npoints\n(but\nresults\n5000\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
