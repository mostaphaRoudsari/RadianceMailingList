I tried the same on\na very large model, but rendering is slow now because the different views\ncan't share ambient data. So my suggestion is to keep low -ad and downsample\nas proposed, but cache the fewer ambient values in an ambient file using a\nmoderate -aa. Any comments? I wondered why this was not mentioned in the\nstudies, am I completely wrong or is it because he simply did not have to\nreuse the ambient values (in a comparision with different ambient settings,\nthat would be a bad idea ;-)?\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Wed Feb  8 16:11:08 2006"}
