Since Franceso was able to build -and share- his wintel\nradiance 3.8a binaries I'm able to render scenes that have mesh\nprimitives, but havent been able to do so via rview, since its an\noutdated version that does not support the newer mesh primitve.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "datetime": "Wed Feb  8 16:39:40 2006"}
