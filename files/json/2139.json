{"body": "\nI recently wrote a program for computing light sources to accelerate\nimage-based lighting for anyone who's working on that.  You can get it\nin last night's HEAD, and the synopsis is below:\n\nNAME\nmksource - compute distant sources for RADIANCE image-based\nlighting\n\nSYNOPSIS\nmksource [ -d nsamps ][ -t thresh ][ -a maxang ] [ octree ]\n\nDESCRIPTION\nMksource produces a RADIANCE scene description of distant illum\nsources\ncorresponding to bright, concentrated  regions  in  the  given\nambient\nenvironment.   Any local geometry is ignored in the input\noctree, which\nshould be derived from a captured light probe.  The output\nsources  may\nthen  be  combined  with  this  environment to produce a more\nefficient\nscene for rendering, faster and less prone to sampling artifacts.\n\n--------\nI'd be interested in feedback if you give this a try.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Gregory J.
