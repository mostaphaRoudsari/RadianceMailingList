One of our Postdocs bought a Mac Box\nand I am trying to install Radiance on it. At first I had trouble\ncompiling Radiance since no ggc was on it. So I installed the gcc\npackage. Now, it keeps on complaining that it does not find the standard\nlibraries such as studio.h. Would anybody know off-hand which packages\nneed to be installed on the Mac so that Radiance compiles? Also, when I\nuse the pre-installed binaries, 'ximage' is missing the file\n/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib. Which package do I need to get that\nrunning?\n\nChristoph\n\nPS: Windows forever:)\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "datetime": "Wed Feb  8 21:04:28 2006"}
