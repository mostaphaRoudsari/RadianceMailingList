But\nI'll try to remember as best as I can.  Firstly, you don't need to\ninstall any special (i.e. non-Apple packages).  Just install the\ndeveloper tools in the standard release:\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/developertools/\nI think that includes X11:\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/\nOnce done, gcc should be found in  /usr/bin/gcc  (version 4.00 in\nTiger).\n\nOther than that, the only thing I can recall is having to create the\ndirectory /usr/tmp and making it world-writeable.  The rest is\n\"standard\" Radiance environment stuff.\n\nPut the X11 application icon in the dock (it's in the Utilities\nsubdirectory of the Applications directory), and start that up before\nrunning any Radiance display programs.\n\nI think that's all (but I may have missed something out).\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Wed Feb  8 22:01:38 2006"}
