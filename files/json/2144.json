{"body": "\nHello,\n\nWe completed a second rendering with the settings below. It, as the\nother rendering, includes a ground polygon and ground glow. Prior to\nrunning the second interior rendering we did a quick outside view\nrendering to create an ambient cache. The difference we see between\nthis and the first rendering is that the sky is blue.\n\nCarsten; is this how you meant to ?use separate ambient caches for the\n?outside? and the ?inside? part of the scene??\n\n-ab  2\n-av  0.37 0.37 0.37\n-ad  5000\n-as  500\n-ar  500\n-aa  0.15\n-dj  0.03\n\nAxel; details of the left side are posted.\n\nhttp://www.labergedaylight.com/pages/temp.html\n\nThank you for your time.
