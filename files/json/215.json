We believe it has to\ndo with the newer X server xfree86 4.1.0.  Has anyone else run into this\nproblem or know how we can fix it?  It is a real pain, I've been having\nto take my Linux Radiance images over to Windows NT to view them.\n\nThanks,\nZack\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3C362326.91AC445F@archenergy.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 04 Jan 2002 14:48:22 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems with Suse 7.3 (xfree86 4.1.0) and ximage"}
