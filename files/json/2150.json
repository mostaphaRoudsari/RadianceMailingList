{"body": "\nUsually, there are three reasons that the oconv process can blow up like\nthis:\n\n1. duplicate geometry - do you have overlapping geometry for the\nblinds (eg polygons on top of each other)\n2. scaling - some piece of geometry that is being built seperately\nand then xformed into the scene at the wrong scale\n3. density - lots of small geometry clustered tightly together in a\nlarge scene\n\nIn some of these cases you can work around the problem by increasing the\noctree resolution (-r), you can take a look at the man page for further\ninformation on this.\n\n-Jack\n\nerwin.zierler@archvisu.at wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050407/2c76ecf4/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Overflow in addobject....", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42554DD8.2080001@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<DIIE.000000C300000F01@mail.stubainet.at>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr  7 17:18:14 2005", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Overflow in addobject...."}
