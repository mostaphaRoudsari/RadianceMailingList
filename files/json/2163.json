Yeah - UV Mapper is pretty nice - try playing around with the\nactual UV maps that it can create too - the export of the map itself\nis a nice feature (no need for taking screenshots of the UV mesh to\npaint textures and patterns on).  I have not actually tried the \"Pro\"\nversion (that costs money) but I am going to look into its additional\nfeatures.  Unwrapping a complex object by hand so the UV map is\nminimally distorted is sort of a drag.\n\nGlad it worked,\n\nkirk\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
