There is\nno need to either modify obj2mesh or the .OBJ exporter to obtain a\ncorrect mapping.  Radiance coordinate mappings are programmable for a\nreason...\n\nIf you want to create a utility to automate the process, I suggest\ncreating one that converts the texture input to Radiance picture\nformat, simultaneously outputting an appropriate material/pattern\ndefinition, which must be served as an input to obj2mesh, anyway.  If\nyou're ambitious, you could even look into translating the material\nparameters to Radiance's physically-based model.  Does this make sense?\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2mesh proposa", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J. Ward", "datetime": "Mon Feb 20 18:19:46 2006"}
