{"body": "\nHi all,\nI have a question about time needed to illumintate scene in radiance?\n\nI modeled a simple cube, but i created many models of that with different number of polygons.\nThe simples cube has 12 polygons (6 faces) and the most complex has about 5000 polygons.\n\nFor all different models that represent exactly the same cube, it tooks about 4 minutes to be illuminated (leaving all other parameters the same).\n\nWhy is that? Does this make sense?\n\nThank you!\nDespina\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050516/d3a798fe/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Despina Michael", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY22-DAV2E084168692E05E6F9C0590150@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon May 16 21:09:24 2005", "email": "despina_m81 at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] time need independent from number of faces?"}
