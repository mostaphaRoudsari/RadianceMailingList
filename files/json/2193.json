{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nBoth images look like they are suffering from image sampling errors.\nYou should try rendering these at higher resolution, setting -ps 1 in\nrpict (or \"set ps 1\" in rvu).\n\nI assume you're using the latest version of Radiance (3.6)?\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  If the problem persists and isn't just image sampling, please\nsend me your .OBJ file (compressed), and I'll have a look.  Don't\ncopy it to the mailing list, though.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj parser in obj2rad and obj2mesh", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DE16856C-3945-4023-B743-3806CFB77F5A@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<b08d0bd890d384147418906429628d03@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Tue May 17 20:01:35 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] obj parser in obj2rad and obj2mesh"}
