I have some unproven code to add this feature to\nRadout and dxf2rad, but have never had the time to look into it\nmore deeply, in order to understand how and if it actually works.\n\nTheoretically, you could also try to analyze the polygons in a\nradiance scene file, find out which ones have common edges, and\nif the difference between their normals is below a certain\nmargin, apply a texfunc to them, smoothing out that difference.\nNot very elegant, but possible. Note that Rayfront removes\nall modifiers when it imports geometry data, so that you will\nhave to edit the imported files in place.\n\nIf anyone can point me to really solid and understandable\ninformation about how to work with the \"barycentric coordinates\"\nthat gensurf uses for this purpose, then I'll try to get it to\nwork with the next releases of Radout and dxf2rad.\n\n\n\nThose illustrations are on my site because I'm currently working\non a plug-in to Rayfront that will allow a full and correct\nsimulation of (most of) those systems. Simulating them with\nRadiance alone is very exhaustive, and likely inaccurate in most\ncases. Radiance is not designed to handle multiple mirror\nreflections in tight spaces effectively. Of course, this doesn't\nhave to keep you from trying, just that you shouldn't put too\nmuch trust into the results.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\nPS: Didn't forget your other mail...\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mesh smoothing", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Fri, 3 Aug 2001 14:49:26 -0400 (EDT)"}
