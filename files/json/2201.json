We\nwould have to reorder the entire ray calculation in order to generate\nbundles of dissociated rays, as otherwise you naturally get a tree\nwith many daughter rays generated for each parent diverging in all\ndirections in your scene.  Grouping daughters together you get almost\nno coherence, and techniques for getting good ray bundles are fairly\ncomplicated.
