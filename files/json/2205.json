Render with caution...\n\nThe tee command is great, but you don't really need it as the \"File\"\nmenu in Terminal can save any selected text to a file, and of course\nthere's always cut and paste.  If you use tee, be sure to redirect\nstandard error to it as well, using |& in the C-shell or 1>&2 in bash\n(I think).\n\n\nFink, eww.  I installed it back when I was getting started on Darwin,\nbecause I thought I needed a utility.  10 hours of compiling later, I\nhad 100's of tools, but the one I wanted still wouldn't compile.  The\ndependency tree on that system is a nightmare....\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] MacBook Pro Report", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Feb 28 18:26:21 2006"}
