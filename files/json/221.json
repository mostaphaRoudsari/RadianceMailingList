Traditionally, the csh/tcsh\nused to be more practical for interactive use, while the sh/bash\nwas more suited for scripting. But I think those characteristic\ndifferences have become rather blurred over the  years.\n\nIn any case, it would probably be a good idea to get some kind\nof starters guide for unix/Linux, which will answer a whole lot\nof similar questions that are bound to come up very soon...\n\n\n\nIf you want to get the advantages of Perl without the headaches,\nthen I'd highly recommend Python instead. There's hardly anything\nthat you can't do with either of them, just that you'll still\nunderstand your Python programs when you look at them again after\na few weeks, which is not quite as certain with Perl.\n\nAgain, however, this is a matter of taste to a certain degree, so\nyou might want to have a look at both of them, and make up your\nown mind.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Linux installati", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Fri, 19 Jul 2002 10:02:18 -0400 (EDT)"}
