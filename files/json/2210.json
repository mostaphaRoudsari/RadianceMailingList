{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nWithout the benefit of photometric measurements, or having seen the\nmaterial of which you speak, it is quite impossible to usefully\nspeculate as to its behavior.  All I can say is that far-field\nreflectance should be an average of near-field behavior that is\nappropriately computed (averaged) in Radiance.  There can be issues\nwith noise depending on the model, but you shouldn't require two\ntypes of model for near and far field.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] sorry, again a question about gold mosaic", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2EE9655A-5E4B-4AC0-934D-64064632431B@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<632c14d44fde4a7185075279f265054f@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Mon May 23 19:41:47 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] sorry, again a question about gold mosaic"}
