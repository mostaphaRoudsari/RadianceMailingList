I used lots of obj's with obj2rad\nso far, and some in a more or less stupid way, converting them to\nmeshes, writing a mesh primitive in a file, scaling it and making an\ninstance of the file than. Now I would like to replace this stupid\nmesh-to-instance step, but I run into the problem that I cannot scale\nmy obj with obj2mesh. Is there noone else needing such an option? Or is\nthere a way to scale the object input? My problem is that I am using\nlots of files, scripted processing, and input my instances or meshes to\nreplmarks. But I cannot make sure that all my markers have the x-axis 1\nunit long (than I could use replmark's -s SCALE). I was thinking of\nwriting my mesh primitive in a small file, apply xform to this and use\nit than with replmarks -x. Still, it seams to be a silly way to deal\nwith the fact that my objs are in feet and my model in meter.\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 2134 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060228/4b695a34/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
