{"body": "\nHi Folks,\n\nI would be grateful if anyone would provide some insight to a problem I've\nbeen trying to resolve for some time:\n\nI am using fluorescent lamps in an office scene, and would like to model\ncolour temperatures of approx. 2200K and 6000K giving a warm white and\ndaylight white respectively.\n\nI have read through the Radiance manual but am a little confused still as to\nhow to set lamp format file (.fmt) to give me the required colours.\n\nI have generated a .dat file from the ies data for the lamp within which I\nset the colour to the default set at 0.907 0.863 0.4762: I believe that this\nrepresents 48 46 25% RGB values.\n\nHowever, when I run a lighting illuminance simulation the .lum file refers\nonly to the lamp .dat file and .fmt file (not the .rad file generated by\nies2rad). Now upond exploring the .fmt file it refers to the 'void lamp\nglow' in this instance its: 4 0 3.57 14.72 860\n\nI think that this may be the line I need to change to alter the colour?\nUnless it's already taken care of in the ies2rad conversion via the .dat\nfile in which case I need to alter the 0.907 0.863 0.4762 values relative to\ndesired K values. I'd be indebted to anyone that can provide the relevan\ncombination for the two lamp colours I'm looking for.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nAnthony Farrell\nDublin Institute of Technology\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org\nSent: 19 May 2005 16:34\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner@radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than\n\"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

They just don't have a diffuse\ncomponent.\n\n\nYour information is correct as far as I understand what you are saying.  If\nyou can fit your measurements to a Gaussian lobe distribution, you are\nbetter off using one of the native models\n(trans or trans2), as all ray paths will be followed appropriately.\nThe general BRDF types, transfunc, transdata, and BRTDfunc, only use the\ndirectional-diffuse lobe specified for interactions with light sources.\nGeneral ray sampling from an arbitrary distribution is quite expensive, and\nnot done in Radiance for that reason.\n\n\nThe diffuse portion of the window distribution through a prismatic glazing\nwill be computed by mkillum, leaving the \"specular\" (directional) portion to\nbe done during the final rendering.  This is the correct behavior, and you\ndon't have to treat it specially with mkillum, which is helpful for\nconsidering contributions from the sky, ground, and neighboring structures.\n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean, here.  If you have some way to simulate your\nexterior and measure the actual output distribution of the window system as\na light source, then you wish to represent that as a brightdata modifier on\na window polygon, this would work.  It's a very challenging measurement\nproblem, though, which is why no one has done it to my knowledge.  (Anyone\nout there have information on this?)\n\nThe purpose of mkillum of course is to create a light source from your\nsurface(s) by simulating an outdoor situation.  It doesn't always work,\nthough.  Specifically, mkillum has trouble resolving the contribution from\nthe sun through curved, specular reflectors and devices.  It can handle most\neverything else.\n\n\nMeasure and validate.  Repeat.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nHi  Federico,\n\nyour task cries for using photon-mapping...\n\nYou should model your shading system geometrically and use dielectric as\nmaterial (be careful about the surface orientation!). The diffusing material\ncan be modeled by trans material. If you have a complex scattering material,\nyou can adapt the trans material by an cal function. (Don't use BRTF-func or\ndata with the current photon-mapping version).\n\nTo be more efficient using the diffuse sky, you should define a photon-port,\nwhere all the photons are emitted to. Usually the photon-port material is\nthe window pane.\n\nThen you can simply run the simulations, direct and diffuse contributions\nshould be calculated correctly.\n\nLast but not least, there exist also a version of daysim containing\nphoton-mapping, so you can run these simulations also hourly (or other\ntimesteps) if you want. Unfortunately, the latest daysim version didn't\ncompile with the photon-mapping extension - but if you need it, you can use\nalso the older version, Christoph could provide it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nJan\n\nFederico Giovannetti wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050519/b\nf64c462/attachment.htm\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\n<radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nMessage-ID:\n<E83FC9AC306BD34B993F651FC8D772F82241C3@ldcexc01.global.arup.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nyou may also consider to have a look to radzilla\n\n;-)\n\nThis is a not official, not bullet proof, version of radiance that\nincorporates all new additions + some really crazy Carsten\noptimisations/changes/addons...\n\nIt seems really consistent and stable and I already modelled some prisms\nwith pmap within it (like a 500 modular prisms wall).\n\nIt works well!\n\nI believe it's worthy to try and I have been really impressed by the latest\ndevelopment.\n\nThe advantage over traditional radiance for me is that photon mapping is\nperformed through the rpict command without having to use mkpmap... but they\nmight be some bugs here of there.... watch out!\n\nciao,\n\ngiulio\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Federico\nGiovannetti\nSent: 19 May 2005 14:24\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHallo Greg Ward, hallo Radiance Community!\n\n\n\nI've been learning Radiance for a couple of weeks and i have to work\nintensively with it in the next weeks, as I4m investigating the energy\nsaving potential and visual comfort of systems combining angular selective\nand diffusing panes.\n\n\n\nNow I have to simulate a simple test-room with a complex fenestration, which\nincludes an exterior prismatic structure as shading device and a diffusing\npane for glare control.
