Rather than\ncreating your mesh instances directly with replmarks -I, instead\ncreate a single Radiance scene file for each mesh with the\nappropriate scale factor.  E.g., if you had a mesh called filecab.rtm\nthat needed to be rotated in x and scaled, you would also create a\nfile called filecab.rad that contains:\n\nvoid mesh filecab\n5 filecab.rtm -rx 90 -s 0.3048\n0\n0\n\nThen, you can use replmarks -x filecab.rad instead of -I, and\nreplmarks will load this file and add the other rotation and\ntranslation arguments necessary to put the object in the right place.\n\nDoes this help?\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2mesh and scaling?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Feb 28 23:17:01 2006"}
