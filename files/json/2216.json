So I guess you would need to turn the photo\ninto .pic file, and then somehow extract the pixel brightness data into\nanother file and interpret it, perhaps converting it to ies format? or\neven stright to .dat?\n\nam i wildly out, or somehow along the right lines. i'm thinking on my\nfeet, and there my well allready be something with in radiance to do all\nthis!\n\nthanks for the suggestion. off to look up HDR now!\nwill\n\n\n\nGregory J.
