{"body": "\nHi!\n\nCan I use -ae of rpict with an alias modifier? I have two layers of\nmodifiers here, one by object type, one by material. So e.g. I have a\nbunch of objects that get modified by \"marble_edgings\", and later, I\nuse \"void alias marble_edgings marble_grey_1\" to assign these objects\ntheir actual material. Now I want to exclude them from the ambient\ncalculation (as you can see by the name, these edgings are not really\nimportant, they are small-surface objects). Can I use -ae\nmarble_edgings, which is the alias, or do I have to use -ae\nmarble_grey_1, which is the (plastic) modifier?\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n\n(Yes, I tried with rvu, but didn't notice a big difference, that's why\nI have to ask now ;-)\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
