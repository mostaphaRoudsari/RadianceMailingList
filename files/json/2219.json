Rob Shakespeare\ndefinitely has some data but I don't think he's ever distributed it.\n(Greg, see what you can do; that symposium sounds really\ninteresting.)  A detailed process for obtaining datasets for\ntheatrical fixtures, including sharp & soft focus, is presented\n(again by Rob S.) in the Rendering with Radiance text.  I know you\nsaid you don't have facility access to make these measurements, but I\nthought you'd find it interesting nonetheless.\n\nIf you need color filter info, I have a spreadsheet that lists the\nrgb values for the Roscolux color filter line.  Rob S may have\nsomething similar.  I got mine from a guy at ETC a few years ago, but\nmust admit I have not used it at all (one of many back burner\nprojects), and can't vouch for its validity.\n\nThomas, sorry; the only electronic info I have on the ies format is\nfrom Ian Ashdown,s great paper \"Thinking Photometrically\" -- actually\ncoursenotes froma lecture he did a number of years ago -- and this\ndetails the earlier format.  I do own a copy of the latest spec\n(LM-63-02), so if there are any specific questions you had, I may be\nable to answer them.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] lighting fixtures data", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri Mar  3 20:31:02 2006"}
