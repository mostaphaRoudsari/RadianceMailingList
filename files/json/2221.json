The computer maintenance guy at school here helped\nme install Cygwin on my notebook computer and Radiance on top of it. I have\njust begun to learn Radiance and when I input a simple room as specified in\nthe Introduction chapter 1.3.1 of the book \"Rendering with Radiance\" by Greg\nWard Larson and Rob Shakespeare, I get the following errors:\n\n$ oconv room.rad > test.oct\noconv: fatal - <room.rad>: unknown type \"bright\"\n\n$rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct\nI get a windows pop up error message saying rvu.exe - Unable to locate\ncomponent, This application has failed to start because cybX11-6.dll was not\nfound. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.\n\nI used the NoteTab Light text editor to create the file room.rad.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed will be greatly appreciated. If somebody with\nworking knowlege of Cygwin/Radiance lives around Tempe/Phoenix/Mesa (Arizona\nState), I would like to get my notebook computer to you to make sure\neverything needed is installed properly. Please help.\n\nRegards,\n\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060304/1da8f103/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ramana Koti", "datetime": "Sun Mar  5 00:13:29 2006"}
