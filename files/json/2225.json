{"body": "\nHi group,\n\nI am modelling a lightpipe in Desktop radiance and as I read in the e-mail archive the best way to simulate it is the use of photon map so I am going to install Cgwin, Radiance and Photon map but I have, I think, a foundamental problem that is: I don't know how to draw and simulate the lens inside the dome of the lightpipe.\nIs there somebody who  can help me?\nIt is very urgent as I am preparing my degree thesis and I have little time to finish my work.\nPlease help me!!!\n\nStefano\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\n6X velocizzare la tua navigazione a 56k? 6X Web Accelerator di Libero!\nScaricalo su INTERNET GRATIS 6X http://www.libero.it\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "s.ponzetti@libero.it", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<IH3CBB$359D057B4FA9BD4F0CD28F51909E41E9@libero.it>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May 26 11:43:37 2005", "email": "s.ponzetti at libero.it", "subject": "[Radiance-general] simulation of a lightpipe"}
