(files.txt explains what\neverything is).\n\nbasically i've used the image to define the output distribution of a\nsource, and am then using that to light a room. the likely problems seem\nto me to be either:\n-some badly set arguments in my .rif file (i dont feel like i completely\nknow what im doing, so this seems quite possible!), or\n-a problem with the quality of the image im using to describe the source\ndistribution. it's not that good quality, but i didn't think it was that\nbad.\n\nalso, all i've been able to find about using hdr images in rendering is\nabout using an image showing the light distbution across a whole scene\nso that a entire scene can be lit by a single, large sperhical source\nsurrounding it. (at least, i think thats the idea!).\nwhat im trying to do is define the complete output of source as i'm\ntrying to model the effect of different combinations of sources on my\nscene. does anyone know of any literature out there that might be\nrelevant to this (i think simpler) approach?\n\nthanks for your help.\nwill\n\n\n\nGregory J.
