{"body": "\nJust wanted to add a word or two to Rob's excellent response...\n\n\nYes, the latest version should be in today's HEAD dump.  This is the\none of the main benefits I enjoy from Peter's CVS setup -- I get a\nlot of help finding bugs early on, rather than just after an official\nrelease (the most embarrassing time to find them).  The last version\nI checked in yesterday was:\n\nrtcontrib.c,v 1.5 2005/05/26 21:35:35 greg Exp\n\nYou can verify this ID by checking the top of the file ray/src/util/\nrtcontrib.c after downloading the HEAD release.  The SCONS scripts\nhave not been updated, so you'll have to use rmake to build it.\n\n\nIn my case, it's a combination of \"force of habit\" with being\nuncertain whether everyone/all_machines have Perl and Python\ninstalled these days.  I think they do, but I never learned either of\nthese languages, so that holds me back as well.  Most of the stuff I\ndo in C-shell scripts is straightforward, or at least it starts out\nthat way, otherwise I'd be writing a C program.  The scripts do tend\nto look pretty ugly, though.  (Not my fault -- you try to write a\n\"pretty\" C-shell script.  I challenge you!)  This also serves as a\ndisincentive for scripting, which I think is a good thing, as it\nkeeps the more complex tasks in a familiar C context.\n\nGetting back to rtcontrib, the first script I have in mind might\ngenerate annual simulations (animations) of a particular view using\ndaylight coefficients.  I may get side-tracked for a while before I\nget that one together, though.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RTCONTRIB", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5078E298-2263-40A0-B661-95CD80B33F7E@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<57600.209.212.87.250.1117203427.squirrel@209.212.87.250>"], "datetime": "Fri May 27 19:50:31 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RTCONTRIB"}
