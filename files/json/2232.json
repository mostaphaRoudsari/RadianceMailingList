{"body": "\n\nI just checked out the new rtcontrib program, following Greg's examples #2\n& 3 in the manpage to create two separate images of sources in a scene and\nrecombinig them with different values.  VERY COOL.  However, when I run\nthe command:\n\nvwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf | rtcontrib -ffc \\\n`vwrays -d -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf` @render.opt \\\n-o c_%s.pic -m light1 -m light2 scene.oct\n\nI get the following message:\nrtrace warning: zero ambient accuracy so \"test.amb\" not opened\n\n...but I did have -aa set to .1 (and this is in my render.opt file), and\nthere is a valid ambient cache.\n\nTwo questions:\na) Why is this happening?\n\nb) Is this the only reason for the direct-only component showing up in the\nrenderings, or is this the intended result of the command?  IOW, I was\nhoping to be able to create renderings that showed the net result of a\nsingle light source, but both its direct *and* indirect contributions to\nthe scene. Can this be done?\n\n--\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1220.209.212.87.250.1117229282.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 27 23:28:41 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cache"}
