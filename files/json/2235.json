So I dumped the -defaults to a\ntext file for you, and will send it (along with some renderings) to you in\na separate email.\n\n--\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cache", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<51207.68.36.127.169.1117253519.squirrel@68.36.127.169>", "refs": ["<1220.209.212.87.250.1117229282.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "<38D9F72A-1575-4788-A283-D2378A3A6C4E@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat May 28 06:12:41 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cache"}
