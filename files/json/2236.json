{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nI found the problem.  It has to do with your -ad 1536 value and the\nway I'm computing weights, which causes the ambient rays to drop\nbelow your -lw threshold.  I made a temporary fix that circumvents\nthe problem in this case, but I haven't checked it into CVS because I\nneed to think more carefully about how I'm computing ray weights in\nthis part of the code.  I'll check it in when I'm sure I have it\nright this times.\n\nThanks -- you're my alpha alpha tester!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cache", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DEB346A2-E07C-4C67-807D-292302BDBBBB@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<1220.209.212.87.250.1117229282.squirrel@209.212.87.250>", "<38D9F72A-1575-4788-A283-D2378A3A6C4E@gmail.com>", "<51207.68.36.127.169.1117253519.squirrel@68.36.127.169>"], "datetime": "Sat May 28 17:40:48 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib and ambient cache"}
