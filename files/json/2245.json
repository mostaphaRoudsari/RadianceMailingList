Cygwin is far from reliable in its\nability to run long, complicated processes.  (Polite way of saying\nthe system is buggy.)  I've had lots of problem reports on this, but\nthere's nothing whatever I can do about it.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] error messag", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
