I am using the maximum resolution of 1440 x 900 possible on my computer. I am attaching a screenshot in a jpg format. (I am using Cygwin)\n\nThanks,\nRamana.\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060310/2524ec88/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ramana Kot", "datetime": "Fri Mar 10 09:13:47 2006"}
