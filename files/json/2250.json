Maybe I will add some basic geometry later\n(using instances), but as the lamps are so small compared to the room, that\nis not urgent.\n\nI do the following at the moment:\n\n1) I have a file conataining one lamp (that is only one modifier and one\nsphere description at the moment.\n\n2) I build my clusters by !xform statements in one file per cluster. E.g. I\nhave conical arrangement (a bit like christmas trees), so the corresponding\nfile has some !xform-arrays to create circular groups of lights in differemt\nheigths and radius. I would put the mkillum-sphere in here, too.\n\n3) The clusters are placed by markers and the replmarks tools.\n\nAs I wrote this, I found how stupid it is to have the light modifier\ndefinition IN the lamp file (1), as this means that I have some thousand\ndefinitions of my lamp modifier now (after xforming them to arrays)... all\nthe same. The first I will change tonight!\n\nI think a close-up of a lght sphere is not interesting? ;-) But there have\nbeen nice flames for oil lamps modeled before with radiance. I will post an\nurl tonight to a paper describing it.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Mon Mar 13 10:30:44 2006"}
