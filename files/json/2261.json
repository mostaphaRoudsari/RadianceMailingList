{"body": "\nDear Greg,\n\nIf I have understood the RTCONTRIB description correctly, it has the\npotential to change the way one deals with Radiancec quite drastically, it\nsounds like an incredible valuable tool! How could I get my hands on it?\n\n//as a more personal question: c-shells? Have you been tempted by any of the\n//p-languages (Python, Perl, Php)? Excuse me for not being a *nix guru, but\n//I think it would be a good idea to code the c-shell scripts as a (Python?)\n//module? Speaking for myself myself, but it would ease up scripting\n//radiance considerably. Idea?\n\nCheers, Jelle.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<mailman.5.1117189336.370.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 27 12:22:17 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RTCONTRIB"}
