Hopefully, they will add MPEG-HDR encoder\nlibraries for Linux and OS X in the near future.  Don't let this stop\nyou, though.  You can always generate a sequence of HDR frames and\nfigure it out later.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Animation Contest", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
