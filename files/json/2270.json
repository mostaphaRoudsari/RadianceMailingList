I'm running the latest\nHEAD release on Ubuntu Linux (Breezy Badger) just for reference. For\nnow, I'm fine with using the \"split\" command as a workaround and\ncalculating the contributions in segments, but I was wondering if there\nis again perhaps something that I'm doing wrong?\n\nThanks,\n\nDave\n\nGregory J.
