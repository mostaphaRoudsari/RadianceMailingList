E.g. I guess I entered using Linux and being in an\nacademic environment at the time. This both changed, but I cannot edit,\nwhile the poll is going on and there are still new entries added. So I\nprefer a time-limited poll to reflect the community at one certain time or\nsomething more dynamic (editable and thus correctable) to reflect always the\nmost recent state. This is quite a bit of work of course, the Linux Counter\nProject is an example for such an approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the most interesting ressource for these issues is the\nmailing list, the questions and contributions posted show a lot of the\nuseage, maybe more then a poll will ever show.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Fri Mar 24 17:42:11 2006"}
