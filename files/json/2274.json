I don't think\nthere's much I can do about it if that's the case.  If someone has a\ncopy of the malloc.c module from glibc, I can take a look to see\nexactly where this check is happening, but that still doesn't give me\nmuch chance of fixing the problem if I can't reproduce it on my\nsystem.  There's nothing particularly funny or strange about my use\nof realloc() in rtcontrib.\n\nThe only possibility I can think of is that I'm passing an invalid\npointer to realloc(), which is somehow generating this error rather\nthan the expected one.  I checked my code, though, and I can't see\nhow this could happen.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace seg fault", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
