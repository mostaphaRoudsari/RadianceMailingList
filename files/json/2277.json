(24x365 = 8760 values for a point on\na work plane)\n\nIf any, what are the constraints to such a process and how can they be\novercome so as not to model each hour individually?\n\nI am using Radiance on Cygwin.\n\nThanks in advance,\nRamana.\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060325/aa00606b/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ramana Koti", "datetime": "Sun Mar 26 03:40:05 2006"}
