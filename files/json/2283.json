{"body": "\n\nHi there\n\nI'm trying to create a light probe similar to Debevec's Rendering synthetic\nobjects into real scenes and using the corresponding points in HDR shop I\ncreate the resulting probe following instructions on\nhttp://www.ict.usc.edu/graphics/HDRShop/tutorial/tutorial5.html\n\nTaking a closeup orthographic projection photo of the probe and then another at\n90 degrees rotated about the probe I match points and blend images using the\nformula with the given image mask. In the result I get 2 of everything, objects\n& light sources. I must be doing something wrong. Is it something to do with\nselecting the right points, or the positioning of the probe?\n\nThanks for any help\n\nTarik\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Tarik Rahman", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1116859471.4291ec4fbe658@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon May 23 16:45:10 2005", "email": "tarik.rahman at ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] light probe of objects on a table"}
