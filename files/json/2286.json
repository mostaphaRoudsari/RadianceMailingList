{"body": "\nHi List!\n\nI am sorry, I have asked so often about this, but as I have to model a\nroom with a lot of gold mosaic, which is not an easy material do\ndefine, here is one more question about this...\n\nSo far, I use a gold material (which has 100% specular reflection)\ntogether with a high roughness value (0.03). This gives me some visual\nimpression of a mosiac and the right color of gold (I use the measured\nvalues by Andrew Glassner).\n\nHowever, as for the indirect calculation, I wonder if I am completely\nwrong with this material. I have a specularity of 1.0 in my definition,\nwhile the effect of using this material as mosaic (not large, plane\nsheets of gold ;-) will in fact give a diffuse reflection in the large\nscale of e.g. a complete dome. So there is a difference in the material\nbehaviour between the scale of a single piece of mosaic (which is more\nor less planar and may have this 100% specular reflectivity) and the\nscale of the building, where the material is \"mosaic\" consisting of\nmillions of pieces, and diffuse.\n\nI once planned to do some experiments with some kind of a \"virtual\nphotometer\", where I could measure the output of a modeled sample from\nvarious directions. I did not do so simply because of a lack of time.\nAnd I was quite pleased by the effect of using the roughness parameter.\nNow I am worried, because I wonder if the diffuse effect of the mosaic\nwill be neglected in the indirect calculation?\n\nThank You for any help, have a nice week-end, CU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
