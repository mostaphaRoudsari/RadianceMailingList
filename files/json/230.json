{"body": "\nOne of the new features in Radiance 3.4 is a von Kries white-point\ntransform built into the -p option of pcond (and other programs).  This\ntransform does a reasonable job of simulating the apparent colors under\na different illuminant, and is an improvement over the straight color\ntransform that was used previously.  However, when you have a mixture of\nilluminants in your rendered scene, there is no accepted adaptation\ntransform for such a condition.  A number of researchers have worked on\nthis problem, and no one has proposed a workable solution to my\nknowledge.  The best you can do is pick an average of the illuminants\nthat seems right for the part of the scene you are viewing.\n\nThe issue of white balance is separate from the issue of spectral\nrendering, but as long as we're on the topic, one of the things people\nhave requested over the years is a means for full spectral rendering in\nRadiance.  As it turns out, this is difficult for the very silly reason\nthat all the materials and patterns have arguments whose count would\nchange with the number of spectral samples.  Choosing anything other\nthan three samples will make Radiance input files incompatible with the\nchange.  In hindsight, it would have been much better to do things the\nway I did them in the Material and Geometry Format (MGF), which\nseparates color into its own entity, with a number of different ways to\nspecify it.\n\nBe that as it may, it is possible to obtain accurate spectral renderings\nof a scene with a single illuminant, provided you precompute the\nadjusted RGB color of the surfaces using a technique I described in my\nmost recent paper at the Color Imaging Conference.  You can get a PDF\ncopy of the paper through the link below if you want to read about the\ndetails.\n\n-Greg\n\nhttp://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/gwlarson/papers.html\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Color appearance and color temperature", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<76669BDC-1BF9-11D6-ADF6-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 7 Feb 2002 10:35:30 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Color appearance and color temperature"}
