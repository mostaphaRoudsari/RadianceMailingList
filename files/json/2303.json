I think that I might have used a different\nand older source package when I compiled the first cygwin version,\nwhich also doesn't include the -G option.\nAt least I've understood that I didn't change the gendaylit code :P\n\nI also agree with John about the weather data measurement accuracy,\nand usually totally discard the direct normal solar component if lower\nthan 120 W/m2, as recommended by the WMO. I think S@tel-Light uses\na similar threshold to decide whether there is direct sun or not.\n\nCiao,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] subtended sun angle in gensky and gendaylit", "tags": [], "sender": "pisuke@blueyonder.co.uk", "datetime": "Tue Apr  4 23:37:49 2006"}
