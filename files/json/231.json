Plus variants like \"polished\" \"slightly\npolished\" etc. One may supply photographs of the real thing, but I'm not\nsure that's good enough.\nSecondly, measuring materials (spectral and/or angular) is, even with\nautomated and fast machinery, some work, data processing and modeling\nare too, especially for an easily increasing number of materials, such\nas in a catalogue.\n\nIt'll be very valuable to get feedback from users how they would use any\nform of catalogue - education or project work, for filling in data when\nno materials are given in a project or for matching a given material in\na project ?\n\nI had the idea of compiling a reference sample catalogue, around 8-12\nmaterial samples (e.g. 3x6cm) initially, plus their measurement data and\nfitted Radiance model. Would be quite handy for projects and feasible\ntoo, using my 12 year old, still used and fully automated\ngonio-photometer at FhG-ISE or a newer one, but I doubted there'll be\nenough interest.\n\nAny comments welcomed\n-Peter\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Fri, 02 Aug 2002 15:59:09 +0200"}
