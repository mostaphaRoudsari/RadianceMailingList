Radiance\nhas various optimisations -- one of them is to assume that the\noverall environment  reflectance is 0.5 (Greg, is that right?).\nThat's fine for most realistic architecture.  Your situation is more\nlike an integrating sphere.  From an earlier (private) exchange with\nGreg regarding a \"dodgy\" validation where this effect showed up:\n\n\nIt sounds like you have one of those \"bizarre test cases\".  Which is\nfair enough given the setting.\n\n-John\n\nPS.
