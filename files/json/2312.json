This sounds suspiciously like a bug, and it may be\nrelated to the sampling bias problem that Rick Mistrick and Younju\nYoon ran across in their work at State College (Pennsylvania).  It\nonly shows up in very particular situations, but maybe yours is one\nof them.\n\nIf you don't mind, please send me your test scene privately, and the\ncommands you used to generate your results.\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Question on Setting ambient parameters", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
