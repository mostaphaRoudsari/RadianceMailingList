In order to install\nDesktop Radiance, you can follow these instructions ->\nhttp://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/arch447/fall2005/Radiance/Instal\nlDesktopRadiance.html.

I would like to know how to import\nfrom Ecotect to Radiance. I already have my building defined in 3D by\nthe software Ecotect, I tried it but it seems to have a problem and the\nrendering image does not work. Does anybody had this problem before and\nknows how to solve it?\n\nIn the documentation of Ecotest it was said that you have to create a\ncamera view inside the building and then exporting to radiance simply\nbut it could happen that there is an installation issue and the windows\nthat is supposed to appear disappear.\n\nAt this first step I really do not know what\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060419/97b38c4a/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Apr 19 19:10:12 2006"}
