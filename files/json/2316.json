I have the spectrum\nof the filter and calculated the RGB color values. Shall i make a normal\nglass cylinder and on top a disc of glass with the RGB values multiplied\nwith the transmittance of the filter? Or would you suggest the trans\nmaterial ?\n\n2. I have .ies data of a rectangular flood light and convert it into a\nradiance file. Although the resulting Polygon is glowing,   the light\noutput  seems to come from the middle of the polygon and not from the\nwhole area. Is this correct?\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Fusenig", "datetime": "Wed Apr 19 21:06:21 2006"}
