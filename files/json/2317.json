If you set the -dj option to something between 0.5\nand 0.8, you will sample over a larger subregion.  (A setting of -dj\n1 is allowed, but only works if all the sources in your scene are\nrectangular.)\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<44468A27.8070605@gmx.de>", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
