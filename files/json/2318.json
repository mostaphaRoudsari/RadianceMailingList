{"body": "\nHi,\n\nthis is quite a FAQ. There are libraries available, however, if you\nexactly know the material you want to simulate, it is often desireable\nto use a real sample and not a \"generic\" material description that may\nvary from the one you will use. Still these libraries are valuable, as\nthey give an idea of how it might look like, and some are simply\nmeasured data files. The most popular material library is the one that\ncomes with Radiance, it is called materials.rad and you find it in the\nlib directory. There are great libraries on the mgf-website, go to\nradsite.lbl.gov, and take a look at the mgf pages. You can use mgf2rad\nto convert these libraries to the material format that is used by\nradiance.\n\nFinally, there are a lot of ways to generate your own material\ndescriptions. You should really take a look at the book \"rendering with\nradiance\". There are different methods, from \"guess and compare\" to\nmeasurements with special equipment. I have used \"calibrated\"\nphotographs, with the help of the mabbethcal utility.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material definition", "sender": "Lars O.
