The limited reflection &\ntransmittance capability of Lightscape does not allow for really\ncomplex material definitions.  In addition, most other lighting\ndesign calculation programs used in the US (Lumen Micro, AGI,\netc) don't support anything more than a reflectance value.  So long\nago I adopted this simplified method of material definition in\nLightscape.  Our models are greyscale representations of spaces.\nWe like to think of them as \"electronic foam core models\". We shy\naway from hyper realism in the interest of time, and also in the\ninterest of reducing the number of variables.\n\nBut I've always wanted to learn Radiance, and the latest debacle\nwith Lightscape going the way of the dinasour (and the advent of\nOS X) have pushed me into the radiance camp at long last.  So\nnow I have this wonderfully capable calculation program, and\nsuddenly have all these possibilities in terms of materials and\nreflection models.  It's exciting, but daunting.\n\nSo, a catalog of materials with known properties, perhaps tested\nwith your gonio-photometer would allow me to create Radiance\nmodels that I could stand behind.  Even if it's not all-inclusive, at\nleast if there were a selection of common materials with known\nperformances, we could use them and then extrapolate as\nnecessary, until a more fully-developed library is created.\n\n\nWell, I for one *am* interested!!  I actually have been meaning to\nask you if your device is available to test submitted samples,\nPeter.  I'm involved in a 1/2-scale gallery mockup right now, costing\nthe museum client hundreds of thousands of dollars, because\nLightscape was in no way up to the challenge of testing the\nglazings.  Radiance probably could have, but not without good\nBRDF data.  Only way to obtain that is with your gonio-photometer.\nWould this be an option in the future, perhaps for a fee?  We send\nyou samples, you send us data files?\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nRob Guglielmetti\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] An open materials library?", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri, 2 Aug 2002 11:21:09 -0400"}
