{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\n\nYou can pick up the main points of what's changed by browsing the\nReleaseNotes file in ray/doc/notes.  This is a simple, chronological\nlisting of changes since time memorial.  I also recommend downloading\nmy presentations from past Radiance workshops on code changes.  Each\nyear for the past few years I've given a summary of \"what's new\" at\nthe workshop.  These are available from www.radiance-online.org under\n\"Intl. Radiance workshops\" on the main (left) frame.\n\n\nLooks like you might have forgotten to download the required\noverlay.  Is there even a ray/src/px/tiff directory on your system?\nThe file you want is called \"rad3R6P1supp.tar.gz\" and is available\nfrom the downloads page.  Install it _right_over_ your previously\ndownloaded HEAD directory.  (Very important.)  Then try to recompile.\n\nIn future, just send me those error listings, to save load on the\nlist.  Thanks.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Compiling RTcontrib on linux", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D01B65FD-B36E-4C5F-B7E0-0D27F602118C@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<429d7ce9.50ab9567.425a.ffffcee0SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Jun  1 17:10:13 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Compiling RTcontrib on linux"}
