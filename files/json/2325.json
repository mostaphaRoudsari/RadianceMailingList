{"body": "\nI measured the intensity distribution of one emitting patch of a lightpipe in 1988. The pipe used the 3M film, but had a square cross section and glowing sides. See the intensity distribution and the luminance distribution along the full lightpipe length at\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/lightpipe\n\nThe intensity distribution was measured approximately at the center of the length of the pipe.\n\nMarin Moeck, Penn State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom:\tradiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Anthony J.

There are several correlations of light depreciation with lightpipe\ndepth, and of course the light pipe reflectance is key to this. Most light\npipes are 97 - 99 per cent specular reflective. Could you please elaborate\nhow one would implement the glow material and brightfunc relative to a given\nrelation and light pipe reflectance?\n\nRegards,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n--\nThis message has been scanned for content and\nviruses by the DIT Information Services MailScanner\nService, and is believed to be clean.\nhttp://www.dit.ie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 3338 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050602/c8426f52/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Martin Moeck", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C23443E@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun  2 17:32:31 2005", "email": "MMoeck at engr.psu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Light pipe intensity photometric data"}
