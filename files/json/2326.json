{"body": "\nthe simplest way to proceed is to create an equation that links a\ncoordinate to the radiance of the surface in form of a multiplier (hence\nthe equation is between [0,1]).\nyou may use a cal file or directly express it into the brightfunc\ndefinition.\n\nAs an example:\nSupposing the relation between light output and distance is this:\n(you may use the proper equation here)\n\ny = a*x*x + b\nand\ny= 0 when x = 1000m\ny = 1 when x = 0\n\nit would be:\n\ny = -0.000001*x*x+1\n\nthat becomes an 'if' sentence to avoid negative values...\ny = if(-0.000001*x*x+1, -0.000001*x*x+1,0)\n\nPutting all together I would define a light material this way:\n\nvoid light max\n0\n0\n3 100 100 100\n\nmax brightfunc light\n2 'if(-0.000001*Px*Px+1,-0.000001*Px*Px+1,0)' .\n0\n0\n\nlight cylinder pipe\n0\n0\n7\n0 0 0\n2000 0 0\n.125\n\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\nwhite polygon base\n0\n0\n12\n0 -10 -3\n0 10 -3\n2000 10 -3\n2000 -10 -3\n\nif it is ok you should see half cylinder black and the other half with a\ngradient. Remember to use really low -ds 0.01.\nCiao,\nGiulio\n\n\nNOTE: Unfortunately the uv trick doesn't work here, since you need light\nand you cannot nest it into instances (and meshes).\nHopefully your light pipe follows a simple direction like Px, Py or\nPz... otherwise you need to change the equation a little (you may also\nfind another equation...).\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Giulio Antonutto", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB508EB4F@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun  2 17:38:28 2005", "email": "Giulio.Antonutto at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Light pipe"}
