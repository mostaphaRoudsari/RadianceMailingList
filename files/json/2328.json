{"body": "\nAnthony, the results were never published. I was a grad. student back then and this was an independent study. It is a hollow prismatic standard lightpipe. I have a cylindrical lightpipe here and believe the results should be quite similar.\n\nMartin\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Fri 6/3/2005 6:28 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nCc:\n\n\nThanks Marin for the photos and data from your experiments, this is most\ninteresting; I am carrying out experiments on hollow mirror lightpipes, I\nnote yours was a square duct.\n\nI measured the intensity distribution of one emitting patch of a lightpipe\nin 1988. The pipe used the 3M film, but had a square cross section and\nglowing sides.\n\nIs it a solid light pipe or hollow, is it prismatic standard transparent?\n\nSee the intensity distribution and the luminance distribution along the full\nlightpipe length at\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/lightpipe\n\nThese are interesting results. Have you published (Thesis, conference,\npapers?)\n\nThe intensity distribution was measured approximately at the center of the\nlength of the pipe.\n\nThanks again for this interesting overview of your work.\n\n\nthe simplest way to proceed is to create an equation that links a coordinate\nto the radiance of the surface in form of a multiplier (hence the equation\nis between [0,1]).\nyou may use a cal file or directly express it into the brightfunc\ndefinition.\n\n\nGuilio, thanks for the example, I'll try implement it for my cylindrical\nlight pipe.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n--\nThis message has been scanned for content and\nviruses by the DIT Information Services MailScanner\nService, and is believed to be clean.\nhttp://www.dit.ie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5614 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050603/7ada9202/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Anthony J.
