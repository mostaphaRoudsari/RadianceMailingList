However DR does have a\ngui of sorts whereas Radiance is really a toolset of applications that\nare typically utilized via the command line on unix/linux/osx type\noperating systems. There are a few other frontends including Rayfront\n(www.schorsch.com).\n\nDepending on what you are going to end up doing with Radiance it can be\nvery worthwhile to learn how to use the command line version on\nunix/linux/osx as the os.\n\nYou will also need a modeling application such as Autocad, Rhino or some\nother application that can output the correct geometry format (.obj\nformat files for example).\n\nHope this helps as a starting point.\n\n-Jack\n\nChris Jessee wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] desktop vs compile?", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Apr 20 23:36:00 2006"}
