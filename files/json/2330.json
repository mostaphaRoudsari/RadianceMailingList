{"body": "\nHi Martin,\n\nRtcontrib required some rather extensive changes to the diffuse\ninterreflection methods, which definitely introduced one or two bugs\nthat I have since fixed.  You need to make sure you have the latest\nHEAD release, as I suspect you picked up a buggy version of src/rt/\nambcomp.c or similar.  If you recompile with last night's HEAD and\nstill have problems, send me a list of the options you're using in\nmkillum and I'll see if I can figure it out.  I did my own test runs\nthis morning to check that it's behaving correctly, and I couldn't\nfind anything wrong.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: New rtcontrib program - mkillum conflict", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7AC14905-4424-4FF5-9845-4115C684828E@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C23444B@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>"], "datetime": "Sun Jun  5 21:48:52 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: New rtcontrib program - mkillum conflict"}
