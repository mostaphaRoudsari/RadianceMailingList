{"body": "\n\nHi there\n\nWhen trying to illuminate objects with a light probe made from an indoor scene\nis it best to generate a cubic cross map in HDRShop and then map each of the 6\nsides onto the room walls as 'glow' textures? Because as it is a small scene\nwith small intense sources, when I use genbox, I never know which is the best\nsize box to illuminate the objects, i.e. get them in the right position as if\nw.r.t. the light source.\nIs the best option to use mksource? If I need to map my light probe onto a\ndistant glow source rather than a large box, what should the geometric\ndescription for that distant glow source be? When creating a mask to combine\nprobe images in HDRShop, since there is no reflection of a camera/camerman in\nthe probe (it's a simulation picture rendered with Radiance) what other\nartefacts is the mask needed for?\n\nThanks for any help\n\nTarik\n--\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Tarik Rahman", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1118060887.42a4415743f7e@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun  6 14:28:42 2005", "email": "tarik.rahman at ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminating objects with a light probe"}
