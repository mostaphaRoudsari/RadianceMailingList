Can i take 0.624 ?\nAs i understand it, my resulting RGB components should be the same as\nyour example normalized ones.\nThen i would apply them to trans.cal to get the normal transmission.\nMaybe i am dead wrong but thats how i see it.\nThanks,\n\nChristian\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060421/dd4c672e/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<20060420185209.12868gmx1@mx058.gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Fusenig", "datetime": "Fri Apr 21 13:05:18 2006"}
