{"body": "\nHello,\n\nscene\nthe 6\nscene\nbest\nif\n\nIf you are going to move the viewpoint around, the closer the geometry of\nthe light probes to the scene geometry, the better. In that case, I guess\nthe box should have the size of the room. However, this depends on where was\nthe camera (or mirrored ball, or viewpoint) when getting the probes.\n\n\nmksource can help improve results and speed, specially if you have small\nsources.\nThe description is vey similar, only you map the probe onto a source object\nlike this:\n\nvoid colorpict sourcemap\n7 red green blue input_image.hdr fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v\n0\n0\n\nsourcemap glow sourceglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nsourceglow source source_1\n0\n0\n4 0 1 0 180\n\nThis works for hemispheric light probes and the result will be maped in the\nhemisphere +Y.\nIf you look into fisheye.cal:\n\nfish_u = .5 + Dx/fish_Rxz * fish_Ry;\nfish_v = .5 + Dz/fish_Rxz * fish_Ry;\n\nfish_Rxz = sqrt(Dx*Dx + Dz*Dz);\nfish_Ry = acos(Dy) / PI;\n\nthe very last \"/PI\" works for hemispheric probes. If you are using a 360\ndeg. probe, you should change this for \"/(2*PI)\", and the last line in the\ndesciption for \"4 0 1 0 360\".\n\n\nI`m sorry I cannot help with this one, I haven`t used it.\nRegards,\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminating objects with a light probe", "sender": "Santiago Torres", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ABEIIOCILNBBDDEPEPICCEKCCFAA.tiago@tkh.att.ne.jp>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun  6 16:37:26 2005", "email": "tiago at tkh.att.ne.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminating objects with a light probe"}
