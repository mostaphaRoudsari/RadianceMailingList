A transmission is the thing in your car that shifts\ngears...  In fact, I think the term is used interchangeably in a more\ninformal context with total transmittance.\n\nTotal transmittance takes into account reflections and\ninterreflections (and absorbtion) inside the glass, and is the\neasiest value to measure.\n\n\nActually, the Y value of transmittance can change for different light\nsources.  What you should do is multiply the value you were given\n(0.624) by the Y you get with your source spectrum, divided by the Y\nyou get when you use their reference source spectrum.  The confusing\npart is that you need to normalize the two spectra using the Y value\ncomputed from each WITHOUT your glass transmittance spectrum.\n\nIs this clear enough?  I know it's confusing, but I don't know how to\nexplain it any better without adding a bunch of pictures and diagrams.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4448BC61.1050009@gmx.de>", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
