{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm rendering out an animation with Radiance which basically is a dissolving\ncube.\n\nThing is that it's a bit pointless to use similar settings for a\nCornell-like box almost closed box, than a cube which is almost completely\nopen. So in order to get a more intelligent rpict settings based on the open\nsurface area  would be a good start. Now my question would be whether\npossible rad (don't think so) takes this relation into account, or has\nanyone another suggestion of doing so.\n\nRight now, I'm making a couple of rough intermediary tests, try to come up\nwith a couple of reasonable settings, and interpolate through them, but it\nwould be cool to do this in a more formal manner, such that will be an\nadvantage for later on since it could be quite useful.\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050608/cd5307b5/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<mailman.7.1118240740.370.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jun  8 16:25:41 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] relation between area & rpict settings"}
