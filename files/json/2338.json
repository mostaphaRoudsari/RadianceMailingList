{"body": "\nDear Greg,\n\nI uploaded some images to: www.ezct.net/radiance/rpict_area_settings/\nCurrently I'm using the following rpict parameters:\n\nrpict.exe -vf render.vf -ab 3 -ar 512 -ad 512 -ps 1 -as 512 -x 1500 -y 1500\n\nwhich is pretty basic, but as you'll see in the last frame is fast and\nartifact free, whereas there's little open area in the initial frame, which\nof course leads to artifacts.\n\nI'm rendering out a animation which shows a cube dissolving in space, each\nframe cuts out a certain area of the box, slowly leaving it to dissolve.\nI figure having the open area parameter drive the Radiance parameters would\nbe a good approach, wouldn't it?\n\nCheers,\n\nJelle.\n\n******\nHi Jelle,\n\nWhat would be useful is a web link to some of your images, so we can\nsee your model and the artifacts you are facing.\n\n-Greg\n******\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<mailman.8.1118314395.370.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun  9 12:53:15 2005", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict settings & open area  relation"}
