Dana\nBram Van Ginneken\n\n\nShree K. Nayar\nJan J. Koenderink\n\n\n\nResearchers at Columbia University and Utrecht University have collaborated\nin an extensive investigation of the visual appearance of real-world\nsurfaces. This joint effort, sponsored in part by REALISE of the European\nCommission, the National Science Foundation and by DARPA/ONR under the MURI\nGrant No. N00014-95-1-0601 has resulted in 3 databases:\n\nBRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) database with\nreflectance measurements for over 60 different samples, each observed with\nover 200 different combinations of viewing and illumination directions.\nBRDF parameter database with fitting parameters from two recent BRDF models:\nthe Oren-Nayar model and the Koenderink et al. representation. These BRDF\nparameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis.\nBTF (bidirectional texture function) database  with image textures from over\n60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of\nviewing and illumination directions. Each of these databases is made publicly\navailable for research purposes. For details about the measurements, and\nfitting procedures a technical report and summary paper are provided.
