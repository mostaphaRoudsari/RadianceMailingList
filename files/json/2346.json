No luminares are defined.The runs are solely daylight. I am\nusing an already built space. The location used is Dubai (United Arab\nEmirates), and because this location is not available I had to define it.\nAlthough I had all the required parameters, when I do the runs the results\ndoes not seem to  change, and to check it out correctly I tried to do the\nruns during night times, around 10 pm and to my surprise I had light in\nthe space.\nCould anyone help..\n\nThank you,\nMaitha Dalmouk\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 4259 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060424/2947e57d/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Maitha Dalmouk Al-Nuaim", "datetime": "Mon Apr 24 22:28:47 2006"}
