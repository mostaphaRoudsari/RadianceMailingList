{"body": "\nUnfortunately, the RGB coordinates I chose for Radiance predated\n(slightly) those chosen for sRGB, and they don't quite agree.  In fact,\nthe red and blue primaries are the same, only the green primary differs\nslightly.  The gamut of the Radiance color space is therefore slightly\nlarger than sRGB, but not significantly larger.  It would be much better\nof course if they were the same, but it was a couple of years before I\nnoticed the difference as sRGB came into vogue, and I didn't want to\nmake a change that would affect the colors of all my rendered images,\nhowever slightly.  If you like, you may redefine the primaries in the\nmain src/common/color.h to match the sRGB primaries, like so:\n\n*** color.h     Wed Oct 21 17:48:07 1998\n--- color_srgb.h        Fri Feb 15 07:53:50 2002\n***************\n*** 60,73 ****\n#define  CIE_x_w              0.3333          /* use true white */\n#define  CIE_y_w              0.3333\n#else\n! #define  CIE_x_r              0.640           /* nominal CRT\nprimaries */\n#define  CIE_y_r              0.330\n! #define  CIE_x_g              0.290\n#define  CIE_y_g              0.600\n#define  CIE_x_b              0.150\n#define  CIE_y_b              0.060\n! #define  CIE_x_w              0.3333          /* use true white */\n! #define  CIE_y_w              0.3333\n#endif\n\n--- 60,74 ----\n#define  CIE_x_w              0.3333          /* use true white */\n#define  CIE_y_w              0.3333\n#else\n! #define  CIE_x_r              0.640           /* sRGB primaries */\n#define  CIE_y_r              0.330\n! #define  CIE_x_g              0.300\n#define  CIE_y_g              0.600\n#define  CIE_x_b              0.150\n#define  CIE_y_b              0.060\n! #define  CIE_x_w              0.3127          /* Illuminant D65 */\n! #define  CIE_y_w              0.3290\n!\n#endif\n-------------------\nYou'll notice above that I also use \"equal energy white\" for the\nRadiance white point, i.e., neutral.  I chose this rather than the sRGB\nstandard of D65 because it avoids the need to specify non-white sources\nto achieve color-balanced pictures.  This is less of a problem with\n3.4's incorporation of the von Kries transform, so using D65 in Radiance\nshould work OK now so long as you render things with this in mind.\nThinking about it now, I'm still a little muddy on what the exact\nprocedure should be; I've gone so long skirting these issues in my\nwork....\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance RGB definition", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FB131B7C-222C-11D6-AF47-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 15 Feb 2002 07:59:23 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance RGB definition"}
