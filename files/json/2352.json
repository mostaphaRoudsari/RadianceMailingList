For this reason, I feel that I'm using \"texfunc\" in an improper\nway for what I need. My objective is to modify the x, y and/or z normals\nof a surface in order to analize how much R, G and/or B is being\nabsorbed/reflected. I know that depending on the texture of a surface, for\nexample, shortwavelenghs of the spectrum are more reflected than the short\nwaves of the spectrum. What I need is to create a \"bumpy\" surface in order\nto see how much blue is reflected depending on the scale of this\n\"bumpiness\" ( from very small scale-microscale, if possible, to\nmacroscale) and by having control of the perturbation of the x, y and z\nnormals. Is there a logic way in how to do this?\n\nAdriana\n\n\n\n\nAdriana Lira\nMaster in Design Studies, 2003\nCandidate for Doctor in Design Studies\nHarvard Graduate School of Design\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Textures: perturbations in x,y,z normals", "tags": [], "sender": "alira@gsd.harvard.edu", "datetime": "Tue Apr 25 01:29:16 2006"}
