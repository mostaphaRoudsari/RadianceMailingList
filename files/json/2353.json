Few\nray-tracing systems do.  Diffraction becomes important when the scale\nof surface variations (texture or thin films) is on the order of the\nwavelength of light, less than a micron or so.  For this, you need a\ntool such as Code V from ORA:\n\nhttp://www.opticalres.com/news/cv96.html\n\nI believe they have student pricing for their tools.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Textures: perturbations in x,y,z normals", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
