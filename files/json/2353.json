{"body": "\nI have 4 IES files applied to each luminaire octree I want to create,\nwhich I think is adding complexity to this issue.  I have tried what I\nthink is basically the work-around method outlined.  I am testing it\nwith this rad file:\n\n### test_oct.rad\nvoid                  alias  l_room                grey_090\n!xform scene/l_room.rad\n\n!replmarks -x parts/campo_full.rad l_test_oct scene/l_test_oct.rad\n### end file\n\nwhich refers to\n### campo_full.rad\nvoid                  alias  l_reflector           grey_090\n!xform scene/l_reflector.rad\n\nvoid                  alias  l_metal               stainless_steel\n!xform scene/l_metal.rad\n\nvoid                  alias  l_glow                campo_glow\n!xform scene/l_glow.rad\n\n!replmarks -x luminaire/hessamerica+++ca45-71r+++6500.rfl l_ies\nscene/l_ies.rad\n### end file\n\nThe \"luminaire/hessamerica+++ca45-71r+++6500.rfl\" file is basically the\noutput of ies2rad (rayfrontized) for a single ies file.  Since I have 4\nof these, and the default ies2rad output is a box centered around the\norigin, i have this extra replmarks (which has used -x all along) to put\nthese 4 distributions in place relative to the luminaire goemetry (\nwhich is described by the xformed rad files rather than an instanced\noctree -- does this matter)\n\nI still am getting no light. in my test_oct.rad scene description.  What\nam I still missing?  The only octree being made is the final scene\noctree for \"test_oct.rad\".\n\nThis url shows a low-quality rendering of the fixture I am dealing with:\nhttp://www.archenergy.com/services/sda/tools/campo/\n\nThanks!\nZack\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<42BADDB8.6080104@archenergy.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun 23 18:05:55 2005", "email": "zrogers at archenergy.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Luminaire octree"}
