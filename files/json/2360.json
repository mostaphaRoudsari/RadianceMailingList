{"body": "\n\nThe bounding box illum was made by ies2rad, so it's been correctly\nscaled, using boxcorr and everything.  So I don't think the problem is\nrelated to this.\n\nI am using Rayfront for most of this, I just go into the files when\nneeded, ie. to take out the sky when creating the lum geom octree.  I\ntried, within Rayfront (my 2nd attempt), to have 4 markers for each of\nthe ies files + 1 marker for lum_geom (overlap between octree bounding\nand ies cubes) and did not get any light output.\n\nThanks for all the feed back.  I have alot of alternative methods to\nplay with now.  Jack, your example makes sense and seems to be\nessentially what I tried for my 3rd attempt.  I will try reorganizing\nsomewhat and see if I can get it to work.\n\nThanks!\nZack\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<42BB12C1.7080304@archenergy.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun 23 21:52:11 2005", "email": "zrogers at archenergy.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Luminaire octree"}
