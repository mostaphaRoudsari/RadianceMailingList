My initial report, posted to radiance-online.org:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003446.html\n\nI also posted some rants and raves on my website:\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/2006/02/27/woohoo\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/2006/03/02/good-and-bad\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/2006/04/09/windows-on-mac\n\nAnd you will notice that my system is currently listed fourth fastest on\nMark Stock's Radiance benchmark page, here:\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html\n\nAll in all I'm thrilled with it, but the squeal is still there (see my\n\"good and bad\" post for details), and I haven't called Apple about it\nyet.  But it's very fast, the display is crisp, and I finally have an OS\nX computer that can run AutoCAD.   I'm hopeful that Parallels gets their\nact together and figures out how to allow the virtualized windows disk\nto share with the Apple filesystem, but it also sounds like Apple's\nworking on their own solution for this.\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Opinions from MacBook Pro users", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Tue Apr 25 17:41:23 2006"}
