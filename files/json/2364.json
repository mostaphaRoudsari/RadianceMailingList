{"body": "\nHi Lebele,\n\nSounds like you have a compatibility issue between different versions\nof X11.  Try changing the \"-I/usr/include/X11\" in your rmake to \"-I/\nusr/X11R6/include\" and see if that works.  (You'll have to run\n\"makeall clean\" beforehand.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Compile error on AMD running Fedora 4", "sender": "Gregory J.
