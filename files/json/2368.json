I have\ninformed everybody that has already expressed an interest (e-mail\nsent 26 April) but I expect there are others that have not yet\ncontacted me.\n\nI will post a flyer about the event next week once I get some details\nabout presentations that have already been offered.\n\nRegards,\n\n-John Mardaljevic\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Thu Apr 27 17:43:27 2006"}
