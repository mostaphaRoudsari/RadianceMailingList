I am working with radiance for university projects\nhere. On the other hand, I have my little collection of marble surfaces that\nI got from my current work.\n\nBTW, while not really fitting to the subject line, do you have a MacOS X\nversion of rshow? A friend of mine started with radiance on OS X, and there\nis a nice previewer missing ;-)\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] An open materials library?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
