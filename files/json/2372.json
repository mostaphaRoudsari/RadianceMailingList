{"body": "\nI am happy to say, after minor brain damage, that I successfully created\nmy luminaire block.  My problem, initially, was due to the Radiance\nlimitation that light cannot be included in an instance.  My problem\nwith the workaround, any of those discussed I think would work - just\ndifferent ways of assembling the pieces, was that I was refering to a\n*.rad file in a my \"./parts\" directory.  However, inside the *.rad file\nwere references to my \"./scene\" directory which is not a subdirectory of\n\"parts\" but at the same level.  My RAYPATH definition has the current\ndirectory \".\" as a path and so it was simply not finding the files...a\nmistake I probably would have noticed sooner had I not been using a\nRadiance interface (rayfront) and a mistake I probably would have never\nnoticed had I not jumped behind the scenes.\n\nDon't know if this will help anyone, but thought I'd post to resolve\nthis thread.  Thanks for all the help!\nZack\n\nBTW- Georg, in Rayfront if people try to create \"parts\" as rad files\nrather than octrees and then replmark them I think it will result in the\nsame problem.\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminaire octree", "sender": "Zack Rogers", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42C090A4.1000003@archenergy.com>", "refs": ["<42BADDB8.6080104@archenergy.com> <42BAE81A.6030804@visarc.com>", "<42BAFC30.8050602@archenergy.com> <42BB07CB.4020706@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jun 28 01:50:46 2005", "email": "zrogers at archenergy.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Luminaire octree"}
