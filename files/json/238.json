You'll have to convert your\nbump maps to ASCII data files.  The in-memory size is the same as if the\ninput were from a picture.  The reason I didn't use pictures to describe\nthe surface normal perturbation map is because they don't support\nnegative values.  What form is your input?  If they're height fields,\nthen you'll have to derive surface normal perturbations from these.  I\nnever liked or supported the use of height fields for bump maps, because\nthere is no definitive mapping from a height field to a surface normal\nmap, which is what you really want for this type of texture.\n\n\nJust use the colorpict map with \"grey grey grey\" as the modifier\nfunctions.  If you don't like using 3x as much memory as single-channel\ndata, then you'll have to convert your data to ASCII again and use the\nbrightdata primitive.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: texpict...", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 18 Aug 2002 09:07:24 -0700"}
