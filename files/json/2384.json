Thanks for the reminder.  I also had no idea\nthat Greg added the ability to read in files; this makes it infinitely\nmore useful. I assume you simply take all the glazing/coatings you want\nand export each to a radiance file from Optics5, and then feed them to\nglaze with the -f switch, huh?  That's great, you guys.  Thanks again to\nGreg for the work, and Jack is being very modest in his post by\nmentioning the tool but not mentioning the fact that his company funded\nthe work.  Thanks to you both.\n\nAnd yes, the normal should face into the building.
