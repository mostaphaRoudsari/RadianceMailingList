The -f switch takes a\nfile with specific formatting (one glazing description per line) which\nis then parsed by the glaze script.

Let me see what\nI can do by way of example on this to demonstrate how it works. You are\nright though that the -f switch makes it way more convenient to use\nglaze for specific libraries of glazing on a per project basis.\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RGB values for different glazings", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon May  1 17:17:06 2006"}
