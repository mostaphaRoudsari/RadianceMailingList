(At least I run out of\nCPU long before the model is that big.)\n\nWhy do you think radiance needs to be 64bit?  On both and Sparc and\nthe AMD64 the 32bit binaries ran quicker.   Only if it needs to\naddress >2G of memory does it *need* to be 64bit.  *Some* programs\nrun quicker 64 bit but *most* *don't*, combine with larger executable\nfiles and increased memory usage I found radiance is best 32 bit.\n\nIt stands to reason for 64bit programs to be slower because they have\nto use twice the memory to store memory pointers.  Ah you say, doesn't\n64bit mean it can use 64bit registers for other things? (Like 64bit\nints and 64bit doubles.)  Well nothing stops that happening in 32bit\nmode if the chip and compilers are well designed, that's what\nsparcv8plus+vis is all about.  32/64bit is the memory address mode\nnot the chip registers.  Some say those extra registers are only used\non AMD64s in 64bit mode; I say I've benchmarks radiance both ways\nand 64 bit was not quicker.\n\nDon't confuse running 32bit Pentium compatible binaries on a AMD64\nwith 32bit binaries optimised for AMD64 on the AMD64.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] compiling Radiance 64-bit?", "tags": [], "sender": "James Lee", "datetime": "Thu May  4 10:41:32 2006"}
