If they are 64-bit long, then you can actually expect a speed\nimprovement, me thinks.\n\n\nThere are benchmarks and there are benchmarks. The only way of finding out\nwheter your particular application will benefit from going 64-bit is to\nactually test it. Which is what I've done for you.\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/rad_bench_sempron.html\n\nSo sit back, have a cup of coffee, and let the little grey cells do some\npondering.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] compiling Radiance 64-bit?", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Thu May  4 12:58:56 2006"}
