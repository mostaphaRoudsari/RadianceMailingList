{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nThis could be a problem with obj2mesh, though at first glance I can't\nspot anything wrong with the code.  Is it possible that whatever\nsoftware is generating the OBJ is being clever and not including\nsurface normals on the flat quad vertices?  Say it was including\nsurface normals on the vertices next to the edge, where it needs\nthem, but not on the interior vertices, which should match the\ngeometric surface normals.  In such a case, I could understand why\nobj2mesh would screw up as it converted quads to triangles, some of\nwhich would have surface normals and others which wouldn't.  Where\nsuch triangles shared an edge, you would end up with inconsistent\noutput like this.\n\nIt may be fixable, but I need to get a copy of your OBJ file to study\nit.  Send it to me gzip'ped in a separate e-mail.  (No need to copy\nthe group.)\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  Out of curiosity, do you get the same results from obj2rad?\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] strange artifacts", "sender": "Gregory J.
