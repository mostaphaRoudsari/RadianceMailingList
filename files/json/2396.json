{"body": "\nHi all!\n\nI'm experiencing a strange problem:\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/pub/artifacts.jpg\n\nI'm exporting the model of a curved glass with vertex normals\nto obj and converting it into a radiance mesh.\nI'm using the dielectric material with it, so the glass object has two\nsurfaces (inner and outer side of glass), but I can't get rid of this\nstrange effects at the edges, where the quads become triangles.\n\nThe remaining part of the surface is fine, even at the center,\nwhere there are some other triangles. I need to subdivide the polygons\nmany time before this effect becomes less noticeable ...\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks!\n\n--\nFrancesco\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1119897428.2733.11.camel@leviathan>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun 27 20:38:10 2005", "email": "pisuke at blueyonder.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] strange artifacts"}
