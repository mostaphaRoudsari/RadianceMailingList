One of the more recent examples is the\n64bit-thread...\n\n\nI prefer that, too. This will not only ensure (or avoid ;-) a certain level\nof quality, but give also some \"expert\" role to those people. So it would be\neasier to know whom to ask for what ;-)\n\n\nNo idea about Plone.\n\n\nThe only CMS that might work and I have experience with would be Drupal, and\nI am able to install it in an hour. Still I will not mention that here now\n;-)\n\n\nOK, who will participate, and how much will that per person (I like the\nexpression \"per nose\" we use for that in German)? If it is not getting a sum\nastronomic as the amount of rpict's options, I will participate. Will I get\na Gold-version of oconv handling all my nested instances when I support this\nproject? B-)\n\n\nYes, the week-end comes close, good times for render-folks... I will spend\nmy spare time on Radzilla (the new 1.1 release) this week.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Fri May  5 14:59:00 2006"}
