Of course, this only\nworks if the rgb values of the material are all non-zero, or you\nwill run into the multiplication-by-zero dilemma. Seems like the\npolygon solution will be simpler in most cases.\n\nActually, you could combine the two approaches, by defining\na mixfunc which selects the red plastic for the surrounding\narea, and a white plastic with the colorpict in the picture\narea. Mixtures are the exception to \"normal\" modifiers, in that\nthey can actually replace material values according to their\nfunctional criteria, instead of just modifying (sic!) them.\n\nRayfront makes the use of mixtures exceptionally easy, after all,\nand the function for this task is trivial:\n\nif(and(inside(X0,Px,X1),inside(Z0,Pz,Z1)),1,0)\n\nIf you replace X0, X1, Z0, Z1 with the lower and upper X and Z\nboundaries of the image, then you can write this directly into\nthe expression field of the mixfunc dialog. If the image is\naligned to the YZ-plane, then you'll have to adapt accordingly.\nThe white plastic and colorpict will now go into the foreground\nslot, and the red plastic becomes the background.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trouble with colourpict", "sender": "Georg Mischler", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.BSF.4.30.0107261243390.93689-100000@emancholl.pair.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 26 Jul 2001 13:09:48 -0400 (EDT)", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trouble with colourpict"}
