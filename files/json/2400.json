This could be automated, but would create a\ndependency on the master server.\n- Should the extra navigation be on every one of the site's pages, or just\nthe entry one?\n- Anything else...\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] knowledge platform", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Sat May  6 00:28:16 2006"}
