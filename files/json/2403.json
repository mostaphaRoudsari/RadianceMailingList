Studio 11 is now free.\n\nOn Sparc it's clear what is happening because the vis extensions can\nbe used in 32bit mode: sparcv8plus+vis and sparcv8plus+vis2.  I assume\nsomething similar is happening on the AMD64s although the compiler\nflags aren't as explicit and there is no isalist entry.\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] compiling Radiance 64-bit?", "tags": [], "sender": "James Lee", "datetime": "Sat May  6 18:14:12 2006"}
