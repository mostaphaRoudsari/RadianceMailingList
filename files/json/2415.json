But with big\nwindow openings, it should not be really necessary to use mkillum. If you\nuse it, consider generating the faces in another tool that gives you more\ncontrol, maybe \"even\" writing them with an editor.\n\n\nTriangles don't work with mkillum. Still, the obj format is not limited to\ntriangles, it depends more on the modeler (and you must make sure that the\npanes are 100% plain).\n\n\nDo you know obj2rad's -n option?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Thu May 11 10:35:06 2006"}
