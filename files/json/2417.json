However, this doesn't remove the side polys, and\nleaves you with two flat faces I suspect, so I'll have to research this\nmethod more.\nYeah, my unix god friend pointed me towards AWK as a simple solution.\nI'm just lazy, and can't write code quickly (not a programmer) so I was\nhoping that there might be a solution out there already.\nDidn't know that. Huh. Well, Revit produces very good models (other than\nthis glass thing) so I'm halfway there I guess.\n\nJeffrey\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<37989395-8767-4FCC-B378-15716735ADD3@rumblestrip.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "datetime": "Thu May 11 17:33:08 2006"}
