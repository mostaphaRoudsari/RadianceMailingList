I fear that not making\nthe glass a secondary light source, and just having it be, well, glass\nand only having the ray of sunlight bouncing around is going to give me\nbad numbers.\nThat's what I'm doing, I can edit them in Max via the 'Edit Poly'\nmodifier, but I'll need to research this more. I want to stay away from\nhand-editing much of anything, for I want to be able to go back and edit\nthe Revit model, re-export to Max, and from there re-export to OBJ2RAD\nfor quick revisions. So far, so good on that front, but this glass thing\nis leaving me stumped.\nI saw that. I was hoping there was a way to use the .MTL file that's\nalready generated by Max. Basically, I'm just being lazy, and hoping\nthere was an existing solution out there.\nNow that doesn't sound like a bad idea! ;-)\n\n--\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\nBecause We Can, LLC\n(415) 505-4689\nwww.becausewecan.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<FCCB55B3313F2341AB3C91810FE1166B013E50A9@ln-s3xch1.bdp.holdings.network>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "datetime": "Thu May 11 17:37:46 2006"}
