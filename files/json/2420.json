{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nThere is a file called grating.cal that models depth of 3-D grids and\nuses a BRTDfunc type to approximate the ensemble behavior.  I posted\nit in response to a similar request from Richard Clibborn:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-\nFebruary/002438.html\n\nIf you want the actual appearance of the blinds, rather than simply\nits transmission at a distance, then a mixfunc is required.  I don't\nhave time to write one right now, or even modify Georg's.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling Challenge", "sender": "Gregory J.
