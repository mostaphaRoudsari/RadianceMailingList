You can download the paper from Science Direct. If there is a problem, I can email you a copy. By the end of the summer you should also be able to download several more material files from the Kalwall web site (www.kalwall.com). Alternatively, there is also the Solera web site with several Radiance materials (http://www.advancedglazings.com/expSolera/).\n\nChristoph\n\nReinhart C F, Andersen M, \"Development and validation of a Radiance model for a translucent panel\", Energy and Buildings 38:7 pp. 890-904, 2006\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Fri 5/12/2006 3:04 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello all,\n\nCan anyone point me to a commerical manufacturer's website where there's specifications of a diffuse skylight (preferably withouth well) that can be modeled in Optics and imported into Radiance material format? (Anything close or suggestions on an alternative way of doing it will work too!)\n\nRegards,\nRamana.\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\nwww.daylit.org\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5049 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060512/c739eeea/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Ramana Kot", "datetime": "Fri May 12 22:03:16 2006"}
