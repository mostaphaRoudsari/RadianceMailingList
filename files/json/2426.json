{"body": "\nHi people,\nI am trying to calculate contrast for images. I am referring to paper\n(http://diuf.unifr.ch/courses03-04/imaging/simoncelli.pdf). This paper\nsuggest that to calculate contrast luminance is first needs to be\ncalculated.\nI am calculating lumninance using the formula.\nL_w = exp[ 1 / N( sum[ log( delta + L_w ( x, y ) ) ] ) ]\n\nWhere:\n\n* L_w - log-average luminance\n* N - number of pixels in the image\n* delta - a small factor to avoid problems with black pixels\n* L_w ( x, y ) - the world space luminance for pixel ( x, y )\n\nwhere log has base e.\n\nI am using the image from http://www.cacs.louisiana.edu/~cice/lal/. i\ncant get the luminance values mentioned on the website.\nCan someone please tell me where am i going wrong.\n\nthanks\nJay\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jay", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<42AF15CD.3010205@uccs.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jun 14 19:38:08 2005", "email": "jpothara at uccs.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Average luminance calculation"}
