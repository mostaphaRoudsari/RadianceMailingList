{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\nYes, it definitely helps to know what we're talking about.  1000\nwords/picture, at least!\n\nThe problem with the initial frames is that there aren't enough\nambient divisions to find the few and tiny holes you have.  I\nrecommend setting a much larger value for -ad at the beginning, and\nyou can gradually relax this as you get more holes in your space.\nJust guessing, I'd say you need at least -ad 4096 for the initial\nframe, which will take 5 times longer to compute.  (I don't think you\nneed to increase -as -- 512 should be enough.)\n\nAn alternate approach is to use illums in your openings with the\noutside distribution mapped to them, as described in Tutorial 0\n(Chapter 1 of RwR which is available online if you don't have it from\n<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book>).  The problem is that you'll\nprobably want to switch at some point from using illum's to just open\nholes as you have them once you get a certain number and it stops\npaying off in the calculation.  With illum's, you can decrease -ab 3\nto -ab 2 and get the same result.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict settings & open area  relation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<57E59743-E749-4639-AFD4-EC8722A8179D@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<42a81fc6.370a7586.1a65.ffffeec8SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun  9 19:54:29 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict settings & open area  relation"}
