Then about a year ago a colleague informed me that Optics\nisn't intended to be used for glazing with diffuse transmission\nqualities.  At the time the method used by optics for optical\ncalculations was based only on non-scattering glazing.\n\n\n\nYou will find a couple of diffusing laminates in the IGDB, but I was\ntold that these are leftovers from before they stopped accepting data\nfor diffusing products.\n\n\n\nThis said, it's been a year since I looked into the situation.  At the\ntime I was told that the inclusion of scattering data was a priority.\nSo if you know anything different please let me know.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nRamana Koti\nSent: 12 May 2006 21:07\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello,\n\nProf Moeck, thanks for the quick pointer. I couldn't ascertain if it can\nbe done okalux products but I need glass types that I can model in\nOptics and Window for Radiance material format and DOE-2.1E glass\nlibrary format. I looked up Optics and Window databases and could not\nlocate Okalux in them. Please advise.\n\nRegards,\nRamana.\n\nOn 5/12/06, Martin Moeck <MMoeck@engr.psu.edu> wrote:\n\nRamana,\n\nOkalux has nice product specifications at\n\nhttp://www.okalux.com/Okalux_2003/englisch/frames_e.html\n\nSelect \"Products\" at the bottom.\n\nThey have a good database since they specify the direct and diffuse\nlight transmission, UV protection, U-value, sound reduction, etc. You\ncan use those in pyramidal toplights. For a translation of the direct\nand diffuse light transmission into the Radiance trans material, see the\nradiance knowledge base and digests.I would also look into the glaze.cal\nscript.\n\nDr. Martin Moeck, Pennsylvania State University\n\n________________________________\n\nKoti\nSent: Fri 5/12/2006 3:04 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello all,\n\nCan anyone point me to a commerical manufacturer's website where there's\nspecifications of a diffuse skylight (preferably withouth well) that can\nbe modeled in Optics and imported into Radiance material format?\n(Anything close or suggestions on an alternative way of doing it will\nwork too!)\n\nRegards,\nRamana.\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\nwww.daylit.org\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\nwww.daylit.org\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060515/6740ce22/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Raman", "datetime": "Mon May 15 10:57:02 2006"}
