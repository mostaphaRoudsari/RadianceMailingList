{"body": "\nHello,\nIn my experience, Desktop Radiance is quite stable if you don`t use the CAD\ninterface. But it doesn`t include the last release, and not all programs are\nported. Depending on what you plan to do, this could be a problem, but for\nsimple renderings, it should work. (the Radiance tutorial, for example,\nworks fine like in the manual)\nYou could also install the last release on Cygwin using Francesco Anselmo`s\nbinaries. You can find the information in the downloads page of\nradiance-online.org.\nFinally, the option of compiling Radiance on windows using the Borland\ncompiler was mentioned earlier in the list, but I don`t know how that works,\nyou can check in the list`s archives (also in radiance-online).\nHope this helps.\nRegards,\n\nSantiago\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]On Behalf Of\nHuangwx@Kyoto-Univ.\nSent: Monday, June 06, 2005 11:57 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHi,\n\nI want to use Radiance on a WindowsXP system. I know that the Desktop\nRadiance has some problems, but the scene I want to render is quit simple,\nso I think I can handle the text-based input files, without the AutoCAD GUI.\n\nI found that in the \"Desktop Radiance Overview\", it is said:\n\n\"For individuals who are familiar with the standard Radiance program, the\nadvanced features that are not currently part of the Desktop Radiance system\ncan be accessed through the MS-DOS batch files by modifying the original\ntext-based input.\"\n\nSo my question is can all Radiance features be accessed in this way? Is it\nstable and reliable?\n\nThanks.\n\nYours,\n\nHuang Weixin\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050606/f76226f3/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] About Desktop Radiance", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ABEIIOCILNBBDDEPEPICKEKBCFAA.tiago@tkh.att.ne.jp>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun  6 15:50:26 2005", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] About Desktop Radiance"}
