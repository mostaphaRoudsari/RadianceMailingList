{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI want to use Radiance on a WindowsXP system. I know that the Desktop Radiance has some problems, but the scene I want to render is quit simple, so I think I can handle the text-based input files, without the AutoCAD GUI.\n\nI found that in the \"Desktop Radiance Overview\", it is said:\n\n\"For individuals who are familiar with the standard Radiance program, the advanced features that are not currently part of the Desktop Radiance system can be accessed through the MS-DOS batch files by modifying the original text-based input.\"\n\nSo my question is can all Radiance features be accessed in this way? Is it stable and reliable?\n\nThanks.\n\nYours,\n\nHuang Weixin\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050606/b4f85279/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Huangwx@Kyoto-Univ.", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<002e01c56a43$65303b60$1f7af90a@kyotovue4o802h>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun  6 04:57:36 2005", "email": "ap.huangwx at archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] About Desktop Radiance"}
