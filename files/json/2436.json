There may well be\na bug, but I can't find it if I can't find hardware on which to\nreproduce the problem.\n\nMaybe you can just continue to use the old binary for ximage, if\nthat's working.  I can see no reason why not to -- it isn't as if the\nRadiance picture format has changed in any incompatible way.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] [Help] Problem with ximage in 7.3.2", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
