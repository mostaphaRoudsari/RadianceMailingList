These data are accessible by the caculation engine evaluating the\ncal-files, in the same way as the coordinates of the ray hit (Px, Py,\nPz) and some other stuff.\n\nThis means that you have to analyze in which way your texture or the\nappearance to be produced by it depends on the surface normal, and then\nadapt it to the new normal with help of the Nx/Ny/Nz values. (Generally,\nthis will be a rotation).\nBy this, the textures can be adjusted to the normals without having to\nknow the object on which they are applied.\n\n-Carsten\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Tue, 20 Aug 2002 13:02:03 +0200"}
