Most of the 'free'\nmodels on the Internet are not great or not 'human'. I need a female\nnewsreader with short hair for my scene, or at least a standing female\nmodel with different layers. I tried to get something out of 'Poser 3D'\nbut all i get is a DXF file with one layer. Maybe someone has experience\nexporting DXF out of Poser. I'm a little bit under pressure because it's\nfor my thesis and the 'clock' is running ;-)\nThanks a lot!\n\nChristian\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Fusenig", "datetime": "Fri May 19 15:20:42 2006"}
