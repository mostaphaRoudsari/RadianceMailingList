However it is possible that you might be able to buy a posed\nhuman figure online at a site like www.turbosquid.com. You might also\ncheck if poser can export in another format such as obj or 3ds  (obj\nwould be preferable as then you can use obj2mesh).\n\n-Jack\n\nChristian Fusenig wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] human dxf models", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Fri May 19 15:44:59 2006"}
