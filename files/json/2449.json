{"body": "\nHi,\n\nWorking on an animation for video/tv, I need to render fields. Instead\nof rendering two frames apart and composit both into one image with\nfields later, I am thinking about a solution in wich I render two\nviewpoints in one image directly.\nIn this image all even scanlines should show view01 and all odd\nscanlines should show view 2 (or in reverse order, I dont know yet).\n\nCurrently I work with the following command to render my animation with:\nvwrays -fd -vf view8_0001.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304 | rtrace -av 20 20 20\n-ab 0 -st 0.01  -x $1  -y $1 -fdd -ovpN model-ani.oct\n\nI think it should be possible to extend this command in order to fit my\nneed, but I don't know where to start.\n\nAn example of the result I like to achieve can be found on\nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/fields.jpg\n\nIebele\n\n\nPS:\nIn 2003 (?) we discussed in this forum about imageprocessing for\nanimation. Two years later, I managed to create some images.\nI put the very first result on http://www.toren.com/radiance/imgshader.html.\nThe processed image shown there is created by a program I wrote that\nreads the output from the above command:\nvwrays -fd -vf view8_0001.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304 | rtrace -av 20 20 20\n-ab 0 -st 0.01  -x $1  -y $1 -fdd -ovpN model-ani.oct,\nso I am rather dependend of this output of rtace. In other words, I am\nsearching for a solution to render two views in one image, using\nsomewhat the same pipeline as I do now.\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering fields", "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42CA5547.4000105@iebele.nl>", "refs": ["<1119830831.31465.43.camel@localhost.localdomain>\t<42C01F5F.1050009@testers.homelinux.net>", "<42C3F580.8040208@iebele.nl>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul  5 11:37:24 2005", "email": "atelier at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering fields"}
