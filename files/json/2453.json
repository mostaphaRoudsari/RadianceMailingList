{"body": "\nHi,\n\nso my reply comes a bt late, as the questions are already answered\n-thanx very much!\n\nThe basic idea is that current radzilla is not 'standalone' and thus\nrelies on a working classic Radiance installation. Classic Radiance\noffers a lot of helper files for all sorts of calculations in\nconjunction with the functional language, and when the program needs one\not these, especially the initialization file 'rayinit.cal', it searches\nthe directories listed in the mentioned 'RAYPATH' shell enviromment\nvariable. And in this respect radzilla  behaves just like classic Radiance.\nThe whole environment variable business may indeed seem a bit strange at\nthe first glance to those less aquainted with the UNIX/Linux world,\nespecially because you set these variables 'globally' in your shell\ninit file, which itself has nothing to to with Radiance or radzilla..\nThe alternative (not implemented) approach would be to put this sort of\ninformation in some kind of .radiancerc or .radzillarc file in a users\nhome directory.\n\n-Carsten\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radzilla again", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42CB25E8.1050403@t-online.de>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB51B3826@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul  5 19:44:44 2005", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radzilla again"}
