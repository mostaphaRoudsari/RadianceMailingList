{"body": "\nHello @all,\n\nwhile testing my radiance installation in ran into a curious problem.\n\nThe machine is not connected to a monitor, instead it has VNC X-Server\nrunning. Everything is working fine. I'm useing XFCE4 as desktop and\nhave no probs with other X11 progs.\n\nWhen starting rview, like with one of the makefiles provided in the\nobj-directory of the sources a window with a correct title pops up for a\nfew millisecs and than disappears again. In my xterm I get the message\n\"Illegal instruction\".\nI found out that this message does not belong to the radiance source\ncode, so it will probably belong to X.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea, how I can find out more on this problem or\nhow to solve it?\n\nRegards,\nMario Minati\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mario Minati", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<42CCF63E.4060301@minati.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jul  7 11:31:07 2005", "email": "mario at minati.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rview problems with X11"}
