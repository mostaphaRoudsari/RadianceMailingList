Based on your material\ndescription though the results you are getting seem to be fine. The\nso-called \"noise\" that you are seeing is the specular highlights based\non the material that you defined. The plastic material that you defined\nonly has a specular component you have left the roughness parameter set\nto 0, thus you material is \"shiny\" so you are getting the tightly\ndefined specular highlights on the bumps of the geometry.\n\nIf you want a \"glossy\" (not sure exactly what you mean here as this\ncovers a variety of things) finish, then you should add a roughness\nparameter, for example, you could try out the following for starters\n(this is not based on anything in particular) to see what the difference is:\n\nThe bumpy surface is made of the following material:\nvoid plastic gray_plastic\n0\n0\n5 .2 .2 .2 .1 .1\n\nI would try this out with the parameters that you have and see what you\nget. As an additional experiment you may also want to turn on true\nrandom monte carlo sampling by setting -u+, though this may require that\nyou oversample your image at a higher size.\n\n-Jack\n\nPS - what does the geometry represent?\n\nYun-Xian Ho wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gloss and area light source rendering problem", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon May 22 14:29:35 2006"}
