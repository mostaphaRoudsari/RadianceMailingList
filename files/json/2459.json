The minification that happens on multiple\nreflections makes your light source into a dot.  In other words, in\nthe reflection of one sphere you see more spheres.  The miniaturized\nimage of the light source becomes a microminiaturized reflection in\nthe reflected spheres, and micromicrominiaturized in the reflection\nof reflection of other spheres.  These will look like noise to your\neye, but that's what the real scene would look like, also.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gloss and area light source rendering problem", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
