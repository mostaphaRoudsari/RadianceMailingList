This is described in chapter 8 of the Radiance\ntext, section 8.5 on large data sets. Page 467 give the following example:\n\noconv -f fl.lgt st.lgt cl.lgt -i e_twr.oct -i w_shr.oct ...  > bridge.oct\n\nMy experience with this approach is that you will get an error message\ncomplaining that the file \"-i\" cannot be found. If you reverse the arguments\nto avoid this message by placing the i options first followed by -f and the\n.lgt files (or rad files in my case), then only the last i option (say\nw_shr.oct) is included in the output octree (bridge.oct in this case). The\nonly way of combining octrees that works for me is the approach of using the\noctrees as instances as described on the same page 467 in the text. Could\nsomeone clarify how the i option can be used?\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Seebohm", "datetime": "Tue, 20 Aug 2002 17:31:37 -0400"}
