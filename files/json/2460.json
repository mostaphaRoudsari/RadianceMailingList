{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nI'm not sure what the limit is in the official release, as this is\nsomething I changed recently, but it's 512 if the latest head.  If\nyou'd like to change it, you can either edit AMBLLEN in src/rt/ray.h\nor set a -DAMBLLEN=1024 (or whatever) in your optimization flags in\nrmake and recompile.\n\nIf you are excluding more modifiers than you are including, you can\nuse the -ai or -aI option instead.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rvu: too many modifiers in ambient list", "sender": "Gregory J.
