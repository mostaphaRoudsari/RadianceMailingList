{"body": "\nHi Greg!\n\n\nIs this the number of modifiers or the total string length? If it's the\nfirst, there must have been a real change, cause I could exclude around\n6 or seven, not more in my old release (which is something after 3.6).\n\n\nI'll take a look at this and compile a new head this week-end.\n\nThank you, have a nice week-end, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rvu: too many modifiers in ambient list", "sender": "Lars O.
