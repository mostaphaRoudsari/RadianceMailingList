To get contributions, you need to\ndownload and compile the latest HEAD release, and use the new -V\noption to rtcontrib.  Then, you should get the results you expect.\nThis is a subtle point that I actually missed in the design of the\nprogram, which is why the option was only added more recently.  Here\nis the description from the new man page:\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n-----------------\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtcontrib with ies2rad", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
