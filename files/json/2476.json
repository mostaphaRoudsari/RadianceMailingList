Ward wrote:\n\n\nThanks Greg for the excellent tips on modeling water, but I'm afraid you\nhave opened up another can of worms with the last paragraph, above.  You\nmention a time-dependent wave texture. (!)  This sounds rather like some\nsort of variable texture that modulates the surface normal based on a\ntime input.  One could script up a run of images and for each frame that\nwater material would be modified by a random deformation that is keyed\nto timestep?  This sounds like an interesting application, and I was\nwondering if you had a framework for such a material description.  cal\nfiles are really something I'm trying to understand more, and each\nexample helps a little bit more.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] another water questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu May 25 17:42:52 2006"}
