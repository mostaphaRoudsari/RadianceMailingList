You can specify a mesh to be\nfluid (for example a cube of fluid) and bound by another mesh (say a\nbox containing the water).  You can specify sources and sinks and\nobjects with which the fluid should interact.  set up the scene you\nwant and Blender will generate a new mesh model for each frame of the\nanimation, which you can export as obj and then obj2mesh or obj2rad\neach model (each frame).  This goes for all of the objects/meshes in\nyour scene, so you could do the modeling and simulation in Blender\nand then render in Radiance.  A simple script could insert the water\nmaterial modifier into each model, etc.\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
