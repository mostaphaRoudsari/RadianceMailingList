Grobe:\n\n\nThey were directed to north because they had to be huge and\nyou had to avoid direct sunlight. Northern light also varies\nnot much over the day.\n\n\nOnly directional light would indeed be irritating but you\nneed a certain directional component to render the shape.\nAgain, use big windows (for the light level) and use them\nin one side of the room (for the directional component).\nIf you can use windows, of couse.\n\n\nNo! Don't use that stuff! We had an exhibition pavillion in\nmy university built with honeycomb insulation between two\nglass profiles. The profiles alone might have worked well but\nthe building inspector insisted in an insulation of the wall.\nThe honeycombs diffuse the light so much that there is hardly\na directional component left. It looks odd and the sculptures\nand architectural modells are shaded poorly even if the interior\nis rather bright.\n\n\nThomas\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
