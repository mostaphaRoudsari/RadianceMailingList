{"body": "\n\nHi Thomas,\n\nSorry for the delay, I just wanted to address your question in your\nresponse to my response to your question. (whoa, that was confusing.)\n\nOn Mon, July 11, 2005 1:50 pm, Thomas Bleicher said:\n\n\nWell, sometimes I adjust the # of lamps, the lumen output, or the\nmultiplier.  Of course these things could be handled with the multiplier\nthat is part of ies2rad as well.  But in rare cases, I need to adjust the\nluminous aperture defined in the ies file, and this can only be done by\nediting those fields in the ies file.  Yes, this is indeed changing the\nfixture from the original photometered luminaire, but it's sometimes done\nin order to simulate a unique fixture.\n\n--\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Project Organization", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1919.66.180.127.98.1121271843.squirrel@66.180.127.98>", "refs": ["<20050710134200.GA7194@zwielich.escape.de>", "<7a1385c71af5d7f28d4dc287e222d5bc@rumblestrip.org>", "<20050711195024.GA4685@zwielich.escape.de>"], "datetime": "Wed Jul 13 18:24:57 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Project Organization"}
