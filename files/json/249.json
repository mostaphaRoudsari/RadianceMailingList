How can something so basic and necessary remain broken\nfor so many years??\n\nI should really have put the -Dtracktime=0 switch into the makeall\nscript for Linux, but since it shows up in a number of other places that\nuse the GNU libraries, this probably wouldn't fix everyone's problem.  I\nthought the Linux folks had repaired it, to be honest.\n\nIt's true that modern VM systems are quite good when it comes to\nswapping, but also true that highly fragmented memory access is always a\nperformance hit when you run out of RAM, so I'm reluctant just to remove\nthe optimization altogether.  It does work on systems that don't use the\nGNU libraries....  At the very least, I should recompile the Linux\nbinaries on the website.\n\nHave people been getting this error with the compiled binaries, or just\nones they compiled themselves from the 3.4 source?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Problem with avlmemi", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1ED9A784-32E4-11D6-B501-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 8 Mar 2002 14:30:40 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Problem with avlmemi"}
