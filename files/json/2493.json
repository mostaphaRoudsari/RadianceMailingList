There is only a diffusive light source located in the\nmiddle of the ceiling. My intention is to change the color and texture of\nthe walls, and then measure the resulting light reaching the geometrical\ncenter of the room: 1)INTENSITY (in radiance units) and 2)the amount of\nRED, GREEN and BLUE of the resulting light spectrum also in radiance\nunits.  How can I do these measurements?\n\nAdriana Lira\nMaster in Design Studies, 2003\nCandidate for Doctor in Design Studies\nHarvard Graduate School of Design\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C39620118A785@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "tags": [], "sender": "alira@gsd.harvard.edu", "datetime": "Tue May 30 05:49:08 2006"}
