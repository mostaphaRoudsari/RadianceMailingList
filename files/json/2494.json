You either need to define a particular\ndirection, or in your case you probably want the irradiance value,\nwhich is the integral of radiance over the projected hemisphere.\nThis also requires you to define a facing direction.\n\nPhil Dutre has a nice compendium that explains lighting units, which\nmay be found at:\n\nhttp://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~phil/GI/\n\nSection VI, starting page 25  is probably where you want to look.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<32031.24.61.4.37.1148960943.squirrel@mail.gsd.harvard.edu>", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
