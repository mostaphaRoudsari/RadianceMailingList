Does anyone here know where I may obtain\ndata for such light fixtures and how to correctly translate this data into\nRadiance?\n\nI have some additional questions concerning the trans material type. In a\nRadiance reference manual, it is stated:\n\n\"Trans is a translucent material, similar to plastic. The transmissivity is\nthe fraction of penetrating\nlight that travels all the way through the material. The transmitted\nspecular component is the fraction of transmitted light that is not\ndiffusely scattered. Transmitted and diffusely reflected light is modified\nby the material color. Translucent objects are infinitely thin.\"\n\n\nFirst, should the transmissivity + transmitted specular component = 1 in\norder for the material to be physically correct? Also, since the transmitted\nspecular component is the fraction of transmitted light that is not\ndiffusely scattered, does this mean that this is apart of the direct\ncalculation or is this too apart of the indirect calculation.\n\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Jun  2 22:46:02 2006"}
