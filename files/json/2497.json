Trans can\neffectively model this material, however.  I did a bunch of measurements\nof a translucent glazing several years ago, to obtain the transmittance\nat the normal as well as every 15-degrees off-axis. A trans material was\nthen created and progressively modified until the curves for the trans\nand the measurements aligned pretty well.  This will be fairly easy,\nassuming you can get a flat glass sample of those tulip-shaped shades.\n(Full disclosure: Greg helped me fit the data to a valid trans\ndescription, which is a large part of why it was fairly easy.)\nMeasuring the actual shade itself would be a real bear, I'd expect.\n\n\nThe best references for trans are the flowchart at Schorsch's site,\n(http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html) and pp 325-326\nin RwR.\n\nGood luck; I know Visarc Jack did some courthouse renderings a long time\nago that featured these large alabaster pendant bowl-like shades, and\nthey looked amazing; the trans really captured the soft lamp image quite\nwell.  Maybe Jack can share what he did?  Even if he measured the actual\nshade, they had a fairly large radius to them.  Your tulip shades will\nbe a real challenge, I think.\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri Jun  2 23:25:43 2006"}
