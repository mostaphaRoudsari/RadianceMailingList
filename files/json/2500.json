{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\nIn all cases that I discus design issues, I  talk about  Radiance as a\ntool that is usefull  to compare one design or situation with another.\nThat means that when I design some lighting solution, I always make two\nor more situations. That makes that in a discussion everybody understand\nat least one important value of the images: to compare one design or\nsituation with another. (when I came up whith only one image, most\npeople said: \"well this is a synthetic image, the real world will\ndiffer\". And because they are right in saying that, the radiance images\nappeared meaningless. )\nAnother suggestion is to contact a manufacturer (I have had good results\nwith Philips Iguzinni in our area) and share your images with. They can\n( or not, then you 'callibrate' further ) approve your calculations. And\nthat will impress your clients for sure.\n\nA lot of clients do have to do a lot of 'marketing yadi yadi yah'. Your\nimages may play an important role for you clients in getting other\nparties interested in the project. For that purpose probably the best\nlooking images  are preferred above the most accurate.\n\nGood luck!\n\niebele\n\n\nJelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 17, Issue 16", "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42DD23A2.7020409@iebele.nl>", "refs": ["<200507191536.j6JFaZS02356@reaktie14.xlserver.net>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul 19 17:58:40 2005", "email": "atelier at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 17, Issue 16"}
