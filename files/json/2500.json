I know that it is possible to arrange for\nequipment rentals directly from KonicaMinolta. This especially makes\nsense for the luminance meter which is indeed ~$3,000 at retail. Also on\nthe spot light that Rob mentioned, good camera equipment stores that are\nset up to provide rental equipment to professionals will have a wide\nselection of lighting. I know that for one exercise I rented a small\nspotlight where you could adjust the beam spread (sorry I do not\nremember the name/type) at a reasonable price.\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon Jun  5 15:00:13 2006"}
