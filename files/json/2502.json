First, is there any\nexisting data that is readily available for translucent materials that are\nused as diffusing elements for light fixtures? Also, are there any\nspecifications or procedures as to how to perform these tests?\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed Jun  7 20:03:21 2006"}
