But you can\nuse them\nfor rendering and convert the images to a Windows friendly format.\n\nRayfront (see www.schorsch.com) offers a complete interface on Windows\nbut uses an older version of Radiance (not that it'd make a big\ndifference in\neveryday use).\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n_____\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\ncharlie portelli\nSent: 14 June 2006 22:04\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi all,\n\nI am new to this enviornemnt.\n\nI have been doing day lighting analysis using IES which has radiance\nbuilt in to it, but the modeling agent that IES caries is very poor. I\nhave created the geometry in CATIA and would like to use radiance to\nanalyze it.\n\nI guess my first question is where can I find radiance?\nDoes it work on windows? If so what version? (currently running windows\nxp)\n\nThanks\nCharlie.\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
