You can not run the cygwin binaries directly from the Desktop Radiance\nfront end. You will have to export the geometry from DR and run the binaries\nfrom cygwin's BASH shell. However, if you use the Windows binaries compiled\nby Francesco, you should be able to run these binaries (e.g. rad, oconv,\nrpict, rtrace, etc) directly from DR. However, it should be noted that you\nwill not be able to use DR's winrview with octrees that are built with the\nFrancesco's Windows binaries.\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Difference...", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Thu Jun 15 15:06:59 2006"}
