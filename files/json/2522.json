The basic problem is always the 'flat'\nillumination caused by the constant value.\n\nWhen it comes to image generation, if you have large scenes with\nexterior and interior parts both of importance for display in the image,\nand/or e.g complex stuff like trees etc, you should give the 'scene'\nfeature of radzilla a try, with it's possibility of setting a separate\nparameter set meaning also separate caches.\nIt depends of course on the type of object. Computers are fast now, so\neven in million polygon octrees like a tree e.g a crude ambient cache\nwith -ab1 and -ad 60 or 100 or so is trackable. In such an obect the\nerrors caused by the crude cache are of no importance,  and  it\ndefinitely gives better results than any constant value  approximation.\nIn other cases, if the outside part is of lesser importance but still\nsomehow visible in the image, setting -ab 0 and a constant av for the\nwhole outside part might of course suffice, and it can save you the time\nand work of pasting some background stuff into the image with photoshop\netc later..\n\n-cb\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] estimating -av values, color", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42E5465B.1070100@t-online.de>", "refs": ["<2d650bdc669b4373597cfcd9098128ce@gmx.net>\t<42DFE198.6010002@visarc.com>\t<42E0ADD0.3010709@t-online.de>\t<227fab3d7079cb70f772c7218959fc95@gmx.net>\t<42E221A7.8020906@t-online.de>", "<fae8afb860262c540496a3832509bd91@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Mon Jul 25 13:38:40 2005", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] estimating -av values, color"}
