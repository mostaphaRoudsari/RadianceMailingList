I have to figure out file sharing between operating systems. Parallels allows to run a Linux window in addition to the XP window within the MAC main window.\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Sun 6/18/2006 6:44 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nI will be taking delivery on a Mac Book Pro 15\", 2.16 GHz Core Duo in\na couple of weeks and will try Parallels on it with Windows XP SP2.\ni will use it initially for GPS/topo mapping apps (DeLorme topo\nsynced to my handheld Garmin GPS) so we'll see what that can do.  If\nanyone wants me to try a windows app on it, let me know.  Oh, I'll\nalso be trying Minesweeper as well.  ;-)\n\nkirk\n\nOn Jun 16, 2006, at 10:06 AM, Giulio Antonutto wrote:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5644 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060620/674a29d1/attachment-0001.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Kirk Thibaul", "datetime": "Tue Jun 20 17:29:50 2006"}
