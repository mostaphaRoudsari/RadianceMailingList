It is not merely to speed up the\nfinal rendering calculation -- the time spent in the overture\ncalculation is greater than the time saved in the final one.  The real\nreason rad does this is to minimize interpolation artifacts as explained\nat the top of page 551 in the \"Rendering with Radiance\" chapter 12 on\nthe indirect calculation.\n\n\nOmigosh.   I don't know how this one slipped by the editor -- no one\never pointed it out to me before, but it must have been pretty late at\nnight when Rob typed it in...  Quoting the oconv man page:\n\n\nThis is meant to indicate that the options must preceed the scene input\nfiles.  The man page doesn't explicitly state that only one octree may\nbe added to, but it should.  The reason for this is because the starting\n(-i) octree defines the boundaries of the scene, which may not be\nchanged when adding new objects.  If you were to attempt to combine two\noctrees, their different boundaries would make them impossible to\nreconcile -- you might as well start fresh from the objects,\nthemselves.  The only reason for building octrees incrementally is if\noconv runs out of space building the whole octree at once, or you are\ntrying to save time in an animation where only a few objects are\nchanging in an otherwise static environment.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rad and oconv questions", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 22 Aug 2002 19:03:30 -0700"}
