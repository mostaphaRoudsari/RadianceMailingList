If there is some admin who wants\nto help, let him install brlcad where it belongs to, somewhere in /usr.\nThan it will also find its libraries. He may also install (if available)\na package for your distribution, as you do not intend to use the latest\nfeatures but only the (old) import-filter.\n\nThe workarounds should come to an end here, as, while you copied some\nfiles to your current working directory, brldcad heaviely relies on its\nlibraries. So it will be easier to properly install the whole package.\n\nThe problem is that brlcad expects to be in a standard location under\n/usr, where a non-admin user should not be able to install. There is a\nfile README and/or INSTALL which tells you where to install it, for my\nOS X release it was something like /usr/brlcad, afaik.\n\nThere is no need to recompile it (except that you insist on installing\nit in a non-standard location. I had hoped that you already successfully\ndid all the conversion as I did not hear any news from you.\n\nAfter all this Radiance-Off-Topic (while interesting, as brlcad is a\nuseful extension for radiance in many ways), there is also nice support\navailable for brlcad such as an icq-channel, mailing lists, the\nsourceforge forums and, really, a lot of nicely formatted pdf documentation.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] iges conversi", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
