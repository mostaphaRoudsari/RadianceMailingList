{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nI'm anything else than a BRDTF expert, so my answer is a bit short  ..\nat least for the moment\n\nin other words. specular reflection increases with higher incidence\nangles (measured from the surface normal normal). ..sounds reasonable..\n\n\n\nthe direction and value of the incident light as seen from the current\nray hit is calculated within the program when stepping through the list\nof sources and adding up their contributions, but this means of course\nthat in general there is not one value and one direction which could be\nexported, but many.\nWhy do you need them? Normally they're dealt with internally, the BRTDF\ngets the direction to the source and then gives back the specular\n(and/or transmission) coefficient of your material for that incident\nangle and your current view ray angle.\n(but I definitely need to have a closer look on how the BRDTF stuff is\nevaluated in Radiance before writing on further ..).\n\n\nThe functional language defines a pure exponential funtion e^x ( or\nexp(x), as it is called). To calculate arbitray powers with it, proceed\nas follows:\nx^y   = e^y*lnx  or  x^y = exp(y*log(x))  in the syntax of the\nfunctional language\n\n-cb\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reflection vs specularity", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42E2219D.80900@t-online.de>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB5234C6E@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>\t<42DE83A4.7090608@iebele.nl>\t<42DF3EE8.8010106@t-online.de>", "<42E12170.40700@iebele.nl>"], "datetime": "Sat Jul 23 04:25:20 2005", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reflection vs specularity"}
