If you use rad and a rif file,\nnote that the quality setting influences the ambient bounces calculated.\n\nBTW, if you use an illum surface, you will need far less. How important\nis it to get \"nice\" pictures in your case?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Bounces", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
