{"body": "\nI think your converted model is huge because of the smooth shading stuff\nthat comes with the conversion from obj 2 rad.\nI did use this conversion a year or two ago, so I don't know the details\nanymore.\nMaybe there is an option in obj2rad to ignore the polygon normals / smooth\nshading. Otherwise you should export your FormZ model without normals,\nthere is no way then to calculate smooth shaded surfaces, resulting in\nsmaller rad files.\nAt the other hand, 38 MB is not too much for nice smooth shaded sweeps!\nAlso I wonder if your 38MB model does consume the same amount of memory\nwhile rendering.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nIebele\n\nRandolph Fritz wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3CAD5CF1.AD7A1386@iebele.nl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 05 Apr 2002 10:14:41 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fun with FormZ exportReferences: <20020404062328.GA17630@panix.com>"}
