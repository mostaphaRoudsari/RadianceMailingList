It's mostly for daylighting and\nelectric lighting integration, and it's kind of a pain to get to work\nwith your own Radiance models, but there is an excel spreadsheet\ninterface that is very easy to use. This ease of use comes at the cost\nof limited features. You can find out more about it here:\nhttp://www.archenergy.com/SPOT/\n\nOther than that there is always Desktop Radiance:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/deskrad/dradHOME.html\n\nIf anyone else knows of any others, I'd be interested to hear about them\nas well.\n\nHope that helps!\nDave\n\ncharlie portelli wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Windows Based Radiance Packag", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
