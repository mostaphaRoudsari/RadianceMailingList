{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\nYes, I think that there are few different strategies for workflow that\ndifferent people/groups on this list employ. I know that everyone has\ntheir reasons and preferences. We employ our own strategy and tools for\nworkflow management.\n\nI think that some of the real strengths of radiance are more built into\nthe ability to perform what I would term \"technical\" or \"performance\nsimulations\" focused on material and/or lighting performance. Most of\nour work though tends to be more about making nice pictures of\narchitecture. For better or worse there are a lot of very powerful\noff-the-shelf rendering/animation packages that are awfully good at\nmaking nice pictures. So from some standpoints, unless the client is\nafter a performance simulation, they really do not care about the\ntechnology. So perhaps one of the strenghts that you may have in your\nservices is in fact your workflow and method of working with your\nclients to accomplish their objectives.\n\nJust my thoughts offered for discussion.\n\n-Jack\n\nJelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 17, Issue 16", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42DD2292.7050901@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<0MKv22-1Duu7B2q9N-0007Nk@mx.perfora.net>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul 19 17:57:00 2005", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 17, Issue 16"}
