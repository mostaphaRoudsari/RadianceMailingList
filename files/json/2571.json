{"body": "\nDear group\n\nI have a question about using colorpict and colorfunc in conjuction with\neach other. What I wish to do is to be able to alter/shift the color of a\ntexture map within a render. I could probably do this is colorpict alone but\nbecause I deal with so many faces (50 000 - 500 000), if I wanted to adjust\nsome of the input parameters for the function file, I would have to change\nthe values during a re-export with my Radiance conversion program. This can\nbe a time consuming process to re-export and recompile the scene in order to\ntweak some parameters. Ideally what would happen is that I would pass the\ncolor returned by colorpict to colorfunc, where my function file would then\nalter the color in accordance with my input parameters. From there, I would\npass the altered color returned by colorfunc to a plastc, plastic2, metal,\netc. material. I would only have one colorfunc (unlike the thousands of\ncolorpicts) so I can adjust the parameters manually during the test\nrendering phase. Is this possible?\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Colorpict and Colorfunc", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F386D236A789137205CA6EBA4D30@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Jul 16 14:21:36 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Colorpict and Colorfunc"}
