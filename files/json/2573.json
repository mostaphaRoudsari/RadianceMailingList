They are\nlocated in the obj-directory if you downloaded the sources (are they in\nthe binaries?). There are also scenes in the ftp-directories which you\ncan find on radsite.lbl.gov.\n\nIf you want something REALLY simple, either go through the manual that\ncomes with radiance or set up a room in your favorite modeler.\n\nGood luck, and feel free to ask!
