You can substitute\nany 1024x768 screen shot you like for \"VDTdisp.pic\".  Make sure the\nmaximum value is <= 1.0.\n\nAs for glare analysis, I don't know how you mean to associate\ndiscomfort glare with a VDT.  Perhaps you are thinking of veiling\nglare -- reflections from the screen that reduce visibility?\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VDThead.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 8335 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060725/766a93c3/VDThead.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VDTon.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 297 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060725/766a93c3/VDTon.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VDTscreen_on.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 627 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060725/766a93c3/VDTscreen_on.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare on monitor scr", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
