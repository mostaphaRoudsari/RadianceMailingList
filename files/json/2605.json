I am not that advance. I have build a plane as my monitor screen. I dont know how to apply material for this plane. Could you please kindly explain how to apply them in this monitor screen plane?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nYuni\n\n\"Gregory J. Ward\" <gregoryjward@gmail.com> wrote:\nSorry, I should have explained better. L_fore is the luminance of\nthe character or whatever it is you are trying to read. L_back is\nthe luminance of the surround -- on the monitor, not behind it.\nL_veil is the *additional* luminance caused by unwanted reflection\noff the screen. You may have to render the monitor with it switched\noff to get this value. You can use the attached VDToff.rad file for\nthis. You'll also need the other files I've attached, which I forgot\nin the first posting.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
