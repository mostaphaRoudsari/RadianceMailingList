I am helping users that were using a\nWindows application that was broken as a result of system updates. The only\nthing the users do is shoot a series of pictures, then create a HDR file.\nam in the process of setting up a series of scripts for them on OS X. I can\ncreate the false color image without a problem. However, I am having\nproblems with the Isocontour image.\n\nWhat are the series of commands that I need to use to create the Iso from\nthe HDR? I know that I need to create an Illumination file and then\ncomposite that file with the original HDR. How do I do this? I am guessing\nit will be 2 different terminal commands.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. I am sorry if this is a simple\nproblem, I am not a Radiance user so a lot of stuff is greek to me.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMatt Parker\nLab Manager\nUNC Charlotte\nCollege of Architecture\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Matt Parker", "datetime": "Wed Jul 26 07:37:22 2006"}
