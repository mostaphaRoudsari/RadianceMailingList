{"body": "\nHi lebele,\n\nI don't have a beautiful solution for this, but the following should\nwork:\n\nrlam '\\!vwrays -vf view1.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304' '\\!vwrays -vf\nview2.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304' \\\n| rcalc -e 'odd=recno-floor(recno/2)*2-.5' -e '$1=if(odd,$1,$7);\n$2=if(odd,$2,$8);$3=if(odd,$3,$9)' \\\n-e '$4=if(odd,$4,$10);$5=if(odd,$5,$11);$6=if(odd,$6,$12)' \\\n| rtrace -fad (etc.)\n\nThe rlam command puts rays corresponding to your two views on each\nline together, and rcalc chooses between them based on scanline\noddity.  This requires a lot of ASCII/double conversions, which can\nbe slow, but since rlam doesn't handle binary floats or doubles, this\nis the simplest way.  A more complex solution that could write\ndoubles directly would use rcalc alone and two view calculations, but\nI don't have time to write that one for you.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering fields", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<292E0F82-3A3C-4070-A53B-9C6F2044CC6E@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<1119830831.31465.43.camel@localhost.localdomain>\t<42C01F5F.1050009@testers.homelinux.net>", "<42C3F580.8040208@iebele.nl> <42CA5547.4000105@iebele.nl>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul  5 17:14:13 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering fields"}
