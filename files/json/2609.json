All of the commands look simple\nenough. My question now is, what is the .oct file and how do I create it? I\nhave been given a series of .HDR images that were created using PhotoSphere\nfrom a series of shots. What do I need to do to convert this to a .oct file\nor do I just substitute my .hdr file where you indicate .oct.\n\nAgain, I apologize if this a stupid question.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nMatt\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR & Isocontour help.", "tags": [], "sender": "Matt Parker", "datetime": "Wed Jul 26 14:37:53 2006"}
