To\nget illuminance instead, turn on the -i option via the \"set i y\"\ncommand in rvu then do the trace again.  You can switch irradiance\nmode off again with \"set i n\".\n\nI hope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR & Isocontour help.", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
