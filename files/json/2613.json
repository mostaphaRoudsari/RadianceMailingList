The man page says the\n\"value\" will be printed as well but I remember vaguely that\nit was split in its red, green and blue component. I can't\nsimply switch to my Radiance machine right now to test it\nso you have to figure it out yourself.\n\nFor illuminace simply use the \"-i\" option when you start\nrvu. Again I am not sure rvu supports this but I don't see\na reason why it shouldn't.\n\nThomas\n\n\n_____\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Chris\nFoster\nSent: 26 July 2006 16:16\nTo: Radiance general discussion; Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHi everybody...again\n\nIm a regular nuisance on here, please dont kick me off Greg!\n\nIn addition to my last email, i have a query regarding light measurement\nwithin radiance. When viewing an .oct in rvu if i type t and then click\non a point, it will give me a few values, the last of which, i assume,\nis luminance in nits.\n\nFirstly is this assumption correct?\n\nIs there a way to measure illuminance as opposed to luminance?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nChris\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
