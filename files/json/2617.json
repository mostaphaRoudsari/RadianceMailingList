{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nthis is an interesting amount of work you've put up on your website, for\nunknown reasons I haven't heard of all this before..\n\nI just started looking at Blender some days ago, and I am currently a\nbit overwhelmed by it, too. So it's the Blender part of the matter which\nstill\ndelays any further occupation with it on my side, btw the same holds\ntrue for Francesco's work. But there will come the time when I catch up\nwith both of you on this. It would be definitely interesting to connect\nall our activites in some way...\n\n-greetz\nCarsten\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mapping texture", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<42EFCA35.60601@t-online.de>", "refs": ["<001001c58cce$8878b1d0$1f7af90a@hwx>", "<20050801204811.GA4884@zwielich.escape.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Aug  2 13:03:26 2005", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mapping texture"}
