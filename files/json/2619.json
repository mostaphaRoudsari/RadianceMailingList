One problem that I am having is\nthat the illums themselves are causing shadows (see here)\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/room7a_day_Camera07_day_pcyl_tr3.jpg\n\n\nFor the wall fixture, you can see the shadow of the spherical illum. I am\nusing a void material for the illum so it's invisible to the eye but\nobviously not invisible to shadow rays. Is there any work around for this?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illums Causing Shadows", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Sun Jul 30 17:28:30 2006"}
