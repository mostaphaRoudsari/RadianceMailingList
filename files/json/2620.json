{"body": "\nHi.\n\nAs far as I can tell, they seem to have changed Tcl/Tk in some\nfundamental ways, and the old trad code no longer runs properly.  I\ndon't have time right now to investigate, unfortunately.  I don't\nhave the latest documentation on Tcl, and it's been forever since I\ntouched any of this code.\n\nAnyone else have info. on the evolution of Tcl/Tk?  I wish they\ndidn't keep changing it in incompatible ways.  Every new release\nseems to break something, and it's been many releases since I made\nany updates.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trad on the Mac?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DE6BA5A2-7549-4E7E-8418-57CCB4B6A1D9@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<20050805224405.69755.qmail@web41124.mail.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Aug  6 01:43:20 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trad on the Mac?"}
