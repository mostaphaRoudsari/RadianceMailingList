The best workaround in your\ncase is to use a combination of direct subsampling (-ds) and direct\njitter (-dj) to make the shadows less noticeable.  In fact, they\nshould be there, but they shouldn't be so sharp.  Turning on\nPENUMBRAS in rad will accomplish the same thing.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illums Causing Shadows", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
