{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nI have compiled and installed the Radiance 3.7 (downloaded August 2,\n2005) under Knoppix 3.9 and everything compiled and played nicely Greg.\n\nOne small backwater that has missed the general name change is the obj\ndirectory. There are many references to the old 'rview' program which\nneed changing to 'rvu' in the next release as this directory is a good\nsource of information to new users.\n\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<092BF7A1BC389E489A69DC764F23CD870341C41E@exmsp2.perth.ad.curtin.edu.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Aug  8 03:13:17 2005", "email": "T.McMinn at exchange.curtin.edu.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Radiance 3.7 obj and rview"}
