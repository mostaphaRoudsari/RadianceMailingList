I dont require the display to show any pictures, i just want it to have a uniform white light emitting from one side of 400 nits. Should i use an illum surface? How can i ensure it has the brightness i require??\n\nYour reply email (below) and attachments to yuni has helped me some greg, i can now add pictures if i so wish, but not sure if it helps me with my above questions\n\nmy box is below, although im sure i havent needed to put it in.\n\nthanks in advance\n\nchris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tue 7/25/2006 6:39 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Yuni,\n\nHere is a description for an HP LCD monitor we measured at LBNL for\nthe New York Times (work sponsored by NYSERDA).  You can substitute\nany 1024x768 screen shot you like for \"VDTdisp.pic\".  Make sure the\nmaximum value is <= 1.0.\n\nAs for glare analysis, I don't know how you mean to associate\ndiscomfort glare with a VDT.  Perhaps you are thinking of veiling\nglare -- reflections from the screen that reduce visibility?\n\n-Greg\n\nvoid plastic grey\n0\n0\n5 .5 .5 .5 0 0\n\ngrey polygon display.1540\n0\n0\n12\n2.57                  7                  2\n2.57                  7               2.09\n2.4                  7               2.09\n2.4                  7                  2\n\ngrey polygon display.4620\n0\n0\n12\n2.4                  7               2.09\n2.4               7.05               2.09\n2.4               7.05                  2\n2.4                  7                  2\n\ngrey polygon display.2310\n0\n0\n12\n2.4               7.05                  2\n2.57               7.05                  2\n2.57                  7                  2\n2.4                  7                  2\n\ngrey polygon display.3267\n0\n0\n12\n2.57               7.05                  2\n2.4               7.05                  2\n2.4               7.05               2.09\n2.57               7.05               2.09\n\ngrey polygon display.5137\n0\n0\n12\n2.57                  7               2.09\n2.57                  7                  2\n2.57               7.05                  2\n2.57               7.05               2.09\n\ngrey polygon display.6457\n0\n0\n12\n2.4               7.05               2.09\n2.4                  7               2.09\n2.57                  7               2.09\n2.57               7.05               2.09\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential and/or\nprivileged material; it is for the intended addressee(s) only.\nIf you are not a named addressee, you must not use, retain or\ndisclose such information.\n\nNPL Management Ltd cannot guarantee that the e-mail or any\nattachments are free from viruses.\n\nNPL Management Ltd.
