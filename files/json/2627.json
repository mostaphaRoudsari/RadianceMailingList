On Windows systems you can use the precompiled Radiance binaries from Francesco Anselmo's website (http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ but there are other packages for this platform as well.\nHTH,\n\n-Erwin\n\nOriginal Message        processed by David InfoCenter\nTo:      Radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI am new to radiance. dunno much abt the commands.
