{"body": "\nDear Group,\n\nI have been recently using OBJ2MESH as part of my workflow. I am finding it\nvery useful. What I would like to know is if it is possible to adjust the UV\nshift and scale of a pattern associated with a mesh? Say if a pattern tiles\n4 times in the U and V, if I want for it to tile 1,2,3,6,8,etc. times and I\nwish to shift the patern by 1/2, is there a method for doing this?\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] OBJ2MESH - UV Scale and Shift", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F39F60B6E619BD64E21DF9A4BD0@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Aug 11 16:17:48 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OBJ2MESH - UV Scale and Shift"}
