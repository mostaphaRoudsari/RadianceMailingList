I have printed off a graph from the PC and have used a ruler to try and get some angle and brightness values for use in my ies file but it cant imagine that its very accurate.\nThe light i physical and want to model have is the ARRI Daylight Compact 4000W (not the theatre one) with a fresnal lens. HMI 4000 W/SE G38.\nI want to model it in spot, midflood and flood focus range.\n\nFor my spot focus my draft ies looks as below\n\nTILT=NONE\n\n1 [lumens per lamp] 1 12 1 1 2 -.376 0 0\n1 1 4000\n0 0.5 1.5 3 4 5 6 7.5 9 11 17 90\n0\n1880000 1800000 1600000 1000000 600000 400000 250000 120000 100000 60000 0 0\n\ni dont know what value i should use for the lumens per lamp, any suggestions? from what you know am i doing anything else wrong??\n\nThanks for your time\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]On Behalf Of\nChristian Fusenig\nSent: 03 August 2006 11:31\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHi Chris,\n\nArri doesn't provide IES or EULUMDAT data for their luminaires, but they\nhave a photometric calculator on their website.\nI measured four different types of luminaires for my thesis and created\nIES files, tell me which one you want, maybe i can help you.\nRegards,\n\nChristian\n\n--\n\nChristian Fusenig\nDipl.-Ing.
