{"body": "\nHi Martin,\n\nYour message to the Radiance-online list came through as a damaged\nattachment.  Can you resend just the text portion of the message -- not\nas an attachment?  In general, it's not a good idea to send attachments\nto a mailing list.  If someone wants to look at your file and you can't\nput it on a website, you can mail it to people who request it\nspecifically.  That way, it doesn't get sent automatically to the entire\nlist.\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<53B8EC38-4C49-11D6-A161-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 9 Apr 2002 23:08:07 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] problem reading attachment"}
