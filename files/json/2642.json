If\nyou are not concerned with fixture efficiency, put any value you like\nthere. Osram HMI 4000 W/SE has a total lumen output of 380,000 lm, if\nyou'd like to have a realistic number there anyway.\n\nMost photometric viewers can calculate the lumens out of a fixture\neasily. I plugged your file (with an arbitrary number in the lumens per\nlamp field) into a program called Photometric Viewer (from Acuity\nBrands) and it showed the fixture to output 37,982 lumens. Based on the\nnumber of lumens coming out of the Osram lamp, that would be about a 10%\nfixture efficiency. Seems low, but then again, I don't know what a 4000W\nMetal Halide fixture looks like anyway.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nHalley\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060803/8f717217/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Fitzpatrick, Halley D", "datetime": "Thu Aug  3 19:08:31 2006"}
