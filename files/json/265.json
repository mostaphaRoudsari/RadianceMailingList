I am completely new to UNIX, so my question may\nbe simplistic.  Please bare with me.  If this question is\ninappropriate, then please let me know, and I will not fill your\ninboxes.\n\nI read Greg Ward's response to Galen Burrell, and tried following the\ndirection.\n\nWhen I try running the ./makeall install script, I always come up with\nerrors.\nWhen I try copying the files manually, I also run into problems\n\nI'm trying to install into /usr/local/radiance\n\nWith the cp -rp lib /usr/local/radiance/lib/ray command, I get a\nmessage saying that the file is identical.\nWith the cp -p src/*.cal /usr/local/radiance/lib/ray command, I get a\nmessage saying that there was no match.\n\nI'm sure it's my ignorance that's causing the problem.\n\nAgain, I'm a complete newbie, so I really don't know what I'm doing,\nbut am willing to learn and experiment.\n\nCan you point me to a resource that will help me understand the install\nprocess?  I understand that my question is really remedial, but I know\nI'll understand better the installation process under UNIX through this\ntask of having to install Radiance.\n\n\nThanks in advance for your time and patience.\n\n\n\nJohn An\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John An", "datetime": "Fri, 20 Sep 2002 12:19:57 -0400"}
