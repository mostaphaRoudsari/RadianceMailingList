{"body": "\nHi Martin,\n\nYour rpiece result with dark blocks is what I might expect if the output\nbuffer position gets off by one byte, though I would expect the colors\nto shift dramatically as well.  I might be able to give you some better\nhelp if you can compress the picture file and put it on a website\nsomewhere that I can retrieve it.  I looked at the rpiece code, and\nthere are plenty of places where NFS could screw up, or it may be that\nthere is a detail about the fcntl() file locking call I don't know, and\nit ends up modifying what I supposed was a read-only parameter.\n\nIt's also possible that there is a bug I fixed a long time ago in\nrpiece, and you just need the newer version.  Try downloading the latest\n(3.4) release of Radiance from http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance and do a\ndiff between the src/util/rpiece.c file there and the one in your code\ntree.  Send it to me.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Problem with big pictures", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0522C053-4CB0-11D6-A513-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 10 Apr 2002 11:23:13 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Problem with big pictures"}
