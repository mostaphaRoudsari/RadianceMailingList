So I need a sed-command maybe,\nthat finds the normal vertex reference by examining the /-seperated\ntriples in lines beginning with f and replace the normal vertex index by\n0. And it should take care of lines that are continued after a line\nbreak, indicated by a backslash, as that seams to be valid in obj.\n\nI am not very good in sed. If someone has a tested sed-string (I guess\nso) it would be great if you could post it, might be of general\ninterest. If not, I will have to think myself ;-) and make hundreds of\nfailed attempts to get this done...\n\nThanks... Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
