You can load your obj into UVMapper and then\nexport it with or without normals, UVs, Regions, etc.\n\nIf you have a lot of obj's this may not be the greatest solution, but\ntry it out.  This is a must have if you model in Lightwave and export\nyour models in obj format and you WANT normals, because LW does not\nexport normal info.\n\nkirk\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nKirk L.
