{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nIt is normal due to gamut issues for some saturated colors to be out\nof gamut.  Even if macbethcal issues a warning about some moderate\ncolors being out of gamut, it may not be a serious problem, and you\nshould judge based on your results.  If you have access to a\ncolorimeter, you could check the RGB values against it with the\nxyz_rgb.cal file in the ray/src/cal/cal directory using icalc or\nrcalc as described in:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n8_1b.html#COLOR_AND\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Scanner Calibration w/ Macbethcal", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AC195EF2-B85C-40DA-B8DB-D736AA08BEEE@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<BAY102-F76B0E9F2F307CCE719B8DA4AB0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Mon Aug 29 06:56:41 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Scanner Calibration w/ Macbethcal"}
