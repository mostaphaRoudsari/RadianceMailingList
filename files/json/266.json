(with osx..) (and on  dual\nathlon linux box...)\ni m not a beginner, but not so more...\nwhat you can do (IF you are a mac user like me, with little unix\nknowledge):\n\n(ELSE wait for BETTER ANSWER...)\n\n\n\n0)log on your system with root permissions (watch out! you are root... )\n\n1) install xdarwin (it seems you did already, anyway you can get it\nfrom http://mrcla.com/XonX/)\n\n2)get tinkertool to view hidden files (so you can use aqua GUI to move\nand copy files ;-))))) (get it from\nhttp://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool2.html)\n\n3)copy the files (binaries precompiled from ftp @radiste) into\n'usr/x11r6/bin/'  (i suggest to backup your current 'usr/x11r6/bin '\ndirectory...BEFORE!!!)\n\n4)then copy the libraries to 'usr/local/lib/ray/' (you should create\n'ray' directory before..) (make it readable for others user)\n\n5)copy manuals into 'man' directory (usr/share/man/) without\noverwriting pre-existing directories... (back up BEFORE doing anything)\n\n6)login as normal users... open xdarwin... enjoy with radiance!!!!\n\nPS. may be you should change permissions to read library directory (and\nto find rayinit.cal)  (you can use command 'chmod' .. 'man chmod')\n\ni hope my email was useful.\nregards,\npillo\n(quite beginner)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance install on Mac OS X (Jaguar)", "tags": [], "sender": "pillo", "datetime": "Fri, 20 Sep 2002 21:47:19 +0200"}
