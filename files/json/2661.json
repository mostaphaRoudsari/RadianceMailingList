{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nI have recently attempted to calibrate my scanner using a Macbeth Color\nChart in conjunction with Radiance's macbethcal. I have run into some issues\nwith 1-3 of my colors (depending on the scanner settings) being out of gamut\nfrom reviewing by debug.pic. What I would like to know is if there is any\nway to rectify this situation? If not, how concerned should I be with this?\nI wish to use calibrated colors in order to match some of the paint color\nswatches that are available at many hardware stores for use in my\nrenderings.  Regarding my scanner, I am using an Epson Perfection 2480. Its\na great scanner and therefore I wish not to have to replace it in order to\nexperiment in finding another scanner that will keep the colors within\ngamut. As far as my scanner settings, I choose no auto exposure (selecting\nthis option too leaves some colors out of gamut) and no color correction.\nAny thoughts or ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Scanner Calibration w/ Macbethcal", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F76B0E9F2F307CCE719B8DA4AB0@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Aug 26 01:05:48 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Scanner Calibration w/ Macbethcal"}
