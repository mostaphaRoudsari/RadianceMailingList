{"body": "\nHi Martin,\n\nNow that you mention it, I think this is not a bug in rpiece, but a bug\nI fixed in the expression evaluation code.  After 2^32 evaluations, the\nexpression clock was wrapping and causing expression results to go stale\n(expressions are anything from a .cal file, including picture mapping\ncoordinates and sky functions).  This would have the effect you noticed\non large pictures, but wouldn't affect shorter renderings.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in version 3.4, and you should rerun your\nsimulation with the new version to check if the problem goes away.  Be\nsure to pick up the 3.4.1 patch release while you're at it.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Re: Problem with big pictures", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1B4215E2-4E39-11D6-AC1F-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 12 Apr 2002 10:17:03 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Re: Problem with big pictures"}
