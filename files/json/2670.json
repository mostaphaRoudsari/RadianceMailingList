I believe this is the cause of your two distinct\nrenderings.  Perhaps someone else has some ideas as to how to get a\nrougher material that still renders a decent reflection of an area light?\n\nP.S.\nI had a look at your website Ian, any chance you might want to share\nthose perl scripts you have that generated your sphereflake and water\ngeometries?  I'm always interested in seeing geometry generators that\npeople have created.\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Area lights breaking up?", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<430C8E05.8070607@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<20050824052916.12d3dd93@saavik.ian.testers.net.au>\t<430B7D43.1080208@rumblestrip.org>", "<20050824101118.77e0377d@saavik.ian.testers.net.au>"], "datetime": "Wed Aug 24 17:11:48 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Area lights breaking up?"}
