Means, a random noise\nfunction gives you a value between 0 and 1 (or -1 and 1),and dependent\non that a color is drawn / interpolated from a handful of values.\n\nOften I use 5 color-maps, so you have 4 'division' values, between 0 and\n1 (the fifth is always 1.0, so it is left out), and of course a color\nrgb tripel for each division)\nChanging the color of a pattern thus means the tedious job of changing\nall the 5 color values. As a first start, simply leave the division\nvalues as the are (i.e. arg 1,5,9,13) and just change the color tripels.\nAs an additional awkwardness, some patterns are set up as a mixture of\ntwo layers, so you have to do this color-editing twice, once for each\nlayer..\n\ntiles:\nThe problem with the whole pattern file business is that you need lots\nof calculations files for each different pattern or variant of a it,\nand, well, that small collection I've produced covers only a few cases.\nIn the tiles/no tiles case, however, there is a trick:\njust make the tile x and y step (arg(40) and arg(41) for the marble\npattern) very large, larger than the object made out of that material,\n(and maybe use a translation transformation also),\nso that no tile grouts appear on your object.\n\nHope this helps\n-Carsten\n\n\n\n\n--\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Der Deckel mu? zugehen.\"    (P.K?lsch)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Carsten Bauer marble cal fi", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Fri Sep  1 22:02:01 2006"}
