Changing sync/async and wdelay/no_wdelay could have some effect.\n\nrw,soft,bg\nI think now they are more like\nrsize=8192, wsize=8192, auto, user, rw\n\nThanks,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] NFS and rpiec", "tags": [], "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "datetime": "Fri Sep  1 23:29:43 2006"}
