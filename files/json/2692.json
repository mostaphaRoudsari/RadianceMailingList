I have\nhad some reasonable success with another  cluster system called OpenSSi\n(www.openssi.org), which has a cluster wide filesystem called cfs. I am\ncurrently looking at something called warewulf (www.warewulf.org) and\nthinking about running diskless clients. I have had some discussions\nwith the people on the list there and some of the things that have been\nsuggested are: lustre (www.lustre.org) and pvfs2 (www.pvfs.org). These\nare cluster oriented distributed filesystems, though I do not no how\nthey manage file locking and cache coherence across all nodes. People on\nthis group have also suggested that NFS might be ok on a small cluster\nassuming a well configured server.\n\nWhen you are using OpenMosix and Radiance are you letting OpenMosix\nmigrate automatically or are you specify which node you want a given job\nto run on. Do you find it distributes rpiece jobs correctly?\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060902/8ea4f5e7/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] NFS and rpiec", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Sat Sep  2 22:44:53 2006"}
