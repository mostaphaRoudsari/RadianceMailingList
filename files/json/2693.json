{"body": "\nHi folks,\n\nWebpages at radiance-online are updated to rad3R7P1 .\n\nFor a change, the full tar file (including aux libs, TIFF libs and all) is now\ncalled rad3R7P1all.tar.gz (8.6MB).\n\nrad3R7P1.tar.gz (1.5MB) needs the \"auxiliary files\" rad3R7P1supp.tar.gz.\n\nrad3R7P1 and the HEAD release had been identical as of 9. Aug 2005. As before,\npatches are generated nightly between the last official (rad3R7P1) and the\ncurrent HEAD release.\n\nAs an extra, Greg has thrown in binaries for MacOs and Linux. The latter\nwere compiled here, which is a \"Debian, i386, Sarge\" Linux distribution. I'd\nexpect the binaries to run on other, reasonable current, Linux dists as well.\n\nso much for house keeping,\nhappy rendering\n\nregards\nPeter Apian-Bennewitz\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20050811053534.GA23493@www.radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Aug 11 07:35:40 2005", "email": "apian at www.radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rad3R7P1 avail"}
