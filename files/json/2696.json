It only lists crop, spotmeter. Sometimes it lists two more options (redeye, calibration), but none of them is pano orig. I am using the latest Photosphere 1.6U. Can somebody outline the steps, please? I have a series of HDR images in the catalog and would like to turn them into one panorama image. The images have common features/an overlap.\n\nRegards,\n\nMartin\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 2677 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060904/b17f85b3/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Martin Moeck", "datetime": "Mon Sep  4 22:02:05 2006"}
