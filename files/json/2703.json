{"body": "\nHallo Greg, hallo Radiance Community!\n\nI'm trying to compare some Radiance-simulation results with experimental measurements (i know it's not that easy, i'm just trying).\nAs I would like to isolate (as good as possible) the effects of glazing system and skylight distribution, i'm looking for diffusing materials for my scale-room which can be  physically very good  modeled with Radiance. That is materials whose BRTDF is not more complex than a TRANS-type. So that i don't have to worry too much about them (??).\nSome textil materials (such as molleton for theater applications)  seem to be good diffusing ones, with an almost lambertian behaviour, but i'm still searching...\nHas anybody in the community a good tip (matt paint, etc.)?\n\nThanks a lot for any contribution and have a nice day,\nfederico\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050908/af90be84/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Federico Giovannetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<002901c5b461$7a5cb2d0$e400a8c0@PC501fg>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Sep  8 12:24:43 2005", "email": "f.giovannetti at isfh.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Materials for scale model room"}
