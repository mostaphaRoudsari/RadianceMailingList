{"body": "\nHi Alexa!\n\nThanks for responding my email. I've been `playing? with the \"pvalue\"\ncommand and I assume I obtain the x-y position of the pixel of any picture\nand the R, G, and B value of that pixle. You told me in your e-mail that\nis up to me how I interpret this RGB data. When I use the pvalue I obtain\ndata like this (for example):\n\n\nxposition     y position      R            G              B\n\n345            240       7.495e-02    7.495e-02     3.495e-02\n\nHowever, which type of units are this? Are there no units at all? Is this\nilluminance? Also, in most of my pixels, the R,G, and B data is the same,\ni.e, 7.495e-02 in the three (RGB). Does this means that that pixel has a\nneutral color?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nAdriana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Obtaining RGB output data", "sender": "alira@gsd.harvard.edu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1225.132.248.209.37.1126217988.squirrel@132.248.209.37>", "refs": ["<1296.132.248.209.37.1124917144.squirrel@132.248.209.37>", "<430D91B6.50000@bradford.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Fri Sep  9 00:20:53 2005", "email": "alira at gsd.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Obtaining RGB output data"}
