(Perhaps some\ndon't do this at all?)  With AutoCAD constantly updating, We are losing\nour ability to export from AutoCAD into Radiance.\n\n\n\nWe may end up just writing a tool that does this, but before embarking\non such a task, I though I'd see what is available, maybe what is new,\nand what's coming up.\n\n\n\nAny thoughts or comments would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060907/0b8a63c4/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Thu Sep  7 16:05:44 2006"}
