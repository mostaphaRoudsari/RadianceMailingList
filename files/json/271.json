The whole\nexercise seems a bit exotic, what's your reason not to use rpict ?\n\nShould you'll be looking for converting from a pic file (rendered by\nrpict or rview) to PPM, use ra_ppm .\n\nregards\nPeter\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Thu, 03 Oct 2002 10:32:19 +0200"}
