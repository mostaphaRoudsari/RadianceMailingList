(Hi Rob!)\n\nJack, you posted some good info there, glad to hear Polytrans is working\n(sort of) for you.  I'm looking for a DWG --> OBJ translator myself, as\nI'm building an object library here and would like to start using the\nmesh primitive for more drapey surfaces like sofa cushions and the like.\n\nI've been using AutoCAD for 13 years now, and I love it, but I hate the\nforced upgrades and the extra translation hoops we have to go through,\nespecially as the smaller developers cannot keep up with the changes.\nRayfront is in this unfortunate situation now.  We still have a couple\nof licenses for ACAD2000 (the most recent version that Rayfront and\nradout work with), but the daylighting team has grown in size here and\nso now we are forced to compete for licenses as we try to get our models\ninto Rayfront.  Maybe we'll look at some of the programs you've\nmentioned as alternatives.  Thanks, Jack!\n\n- Rob\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Sep  7 18:02:17 2006"}
