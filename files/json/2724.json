A problem with the dwg import is that\nit is based on OpenDWG, which is perfectly fine for non-solid entities.\nHowever ACIS is proprietary, so the reverse engineering in the dwg\nimport option is far from perfect in my trials. I have corresponded with\nRobert Landsdale at Okino, he is of the mind that the \"right\" way to do\nconversion of solid geometry is by exporting ACIS data from Autocad and\nthen importing with one of their special modules (additional cost), one\nof which is reverse engineered and the other uses a fully licensed ACIS\nlibrary. I have no clue though whether surface geometry would get\nexported via the acis option in Autocad. And further I do not have a\nsense for what resulting geometry grouping/organization would be. I know\nthat we depend on Autocad layering as a material/organizational strategy.\n\nSome additional food for thought. The folks who sell OBJ Export have a\nwhole slew of cad geometry import export tools. They are based out of\nIndia and I believe are quite able to develop custom applications if\nneeded....\n\n-Jack\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Sep  7 18:36:12 2006"}
