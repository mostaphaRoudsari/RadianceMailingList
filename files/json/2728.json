{"body": "\nDear All,\n\nI am trying to calculate the direct light from the sky for a reference\ngrid within a number of rooms. I am sure there is a sophisticated manner\nin which to achieve this, but I have cobbled together an approach in the\nfollowing way:\n\ndelete the ground source glow from the sky.rad description\nuse rtrace to calculate the values for the points, but set -av 0 0 0 and\nuse a single material for all surfaces (except apertures!) which is\nexcluded from the ambient calculation using -ae.\n\nThere are some points within the rooms, which I am pretty certain do not\nhave a direct view of the skydome, and therefore should return a zero\nvalue, but they do not.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nregards\n\nNick\n\n\n--\nNick Devlin\nXCO2\n1-5 Offord Street\nLondon N1 1DH\n\nTel: 020 7700 1000\nFax: 020 7700 4455\n\nEngineering Sustainability\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "nick devlin", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<op.sxhu7us2bxkgpz@domingo.xco2_group>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Sep 22 10:02:01 2005", "email": "nickd at xco2.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Compute direct component from sky only"}
