The story should\nshow up on the main page (www.cgarchitect.com) in an hour or so, but\nthe direct link will take you there now:\n\nhttp://www.cgarchitect.com/news/Reviews/Review013_1.asp\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to say that I had a great time there,\nand learned a lot.  It was great to meet some folks I have known\nelectronically for many years!  I wanted to send the editor a copy of\nthe picture Greg took of all of us, but my email for the last 24 hours\nhas been fairly well screwed up.  I seem to be able to send, but cannot\nreceive.  This, as you may expect, is causing me a great deal of\nfrustration.  Raphael, keep trying.  I hope to have my email back up by\ntomorrow, or I look for another host!!\n\nAs an aside, I am deeply depressed over the early exit of the New York\nYankees from baseball's post season.  But I am enjoying watching the\nAtlanta Braves get spanked by the Giants this evening.  (I'm fully\naware that the majority of the workshop attendees could not care less\nabout the whims of a band of jocks swinging a wooden stick at a hurled\nball, but I feel the need to vent.)\n\nI hope you all had a good return trip from the workshop.  When's the\nnext one? ;-)\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sun, 6 Oct 2002 22:20:34 -0400"}
