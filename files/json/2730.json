All geometry which Autocad can read can be\nexported to Relux and then to Radiance.\n\nBut there is another more direct way, the current version of Relux can\nalso read 3DS (no textures), DXF (3d faces) and VRML directly. We are\nworking on the limitations, esp. the texture import for 3DS. This\ngeometries can then be exported to Radiance without having a licence.\n\nSiegbert\n--\nDr.-Ing.
