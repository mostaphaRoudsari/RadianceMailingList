{"body": "\nThomas,\n\nthanks for that. I had tried it in the past but rtrace returns values of\nzero!!\n\nI was confused about this, until I remember that for a uniform, or\novercast sky (the types I am testing), the sky is a glow source, which I\nbelieve is not tested in the direct calculation.\nwhich means I am back to the drawing board.\n\nI thought about subtracting the ambient values from the total illuminance\nvalues, but this is no help either as sky glow falls in the ambient file.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nregards\n\nnick\n\n\nMessage: 8\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; delsp=yes; format=flowed\n\n\nOn 22.09.2005, at 10:00, nick devlin wrote:\n\n\n\nYou have to set \"-ab 0\" as well or ...\n\n\n\n... you get indirect contributions from the sky.\n\nIf I do understand the discussions on the list correctly you have to\ntake into\naccount _only_ direct components for ie. \"Right of Light\" and other\nlegal stuff.\nIn reality the indirect components do count as well.\n\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Compute direct component from sky only", "sender": "tbleicher@arcor.de", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8089AB3B-D9E9-4498-9B68-14F0188A1BB7@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<E1EINs7-0001lF-Cb@ptb-mxcore02.plus.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 22 Sep 2005 11:36:57 +0200", "email": "Thomas Bleicher", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Compute direct component from sky onlyTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"}
