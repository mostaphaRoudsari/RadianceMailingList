{"body": "\n\nWell, I guess I'm overly optimistic.  I keep hoping Windows will go\naway, too...\n\nThe problem with implementing our own lock manager using lock files\nis the overhead involved in setting the lock.  I'm currently\nobtaining a lock every time I write out to the ambient file, and I'm\nworried that the time it takes to do our own locking if multiple\ncross-network file creations and checks are involved will totally\nkill the performance.  If that's the case, we would be better off not\nsharing the ambient file at all, which is the current workaround.\n\nThe more sophisticated solution is to somehow measure the performance\nof our lock manager as we use it, and optimize our ambient value\nbuffer size accordingly.  This requires a lot more work on the\nprogramming side, and I figure it would take about a week plus an\nother week of testing to come up with something workable.  As usual,\nthere are no funds for this, so it sits on the back burner (which is\nswitched off) and grows mold.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mac OSX, xgrid and RADIANCE", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<01B72AD1-EC24-468D-A426-F58435D8D078@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<5D32DAB1-3A3A-4F7F-8628-ACACE19865AB@biomechanicsinc.com>", "<4331E346.9030403@rumblestrip.org>", "<A01FA3BE-21C9-414D-9761-0727F7A421B2@gmail.com>", "<Pine.BSF.4.58.0509212017500.97764@emancholl.pair.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Sep 22 19:52:32 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Mac OSX, xgrid and RADIANCE"}
