{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nI hadn't realized that Mark Stock had finalized his new benchmark.\nIt's really nice.\n\nI gave it a try today, and also found my G5 running 10.4 to come up\nshort in the tests.  I have a 1.8 GHz G5 PowerMac, which performed\njust slightly bettern than a 1.6 GHz P4-M running Linux and compiled\nwith gcc 3.3.2 -O3.  (My copy was compiled with gcc 4.0.0 -O2.)\nWhat's even more surprising is that 1.5 GHz G4 laptop is about 13%\nfaster than my G5, when by the clock it should be at least 17%\nslower!  I suspect there's something really wrong with gcc 4.0 on the\nG5, and since it's just come out, it hasn't been fixed.  Compiling\nwith -ffast is not usually a good idea, as that's always broken\nthings in the past, but you could try it just to see what happens.\n(I wouldn't trust it on any paying jobs, though.)  I might try -ffast-\nmath tomorrow if I get time.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mac OSX, xgrid and RADIANCE", "sender": "Gregory J.
