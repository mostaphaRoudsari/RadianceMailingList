{"body": "\nThomas,\n\nI used mkillum yesterday and bingo!!! got some better results, that I am\ntrying to validate.\nOne question though, I just need to be certain that there is no ambient\nlight in my results.\n\nso to check, I am using the following for mkillum and then rtrace:\n\nmkillum -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1\n-st .01 -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -av 0 0 0 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -af\nscene2.amb scene2.oct < window.rad > mkwin2.rad\n\nrtrace -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1\n-st .01 -ae Zero_Ref -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -av 0 0 0 -lr 12 -lw\n.0005 -af scene2.amb mkscene2.oct < mk1.pts > existing3.dat\n\nI assume that by setting -ab 0 and -av 0 0 0 there should be no ambient\ncalculation, and indeed, lookamb just returns the values from rtrace,\nrather than a data file for value, position etc.. I believe this is a good\nthing.\n\nYour thoughts would be greatly apprecicated however.\n\nmany thanks\n\nnick\n\n\nOn 22.09.2005, at 13:19, nick devlin wrote:\n\n\nYou could probably replace your windows with illums\nusing mkillum and a higher -ab value.
