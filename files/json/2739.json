However, that being said\nI think that if another package needs to be introduced then cost is a\nbig big issue. Polytrans with the CadPak is ~$540 I think. As Form Z is\na full blown cad/modeling application, I expect it costs ~$2000?\n\nI guess if I was using Autocad and wanted/needed to introduce another\npackage I might look at Rhino which does stuff that Autocad is not very\ngood at.\n\n-Jack\n\nChris Jessee wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: *** Spam ***  Re: [Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Sep 14 17:14:13 2006"}
