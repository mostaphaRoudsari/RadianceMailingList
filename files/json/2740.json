Although expensive,\n($1200) FormZ has proven over time to be a solid tool for repairing\ntroublesome geometry files from AutoCad and other CAD packages.\nRhino may also be a good choice but I have no knowledge of it.\n\nTo meet your immediate need I offer to process your dwg file through\nFormZ so you might evaluate it's usefulness prior to spending any money.\n\nThank you,\n\nChris Jessee\n\n\n\n\nOn Sep 14, 2006, at 11:13 AM, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: *** Spam ***  Re: [Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?", "tags": [], "sender": "Chris Jessee", "datetime": "Thu Sep 14 18:37:01 2006"}
