But I\ndon't think there are fixed criteria for this.\n\n\nAccording to the man page you're looking for the \"-t\" option. The\ntable used for the lookups by default is called \"lamp.tab\" in the\nbase directory of your RAYPATH.\n\nThe first column in this file are the patterns Radiance knows about\nby default. If you have more detailed information about your lamps\nyou can create your own lookup table and use the \"-f\" option in\npfilt to specify your table. See the comments at the top of lamp.tab.\n\nAn example would be:\n\npfilt -t \"warm white\" neutral.pic > warm.pic\n\nIf you use a type that's not listed in the table pfilt will tell\nyou about it.\n\nI think you have to start with a white balanced image or the results\nwill be usefull. I tried it on my benchmark pics and the \"warm\" filtered\nimage turned out blue ...\n\nHTH,\n\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] About lamp color", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4B87BFB5-B76D-47E6-A8C3-2691F133419B@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<001101c5c241$3b1f58a0$1f7af90a@hwx>"], "datetime": "Mon Sep 26 18:29:02 2005", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] About lamp color"}
