I used -ab 1 before. I already have exlde\nlists for the ambient calculation. The glow for illumination is a nice\nidea, if I just want to see the position of light sources. But if they\nare to illuminate the scene?\n\nI was thinking of making even heavier use of mkillum. First, bundling\nthe light sources, so that there will be hundreds, not thousand, at\nleast in the indirect calculation. Than it may make sense to divide the\ninterior with illum panes, so that e.g. the light contributed from the\ngalleries to the main room is precomputed by mkillum. Finally I may end\nby dividing the whole scene in virtual rooms seperated by illum panes?\n\nIs there a patch for current radiance that allows an alternative\nmodifier (like void) for the indirect calculation? That is available in\nRadzilla and might be very helpful, as I have colorpict maps on most\nsurfaces.\n\nThanks & CU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient resolution and memor", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
