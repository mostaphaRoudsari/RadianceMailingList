{"body": "\nI'm not a mathmatical type, so I can't advise you on a cal file, though I'm\nsure there's a way.\n\nBut you could use a 2 color pic file and project it on sideways.. say 7/8 is\nred and 1/8 is white.  That should give you a white circle on a red ball.\nGive the pic enough resolution so the color boundary is crisp.\nYou'll have to make it an octree and use it as an instance if you want to\nmove it randomly.\n\nHTH\nRob F\n\n-----Original Message-----\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nSent: 9/26/2005 4:41 PM\nhi,\nI want to generate a pool-ball like object. Basically, instead of\nhaving a uniform colored object, I want to add some other color to the\nobject but the object is made of uniform material. Can I generate a\n.cal file and directly manipulate the color at specific location using\nlocal coordinates and use colorFunc to add the pattern? It sounds\ntrival to do but I m having trouble generating it right. Thank you\nvery much.\n\n--\nalways on full sail during high tides\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "bei.xiao@gmail.co", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B8DD8375FCE2C94B9F170D9277C1FA2B8C5B1D@corvallis>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Sep 27 18:28:50 2005", "email": "bei.xiao@gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] adding color pattern"}
