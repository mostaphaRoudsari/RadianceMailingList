However, exporting less then 100 polygons is pretty instantaneous.  I find that when 3D models are overly complex, they were drawn for architectural renderings and I end up re-drawing parts of them anyway.\n\n\"I guess I had not thought about Torad for quite some time. How are you\nfinding the speed of the export process with Torad? I guess the nice\nthings about this, is that there is probably a group of users who might\nbe able to support this since we can actually see the source code.\"\n\nAs far as updating and maintaining, are there any legal issues with updating and/or modifying Torad?\n\nChris,\n\nThank you for your offer.  I may send you a simple model just to go through the process.\n\nMark\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060915/9cacb7ac/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "datetime": "Fri Sep 15 16:25:28 2006"}
