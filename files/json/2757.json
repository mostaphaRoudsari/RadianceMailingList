I just happened to know the\npossible translation pipeline.... I guess am not surprised that the file\nis large. How large is the corresponding radiance data? Are you also\ntranslating the materials? You will most likely need to have materials\ndefined in vrml and perhaps even some lighting for proper display. I\nhave posted this back to the list. Perhaps someone else has some insights?\n\n-Jack\n\nYun-Xian Ho wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rad to wr", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed Sep 20 16:28:50 2006"}
