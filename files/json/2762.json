If this is the case, you should set the RAYPATH environment\nvariable. It must include the path where the files ending .cal have been\ninstalled on your computer, often this is a directory called lib or\nlibrary in your radiance installation.\n\nI do not know how to set the variable, as this changes with every\nversion of windows and I am not an experienced user of that system at\nall. If you do not know, find it in the documentation or ask some\nwindows admin.\n\nGood luck!\n\nLars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] simulation problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
