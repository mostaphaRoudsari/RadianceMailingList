I wonder if I can get some guidance on using\nRadiance for this kind of calculation.  I'm thinking perhaps I can set up a\nCIE overcast sky and turn off the effect of all reflected light.  Then I\ncould compare the amount of light falling first on an unobstructed\nhorizontal plane, then on an unobstructed vertical surface, and finally on\nthe centre points of all the windows on the building, taking into account\nthe shading provided by the surrounding buildings.  Can anyone advise me on\nthe best way of doing this?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nNick Doylend\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Nick Doylend", "datetime": "Fri Sep 22 13:41:20 2006"}
