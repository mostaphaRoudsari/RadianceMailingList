{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nYou are correct that the real arguments cannot be expressions.  The\ndefinition of a diffuse component is one that does not change with\nangle, so there should be no need to define these parameters as\nvariables.  If you have some varying portion to your BRDF, then put\nthis in the directional-diffuse component, which are string arguments\n7-9 for BRTDfunc.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  On my mailer, the first message came through better than the\nsecond.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Calculating diffuse component in a BRTDfunc", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DDE6AB1F-FE5D-4383-98B2-E8F2732ECBD5@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<07fa01c5c5a7$c52e3fc0$0c01a8c0@JELLE> <433D4749.5010302@iebele.nl>"], "datetime": "Fri Sep 30 18:28:51 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Calculating diffuse component in a BRTDfunc"}
