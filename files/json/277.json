{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI am rendering an animation of an interior scene. At this moment one\nframe takes about half an hour to render(*), with fine results per\nframe. When I view the frames as an animation however, the artifacts are\n\"unstable\". It looks like Radiance renders shadows,\nreflections(specularity) and indirect illumination in a random way.\nSometimes objects also get different color intensities in the rendered\nimage, as if they were lit in a (radical) other way.\nI have rendered a lot of still images in Radiance and never noticed that\ntwo renderings with exactly the same geometry, render-options, viewport\netc. results in slightly different images (!).\nHow can I solve this? Does anybody knows how to render without these\n\"moving artifacts\"? Is there a random thing in Radiance that we can turn\noff ?\n\nRegards,\n\nIebele\n\n\n(*)  Below are the settings I use for the rendering. I know that I can\nincrease the quality using different settings, but that is not the point\nhere. My point is that the overall solution has too many, and\nunexpectable differences between  rendered images.\n\nThe settings are (as they appear in my ran file):\nDIRECTORY  = /disk11/ani01\nOCTREE = glow.oct\nVIEWFILE = ani01.vp\nSTART  = 1\nEND  = 448\nBASENAME = /disk11/ani01/ani01%03d\nDISKSPACE = 250\nOVERSAMPLE = 4\nINTERPOLATE = 0\nRESOLUTION = 720 576\nrender = -dp 1024 -ab 1 -ad 1024 -ar 2048 -as 512 -aa 0.2 -lr 1 -st 0.01\n-ps 8 -av 20 20 20\npfilt  = -r .7\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "atelier iebele abel", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3CD284B0.72EB180C@iebele.nl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 03 May 2002 14:38:09 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] animation"}
