I know for certain\nwhat will work is the following:\n\nstep 1: define your instance such as inst.rad\n\nvoid instance test\n1 some-instance.oct\n0\n0\n\nstep 2: to deploy your instance in an array use a call to xform perhaps\nin its own file (or in some scene description) such as array.rad\n\n!xform -a 10 -t 10 0 0 inst.rad\n\nthis will make an array in X of inst.rad repeated 10 time at unit\nintervals of 10.\n\n-Jack\n\nJelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060925/e408c34c/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] instance primitive & xform", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon Sep 25 22:40:37 2006"}
