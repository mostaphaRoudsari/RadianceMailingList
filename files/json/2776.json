The only limitation is\nthat you cannot specify mirror transformations using it. And I do not\nknow a converter that writes out instances/references/blocks/symbols in\nCAD files as their corresponding triangle markers, so you have to care\nabout it yourself. In formZ, use the symbol detail level (e.g. detail\nlevel containing geometry, level 2 triangle) and you get the whole thing\nnicely integrated into your CAD/modeler.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] instances", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
