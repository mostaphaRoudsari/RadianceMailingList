{"body": "\nI like Blender, because it is open and it is Python accessible.  This\nwas partially why I started to learn Python.  Poser, a 3D figure\nanimation package also has a Python API.  It turns out that several\nother things I am interested in are accessible through Python,\nincluding ODE (the open dynamics engine for physical simulation, etc).\n\nTo answer your question, Blender has a nice set of modeling and\nrendering tools - I haven;t used it in a while, but am getting back\ninto it because of the natural potential for tying it to RADIANCE\nobject generation (not as slick as b/rad or some of the exporters,\nthough).\n\nSo much to do.\n\nI was considering bash as the next shell to learn, as i too have\ndissected some of Greg's shell programs and have begun to understand\nthe significance of scripting and programming RADIANCE.\n\n\n\nkirk\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
