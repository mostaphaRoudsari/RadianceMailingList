However, we do not what exactly Jelle's objectives\nare with respect to numeric accuracy. I would suggest to anyone\ninterested to go back and read both May and June threads as Rob points\nout below. It is very interesting and suggests the method of mapping\ndirectly to the interior window surfaces to get both the environment\nmapping as well as the distribution output. I had been thinking of\nmapping to a source.\nThanks! We are working on another night lighting project now where I\nhope to use similar techniques. One thing that is intriguing from a\ndesign standpoint, is when the architect says the want to try out some\ndifferent things, the possibility is to actually run rtcontrib with all\nthe needed sources (including optional ones and \"what if\") and then\ngenerating various images shows the possible scenarios as a result.\nThis is a great thread, I recommend it....\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient setting for very large scenes", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Sep 28 21:41:25 2006"}
