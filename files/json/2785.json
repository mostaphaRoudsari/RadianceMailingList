How would such an approach work\non Radiance? I remember it's been quite a help, but am not sure if it would\nmake sense for Radiance.\n\nCheers,\n\n-jelle\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "datetime": "Mon Oct  2 12:46:32 2006"}
