{"body": "\n\nDear All,\n\nGood day everyone! I am new to Radiance and I want to use this wonderfull software for my Phd in Architecture which involves a lot of simulation.Unfortunately I am aWindows user without time to learn Linux or Unix from scratch.I have looked at the different forms of the windows versions like Desktop radiance, but I discovered on some site that it is for \"less serious\" scientists. Is that true?Also I have been advised to use either CYGWIN or a CD-rom version from ftp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/\nI may not be able to use cygwin 'cos it does not have resume and being in a developing country where electric power supply is not guaranteed, this is aproblem. Also the learnix version too does not have a resume capability(using DAP) variety  for download. Pls I need some advice on what to do.\n\nA big thanks to everyone and more grease to everyone's elbows!!!\n\n\n\nAbubakar Salisu\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo! for Good\nClick here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050927/98d47d0f/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Abubakar Salisu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20050927200825.42172.qmail@web35307.mail.mud.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Sep 27 22:09:47 2005", "email": "arcsalisu at yahoo.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Windows enabled Radiance"}
