You should\nwrite to Eleanor to ask.  I have no problem sharing the model, but\nbear in mind that it's more like a set of scripts than a model.  We\nonly ever look at one floor at a time, since constructing the whole\ntower with all those thousands of tubes would be a waste of\nresources.  Also, there is the urban model to consider.  I'm not sure\nwe even have the rights to distribute that.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: ambient setting for very large scenes", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
