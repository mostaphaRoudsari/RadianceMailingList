The \"s\" is\nfor \"system\" time, or time spent executing system calls -- usually\ndisk i/o and the like.  The final \"r\" is \"real\" time, or hours passed\nin total, and gives an idea of what percentage of the cpu you are\ngetting, e.g. (50.244+0.452)/53.318 means you're getting 95% of the\nprocessor.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reporting Inf", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
