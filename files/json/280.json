{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nIMHO, the only real non-trivial problem with incorrectly oriented\nsurfaces happens with solid glass (=dielectric) objects. If the CAD\nspills out polygons with quasi-random orientation (AutoCAD 12 caused me\nsome temporary headaches years back), hand tweaking the orientations is\nnot an option. Problems with orientation of glow and spotlight surfaces\nare typically easier to hand-tweak. All other surfaces, as you know,\ndon't care for orientation.\n\nhttp://www.pab-opto.de/progs/rshow/rshow.html - shows surface\norientation too (when moving the mouse over surfaces and keeping the\nmiddle (OS-X ??) button down.) come to think of it,- there's no OS-X\nversion available yet.\n\n\nrshow has an option for that too\n...\nI guess one problem with libraries is the naming. When 4 people find\n\"Sandblasted\" in the list, they have 25 different ideas how that looks\nin reality. \"Lightly sandblasted\" doesn't help either.\n...\nNo way. CPU architectures (super-scalar, pipelining, cache coherence)\nplus compiler optimizations de-correlate clock speed from rendering\ntimes.\n\nI've got no experience with 2Ghz (AMD ?) dual boards, although all other\nduals (PII 200MHz- PIII 1Ghz) worked as expected so far. Mem speed, disk\ntimes (if needed, typically not so much for Radiance during rendering,\nrpict does heavy I/O only at startup while reading the scene) and cache\nsize may slow down overall throughput.\nbtw: With rpict, -PP allows sharing the geometry between two rpict\nprograms on the same machine. Useful for large scenes.\n\n-Peter\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3CDAD4F8.E936A2FE@pab-opto.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 09 May 2002 21:58:48 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Too many questions to fit in the subjectReferences: <3CDA629A.13873.83396C@localhost>"}
