Would ra_pict apply\nthe same?\n\nOr - does anyone have suggestions for a cheap or free Mac moviemaker from\ntiff to Quicktime?\niMovie treats each image as a 5 second graphic, not one frame\nI've been using Moover, a Mac OS9 app that converts picts to QT.\n\nCreated ran2tiff program to automate exposure setting of animation sequences\nusing a moving histogram in combination with pcond, and converting frames to\nTIFF.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Fitzsimmons, Rob", "datetime": "Sat Oct 28 01:07:15 2006"}
