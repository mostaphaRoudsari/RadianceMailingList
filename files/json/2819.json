There it is only one defined sky (midday, equinox, clear sky) and a minimum average illuminance in the room behind the facade (+ turnable but not moveable lamellas) is required.\nThe lamellas I've to simulate are not the perforated mini blinds, but get  a dimensions of 0.5 meter width and a length of about 3 meters.\nThe surface is brushes aluminum (adapted for redirect the daylight into the room).\nWith this starting position, I need a material definition which reflect the daylight (direct and diffuse)  at  85% of lamella area and, on account of the 15% of gaps in the lamellas, a light transmission of 15%.\nDoes anybody have an idea?\n\nThanks\nFriedemann\n\n\n-----Urspr?ngliche Nachricht-----\nVon: radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] Im Auftrag von Mark de la Fuente\nGesendet: Dienstag, 31.

These are like perforated metal mini blinds right?\n\nMark\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061103/ca6aa2ce/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Friedemann Kik", "datetime": "Fri Nov  3 09:41:57 2006"}
