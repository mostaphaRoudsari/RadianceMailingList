{"body": "\nDear all\n\nI am going to do a research in Stuttgart university about the effect of daylight in visual comfort at schools,\n\nFor that I need a reliable glare prediction index, would you please tell me which one of the existing glare indices which are used in Radiance is better for that reason.\n\nAs I know Jan Wienold and his colleges are providing a new glare index which is \"daylight glare probability dgp\".\n\nConsidering that it has been provided for office spaces, and the difference between office visual tasks and classroom visual task (I mean the blackboard), is it possible to use it for evaluating glare in classrooms as well?\n\nThanks alot\n\nNiloofar\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20050916/c82a58d3/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Niloofar Moghbel", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001101c5bac5$66b55290$8ef24581@bauphysik7pc>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Sep 17 02:43:43 2005", "email": "niloofar.moghbel at lbp.uni-stuttgart.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glare index"}
