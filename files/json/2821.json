There it is only one defined sky (midday, equinox, clear\nsky) and a minimum average illuminance in the room behind the facade (+\nturnable but not moveable lamellas) is required.\nThe lamellas I've to simulate are not the perforated mini blinds, but\nget  a dimensions of 0.5 meter width and a length of about 3 meters.\nThe surface is brushes aluminum (adapted for redirect the daylight into\nthe room).\nWith this starting position, I need a material definition which reflect\nthe daylight (direct and diffuse)  at  85% of lamella area and, on\naccount of the 15% of gaps in the lamellas, a light transmission of\n15%.\nDoes anybody have an idea?\n\nThanks\nFriedemann\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061103/d210a212/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: perforated lamellas", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Fri Nov  3 15:29:40 2006"}
