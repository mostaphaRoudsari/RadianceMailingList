I don't really blame Wiki for this -- the\nproblem was more lack of groundswell and necessary controls, which\nI'm sure we could remedy if we were a little more organized.\n\nI am not versed on the merits of or differences between Plone and\nWiki, and I know very little about either.  Both Peter Apian-\nBennewitz and Daniel Fuller (the sysadmin for LBL's website) say\nPlone is better, but you would have to ask them for details.  I'm\nwilling to trust others' judgement on the matter, as I have no\nexpertise in the area of web management.  I can make some simple\nHTML, and that's about it.\n\nThe important thing is that we agree to contribute material, and the\nsite administrator should be happy and/or paid for their efforts,\nwhich I suspect would be substantial using either system.  In other\nwords, setting up a Wiki site may be easy, but protecting it from\nadware while developing useful content may in fact be easier with\nPlone.  I leave the debate to others.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance documentation organizati", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
