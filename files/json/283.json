Which would be most easily done using one of\nfork&exec/system/popen on Posix (e.g. Linux/UNIX) systems, Windows may\nhave similar means of communicating with external programs. But you\nsaid, you can't do 'system' calls. Does that mean you can't read from an\nexternally started program ?\n\n\nWhat do you mean by \"API altered from rpict\" ? Using the rendering\nroutines from rtrace/rpict would be feasible, but it doesn't explain why\nyou have trouble with rtrace output.\n\nand then our real problem is to specify a region (or even a single\npixel)\n??\n\n?? It fails if and how ?\n\n??\n\nI'm still not quite sure I understand what you problem is-\n\n-Peter\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Fri, 11 Oct 2002 01:19:55 +0200"}
