I have modeled a water surface\nin the past, but I am not sure how to model light traveling through\nwater. I vaguely recall hearing that to do so one must model the water\nvolume as a dielectric. Could anybody explain to me how this is done? An\nexample file would be very much appreciated.\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart, Ph.D.\nAssociate Research Officer                      National Research\nCouncil Canada          Institute for Research in Construction\nAdjunct Professor                                     McGill University\nSchool of Architecture\n1200 Montreal Road M-24, Ottawa          Ontario K1A 0R6, Canada\ntel: (613) 993-9703                                  fax: (613) 954 3733\nchristoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\n<blocked::mailto:christoph.reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>\n\nLightswitch Wizard (initial design)            www.buildwiz.com\n<blocked::http://www.buildwiz.com/>\nDAYSIM (expert software)                        www.daysim.com\n<blocked::http://www.daysim.com/>\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061106/62a531be/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "datetime": "Mon Nov  6 20:25:16 2006"}
