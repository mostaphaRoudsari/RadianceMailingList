Its behavior is determined\nby the index of refraction and transmission coefficient in each wav\nelength band per unit length.\nCommon glass has a index of refraction (n) around 1.5, and a\ntransmission coefficient of roughly 0.92 over\nan inch. An additional number, the Hartmann constant, describes how the\nindex of refraction changes as a\nfunction of wav elength. It is usually zero. (A pattern modifies only\nthe refracted value.)\"\n\ndielectric is needed to simulate water refraction\n\nThe problem with dielectric in Radiance is that direct light doesn't\nknow how to return to light sources when it cross dielectric, when you\nare seeing a point under the water radiance tries to illuminate it with\ndirect light connecting it with direct lights with a stright line but\nwhen it traces the ray to the direct light the ray deviates with\ndielectric and it probably doesnt arrive to the light source(depending\non its size and angle of incidence with dielectric).\nProbably you will get better results using photton mapping of roland\nwith dielectric surface,\n\nexample a 1.3 refractive index water\n\nvoid dielectric water\n0\n0\n5 .8 .8 .8 1.3 0\n\nwater polygon planoagua\n0\n0\n12\n0 0 .5\n3 0 .5\n3 3 .5\n0 3 .5\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] under water light fixtures", "tags": [], "sender": "Ignacio Munarriz", "datetime": "Tue Nov  7 10:12:07 2006"}
