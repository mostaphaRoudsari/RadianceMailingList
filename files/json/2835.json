{"body": "\nHi\n\nI'm currently working on how to use measured BRDF data, e.g. represented\nusing a wavelet parameterization, with Radiance. I'm struggling at bit\nwith this, as documentation on using Radiance with measured BRDF data\nseems not to exist? Can someone give me directions, links to previous\nwork on this, documentation or advice on this?\n\nThanks,\nJeppe Vesterbaek\nUnivesity College London\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jeppe Vesterbaek", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43440B8F.6020206@cs.ucl.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Oct  5 19:22:26 2005", "email": "j.vesterbaek at cs.ucl.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Using BRDF measurement representations withRadiance"}
