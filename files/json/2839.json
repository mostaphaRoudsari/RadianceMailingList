In retrospect, it would have been smart to\nadd an option to get back the old color scale, and I can work on\nadding one.  In the meantime, you can alias your falsecolor to:\n\nfalsecolor -r '1.6*v-.6' -g 'if(v-.375,1.6-1.6*v,8/3*v)' -b '1-8/3*v'\n\nto get back the old scale.  Easier might be to uncomment lines 14-16\nin your falsecolor script and comment (or remove) lines 17-19.\n\nIf anyone has references to a preferred scale that runs through at\nleast 8 named colors on a natural-appearing scale, I'd love to hear\nabout it.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3.8 Falsecolor Sca", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
