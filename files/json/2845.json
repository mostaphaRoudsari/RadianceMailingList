THanks Greg for adding the \"-spec\" option.\n\n\n\nHmmm, what do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with these\nnumbers?  I use pextrem all the time in conjunction with falsecolor.\nIf you simply run 'pextrem -o' on a radiance image and multiply the\ngreen channel of the high pixel by 179, you have your maximum value\nfor the -s option.\n\n\n\nyeah, and this is probably easy for anyone who doesn't suck at\nprogramming, as I do.  I just spent longer than I care to share\ntrying to add such an option to falsecolor.  It should be easy, but I\ncouldn't sort out what values to use for certain variables.  Greg has\nalready done a lot of the work, since the -e option already has code\nto run pextrem to find the max (and min) values and assign them to\nvariables within the script (falsecolor is actually just a shell\nscript).  But I don't know how the scale option gets applied to the\nlegend.  (Greg, I can share with you what I have so far, if you wanna\ntake it the rest of the way. )\n\n- Rob\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3.8 Falsecolor Sca", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sun Nov 12 06:23:17 2006"}
