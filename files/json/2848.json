{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nPutting illum surfaces inside of your windows rather than using a\nseparate surface for each window pane is one way to reduce\ncalculation times if your mullions are not particularly large or\nprominent.\n\nAll else being equal, you can reduce -ab by 1 and decrease -ad and -\nas (by a factor of 2 or so) and even increase -aa by 50% and still\nget similar results.  However, you may also have to set -dj .8 and -\nps 1, which will undermine the calculation speeds a bit.  Overall,\nillum's pay off most when you have smaller windows or skylights and/\nor complex goings on outside.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5CCE4547-C5A0-4393-BF21-7A4A4864F837@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<1033d54fb5c3c435824698279a74d7c1@gmx.net>", "<f8f01cff620221b261a4f8bbb2b90710@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Sun Oct  9 18:47:02 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?"}
