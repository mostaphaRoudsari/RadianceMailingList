We have\nbeen trying to keep with the alternation between Europe and North\nAmerica, to stay within limited travel budgets for everyone at least\nevery other year.  Since last year we were in Leicester, and Quebec\nCity didn't work out for 2007 (maybe 2009), I started asking around\nfor alternatives.  In 2008, I'm hoping we'll be back in Fribourg,\nSwitzerland, if Raphael's offer is still good.\n\nThe next question is about the dates.  We were thinking sometime in\nSeptember or early October would be best, but I need some information\nfrom people as to what week would be best.  We want to avoid any\nconflicts with school years and other conferences, and take advantage\nof colocation opportunities if there are any.  So, please help us out\nwith anything you know about.\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Nov 16 20:21:33 2006"}
