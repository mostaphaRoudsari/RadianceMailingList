{"body": "\n\nHi Schorsch,\n\nthank you for the hint, for someone not that familiar in Autocadland\nthis is really hard... especially as I am currently working in formZ\nand have to get the geometry (dxf) from there.\n\nI did it a bit different now. I read again the obj2rad manpage, and\nfound out that the obj geometry is triangulated ONLY if not planar OR\nif there is surface normal information included in the file. So I\nswitched off the normals - et voil?, I got the polygons!\n\nI have just started the next run of mkillum now, which is much more\npromising, cause there is really nothing worse to feed to mkillum than\ntriangulated faces. I hope the normals will still be right, as the\nfaces were editet correctly, but you never know what cad / modelling\nsoftware is doing to your scene...\n\nSo thank You, and sorry for some of my questions which were a bit\nmisleading cause the problem was completely different than I had\nguessed, but I am just getting crazy with that mkillum step in my scene\nat the moment ;-)\n\nCU, greetings to Munich, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?", "sender": "Lars O.
