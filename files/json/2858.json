{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\nThanks for your feedback and support, but I've done really very little,\nand think we all need to thank both Greg for keeping adding new features\nto Radiance, Georg for having set up Scons and fixed all the windows\ncompatibility issues, and both of them for still maintaining the\nprecious Radiance code without compromising stability and reliability\nof results.\n\nMh, as a Linux addict, I still feel a bit guilty for making more\naccessible Radiance to the \"lazy\" windows users, especially after\nGreg's \"wrap-up & outlook\" presentation at the Radiance Workshop in Montreal ;)\nI'm so sorry I've missed it ...\n\nFrancesco\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org per conto di Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research\nInviato: gio 10/13/2005 11:19\nA: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nOggetto: [Radiance-general] wintel binaries\n\nFrancesco,\n\nAfter having had a couple of test runs on your wintel binaries, I have\nto admit that I'm duly impressed, you wouldn't believe what a relief\nthis is after having run the radiance wintel binaries that came along\nwith dtp-rad for quite a while... thanks so much for these excellent\nbinaries!\n\n-jelle\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 3358 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051014/74335a67/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<2C0020B9EB71CE4281B292F0E16A6DDE09A71A@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 14 01:41:55 2005", "email": "francesco.anselmo at arup.com", "subject": "R: [Radiance-general] wintel binaries"}
