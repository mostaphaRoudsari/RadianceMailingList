Certainly having windows binaries of the\nlatest code is a big help for people who can't or won't deal with\nlinux.  As for me, I *like* linux (but *love* OSX) =8-), and so here I'm\nhappy to report that just today I got one of our scripts going on both\nwindows and linux (gotta love Python, which takes care of 95% of that\nproblem all by itself).  The availability of new windows binaries for\n3.7 will just make this setup even more uniform, and I'll have to have a\nlook at those.  (Hey Schorsch, could these binaries be \"dropped in\" to\nan existing Rayfront installation?)\n\nAnd yeah, we missed you in Montreal too!  (and Schorsch, and Jack, and\nPillo, and PaB, and John M, and everyone else who make this list so useful!)\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: R: [Radiance-general] wintel binaries", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<434EF4BB.3040002@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<2C0020B9EB71CE4281B292F0E16A6DDE09A71A@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Oct 14 02:00:04 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "R: [Radiance-general] wintel binaries"}
