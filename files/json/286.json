That normalizes the *orientation* of image\nmaps in space, so that they are always mapped flat onto the\nrespective surface. Of course you still need to make sure\nthat they appear at the right location in space (unless it's\na global mapping).\n\nIn general, the best approach for location specific mappings\n(pictures hanging at the wall) is to create a seperate file\nwith the picture sufrace, and possibly the frame etc. Peters\ngenpic program does a nice job there for most situations.\nThen transform that file to the right location, geometry,\nmapping, and all.\n\nRayfront includes genpic binaries, and the \"parts\" mechanism\nprovides an easy way to place external objects in the scene.\nAnd no, this is not all cheap advertizing, Martin maintains an\neducational Rayfront license at PSU (whether he actually\nuses it is another question, of course... ;)\n\n\n\nYes. That may eventually change once I have understood how\ngensurfs smoothing actually works (doesn't seem to bee too\ncomplicated, just that I didn't have the nerve to dig into\nthe topic yet).\n\nIt seems that Ole Lemmings ConRAD preserves smooting when\nconverting from 3D-Max files.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance workshop, etc.", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Wed, 16 Oct 2002 09:02:44 -0400 (EDT)"}
