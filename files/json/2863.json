I am responding purely so that other newbies can find the answers\nmore quickly next time.\n\nTo test the sky output I produced just one sky description with +s and -B &\n-R defined. Created octree with a simple horizontal surface (not sure this\nwas necessary) and sky. Then:\n\nRview -i -vf viewfile.vf test.oct\n\ncommand.\n\nThen restart rview with same parameters but include -ab 1 to include the\ndiffuse component from the skydome. Easy. Trace again, and check the values\nagainst my assumptions.\n\nIn short, specifying -R & -B explicitly define. Had just managed to confuse\nmyself by thinking too hard!\n\nMany thanks\n\nNick\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 5\n<radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nMessage-ID:\n<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB501E7E6E3@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nNick,\n\n-R -B are supposed to specify direct and diffuse contribute.\na quick and easy check is to create a -s (diffuse only) and a +s\n(global) sky with the same -R -B and check illuminances at a point (0 0\n0, 0 0 1)\nNow try without the sky dome and +s (direct only) and see...\nyou should get diffuse and global and direct values.\nPlease try it.\n\n\nAbout the source primitive, you need it all the time.\nCoefficients can be just (1 1 1) for the sky\nand a reduction like (0.1 0.1 0.1) or (0.2 0.2 0.2) for the ground\ndepending to the model you are working on.\nIf you use your coefficients you will be working with colour but you\nneed to check that the photopic average is correct.\n\n\nHope this is +s,\ni.e. 'clear'\n:-)\n\nCiao\nG>\n\n\n\n\n**********************************************\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Testing -B -R in gensk", "tags": [], "sender": "Giulio.Antonutto@arup.com", "datetime": "Wed, 22 Nov 2006 10:24:34 -0000"}
