{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI am currently changing my Makefile that is doing some rendering. So\nfar, the views had been in the Makefile itself, each as one target. Now\nI wanted to change this and use a viewfile together with the -P option\nof rpict for multi-processing.\n\nI am wondering now how to understand the manual. I used a line like\nthat:\n\nrpict -S 1 -P pics.pfile -o pic%02d.pic scene.oct < scene.vf &\n\nBecause I thought that the rpict process must go to the background, so\nthat I can start the other processes with\n\nrpict -P pics.pfile &\n\nHowever, I did not get any output. So was the & after the first rpict\nthe problem? Will it read the scene and send itself to the background,\nwaiting for more processes? Or do I simply have to wait before starting\nthe second rpict, until the first one has read the entire scene?\n\nTIA + CU, this multi-processor radiance stuff is really not easy...\nLars.\n\nfrom my Makeile:\n\npics: scene.oct scene.vf\nrpict -S 1 -P pics.pfile -o pic%02d.pic scene.oct < scene.vf & \\\nrpict -P pics.pfile & \\\nrpict -P pics.pfile &\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
