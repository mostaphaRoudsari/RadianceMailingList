If I know a little about the composition of the mist\n(e.g. droplet size and density), is there a way to derive the extinction\ncoefficient (-me), scattering albedo (-ma) and eccentricity parameter\n(-mg)?\n\nAlso, the beginning of chapter 14 of Rendering With Radiance suggests\nthat the single scatter approximation used is only appropriate for thin\nmists - is there a guideline for how thin \"thin\" should be?  I want to\ntry several different thicknesses including some cases where visibility\nmight be less than one metre...\n\nThanks,\n\nAndy Stone\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061206/52da82e3/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy Stone", "datetime": "Wed Dec  6 14:24:11 2006"}
