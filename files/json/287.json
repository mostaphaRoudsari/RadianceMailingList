These octrees are than used as instances to build a part of a\nbuilding, which is than transformed into a frozen octree. So  I want to get\nfrozen octrees for all major parts of my scene which should be useable on\ntheir own, without dependencies on other files.\n\nMy makefile than runs rpict on the octree, and I get a nice image.... but I\ndon't see any image mappings.... I also don't get any error or warnings (I\nwas used to get \"image xxx uses yyy kB\" when I used image map patterns so\nfar).\n\nAre the image maps included in a frozen octree? Do I need any special switch\nin rpict to make colorpicts visible (I use just vp vd at the moment)? Is\nthere anything special when using alias-modifiers in instances (i get my\ngeometry from dxf2rad, so for each object, I define a file object.mat which\ncontains just the aliases refering to material definitions in a global file\nproject.mat).\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
