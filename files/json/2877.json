You didn't really need an illum\ngoing into mkillum, though you could have used one.  It would only\nspeed up the mkillum calculation slightly, while actually making the\nsubsequent rendering take longer, since rays would always be sent to\nan illum source which is forever obscured.\n\nIf you had a side-light window not computed with mkillum, then an\nillum would be appropriate there.  However, you would have to follow\nmore closely the template offered in the Scene 0 Tutorial.  (See\n\"Rendering with Radiance\" p. 32.)  The scene description you sent was\nmissing the appropriate \"illum\" statement for the top window.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Understanding illum  correctly?", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
