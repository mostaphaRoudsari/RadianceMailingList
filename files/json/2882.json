This is especially important if the -ad parameter is low, i.e., <=512. A high -aa parameter, such as 5000 or whatever, creates a dense grid of indirect/reflected values. You can check that by making two images, one with a low setting of ad and aa, and one with a low setting of ad and a high setting of aa. That will show you immediately what the ambient accuracy parameter is about. The image contains less blotches.\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tue 12/26/2006 2:30 AM\nTo: Radiance general\nHi,\n\nI've been reading some previous posts related to ambient parameters\nsettings and I have some questions.\n\nWhen it is recommendable to use -aa 0 value? If I understand this\nparameter well, 0 value turns off irradiance caching, so we can use it\nwhen caching isn't needed (mkillum calculation for venetian blinds or\nrtcontrib).\nWhen we set -aa 0, does -ar have influence on minimum sampling distance,\nsince: min sampling distance = max scene dimension* aa/ar.\n\nWhen I run a rtrace calculation with -aa 0, calculation time is much\nshorter than with -aa 0.1. Why?\n\n\nHave a nice holidays :)\nMarija.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 3446 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061226/cc686d12/attachment.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Marija Cvetkovi", "datetime": "Tue Dec 26 22:44:12 2006"}
