{"body": "\nHi,\nI am trying to use actual data for glazing materials, and I've found that\nOptics5 has a good database. Since it has exporter to Radiance, single or\nmulti layer glazings can be easily converted to Radiance format.\nResulting file has a form like:\n\nvoid  glass       GlzSys_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.807     0.875     0.849\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    GlzSys_front\n10\n0.134     0.147     0.147\n0.740     0.803     0.779\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    GlzSys_back\n10\n0.134     0.147     0.147\n0.740     0.803     0.779\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nMy question is how should I use these data in Radiance scene description.\nI suppose that idea is to define window glass with 3 layers:\nGlzSys_front  GlzSys_glass  GlzSys_back\n\nAm I right?\n\nOne more question: does anyone know how this BRTD parameters are calculated\nfrom Optic5 data?\n\nThanks,\nmarija\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Cvetkovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<00b601c5d641$a47fe2b0$0100a8c0@mallah>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 21 15:17:49 2005", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Import from Optics5"}
