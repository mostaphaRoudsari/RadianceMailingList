Two -I options would turn it off again.\n\n\nWIth -i the origin will match the input, as the rays are traced from\nthere.  With -I, the origin will not match the input, as I said.\n\n\nAgain, -i and -I do not toggle each other.  With -I+ set (either\nusing -I alone or -I+), the -i setting become irrelevant.  Think of -\nI as superseding the -i setting.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -oo adds direction to origin", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A276A4A8-2D82-4C0C-A944-FCF5C826879C@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<10223.213.58.97.64.1130164020.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>", "<2AE0F1DD-8D4E-4915-B809-7E80ECEE650B@gmail.com>", "<10109.213.58.97.64.1130170728.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Oct 24 19:13:10 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtrace -oo adds direction to origin"}
