The -aa 0 setting is\nappropriate when you have a lot of small geometry that isn't safe to\nleave out of the ambient calculation (using the -ae or -aE options),\nor for special applications such as mkillum or rtcontrib.  Turning\noff the ambient cache is NOT a good idea when what you care about is\nindividual ray accuracy, such as when you are using rtrace to\nevaluate radiance or irradiance values in a space.  It can be done\nwith -aa 0, but you have to pay close attention to your other\nparameter settings (such as -ad, -as, -lw, and -lr) and alter them\nappropriately.  The -ar setting has no effect with -aa 0.  Ditto for -\naw.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient accuracy parameter", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
