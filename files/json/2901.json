{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\nThe -oo option and -od option report the origin and normalized ray\ndirection (respectively), but only with -I-.  When you set -I+, then\nrtrace fudges the calculation by creating a ray 1 unit above an\nimaginary Lambertian surface, and this is why the origin (and\ndirection if you check) do not match your input.  Instead, the\nintersection point (-op) and surface normal (-on or -oN) will match\nthe origin and direction given.\n\nThis is not a new bug in 3.7, but something that's been there since I\nenabled reports of parameters besides ray value with -I+ in the 2.3\nrelease.  Perhaps you weren't using the -I+ setting in your previous\nscripts.\n\nI think I could fix this behavior if it's really screwing you up.  I\nagree that it's confusing to have the -oo and -od options change\ntheir apparent reporting depending on the -I setting, but they are\nreporting the values on the ray actually traced.  You don't start out\nat the surface and direct the ray straight up in order to compute\nirradiance.  That wouldn't work.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -oo adds direction to origin", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2AE0F1DD-8D4E-4915-B809-7E80ECEE650B@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<10223.213.58.97.64.1130164020.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Oct 24 17:52:16 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtrace -oo adds direction to origin"}
