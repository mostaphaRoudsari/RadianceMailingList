I have a floor build of tiles. A tile here is an\ninstance, refering to an octree which is made from a rad-file describing the\ngeometry at 0;0;0 with a colorpict modifier (which also defaults to 0;0;0). I\nuse these instances with replmarks, so I should get the tiles with their\npattern transformed to the points defined by the markers? Or will replmarks\ntransform only the geometry to the triangle marker's position, not it's\ncolorpict modifier?\n\nIn fact, I simply wonder why I don't get any patterns if I render my scene\n(and no error messages).\n\nCU, Lars.\n\nHere is my material-definition (as you see, the geometry is from dxf2rad ;-):\n\nvoid colorpict porphyr_pattern\n9 clip clip clip 13_36a_map_porphyr.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 3\n0\n1 2\n\nporphyr_pattern plastic porphyr\n0\n0\n5 .11 .11 .08 .05 0\n\nvoid alias l_floor_green_stripes porphyr\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] colorpict modifiers in instances and frozen octrees?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
