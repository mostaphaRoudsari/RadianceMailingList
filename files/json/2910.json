I am particularly interested in generating some of the new CIE general sky distributions (there are 15; cf Darula and Kittler \"CIE general sky standard defining luminance distributions\").\n\nI found that the \"gensky\" program can generate a Radiance description of the sky, but gensky appear to be limited to the three classic CIE standards (clear day, overcast, intermediate).  Is there another program that could be used to generate these new standards?\n\nThank you!\n\nJuan\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Juan Posada", "datetime": "Mon Jan 29 17:44:05 2007"}
