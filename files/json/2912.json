Perhaps if the\nsystem was a translucent glazing system with some kind of additional\ncoating the specular component might be higher.\n\nRegarding your comment on absorption. It is actually important to base\nyour material on reasonable estimates for the initial parameters as\ndescribed in RwR, as these have impact on the values used for the\narguments to the material. As you see in the formula's in the book the\nparameters all interact with each other.\n\n-Jack\n\n\nFriedemann Kik wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070201/c46a380c/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: AW: [Radiance-general] trans materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Feb  1 15:10:24 2007"}
