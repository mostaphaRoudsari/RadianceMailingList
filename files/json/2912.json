{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nI have come across an issue regarding converting colors from CIE xyY color\nspace to Radiance's rgb. From the post:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002783.html\n\nand from RWR, the conversion is as follows:\n\nX=x*Y/y;\nZ=(1-x-y)*Y/y;\nr=  2.565*X -1.167*Y -0.398*Z;\ng= -1.022*X +1.978*Y +0.044*Z;\nb=  0.075*X -0.252*Y +1.177*Z;\n\nHowever, when I attempt a conversion the color seems way off. For example,\nthe color x =  0.3304 , y = 0.3582 , Y = 0.9822 which I expect to be a faint\nyellow converts to rgb = 0.838, 1.05, 0.825, which is more of a faint green.\nI have used another script found in the following paper:\n\nhttp://aesl.hanyang.ac.kr/resource/radiance/rstds.pdf\n\nThe rgb.cal script in this paper list the following for xyY to rgb\nconversion:\n\nX=x*Y/y;\nZ=(1-x-y)*Y/y;\nr= 2.739*X -1.145*Y -0.424*Z;\ng= -1.119*X +2.029*Y +0.033*Z;\nb= 0.138*X -0.333*Y +1.105*Z;\n\n\nAlthough not always spot on, its much closer to the aforementioned (the\nprevious example converts to rgb = 0.995,1.01,0.74 which is a faint yellow\nwith a slight green tint). Thanks for any help and/or advice. As a note I\nshould mention that I use the following online calculator to convert from\n0-255 rgb color space to CIE xyY color space:\n\nhttp://www.easyrgb.com/calculator.php\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] CIE xyY to Radiance rgb Conversion", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F32D589C9A99E79AD0A0A25A4710@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Oct 18 21:06:54 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] CIE xyY to Radiance rgb Conversion"}
