I wouldn't have thought through\nto your purpose to suggest mksource.\n\nEven so, I'd hate to leave your other questions unanswered, so here\ngoes...\n\n\nXimage doesn't load the original HDR pixels into memory, instead\nrelying on the file's presence to query specific values.  If you\ndon't give it the file, it disables its query function.\n\n\nYou should EITHER use the -o option (once for each input file), OR\nuse le(n) to adjust the exposure, not both.  If the -o option is\napplied to an input image, values you get will already have been\ndivided by the associated expousre.\n\n\nGiven what I just said, you would either use:\n\n$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)/le(1)+li(2)/le(2)' 004.hdr 006.hdr > test.pic\n\nor:\n\n$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)+li(2))' -o 004.hdr -o 006.hdr > test.pic\n\nIf you felt like it, you could get the same result from:\n\n$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)+li(2)/le(2)' -o 004.hdr 006.hdr > test.pic\n\nbut that would be a little twisted...\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pcomb photometrically correct", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
