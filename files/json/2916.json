Or would in\na networked-X scenario the application still pull the pixel luminance over\nthe network, if called with a file name?\n\nIn other words: There are two distinct parts to ximage: the display part,\nand the query part, and the two don't know anything about one another?\n\nI've experimented with the -o options ('T'-key), and the results are the\nsame: zero when input to ximage comes through a pipe, expected value when\nread from file:\n$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)' -o 004.hdr | ximage -ov\n\n\nSo some of the ximage features can not be used when input is STDIN? Is\nthere a particular reason for implementing it this way?\n\n\nAha! This makes it crystal-clear now.
