After all, It\njust generates the appropriate xform commands or instance primitives\nin the output.\n\nDid you verify that a single tile shows the pattern when viewed\neg. with objview? Just to eliminate simple mistakes like mapping\nto the wrong side of it etc...\n\nAs another remark: For very simple objects like this, instances\ncreate more overhead than they are worth. Consider using the -x\nargument with the scene file instead of -i with the octree.\nOh, and I hope you're not using the -m parameter to replmarks...\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<200210171402.g9HE2Pk23811@darkside-animation.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Thu, 17 Oct 2002 10:19:39 -0400 (EDT)"}
