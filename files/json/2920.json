{"body": "\nHi Greg!\n\n\nWell, the reason why I wanted to use -P is that I need some way to make\nthe processes render just the missing frames. So they need to be\nsynced. If I use just several rpict's without -PP, I will have to split\nmy view files, and that means that I have to regroup the views in the\nview files each time that the cluster configuration changes.\n\nThe problem with using rpict with -PP is that rpict will share memory,\nand than openmosix will not allow the processes to migrata any more. So\nif the -PP option is the only way to make multiple rpict processes\nsync, I will have to go back and use a target for each view in my\nMakefile. Than I can use make -j # with # being the number of machines,\nthe most generic way to distribute the processes. I am not too happy\nwith that because I will have the problem with the viewfiles sooner or\nlater when starting animations - I cannot have one target per frame, so\nI will have to find a way to render ONE viewfile's views in parallel\nwithout that \"shared memory\".\n\nIn fact I am seriously considering using ranimate for my stills now, as\nthis allows me to distribute processes from ONE viewfile. I could\nsimply add HOST-lines pointing to localhost, which is a bit silly, but\nshould work fine.\n\nThank you for all the help, and have a nice week-end, we have a nice\nsunny autumn day here and it is a pity to stay in the lab ;-)\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] starting rpict -S 1 -P pfile", "sender": "Lars O.
