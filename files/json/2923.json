{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nIt may just be that you need to use the -PP option rather than -P,\nwhich doesn't do parallel processing.  (The -P \"persist mode\" is a\nrelatively little-used option that permits serial execution without\nthe associated startup costs -- it's more valuable for rtrace than\nrpict.)\n\nAlso, each of your rpict -PP commands should be handed the same set\nof views on the standard input.  Otherwise, nothing will happen.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] starting rpict -S 1 -P pfile", "sender": "Gregory J.
