{"body": "\nHi,\n\nthank you for the reply. I will try to use more than one host-line per\nmachine, I guess that ranimate won't catch that and will start one\nprocess per host-line, without giving -PP to rpiece. So the processes\nwill be started via ssh on the localhost. Hope this works... I am\ndesperatly needing a way to speed up rendering times at the moment...\n;-)\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimat HOST setting", "sender": "Lars O.
