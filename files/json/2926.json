But what about the light\nsources generated by mkillum?\n\nThan, my scene has one more strange feature. More or less all the outer\nwalls are instances. So putting a big occluder around the closed parts\nof the building would speed-up because I do not have to test for light\nsources behind the wall. But the only outer light source there is the\nsky distribution + sun. The sky distribution is an indirect source in\nRadiance afaik, so will I win anything?\n\nThanks, hope someone can bring some light into my occluded understanding\nof the cache,\n\nLars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
