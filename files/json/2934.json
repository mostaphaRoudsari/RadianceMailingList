{"body": "\nIf you are using AutoCAD, then you might try Georg Mischler's radout.  It's much better than torad.  Never used dxf2rad, but I always make sure and use 3d faces to draw illum sources (and most others for that matter).  That way you can shade and/or turn the back face off within cad and check to make sure the faces are drawn in the right orientation.  What I have not been able to figure out (and perhaps someone knows) is how to check to make sure all 3D face points are coplanar. I've run into problems before where objects are not coplanar, but with hundreds of planes, who knows which one is drawn incorrectly!  The only quick fix to that is to triangulate.....\n\nMark\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed\n\nHi,\n\nok, I found the problem, not the solution. I have a cad model for the\nfaces, and they are all polygons. Now, if I use obj and obj2rad, they\nare all triangulated. And if I use dxf and dxf2rad, only 3- or 4-sided\npolygons are possible. One way would be to use polylines (closed) with\ndxf2rad, but somehow, this gives me just an empty rad file. At the\nmoment I have really no idea how to get my illum surfaces (=polygons)\nfrom cad to radiance...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051011/e36f6201/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "grobe@gmx.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<a76b2ad46387a31d098b4de54f08c0b4@gmx.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Oct 2005 17:57:44 +0200", "email": "\"Lars O.
