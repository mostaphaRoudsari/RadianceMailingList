{"body": "\nHi,\n\nok, I found the problem, not the solution. I have a cad model for the\nfaces, and they are all polygons. Now, if I use obj and obj2rad, they\nare all triangulated. And if I use dxf and dxf2rad, only 3- or 4-sided\npolygons are possible. One way would be to use polylines (closed) with\ndxf2rad, but somehow, this gives me just an empty rad file. At the\nmoment I have really no idea how to get my illum surfaces (=polygons)\nfrom cad to radiance...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?", "sender": "Lars O.
