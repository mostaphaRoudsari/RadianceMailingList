I got the\nsame error that you did. In order to fix this (without messing with the\nscript), I made sure that all decimal units are expressed in the form\n\"x.x\" as opposed to \".x\", thus I added 0 to the front of decimals units\n\".x\". Now it seems to work.\n\n-Jack\n\nsiritip@umich.edu wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glaze.csh header and input format", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Feb 15 15:13:47 2007"}
