{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nthanks for your reply.  In fact, I am using surfaces not for each pane,\nbut for each opening now, so that is why I have \"only\" these 400 faces\n;-) I tried reducing -ab, -ad and -as, but rendering times are *really*\nslow now. I have all these zero-radiance illums (sealings), do they\nhave an effect on the rendering speed, even when zero?\n\nYou know the scene, it is this church scene I showed you, so it has a\nlot of these small windows, and as the fenestration is rather complex,\nI hoped that using illum \"coffers\" around the windows would improve\nrendering speed as well as accuracy. However, so far the speed is\nreally disastrous. Outside the building, there is not much detail. I\neven tried to apply skyfunc to the window panes, but as I have to apply\nit to *every* small pane than (because I can't use the coffer trick to\nintegrate the whole window than), I get so many hundreds of light\nsources that calculation is almost impossible.\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum with 400 sources?", "sender": "Lars O.
