{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI am using mkillum on a scene with a lot of faces converted to illums\n(about 400). This is rather fine-grained and results in longe times\nspent on mkillum. Now I wonder if I should tweak the rtrace-settings a\nbit to get quicker and still not too bad results, so far I use\ndefaults. Background: the sources represent glass panes in windows, so\neach window is allready divided into multiple faces. This is one of the\ncauses for the many illums that are calculated.\n\nWhat are the settings you use with mkillum, in a daylight-scene, with\nrather small openings (because of the divided windows)?\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\nP.S.: I have been waiting 2 hours for 40 illums, so I am a bit worried\nabout this now ;-)\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
