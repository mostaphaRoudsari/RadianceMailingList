{"body": "\nHi Greg\n\nThanks for the quick reply. I'll have a look at \"He.cal\" tomorrow (been\nstaring too long at this monitor by now :p).\n\nWith respect to Radiance's handling of BRDF materials: is there no way\n(around) to change how Radiance calculates the indirect component? I'll\nbe using Radiance for rendering (relighted) real scenes (in\ncollaboration with Katrien Jacobs) and would like the rendering to be as\nrealistic as possible (no efficiency concerns atm.).\n\nThanks,\n/Jeppe\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<D74EA448-31EA-4972-B26E-D7468A4B880D@gmail.com>", "sender": "Jeppe Vesterbaek", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<43441773.3000505@cs.ucl.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<43440B8F.6020206@cs.ucl.ac.uk>", "<D74EA448-31EA-4972-B26E-D7468A4B880D@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct  5 20:13:12 2005", "email": "j.vesterbaek at cs.ucl.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Using BRDF measurement representations withRadiance"}
