{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\nThis is a good summary here with a lot of questions. I am not sure that\nI can answer all of the questions, I will try to address a few items though\n\nMarija Cvetkovic wrote:\n\nAs I read \"trans.cal\" this is for converting from transmittance to\ntransmissivity, the latter value is used for the radiance \"glass\"\nmaterial type. I believe that the \"glass\" material that is output from\nOptics accounts for this translation. I think that maybe Chas Erhlich\ncould confirm this?\n\nNote though, quoting Greg from the file, that trans.cal is for an\n\"infinite series solution for an uncoated pane of glass.\" This is a\nsolution for a single pane only. I am not sure that adjusting the index\nof refraction is a valid way to \"adjust\" the reflectance and it still\nwould result on the same reflectance on both sides of the material. Most\nglass systems that use coated glass have different reflectances on the\noutside and inside.\n\n\nThis is just a hack to combine the two separate BRTDfunc definitions\noutput from Optics into one definition. You correctly note the problem\nwith this hack.\n\nI think that another important issue with this is that it is really\naccounts for only one type of coating and I do not think that it\naccounts for multi-pane assemblies.\n\nActually, I think that at the time we were interested both in coated and\nfrit glass, multi-pane assemblies, so I would not say the main goal of\nthe script if frit glass only. However I am not sure what you mean by\nyour question: \"is it important what kind of glazing user defines?\" Yes,\nyou need to correctly assemble a glazing system in Optics, and export\neach individual layer (up to two panes). I think that one can obtain\n100% coverage reflectances/transmittance for frit glass if you talk with\nthe manufacturer. The other thing that is important is the orientation\nof the geometry that the material is applied to, the normal needs to\npoint into the space. Note also that while the material may represent a\nmultisurface piece of real world geometry, the representation in\nRadiance is a single surface piece of geometry.\n\nIf you are going to use this script I highly recommend that you export\nyour own data and use the -f option of the script so you can use a data\nfile that defines your own coated glass and frit glass (if needed) options.\n\nFor frit glazing systems, one problem with this script is that it cannot\naccount for systems where the frit and coating are on the same surface.\nAlso currently the scrip depends on the \"clear\" glass data hard wired\ninto the script.\n\n\nI think that the short answer is that glazing.cal does not account for\nall coated glazing and is only for a single pane glazing system.\nGlaze.csh is currently the only thing that creates some opportunity to\nuse data from something like Optics in a more functional way. Glaze.csh\nis not only for fritted glass.\n\n\nThe input file should look something like the following it has a header\nline followed by one line per glazing material type:\n\nSurface   Tr   Tg   Tb   Rcr   Rcg   Rcb   Rgr   Rgg   Rgb   Part\n<surface name>   <r trans>   <g trans>   <b trans>   <r coated refl>\n<g coated refl>   <b coated refl>   <r glass side refl>   <g glass side\nrefl>   <b glass side refl>   <boolean switch [0 or 1] to indicate if\nmaterial can have partial coverage, such as a frit>\n\nAs I recall this file is pretty sensitive to spacing of the values!\n\n\nYou should contract Greg to extend the script to account for more layers...!\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glazing modelling", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4368E8F2.3000601@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<004f01c5dfa3$144f93f0$0100a8c0@mallah>"], "datetime": "Wed Nov  2 17:30:39 2005", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glazing modelling"}
