{"body": "<4368E8F2.3000601@visarc.com>\n\nHi Jack,\nThank you for the fast answer.\nI just have few comments:\n\n\n\nYes, this conversion is taken into account when glazing is exported.\nI meant trans2.cal, not trans.cal. My idea was to use a trick I've found in\nsome Greg's mail:\nTo define glass with transmittance .85 and reflectance 0.5, run \"calc\ntrans2.cal\" in the ray/src/cal/cal directory and enter:\nTn = 0.85\nRn = 0.05\nTyping in \"n\" and \"tn\" will give you these results:\nn\n$1=1.39992615\ntn\n$2=0.894736842\n\n\nYou are right, so I suppose this 'simply glass' option is definitely not for\nuse.\n\nYes, I've already had that problem, and that is the reason why I've asked\nfor the format definition.\nThe other problem occurs when I put only one glazing definition into the\nfile. Glaze script doesn't report error, but new material isn't added to\nlist of available surfaces!? Do you have an idea why it is happening?\n\nThanks again,\nmarija\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Cvetkovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<00de01c5dfd7$8f892660$0100a8c0@mallah>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Nov  2 19:03:23 2005", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glazing modellingReferences: <004f01c5dfa3$144f93f0$0100a8c0@mallah>"}
