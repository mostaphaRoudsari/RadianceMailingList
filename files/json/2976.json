I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find\nfunction file \"rayinit.cal.\" I searched through the mailing list\narchives and found a few items on the placement of library files and\nsetting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I\nhave my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make\nsure\nthat rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables\nare\nexporting properly as I can see the paths when I \"echo $PATH\" and\n\"echo\n$RAYPATH,\" however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for\nsome\nreason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nDave\nMaino\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general\nmailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-\nonline.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "pillo.pillo@tin.it", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<11706541.1132262016959.JavaMail.root@pswm13.cp.tin.it>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Nov 17 22:14:56 2005", "email": "pillo.pillo at tin.it", "subject": "R: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problems"}
