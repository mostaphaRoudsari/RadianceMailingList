I don't think Desktop Radiance has a clean way to do this in the interface so you may have to add this to the created rif and rad files behind the scenes.  This is a more complex process and I would suggest reading the Radiance manual pages on rif and rad formats and on replmarks.\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\nZack Rogers, P.E., IESNA, LEED AP\nDaylighting Analysis Group Leader\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext. 435\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tuesday, March 20, 2007 8:45 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nAs I understand it, Mohamad is asking how to incorporate a model already in Radiance format into a Desktop Radiance scene.  There must be a back door or some trick, but I don't know anything about DR.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] monitor model upload in Desktop Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward@gmail.com", "datetime": "Tue Mar 20 16:31:25 2007"}
