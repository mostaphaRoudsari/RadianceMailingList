You are much appreciated.\n\nGreg described my problem exactly right. Mark, I started by drawing my own furniture, but I realized that they won't have accurate photometric data. If there is a possible way to model accurate model in cad (Desktop Radiance), I'm totally open to this option. I master the work in the cad system.\n\nZack, I couldn?t find the replmarks command in Desktop Radiance. I think it's only available in Radiance. Am I right. Also, I don't know if the DR has the Triangular marker option to use. I read all the information available in the Radiance manual pages, but nothing helped on this issue with the DR.\n\nBest regard.\n\nRespectfully,\nMohamad\n\n---- Original message ----\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nMohamad T.
