I think we should take a position on this\nlist and to strongly discourage anyone tempted to use dtp-rad. It's a corpse\nof the nice (na?ve? )intention to encapsulate the power of Radiance in a\nGUI, and choose (god forbid) acad as a place to do so...\n\nThere is a ton of tools that will allow you to work perfectly with Radiance\non win32, but dtp-rad is *NOT* one of them! If you need a positive\ndefinition of what those are, I'm happy to re-iterate those.\nThere are many competent converters out there, and many project that present\na good interface to Radiance (brad, conrad, schorsch.com)\n\nCan I suggest that perhaps it would be great to have pointers to these\nvaries projects on the official radiance site, or perhaps\nradianc-online.org? Radiance on *nix is pretty straightforward, and is a\ndifferent  audience from the win32 platform, where it is *far* more\ndifficult to set up a decent Radiance workflow, rather than the configure,\nmake, install routine. I think this knowledge needs to be condensed\nsomewhere soon.\n\nCheers,\n\n-jelle\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "datetime": "Tue Mar 20 19:23:41 2007"}
