(Now I am using VMPLAYER to run the Linux/radiance and sharing\nthe hardware/file systems via samba - works a treat) - Just export your\nCAD model using 3ds or dxf, copy it across to the Linux file system (via\nsamba), convert with 3ds2mgf + mgf2rad or the dxf2rad method. Then use\ntrad as a nice friendly gui to radiance.\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Terrance McMinn", "datetime": "Wed Mar 21 02:48:44 2007"}
