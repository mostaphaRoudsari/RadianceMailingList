{"body": "\nHi Nicholas,\n\nThere are many ways to run Radiance with multiple processors\nand multiple machines. Some programs like rad and rholo have\nsupport for multiple processors (-N option), rpiece can be used\nto split a picture into tiles and have them rendered by different\nprocessors or computers over a network (for instance sharing\nthe scene files with nfs).\n\nPersonally, I like to use openmosix with Radiance, and you can\nread about my experience in a previous message to this mailing list:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001992.html\n\n__\nFrancesco\npisuke@blueyonder.co.uk\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] multiple processors", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<200511220854.41379.pisuke@blueyonder.co.uk>", "refs": ["<7E0B66590000A543B7BFDDA5DF12FBD4083D9D@CJPSYD2.cjp.co.uk>"], "datetime": "Tue Nov 22 09:56:29 2005", "email": "pisuke at blueyonder.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] multiple processors"}
