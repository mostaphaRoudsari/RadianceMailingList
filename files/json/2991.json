You can use 'material1' directly in your scene, there\nis no need to define an alias.\n\nUsing a normalised picture allows you to change the material\nreflectance by changing the rgb-arguments in the plastic\nprimitive (here: 0.4) directly. You don't have to take into\naccount the average of the picture as well because the average\nof the normalised image is 1.\n\nYou don't have to use a digital image as source (normpat will\ntake care of that, too). Only if you want to use the image\nas illumination source you need a properly calibrated HDR image\nwhich can only be obtained with a digital camera.\n\nI have a few comments on image maps here:\n\nhttp://home.arcor.de/tbleicher/radiance/imagemaps.html\n\n\nHTH,\nThomas\n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
