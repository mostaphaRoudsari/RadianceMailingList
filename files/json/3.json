In particular, does formZ automatically create\nseperate layers, so that dxf2rad can use different modifier\nnames? You could earn yourself at least a pat on the back and\na honorable mention by writing a very short description of the\nexact procedure for my web site.\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict error: address not found in avlmemi", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Mon, 23 Jul 2001 19:29:09 -0400 (EDT)"}
