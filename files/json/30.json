HAs anyone heard of changes made to the system\nthat might cause compiler errors?  It seems to fail with about half of the\nexecutable files I expect it to make.  I've made the appropriate changes in\nthe makeall file to point to the X11 directories, so I'm fairly confident\nthats not the problem.   Does anyone have and suggestions, or perhaps know\nwhere I might find a pre-compiled version for Linux OS?\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert Graham\n\n\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C139FC.943AA45C\nContent-Type: text/html;\ncharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\n<HTML><HEAD>\n<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n\n\n<META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2600.0\" name=GENERATOR>\n<STYLE></STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY bgColor=#d5ccbb>\n<DIV><SPAN class=984172313-10092001><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>There\nare Linux binaries available at the distribution site: <FONT size=2><A\nhref=\"http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/\">http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/</A>,\nthough I can't currently reach the site.
