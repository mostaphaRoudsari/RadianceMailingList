If that material has color, then\nyou will get a brightness modification to the color specified in the\nmaterial primitive.  I don't know of any reliable procedures for taking\ncolor information in a subset of an image and extrapolating it into the\nsurrounding image.  If your color image only covers a fraction of your\nsurface, you are not going to be able to get color for the rest of it\nby combining this somehow with a complete grayscale image.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: colorpict modifiers", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 3 Nov 2002 20:18:52 -0800"}
