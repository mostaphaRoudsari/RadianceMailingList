Anselmo! Radiance binaries compiled with Mingw32 for\nwindows, look in:\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=3Dmodload&name=3DDownloads=\n&file=3Dindex&req=3Dgetit&lid=3D12\n\nEcotect 5.5 is very fast and easy to model and run daylighting\nsimulations. Model your atrium, after that call RADIANCE Export Toll\nand voila.\nECOTECT has a very good interface trough RADtool, they run smooth and\nyou'll have very precise images and analyses.\nIf possible, forget Desktop Radiance.\n\nRegards to all, from Brasil\n\n[vangelis]\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Do you think Ecotech 5.5 with Desktop Radiance control panel (the\nnewest version ) is the right tool to do my atrium research? I like using it\nfor its clear GUI, but if it could finish similar work and achieve the same\nresults as its UNIX/LINUX brother?\n\n2.  I think a lot of complex atrium roofs have to be researched and\nconstructed in my project, if UNIX/LINUX Radiance is the most suitable tool?\nIf Linux version is good, could I use the Radiance on Cygwin Environment?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] simulating an atrium", "tags": [], "sender": "Evangelos", "datetime": "Wed Mar 28 22:52:56 2007"}
