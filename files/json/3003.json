These can be put in a file and\nincorporated with a single -aI option.\n\nThe other alternative is to switch off the irradiance cache using -aa\n0 and assign other parameters to make the problem tractable over all\nsurfaces.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<46112A63.60802@iebele.nl>", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
