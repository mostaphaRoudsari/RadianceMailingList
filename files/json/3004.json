FYI, it is\npossible to generate an obj, convert to a radiance mesh and use Local\nu,v coordinate mapping to get the leaf and bark materials to apply. I\nhave a tree right now that basically has a few materials defined for it:\n\n1. bark with colorpict modifier\n2. leaf with colorpict modifier\n3. leaf-mix mixpict - this uses an alpha version of the leaf to mix\nbetween void (ie where the alpha is black) and the leaf material (2)\n\nThe question for Greg is this, to exclude the leaves from the ambient\ncalculation what needs to be listed in the exclude file the \"leaf\"\nmaterial and/or the \"leaf-mix\" material?\n\nIebele, the one thing to note is that the obj file that comes out of\nxfrog does not play well with obj2mesh or obj2rad. Thus I have to bring\nit into PolyTrans and re-export as an obj to get a file that radiance is\nhappy with.\n\nBest,\n\n-Jack\n\nGregory J.
