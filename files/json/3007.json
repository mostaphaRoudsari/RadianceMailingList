{"body": "\nSteen,\n\nI've found that the easiest way to deal with situations like this is to\nuse some sort of forward ray-tracing program such as TracePro to model\nthe luminaire you want with the materials that you want. Some of them\nget quite in-depth with their materials libraries, so specifying exactly\nwhat you want is generally not a problem. You should also be able to\ndefine the source you want and set the lamp lumens appropriately. After\nrunning the simulation, you can then output the distribution to an IES\nfile for use in Radiance. I'm sure there are ways to do this strictly in\nradiance as well, but I'm not as familiar with the methods you might\nuse. If anyone else has experience using only radiance for this sort of\nthing I would also be interested to hear how you did it as well.\n\nDave\n\nSteen Traberg-Borup wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to model a desk top lamp?", "sender": "J.
