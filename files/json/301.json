The main source of color\nmismatches is going to be the relationship between the scene illuminant\nand the surface reflectances, which is of course ignored by ICC\nprofiles.  The color space used by Radiance is close to the sRGB\nprimaries, but not exactly those.  To convert to sRGB from a standard\nRadiance picture, use the following command:\n\n% ra_xyze -r -p .64 .33 .30 .15 .06 .313 .329 stand.pic | ra_tiff -g\n2.2 - srgb.tif\n\nFrom there, you should be able to print and get reliable color results\non most systems, including Macs and PCs, since they assume sRGB given\nno other information.\n\nHowever, the point I was trying to make was unless you have very\ncarefully rendered your scene in order to arrive at the standard\nRadiance color space, these sorts of manipulations are futile.  To read\nin greater detail how to compute color correctly, including full\nspectral effects, see the recent paper I wrote with Elena\nVileshin-Eydelberg:\n\nhttp://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/gwlarson/papers/egwr02/\n\nThis covers important issues such as white balance and optimal\nrendering color spaces.  Radiance can render in any RGB space you\nchoose -- they are just three separate color channels as far as the ray\ntracer is concerned.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  Have you ever taken a look at the ICC specification?
