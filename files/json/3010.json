{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\nI missed this e-mail, but I guess everyone else did, too....\n\nThe compamb script only computes the ambient value for rpict and rvu\nin rad, not mkillum.  To get this, you are best off using the value\ngiven by gensky (assuming you're using gensky).  For example, \"gensky\n8 10 15\" spits out:\n\n# gensky 8 10 15\n# Local solar time: 14.77\n# Solar altitude and azimuth: 47.3 70.4\n# Ground ambient level: 18.1\n(etc.)\n\nFor exterior calculations including mkillum, -av 18.1 18.1 18.1 would\nbe appropriate.\n\nAs to the rest of the mkillum parameters, you have to think about how\nmany bounces are important and set this yourself.  Rad is not smart\nenough to figure it out (and neither am I unless I know your geometry).\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum parameters", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<684FA0CD-E41F-4279-9EFD-FB94CD9966E8@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<001201c5ef67$ccd57ba0$0100a8c0@mallah>"], "datetime": "Wed Nov 30 00:59:33 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mkillum parameters"}
