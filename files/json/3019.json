I checked the location of the radiance system\nfiles:\nthe *.cal procedurals were in /usr/share/radiance/lib\n\nthe rad executable was in /usr/lib/radiance/bin\n\ntherefore editing my .bashrc script with\nexport PATH=.:/usr/lib/radiance/bin:${PATH}\nexport PATH=.:/usr/share/radiance/lib:${PATH}\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/share/radiance/lib/\nexport RAYPATH\n\nsolved it. (I think one of the lines might be redundant)\n\nthanks again\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck Out Our List Of Trendy Restaurants.
