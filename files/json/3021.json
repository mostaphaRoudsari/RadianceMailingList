I always append the existing RAYPATH when\nsetting a new one, just not to break anything I might have done before.\nIf there is nothing that has been defined before in this variable, there\nwill be no negative impact as the existing (appended) RAYPATH will just\nbe empty.\n\nNow some comments on your settings:\nPossible, but not recommended. Including '.' into your path is dangerous\nas it opens the possibility of executing programs that you do not want.\nE.g. someone might have somehow managed to put a executeable named \"ls\"\ninto a directory of yours, containing some malicious code and a call to\nls. If you happen to type \"ls\" in that directory, not the system tool\nyou expected, but the malicious code would run (with your user rights),\nand as there was a call to the original \"ls\" in it, you get the output\nyou expect and will not even realize what happened. So I never have '.'\nin my PATH. And it is never necessary!\n\nThere are no executeable in /usr/share/radiance/lib, this is not reasonable.\n\n\nOk, but before you used tanother convention for the variable, so use the\nsame here. Just one line, not two.\n\nAh, and thanks to Jelle I just found that I forgot the '.' in the\nRAYPATH setting that I describe on my webpage ;-)\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Help:Setting up a radiance system", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
