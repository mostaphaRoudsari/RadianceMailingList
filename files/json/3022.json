{"body": "\nHi,\nI am trying to use mkillum program, for window definition, from rad. If I\nunderstood well I should have 2 lines in .rif file: illum and mkillum.\n\n-illum line\nShould the file defined in this line contain both glazing material and\nsurface definition or it can contain only one of them?\n\n-mkillum line parameters:\n-ab 2 - I suppose this is enough since the environment is clear (no\nobstructions)\n-as and -ad can be the default for rtrace\n-av - What exactly represents this -av value for mkillum?   How could I\ncompute it?  Would the calculation be accurate if this is 0?\n\nI am simulating simple room with a window on the South wall.\n\nIf I run compamb with rif file containing this mkillum, would it use the\nillum material data? I am asking this because in the book it said that rad\nwould take care for all changes in illum files, but I am not sure if compamb\nwould do that too.\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Cvetkovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001201c5ef67$ccd57ba0$0100a8c0@mallah>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Nov 22 14:24:51 2005", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mkillum parameters"}
