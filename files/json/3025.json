You\nshould get a IES-formatted file.\n\n2) Generate a radiance description from that file using ies2rad:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ies2rad.1.html\n\n3) Include that description instead of the spotlights (keep orientation\nand position, and use !xform to include the source.\n\nThe procedure is described in detail in the tutorial that came with your\nRadiance installation. And a great help are the tutorial from\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml !\n\nGood luck, CU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070407/09091e64/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Help:Setting up a radiance system", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
