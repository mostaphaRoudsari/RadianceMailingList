I have a some question about mimicking human visual response.\n\nI have read part of the book \"Rendering with Radiance\", and it said that the mechamism of human eye to\nadapt outside world has not been very well understood. So I wonder if anyone can give me some information\non the recent development in this area, to what extent it has been understood nowadays? Are there any websites or books I can refer to?\n\nI noticed that now the digital cameras can perform auto white balance, and auto exposure, do they also\nmimic the human eye response? I mean do they compress the dynamic range?\n\nOne more question is that I tried to use pcond program, I found that the option of -h and -e could not work together, I mean I can not mimic the human eye response and also adjust the exposure, did I made some mistakes?\n\nBest wishes.\n\nYours,\nHuang\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070413/91962616/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Huangwx@Kyoto Univ.", "datetime": "Fri Apr 13 08:54:37 2007"}
