Do a\nsearch on \"color appearance models\" and the work of Marc Fairchild at\nRIT, James Ferwerda at Cornell Univ., and Sumanta Pattanaik at UCF.\nSome of this work has appeared at SIGGRAPH, and Pattanaik et al. from\n1998 has a nice introduction to the many considerations of modeling\nhuman vision.\n\nThe pcond algorithm was described in a 1997 paper in IEEE TVCG:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/lbnl39882/tonemap.pdf\n\n\nNo, in fact most cameras increase contrast and color saturation in\norder to give images more \"punch.\"  This is the opposite of dynamic\nrange compression.\n\n\nThe -e option uses a linear exposure setting, which doesn't allow for\ndynamic range compression.  That is why it doesn't work together with\nthe -h option.\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] About mimic human visual respons", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
