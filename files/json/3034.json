{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nActually, -ar 0 just turns off the limit to value spacing, so you'll\nbasically get one interreflection calculation per pixel on inside\ncorners.  Interpolation still takes place when surfaces are farther\napart.  To turn off interpolation altogether, you'd have to set -aa\n0, which is another (somewhat more drastic) approach to the scaling\nproblem.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] -ar and large scenes", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<9EE0D034-E04E-419D-93EE-EDF725D05147@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<437E619E.2080902@rumblestrip.org>", "<120B78F8-C678-4D5F-BC87-232FED342B7B@gmail.com>", "<437E6A9F.4050004@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Sat Nov 19 01:08:27 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] -ar and large scenes"}
