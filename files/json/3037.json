In a\nsecond image I used the same shape but made the object glow\n(material) and the environment black - This created something like a\nmask. Then I wrote a small program which picks all the non-black\npixels in the mask and replaces them with the content from the first\n(specular) image.\nTo my surprise these shapes never matched up perfectly, the mask\ncreated with the non-specular material was always a few pixels bigger\nthan the specular shape, as a result there were always a few\nbackground pixels selected. I tried other materials in combination\nwith different lights(ambient etc) - always encountering the same\nproblem.\n\nkatja\n\nOn Apr 19, 2007, at 2:58 PM, Fitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n\n\nKatja Doerschner\nUniversity of Minnesota\nPsychology Department\n218 Elliott Hall\n75 East River Road\nMinneapolis, MN 55455-0344\nPhone:+1 612 626-8551\nhttp://vision.psych.umn.edu/~doerschner\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070419/937c95f8/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] remove light probe image from background", "tags": [], "sender": "Katja Doerschner", "datetime": "Thu Apr 19 22:14:19 2007"}
