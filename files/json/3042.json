I plan to work on a\nmodule that will create \"window sources\" similar to mkillum given\nmeasured BTDF data, but this won't be ready for some months.\n\nI realize this isn't much help, but I'm afraid the options are\ncurrently somewhat limited.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Specifying surface properties from BTDF data", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
