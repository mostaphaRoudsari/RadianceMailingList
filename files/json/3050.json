What do you get when you type\n\"echo $RAYPATH\"?  I'm guessing you don't have '.' in the path for\nsome reason.  Either that, or the directory you're in doesn't have\nthe right permissions.  (Though I would expect an earlier error in\nthat case.)  What do you get when you type \"ls -l illum12.dat\"?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] OSX rpict errors with mkillum", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
