Yes, in my conversion to OSX I'd\nforgotten that I was now working with bash and hence had a space in the\npath statement where it should not have been.  Back to basics 101.\nThanks again.\n\nBest regards,\nChris\n\n\n\nHi Chris,\n\nThis sounds like a RAYPATH issue.  What do you get when you type \"echo\n$RAYPATH\"?  I'm guessing you don't have '.' in the path for some\nreason.  Either that, or the directory you're in doesn't have the right\npermissions.  (Though I would expect an earlier error in that case.)\nWhat do you get when you type \"ls -l illum12.dat\"?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: chumann.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 315 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070509/0d127205/chumann.vcf\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general]OSX rpict errors with mkillum", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Humann", "datetime": "Wed May  9 18:50:44 2007"}
