I\nhave a dome with a highly specular (consider 99% specular) surface. The\ndome is an obj-mesh, with interpolated vertex normals (\"smooth\") and\nimported using obj2mesh.\n\nThe rounded vertexes render a smooth dome when viewed from below, as\nexpected. But as this dome reflects light onto the floor, it is some\nkind of a big convex reflector. I wonder if for light reflected from\nthis reflector to the ground, the normal interpolation is applied, too.\nThe background for my question are big bright splotches on the floor. I\nalso wonder if this geometry is something not really to be modeled in\nclassic radiance, as the old questions of convex reflectors and backward\nraytracing might occur. Is this even a case for photon mapping? I have\nnever been in modeling a convex reflector, for architecture this is not\na typical example in our days, so I am curious about what you propose...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
