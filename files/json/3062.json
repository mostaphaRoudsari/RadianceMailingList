Obj2rad\nwill convert the obj format geometry to radiance format geometry. It\nwill not convert material definitions. To see what materials need to be\ndefined do the following:\n\nobj2rad -n my_geometry.obj > my_geometry.data\n\nThe -n switch will set obj2rad to only output material related names\nthat are used by the obj geometry. You should look for the names between\nthe following section:\n\nqualifier Material begin\n....\nend\n\nYou can ignore the other sections. These are the names of the materials\nbeing used by the geometry. You will need to define them in a radiance\nmaterial file, for example, if you have a material named: glazing, you\nwould then need to define a material in radiance with the same name:\n\nvoid glass glazing\n0\n0\n3 .7 .7 .7\n\nThis file would then be included before the geometry files when\ncompiling the scene:\n\noconv my_materials.rad my_geometry.rad > my_scene.oct\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\ngcb205@soton.ac.uk wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070515/0efd5022/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2rad strange results", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Tue May 15 15:01:29 2007"}
