With my limited expertise the only way in which i can\nsee\nof doing this is to export to Wavefront object .obj from 3DS and then\nuse\nthe obj2rad radiance tool.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that the .rad file which is generated\nby\nobj2rad does not appear the same as those that i have used before. When\ni\ntry to render these .rad files oconv reports that the beginning of each\nof\nthe lines begins with an undefined moodifier.\n\nWhen i used the resultant octree file in rview it reported a fatal error\n\n\"./rview: fatal - (pot.oct): truncated octree\"\n\nAny help that you might be able to offer would be very welcome.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nGareth Beale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Tue May 15 15:08:45 2007"}
