The problem is that the model\nI want to render has been developed with classic Radiance as target\nengine, and as it becane rather huge, uses all kinds of optimizations\nthat fit to classic. I will try to render it in Radzilla, but have not\nbeen successful so far. So I need the safe fall-back while integrating\nRadzilla step by step into the simulation.\n\n\nI think this is one more reason to use it, who else should test it on\nridicularly blown-up scenes with thousands of light sources ;-) I will\ntry this week-end, I just compiled the latest Radzilla (still failed\nwith some GUI-stuff on QT/Mac, but I won't need that now anyway).\n\n\nMe too... as we come to a point where the photon map is needed, is\navailable and validated, it would be not very reasonable to keep people\naway from using it. Maybe something for a Radiance 4.x line?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: pma", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
