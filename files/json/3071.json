{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nIn some of my recent renders, I have encountered some very specious\nartifacts. I generally specify a high number of ambient division (usually\naround 3072) and ambient super samples (500-1000) for my renders.\n\nThe first ones are these mysterious dark splotches:\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=4bcbre2.jpg&.src=ph\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=c76fre2.jpg&.src=ph\n\nI really can't figure out what's causing these. I am unsure if this is\ncaused by poor interpolation. Also, occasionally I have come across the\nfollowing bright spots:\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=e02ere2.jpg&.src=ph\n\nNo matter how many ambient divisions that I specify (I went up to 16,000\nambient divisions with 2000 ambient super samples),  I can't get rid of\nthese bright spots. The problem with these particular artifacts is that I\ncan not predict when it will occur. What I need the most when performing\nrenders is predictability. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY102-F24B47FFB9825E0AC959DCAA4410@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Dec  5 19:07:34 2005", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] What's causing these artifacts???"}
