{"body": "\nDear folks,\n\nout of curisosity: has someone got a Nikon (model 8400/880/4500)\nremotely controlled (shutter speed etc. for HDR) under Linux  ?\nPaul's informative posting from March 2005\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002512.html\nmentions hacking the firmware to get a remote controlled sequence of\nshutter speeds on a Nikon.\n\nLinux USB pages say that most Nikons are supported by gphoto2:\nhttp://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=1353\nhttp://www.teaser.fr/~hfiguiere/linux/digicam.html\nReading images on a 4500 with PTP mode works, remote trigger works, but\nmostly likely the firmware doesn't support setting of the shutter speed:\n\nNikon Europe support tells me that only the 8400,8800,L1/L101,S4 support\nremote control via USB (firmware of the 4500 at hand is 1.2, most recent\none at Nikon is 1.3, which they say differs only in flash control). Has\nsomeone info on the inofficial side to this ?\n(If you are not aware of it, holding the 'menu' button at power-on\ndisplays the firmware version)\nSomeone I talked to mentioned  some undocumented pins on the 4500 USB\nconnector, which  are supposed to be RS232 with remote control\nfeatures.  Apparently he'd be testing this soon.\n\nAnyone aware of 3rd party companies selling something like an HDR\nfirmware for NIkons (or other cameras) ?\n\nInfo on positive experiences with other brands and HDR control via USB\non Linux would also be much appreciated.\n\nTIA\n-Peter\n\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4395CE39.8030507@pab-opto.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Dec  6 18:46:59 2005", "email": "apian at pab-opto.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] USB?linux remote shutter control of Nikons ?"}
