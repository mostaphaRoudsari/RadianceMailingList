{"body": "\nHi Ignacio,\n\nFrom my experience, there are memory problems associated with\nCygwin, and these are unrelated to Radiance (other than the fact that\nRadiance uses a lot of memory).  A backtrace isn't much help in this\ncase, I'm afraid, as it is not a problem with the program, but with\nthe system under which it is operating.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Segmentation fault", "sender": "Gregory J.
