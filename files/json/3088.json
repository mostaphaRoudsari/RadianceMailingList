Some scanline-based renderers are able to compensate for\nthis with specialized algorithms, but it's almost impossible to avoid\nin a ray-tracing system.  You need to create a finer mesh to\nameliorate the problem, though you'll never be able to eliminate it\nentirely.  The only way to do that is to have the correct geometry to\nbegin with -- i.e., by using a sphere in this case.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] smooth on meshes", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
