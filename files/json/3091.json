I use\nplastic material and both specularity and roughness are zero. can someone\ntell me whether the intensity of the pixels match the real world value or it\njust looks real. Please forgive me for my poor English and the problem is\ndriving me mad. Any help will be appreciated.\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070530/52cbc493/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Sun ChenGuang", "datetime": "Wed May 30 10:20:12 2007"}
