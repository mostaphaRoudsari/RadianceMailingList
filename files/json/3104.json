Peter Apian-\nBennewitz packed it up, and Daniel Fuller unpacked, connected and\nconfigured it.  The site was working almost immediately with IP\nredirection, but the mailing list has been more of a problem.\n\nIf this gets through, but you don't see a post you made to the list\nin the last few weeks, please repost it to the list.\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
