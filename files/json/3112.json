I think it is best here to replace the glazing by a mkillum pane and, if the shading system masks the window in a way that you expect variying illumination, subdivide that illum face a bit (see mkillum manpage). Without the illum pane, you might \"measure\" the max/min values of an inaccurate raytracing, sometimes light sources found, sometimes not, purely by luck ;-)\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ray-trace or mkillum for external blinds", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Fri Jul 13 09:55:32 2007"}
