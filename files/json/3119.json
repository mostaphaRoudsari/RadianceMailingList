{"body": "\nJeffrey,\n\nI also get the same behaviour as John reports.  In my experience going\nfrom dxf -> 3ds -> mgf -> rad (works better than dxf -> rad directly)\nmissing surfaces are due to errors in the original cad model or small\nerrors in curved surfaces being triangulated.  I would recommend\nchecking the original model.\n\nApart from that could there be any 3ds primitives that are not\ntranslated by 3ds2mgf?\n\nIain\n\nJohn Mardaljevic wrote:\n\n\n--\n****************************\nDr Iain A Macdonald\nEnergy Systems Research Unit\nUniversity of Strathclyde\nGlasgow, UK\n+44 141 548 3747\nhttp://www.esru.strath.ac.uk\n****************************\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance plug-in for 3DS", "sender": "Iain Macdonald", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<43A92484.4090608@esru.strath.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<33B40178-C019-45BF-8FDE-DFCF7A3006E5@dmu.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Wed Dec 21 10:53:47 2005", "email": "iain at esru.strath.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance plug-in for 3DS"}
