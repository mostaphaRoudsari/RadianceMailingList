{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nHere are a few more thought to add.\n\n* 3ds - this format has some limitations in data size/allocation. I\nhave noticed on big models that have a lot of geometry, 3dsout\nfrom Autocad will stop on large entities. One thing to consider\nwould be writing a script (autolisp) and using 3dsout on a per\nlayer or per color basis, though this still may not work on large\nentities.\n* Max and objects converted to 3ds - there are lots of objects out\nin the 3D marketplace that are sold in multiple formats, some of\nthese are actually modeled in Max and then converted to other\nformats. One problem that I have noticed with models created in\nMax is that because of the way Max deals with coordinate systems\non a per object basis, models exported to other formats such as\n3ds do not always have things transformed correctly. I think that\nthis must be a problem with the way Max deals with exporting to\nother formats. For example, I bought some nice 3D car models in\n3ds format, in a few of them the wheels where not in the right\nlocation when I viewed the model.  PLEASE NOTE - I am not a Max\nuser, but I have worked with customers who use Max, and it is a\nhuge @#%$%^#$% pain in the @#%$$#$% to get things converted into\nsomething useful.\n* Polytrans - my latest effort at find a decent 3D conversion tool\nfinally lead me to purchase Polytrans from Okino\n(http://www.okino.com/conv/conv.htm) along with the cad-pak\nmodule. I have used this for a few different things (though there\nare some minor problems with the native autocad dwg as they use\nopendwg vs native dwg). The nice things is that I now have a\nreliable way to export directly to obj!\n* 3Dwin4 and Accutrans3d - I have used the former with some success\nand heard of the latter. You will have to do a search on where to\nfind them. These are shareware\n* Revit - As far as this is concerned, I have always thought that\nthis must be a pretty great tool. However, I have never used it\nfor production for the very reason that it seemed extremely\ndifficult to get geometry out. This being said though, I have\nheard from relatively reliable sources that they are working on\nthis, on the other hand though I think that in the bigger picture\nthey are trying to determine the best way to fit Revit into their\noverall product mix.\n* Outsource Development of custom exporter - Depending on need and\nhow much you use Revit it might be worth it to consider\noutsourcing the development of a native exporter. I have no idea\nwhat the Revit api is like though so not really sure what would be\ninvolved.
