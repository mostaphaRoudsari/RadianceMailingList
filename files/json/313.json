And, as Carsten points\nout, the ambient term will give you light even where there is none.  If\nyou want to avoid all such leakage problems, you would need to set -ar 0\nand -av 0 0 0.  However, the image would take longer to compute, and\nsetting -av 0 0 0 rather than to a good guess of the ambient level\nresults in a loss of accuracy over most of the scene.\n\n(There is a script in the 3.4 release called compamb, which computes an\nambient value for a rad input file automatically.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Strange problem using -vtl to cut sections", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8589F9A2-95C3-11D6-BD06-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 12 Jul 2002 11:16:44 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Strange problem using -vtl to cut sections"}
