{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nWithout seeing your swatches or having a reflectance measurement to\ncompare to, it's difficult for me to guess whether the calibration is\nworking or not.  Certainly, the debug output from Macbethcal\nindicates that it was able to do a reasonable job of inverting your\nscanner's response.  However, it's still possible that some kind of\nauto-exposure is changing the results from one scan to the next, so\nit may be that your absolute levels are off.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Macbethcal Reflectances", "sender": "Gregory J.
