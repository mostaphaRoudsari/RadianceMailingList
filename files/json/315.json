CPU costs are rarely\nlinear with CPU speed, so you may end up with a better cost/performance\nratio with two slightly slower CPUs than with one top-notch CPU.\nAs Schorsch pointed out, split your rtrace input vectors to two rtraces\nand half your computing time. Easy with shell or awk programming.\n\ncorrect. Of course two dual machines are also an option....\n\n-Peter\n\nPS: I had a glance at mosix, - definitely a neat idea from a kernel and\nopsys perspective. However, while rendering for fun and profit, I'd\nrather prefer to know what is happening on my machines. Imagine a\nlogfile of an aborted rpict. It states \".... rendered on foo\", whereas,\nthanks to mosix, it had been transparently migrated during rendering to\na different box, with happened to have a faulty RAM segment.\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Fri, 17 Jan 2003 18:03:07 +0100"}
