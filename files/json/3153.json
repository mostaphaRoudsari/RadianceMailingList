I created the sky.rad file as follows for intermediate sky with sun (in Vienna)\n\n!gensky 9 5 14:00 +i -a 48.14 -o 16.2 -m -15 -R 106.5204882 -B 429.0795118\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4                1                1                  1                  0\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4                0                  0                  1             180\n\nand after using\n\noconv sky.rad > sky.oct\n\nI used the rview command as descibed in the book:\n\nrview -vta -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 sky.oct\n\nBut all I can get is an angular fish eye-view of the sky only white, without any  distribution.\n\nI would appreciate if someone could help me to fix this problem.\n\nThank you very much\n\nRegards, Sokol\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nLuggage?
