Ore more simply you could pipe the results of rcalc\ndirectly to rtrace like so:\n\n\n\nrcalc -e '$1=2;$2=0;$3=5;$4=$1-2;$5=$2-0;$6=$3-1.5' grid.pts | rtrace\n...\n\n\n\nBy the way, your points need to be entered in the grid.pts without\ncommas or parenthesis like this:\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n\n\nHope that's helpful,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\npanick\nSent: 05 September 2007 17:22\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHello all,\n\n\n\nI want to find the luminance values for a grid of points using rtrace\nbut from a specific position of an observer.\n\n\n\nobserver's position (2,0,1.5)\n\n\n\ngrid of points :  (0,1,0) , (0,2,0)\n\n(1,1,0) , (1,2,0)\n\n(2,1,0) , (2,2,0)\n\n(3,1,0) , (3,2,0)\n\n\n\nHow do I have to write the rtrace command and the file which contains\nthe points and the vectors?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nNick\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070907/fb8a802f/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Fri Sep  7 04:04:15 2007"}
