{"body": "\nHi folks,\n\nI should know the answer to this, but I don't.  Let's say I have a\nscript that performs some numeric analysis of a scene (rtrace) and then\ndoes some renderings as well.  I typically crank up the settings quite a\nbit for rtrace, but relax them a bit for images (usually).  My question\nis, can the rpict process(es) safely use the existing ambient cache left\nover from the high-accuracy rtrace run?  Could running the rtrace at\nlower accuracy settings degrade any of the previously cached values?\nJust curious.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43A9E1D1.4050905@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec 22 00:16:02 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] sharing the ambient cache"}
