{"body": "\n\n0...(daylight\n\nHi pillo,\n\nI did some study on daylight and glare about a year ago. At that time I\ntried the different rating systems in Radiance and ended up using UGR. It\nseemed to give the most consistent results under different conditions, and\nthere are suggested values for different uses (if I remember well, it was 19\nfor offices and 21 was allowed when daylight is present) plus, it is the\nofficial rating from CIE. DGI gave me some strange results in some occasions\n(mine were too high). That`s my experience, but I would really like to hear\nconsiderations from the more experienced.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSantiago.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Santiago Torres", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000c01c22e55$5db5f960$80f54ca5@computer>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 18 Jul 2002 21:19:29 +0900", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: (no subject) (pillo.pillo@tin.it)References: <20020718100002.21739.48088.Mailman@darkside-animation.com>"}
