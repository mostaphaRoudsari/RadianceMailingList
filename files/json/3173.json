I generate the sun and\nsky using\n\"gensky 3 21 10:00EST -a 40.77 -o 73.967 -g .2\". The sun brightness is\n6.63e+06. It's a big number.  When I render my scene with the sun &\nsky, and adjust the exposure. The generated image can be viewed in\nhttp://www.cs.rpi.edu/~shengyu/sunny.png. However, the exposure is\nonly 4.537687e-02. If the sun light directly reach the\nsunlight-redirecting panel in the scene, how can an exposure of\n4.537687e-02 can adjust the color in the range of 0 and 1 because the\nsun brightness is such a big number?\n\nThanks.\n\nYu Sheng\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Sheng Yu", "datetime": "Sun Sep 23 22:56:41 2007"}
