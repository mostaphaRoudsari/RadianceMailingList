If so, then the comment at the top of\nsource.cal is correct, but it looks like I messed up on the actual\ndefinition of phi, which should be:\n\nsrc_phi = mod( atan2(-Dy, Dx) / DEGREE, 360 );  { 0-360 }\n\nrather than what it is, now.  I'm really confused, because this is\neffectively what I had before I made the \"correction,\" since I also\nhad a -my transform prior to 4/93.  I don't know where my copy of\nLM-63 is, if I even still have it, so if the above line works for\nyou, perhaps I should just change source.cal to agree with its\ncomment...\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: IES2Rad questions", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Oct  4 19:30:15 2007"}
