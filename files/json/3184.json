{"body": "\nDear friends,\n\nI'm trying to make use of advantages of the \"secondary\" light sources\nto speed up the indoor irradiance calculations.\n\nIn the test below we have compared a daylight factors in a room,\ncalculated along the central depth axis of the floor.\n\nThe room parameters are:\n3.2 meters - width,\n5.6 meters - depth,\n2.5 meters - height.\n\nThe window is 1.92 meters width and 1.5 meters height 0.8 meters\naltitude (above the floor).\nThe room is located in the building having external obstruction\n(another building) on the opposite side of the street.\n\nThe uniform sky model was used.\n\nI run Radiance (3.7.2 and 3.7.3) with different parameters and here\nare the most valuable of them:\nhttp://www.audice.com/radiance/Graphs_3.png\n\nWhere:\n\n\"Radiance Illum 1\" and \"Radiance Illum 2\" - the scene was divided into\nan outdoor and indoor parts. At the first pass the distribution of light\nfrom the window was calculated in the outdoor scene. At the second\npass the daylight factors were calculated in the indoor scene.\n\nFor window material I used:\n\nvoid illum window_mat\n0\n0\n3                  0                  0                  0\n\nI didn't use \"glass\" material, because I needed rather empty opening\nthan the glass.\n\n\"Radiance Illum 1\"\nParameters I used for mkillum:\n-ab 4 -aa .2 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -dp 256 -ds .15 -lr 8\n\nComment in scene .rad file:\n#@mkillum i=window_mat d=64 s=24 m=wind_illum f=./dist/window c=n b=0\n\nParameters I used for rtrace:\n-ab 8 -aa .1 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -dp 256 -ds .15 -lr 8\n\n--\n\"Radiance Illum 2\"\nParameters I used for mkillum:\n-ab 8 -aa .1 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -dp 256 -ds .15 -lr 8\n\nComment in scene .rad file:\n#@mkillum i=window_mat d=256 s=128 m=wind_illum f=./dist/window c=n b=0\n\nParameters I used for rtrace:\n-ab 8 -aa .1 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -dp 256 -ds .15 -lr 8\n\n--\n\"Radiance Standard\" - no illum surfaces were used. The model was not\ndivided into indoor / outdoor parts so the interreflection calculation\nwas used to compute the contribution from the window.\n\nrtrace parameters used:\n-ab 8 -aa .032 -ar 512 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -dt .05 -dr 8 -dp 2048 -ds .1\n-dc .6 -lr 8\n\n--\nWhat causes more than 6% error for \"Radiance Illum 1\" and \"Radiance\nIllum 2\" in the \"pink\" zone? Is there any way to get more accurate\nresults using secondary light sources?\n\n--\nBest Regards,\nIlya A.
