The G5 was one of the best\nworkhorses this month!!\nOn my G5 the deafult processor performance is already set on  \"Highest\".\nBesides that, removing the -DNICE= arguments in rt/ Rmakefile is\nsomething I like to check out, but I am fearly new with OSX, and I\nhaven't found any development tools yet.\nWhere do I find development tools for OSX, so I can run make?\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB5925FB5@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Dec 16 16:22:27 2005", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] No more Mr. Nice Guy"}
