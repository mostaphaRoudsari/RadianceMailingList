(I guess this was offline\nthough as I just hit reply.) I could not figure out how to generate a\nrandom value like this, so I was recommending that something could be\nscripted where random values could be generated with some other\nscripting language. This is much more elegant as it keeps it all\n(relatively) native and in-line to boot.\n\n-Jack\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] perlin nois", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Sat Oct 13 10:39:52 2007"}
