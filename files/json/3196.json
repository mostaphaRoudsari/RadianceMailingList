{"body": "\nMark is right.  To get the correct appearance out of a triangle mesh,\nyou actually need to use a displacement map to give the underlying\nmodel the correct appearance w.r.t. grazing shadows such as this\none.  Implementing displacement maps in a ray tracer is pretty\ndifficult, and in the end it costs more to render them than simply\nincreasing the resolution of your T-mesh as Mark suggests.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<Pine.LNX.4.63.0512130944040.28934@centipede.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0134A81C-A096-4134-89EB-58FDEC4421F7@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<439E9789.4020402@semanticlight.com>", "<Pine.LNX.4.63.0512130944040.28934@centipede.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>"], "datetime": "Tue Dec 13 17:41:01 2005", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rendering meshes with interpolated vertexnormals"}
