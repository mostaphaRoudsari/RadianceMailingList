{"body": "\nBob,\n\nYour guess is right. Radiance's triangles, even with normal\ninterpolation, are still flat. To use the normals to present a\ntrue curved surface would (I think) require an implicit\nrepresentation of the surface.\n\nThis particular example, with a low-res mesh and direct sunlight,\nis the \"poster-child\" of this problem.\n\nI usually avoid this problem by a combination of higher\nresolution (I use tri meshes up to 1M elements) and more ambient\nthan direct light.\n\nSo, I see no way to completely avoid this for some problems.\n\nMark\nmstock@umich.edu\n\nOn Tue, 13 Dec 2005, bob coyne wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<439E9789.4020402@semanticlight.com>", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.63.0512130944040.28934@centipede.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": ["<439E9789.4020402@semanticlight.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Dec 13 15:51:22 2005", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rendering meshes with interpolated vertexnormals"}
