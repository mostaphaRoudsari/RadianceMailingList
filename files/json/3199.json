{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI'm having a problem rendering polygon mesh objects with interpolated\nvertex normals (converted via obj2mesh). I'm running Radiance 3.7.2b\npatch release 22 Aug 2005.\n\nWhen I render a sphere mesh that's illuminated from above and to the\nside, I get bad artifacts along the shadow line, with large dark\ntriangular wedges periodically protruding into the illuminated\narea. (See link below for what this looks like.)  The dark triangles\nseem to correspond to those quadrilaterals in the mesh where only a\nsingle vertex is illuminated. My guess is that it's treating the whole\nquad as pointing away from the light source, even though one vertex\nand a significant area of it are in the illuminated region of the\nobject.\n\nIs there any way to avoid this?\n\nwww.semanticlight.com/images/sphere-problem.jpg\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n- Bob\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "bob coyne", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<439E9789.4020402@semanticlight.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Dec 13 09:33:50 2005", "email": "coyne at semanticlight.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rendering meshes with interpolated vertex normals"}
