{"body": "\nPillo,\n\nyou are right that the UGR is designed only for artificial lighting glare\nconsiderations.  theoretically speaking, it can't be applied to assessment\nof discomfort glare from windows.  there are two reasons.  firstly, the UGR\nassumes the light source is very small (<0.01 sr) in the field of\nview.  because windows occupy a larger portion of the field of view, they\nhave a greater impact on the eye's adaptation level, disturbing the\nassumptions of the UGR.  secondly, there is generally greater tolerance for\nmild degrees of glare from windows than from artificial luminaires.  this\nmeans that the UGR will overestimate the degree of perceived glare from\nwindows.\n\ngiven credit where it is due, most of this info came out of the thesis of\nMartine Velds from Delft, 'Assessment of lighting quality in office rooms\nwith daylighting systems'.  the bad news is that she goes on to say that,\n'it seems to be infeasible to predict or measure the perceived degree of\ndiscomfort glare in a specific situation'.  she then went on to develop a\nnew procedure called the 'visual comfort evaluation method', based on scale\nmodel or test room evaluations of glare.\n\nso, this is not good news.  i'm afraid i don't have a better suggestion as\ni haven't spent much time on the problem myself.  there is, however, a good\nexample of an approach taken by John Mardaljevic in the SIGGRAPH '98 course\nnotes, available on the RADIANCE web-site.\n\nRegards,\nPhil Greenup.\n\nAt 04:11 pm 18/07/02 +0200, you wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare dgi", "sender": "Phillip Greenup", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4.3.2.7.2.20020719093730.00af7630@pop.qut.edu.au>", "refs": ["<000c01c22e55$5db5f960$80f54ca5@computer>"], "datetime": "Fri, 19 Jul 2002 09:55:32 +1000", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glare dgi"}
