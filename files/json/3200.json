{"body": "\nDear Greg:\n\nI am very sorry for posting images to the mailing list.\n\nThanks very much for your suggestion.I have fixed the problem by setting the roughness of floor to 0.01.\nAnd I have speed up the rendering process by increasing the -aa value.\n\nThe AMBFILE seems can help to get better rendering results, and greatly increase the rendering speed\nfor the same model. But I think when I change materials of the model, I should delete the old ambient file\nand let Radiance generate a new one, otherwize the result will be incorrect. Am I right? Or maybe the\nambient file can be reused by models with similar materials?\n\nbest wishes.\n\nHuang\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20051213/745ef4a7/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Huangwx", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000e01c5ffb4$d3d4ec30$1f7af90a@hwxin>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Dec 13 08:15:55 2005", "email": "ap.huangwx at archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Fw: How to increase the rendering speed?"}
