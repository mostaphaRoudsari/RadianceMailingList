If\nthe package maintainer can't find a solution, the binaries of both\npackages have to be renamed.\n\nFor rcalc the maintainer of the rcalc package agreed to rename the\nbinary to grcalc, so this doesn't mean any change for us.\n\nAfter discussing the issue with the maintainers of the other package\nwhich provides the genbox binary I have agreed to rename genbox in\nDebian, as their package (gromacs, a molecular dynamics simulator) is in\nDebian since a long time and their genbox is also used in a lot of\nscripts which run it on large clusters. Imho agreeing here to rename\ngenbox is the only right way to go, although this is a bit annoying for\nradiance users of course.\n\nMy suggestion would be to rename genbox to genrbox, but I'm open for any\nother suggestion.\nThe rename will be documented in /usr/share/doc/{README,NEWS}.Debian and\nof course nobody will be stopped to add a symlink on their system which\npoints form genbox to genrbox - but I can't ship this link with Debian.\n\n\nAny suggestions and wishes are welcome.\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd@bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance in Debia", "tags": [], "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "datetime": "Fri Oct 19 02:09:59 2007"}
