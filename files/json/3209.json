Even if\nit's not one of the most common commands from a user's perspective,\nit's applied in dozens of scripts, mine and others', which would have\nbeen very tedious to track down and change.\n\nHowever, as Randolph says, genbox is also widely used, mostly in\nscene descriptions.  While we cannot easily change the existing docs,\nthis didn't stop us from renaming \"rview\" to \"rvu\" to avoid the clash\nwith one of vi's half-dozen monikers.  As you noticed, I added a\nsymbolic link in the executable directory from rview -> rvu as a stop-\ngap until people picked up the new name.  Would it be possible to do\nthis with genbox -> genrbox?\n\nAsking that packages not have any name collisions is a laudable but\nnot terribly realistic goal.  Surely, there are so many Debian\npackages by now that name collisions must happen left and right.  No?\n\nIf we aren't even allowed a symbolic link, one dastardly work-around\nis to add a check for the \"genbox\" command when parsing scene input,\nsubstituting \"genrbox\" and printing a warning of its deprecation.\nUgly, but it might work.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance in Debia", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Oct 19 08:25:29 2007"}
