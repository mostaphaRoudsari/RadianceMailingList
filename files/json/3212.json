I could even ship a script to add links to /usr/local/bin for\ngenbox and rview.\n\n\n\nThat was the first name clash since a longer time I've seen (and shame\non me, I should have checked that before). Radiance ships so many utils\nthat it is much more prone to such problems than packages shipping only\none tool. I think in general using a common prefix for utils of one type\nare very useful and common to avoid such problems, like k*/g* for\nkde/gnome tools. Also our tech-ctte is pretty strict if people try to\nuse too generic names. For example packages like libcommon or libconfig\nprobably won't be accepted at all in Debian.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I don;t see any other way yet.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd@bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance in Debia", "tags": [], "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "datetime": "Fri Oct 19 16:55:34 2007"}
