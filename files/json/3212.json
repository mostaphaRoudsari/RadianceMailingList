{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'm using Francesco Anselmo's \"radmap\" script to generate some annual\nskies for a fairly low latitude, and for a portion of the summer gensky\nthrows me a warning: \"sun too close to zenith, reducing altitude to 87\ndegrees\".  This adjustment creates a slight \"bump\" in the summertime\ncorner of the analemma when you view a hemispherical fisheye projection\nof the annual sun positions.  (The sun positions are being generated by\nthe script, which is getting its info from an epw weather file.)\n\nWhat is the cause for gensky relocating my suns to 87 degrees?\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43975B52.5040903@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Dec  7 23:01:13 2005", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sun too close to zenith"}
