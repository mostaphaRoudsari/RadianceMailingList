Just dowload the files and run\n# gcc -o dxfimport dxfimport_so.cpp\n\n\"dxfimport\" is a c++ command line utility that reads triangle (face)\nprimitives from dxf files, and convert these into Radiance polygon\nprimitives, using the layernumber of each face as modifier (LAYER001,\nLAYER002 etc.).\n\nThe url is:\nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so.h\nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so.cpp\n\nComments in the source files are a combination of dutch and english, as\nI said it is an in-house tool - and I am dutch....  :)\n\nGood  luck,\n\nIebele\n\n\n\nTom Young wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "tags": [], "sender": "iebele", "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 06:49:07 2007"}
