{"body": "\nthanks for the interest in such this topic!!!!\n\nnow i just want to add some pepper to the discussion....\n(or show everybody more clearly that i m a true beginner...)\nyou told me about glare analysis in the case of artificial lighting\nbut: how can you consider real photometric curves if they are not directly\nvisible (illum material+impostor geometriesare are not considered inthe\ncalculation...) when using impostor geometries?\nis it correct to use brightdata+source.cal+light (instead of illum) and\nto assign such definition to a surface close to the real shape of light\nsource considered??\n\n\nthanks\npillo\n\nPS (true email)\nDGI<0 still remains a problem unsolved for me and i m happy to see that\nAnnalisa shares the same problem with me, i m not alone.\nalso the fact that findglaring on a octree or on a precalculated picture\ngives different values is a problem....\nalso the fact that different VCP occur with same DGI is a problem (indexes\nor calculations problems?)\nso i m wondering if the problem is but an rtrace tag's right values choice...\n(but which are the parameter involved?)\ni m thinking about a convergence test for glare calculations (like Mardaljevic's\nab test)....BUT\nthe conclusion of my talk is that surely i m a beginner and the problem,\nmay be, depends ONLY on my little knowledge of glare calculations ...BUT\ni'll appreciate every suggestion to solve it. (also like \"read again WARD's\nSUPERBOOK!\")\nSO let's talk about this interesting topic !(glare calculations using Radiance)\n\nagain,\npillo\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] R: Glare DGI<0", "sender": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3CEF804100036277@ims4a.cp.tin.it>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 19 Jul 2002 12:16:01 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] R: Glare DGI<0"}
