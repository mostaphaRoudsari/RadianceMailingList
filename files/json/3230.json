{"body": "\nHi Francesco and all,\n\nI've read through the mailing list archives and experimented with \"rad\n-N\" and rpiece.  I'm using multiple CPUs and multiple machines on\n'standard' linux distros - cannot use openmosix.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1.\nIf I do this:\nRad will *not* split up my scene for me (using rpiece).  However, if I\nspecify multiple views, rad *will* run rpict multiple times\nsimultaneously (ie. as forked/backgrounded processes).\nIs this expected behaviour? I was hoping it would split my scene!\n\n2.\nUsually I use RIF files to store my \"scene=\", \"illum=\", \"zone=\"\nvariables, and to let rad handle calling oconv/rpict/pfilt/etc correctly\nwith appropriate settings.\n\nTo divide up a scene, it seems I must use rpiece which calls rpict.\n(Let's *assume* my NFS lockd is working okay).  Therefore I cannot use\nrad and my rif files?  So I have to do what rad does *manually* and\nincorporate rpiece into this process?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nBrett Beeson\n\nCUNDALL\nHSBC Building Level 20\n300 Queen Street\nBrisbane QLD 4000\ntel:   +61 (0)7 3023 5048\nfax:  +61 (0)7 3023 4000\nwww.cundall.com.au\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nFrancesco Anselmo\nSent: 22 November 2005 18:55\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Nicholas,\n\nThere are many ways to run Radiance with multiple processors\nand multiple machines. Some programs like rad and rholo have\nsupport for multiple processors (-N option), rpiece can be used\nto split a picture into tiles and have them rendered by different\nprocessors or computers over a network (for instance sharing\nthe scene files with nfs).\n\nPersonally, I like to use openmosix with Radiance, and you can\nread about my experience in a previous message to this mailing list:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/00\n1992.html\n\n__\nFrancesco\npisuke@blueyonder.co.uk\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\nBrett Beeson\nSustainable Designer\n\n\nImportant Notice.
