{"body": "\nHello all,\n\nSince this is the first message on THE LIST this side of the New Year, I wish\nyou all a happy and productive 2006. I hope it's going to be better than\n2005, and worse than 2007 will be.\n\nAnd here comes my question:\n\nI was wondering if anybody has any idea as to if there is a MIME type for\nHDR images. This is for dishing out HDR through an HTTP server, and if\nleft undefined, HDRs get served as 'BIN file', which isn't particularly\nelegant, and makes assigning the default browser behaviour ('open with\nximage') rather challenging.\n\nIs there a kinda standards body looking after those MIME types, or is this\nleft to the distributors/developers of OSes, desktop environments and\napps?\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR MIME type", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10111.213.58.97.235.1136192799.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<BAY102-F2938AED7558BA2E6FFCA90A4410@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Mon Jan  2 10:14:33 2006", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR MIME type"}
