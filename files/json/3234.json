Could you restate it more\nclearly?\n\nAre you speaking of the rpict/rtrace -i+ rendering option?  In this\ncase, trans materials will be ignored, treated as if they were not\nthere at all, regardless of the real arguments.  The same is true for\ndielectric and glass materials.  This is designed to avoid the\nconfusing situation where you see the irradiance arriving at a window\nrather than the irradiance on the objects visible through it.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 4933 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060102/cc946c81/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Greg War", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C2349D4@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jan  2 20:23:01 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] trans"}
