I have the book \"Rendering with Radiance\" but it\nseems to be void of any in-depth information concerning writing procedurals\nwith the CAL files. I have tried to go through the files to see how they are\nwritten but unfortunately, I can't understand how many of the equations were\nderived. The reason why I would like to know is so that I can write my own\nprocedurals and so that I can better optimize the parameters for the\nstandard cal files.\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online\nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed, 22 Jan 2003 21:54:27 +0000"}
