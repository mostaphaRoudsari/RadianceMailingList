On the other hand, I think this BIM stuff is going to go\nsomewhere, so figuring out how to manage the data is going to be an\nissue worth investigating. I suspect it is particularly nasty if you are\ntrying get data out for use in Autocad 2000. I wonder if would be any\nmore \"inter-operable\" going from Revit to 2008.\n\nAs an aside, I really wish that the folks at Autodesk would provide a\nmethod for exporting to obj format. Not that this helps with managing\ngigantic 3D data sets, but it would at least provide good workflow from\nAutodesk tools to other applications....\n\n-Jack\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 13:31:20 2007"}
