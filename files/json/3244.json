But I do agree that\nhardware and to a certain extent software is looking more than ever like\nit's ready for this challenge.  I still would argue that the end users\nare not.  Despite there being an AIA layer naming standard for ten\nyears, I have yet to get a couple of drawings from a couple of\narchitects that use the same \"standard\".\n\nAnd yes, it does seem like the further you go back, version-wise, the\nmore problems you have.  The file size issue is related to this; each\nprogressive version downgrade caused the file to grow a bit more.  In\nour case, this model was exported to AutoCAD 2008 format by the\narchitect, then converted by me to 2004 and 2000 format, just to see the\ndifferences.\n\nYeah, I agree.  This is one of the reasons for our office purchasing a\nlicense of SketchUp Pro, is the export capability.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 14:18:07 2007"}
