But it's not their job to provide the consultants with\nusable models for their particular simulation tool. It's their job to do\nthe fuzzy visual things and that's what Sketchup was design for. If\nit would\nrequire more precision and accuracy it would not be as popular as it is.\n\nEveryone has a favourite and if you know how to use your tools I\ndon't see\nwhy it shouldn't be possible to create good Radiance models in Sketchup.\n\nI just can't get the hang of it.\n\nThomas\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sketchup to Radiance [was: dxf2rad]", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 14:30:30 2007"}
