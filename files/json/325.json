{"body": "\nI have recently installed Suse Linux V8 at home to explore using Radiance in\nits \"native\" environment. Starting with the Desktop Radiance installation\nunder Windows, I am now reasonably confident in setting up scenes, lights\netc using Cad and a text editor.\n\nI am finding Linux a bit of a challenge.  How do I set the RAYPATH\nenvironment variable under the Bourne Again Shell (bash), and how do I set\nit as part of my login? I have discovered that if I change to the c-shell\n(csh) and follow the installation instructions, it works for that session.\nSimilarly the animation scripts in the old email archives work under csh,\nbut not under bash. Should/Can I set Linux to use the c-shell as standard?\nIs it worth the bother? Can anyone offer advise on the best way to go, or\nrefer me to good documentation sites.\n\nNot being familiar with either language, and because of its cross-platform\nsupport, I have been reading up on Perl as an alternative for writing\nscripts to use with Radiance. Has anyone used Perl for animations and would\nthey be willing to share their efforts?\n\nMany thanks\n\nBruce Sounes\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Bruce Sounes", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<EF5077DDD024D411B6B100C0DFE0D9340DCC75@SERVER01>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 19 Jul 2002 14:28:17 +0100", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Linux installation"}
