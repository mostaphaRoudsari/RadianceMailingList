If there is a published\nstandard for Sketchup files, or something closely related (a higher-\nlevel output from Sketchup), that would be interesting to look at.\nOtherwise, you can try lobbying the developers to put a Radiance or\nMGF export option directly into their software, which is much easier\nto write than a translator.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Oct 24 08:19:50 2007"}
