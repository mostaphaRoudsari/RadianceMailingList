I could it in two ways: building up a model and measuring real behaviour and simulating it and comparing the datas, or look for someone else who did the same.\n\nCan you help me? Do you know about some pubblication having done this already ? It would be better it to be free of charge, but also if I (actually my university) has to pay for it, it could be great!\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nHave good time :)\n\nLucio\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "loscotec@libero.it", "datetime": "Tue Oct 30 04:58:12 2007"}
