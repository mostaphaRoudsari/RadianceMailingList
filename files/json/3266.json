I think there may\nneed to\nsome technique to model cylindrical light sources.\n\nActually, I'm modeling UV lamp emitting only ultraviolet wavelength\nin small equipments.\nSo the cylindrical black light source was defined to have only blue\nradiation (for an alternative to UV). Of course all the materials have\nreflectance values only for blue radiation.\nI want to find the UV intensity on some surfaces, and I think Radiance is\nwell organized to calculate this value, but I'm not sure if\nthere is anything to consider like that cylindrical light source is not good\nin Radiance.\nI really appreciate if I get some advices on my case.\n\nMinki, Sung\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071031/31f767dd/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Minki Sung", "datetime": "Tue Oct 30 19:45:48 2007"}
