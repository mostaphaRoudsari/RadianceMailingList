The Radiance export took about 13 mins on a\n2.16GHz C2D MB (2Gb RAM).  The exported rad file was of size 13Mb and\ncontained 60278 polygons.  For comparison, exporting the same model\nto Radiance via 3DS (& MGF) was much quicker but gave a rad file of\nsize 38Mb with 188043 polygons (because of the conversion to\ntriangles, of course).\n\nThe smaller rad file did produce a number of \"non-planar vertex\"\nwarnings (as one might expect).  I haven't tried out the model much\nsince I would need to first change all the material colours in SU to\nmatch the scheme used for the layers.\n\nHats off to TB for this very handy utility!\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mardaljevic John", "datetime": "Thu Nov  1 09:18:39 2007"}
