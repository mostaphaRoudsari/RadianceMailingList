{"body": "\nHi Christoph !\n\nFor some reasons this is an intersting topic for me, too, although I\ndon't know much about rtrace (never used it so far, I'm working only\nwith rpict/rview).\n\nUnder what circumstances did you perform the calculation ? Direct light\nonly, or ambient light also? Which were your parameter settings (direct\nand ambient ?) Did you perform several consecutive runs with rtrace to\nget a mean value ?  For this, parameters have to be changed slightly to\n\"trick\" the internal random generators, otherwise you simply would get\nthe same result again. From my answer so far you can imagine where my\nthoughts are heading at: Within the algorithms, a lot of random\nfluctuation, ray direction jittering etc. is performed. This leads to\nnoticeable deviations of results. (In a comparison experiment, I once\nobserved relative brightness differences between 0 and 8% throughout the\nmain part of an image, near one shadow boundary up to 18% and higher,\nfor two runs of the same scene).\n\n\nCarsten\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3D386857.E07C609C@t-online.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 19 Jul 2002 21:28:23 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] visual transmittanceReferences: <FF93BF7E67F5D511859B0004AC3696C002F3B823@nrcmrdex1b.imsb.nrc.ca>"}
