We also do not know the scene. Can you provide\nus both with a sketch (e.g. wireframe screenshot or hand drawing) and an\nimage showing the noise, both low res and/or an a website? Usually you\ncan improve the visual quality by either setting higher values for the\nambient parameters or using workarounds as mkillum.\n\nOne other hint. Create a rif file and render using rad. That will help a\nlot at the beginning, as rad will set some parameters for your scene\n(and you can display those).\n\n\nGood luck! CU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Noise free rendering of simple sun/sky sc", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Thu Nov  8 07:21:12 2007"}
