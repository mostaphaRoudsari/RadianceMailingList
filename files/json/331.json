Here's a snippet from an old\nemail exchange between Greg & I:\n\n\" ... I got very annoyed about the avlmemi bug after the workshop,\nthinking about these things that have been dogging me for so many years,\nso I did a little investigation on the OS X version, where to my horror\nthe same problem had come up, again.  Fortunately, I had an easily\nreproduced error, so I was able to do a little experimentation.  All\nthese years, I thought it was a bug in the qsort(3) library routine, but\non further testing, I couldn't get it to fail, so I started to look\nelsewhere.  As it turned out, it wasn't the qsort() function itself,\nrather it was the comparison function I was giving it in ambient.c.  I\nwas comparing two pointers using pointer arithmetic, using an expression\nthat works with most compilers, but apparently not GNU-C!  In the end,\nit was a single word that needed to be changed to rid me of this bug\nthat's been hanging on for at least 6 years, since the first Linux\nsystems came into widespread use.\"\n\nThere you go.  Maybe I saved Greg some typing.\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Jan 2003 12:54:54 -0500"}
