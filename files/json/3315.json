{"body": "\nIMHO, HDRI may or may not require the color reproduction and\nsaturation to be as accurate or appealing.  IIt seems to me that, in\ngeneral, saturation and color issues are less important when using a\nHDRI for image-based lighting than when using the technique of\nconverting a sequence of LDRI to a single HDRI for increased dynamic\nrange in a tone-mapped photograph, where the final output will be an\nimage of the scene as opposed to a light probe image for IBL.\n\nCould hdrgen/Photosphere possibly benefit from more control over tone-\nmapping in a way similar to the CameraRaw presents options for\nexposing a RAW image?  If the use of HDRI for general photography\n(which I am really getting interested in, BTW) would other users find\nit useful to expand the ability of hdrgen/Photosphere to present the\nuser more control over the tone mapping process?  This kind of\ndiscussion could probably fill a whole new forum, and I would be all\nfor it, if it is not too much of a hassle.\n\nInteresting as always!\n\nkirk\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
