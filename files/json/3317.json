{"body": "\nHi Kirk,\n\nPeter is quick.  He has just set up a new mailing list, hdri@radiance-\nonline.org, which I suggest you subscribe to and we will move the\ndiscussion there.\n\nHDRI generation is a separate issue from tone-mapping, and although\nPhotosphere attempts to do both, it only makes a weak effort in the\ntone-mapping department.  Hdrgen makes no effort to tone-map images,\nand it should not.  In fact, I don't recommend tone-mapping HDR\nimages into HDR, but directly into the destination display's color\nspace, as an HDR image should maintain it's scene-referred color\nspace.  Some of these issues are discussed and spelled out on\nhdrsoft's excellent FAQ page:\n\nhttp://www.hdrsoft.com/resources/dri.html\n\nSince you bring up RAW (also discussed by hdrsoft), I should mention\nthat although it is tempting to shoot RAW in preparation for creating\nHDR images, I have found it not to be helpful in most cases.  The\nadditional range/resolution obtained is modest, and the confusion\nresulting from the many \"development\" options you mention means that\nreproducibility is an issue.  Unless you have a method to go straight\nfrom RAW into HDRI, you are better off shooting high-quality JPEGs on\nmost cameras.\n\nI'll make an announcement under a new topic about the HDRI mailing\nlist, and let's continue the discussion there.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR", "sender": "Gregory J.
