For example when I point the \"camera\" straight into an\nRGB = 1 W/(m^2 * sr) sky dome I get radiances of 0.9941 (although that\nmay be due to finite precision in the .hdr file format).\n\nSeeing that you are from Denmark (as well) I took the liberty to call\nyou on the phone (your company switchboard informed me you were away on\ntravel) ... if you feel like discussing some of these things (not that I\nnecessarily have the answer to your problem) we can contact each other\nwhen you get back.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\nChristian Anker Hviid wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: cbm.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 391 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071122/18071e90/cbm.vcf\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<OF0F60BC27.3F355349-ONC1257396.0054D037-C1257396.0054D03F@birch-krogboe.dk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Claus B.
