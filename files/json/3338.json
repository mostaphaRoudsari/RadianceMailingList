{"body": "\nDear all:\n\nI am trying to use Radiance on a super computer of\nour university. The super computer has 128 CPUs,\nand it should be very fast. But I found the rendering\nspeed is almost the same as my notepad. A stuff of\nthe super computer center tried to analysis the rendering\nprocess, and found out that most time was not taken by\ncomputation, but by outputing data to files. I think\nwriting data to the .unf file must take a lot of time.\nIs there any way to solve this problem?\n\nYours,\nHuang\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Huangwx", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000401c61d5e$e9275c40$1f7af90a@hwxin>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 20 22:32:50 2006", "email": "ap.huangwx at archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] output to .unf fileReferences: <200601131106.k0DB6HdC019146@omls-1a.kuins.net>"}
