Check the man page for rpiece and ask your system administrator to help you set up a batch file for it.\n\nRview and rtrace are not parallized at this time, I believe.\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Thu 1/19/2006 7:23 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nDear all:\n\nI am trying to use Radiance on a super computer of\nour university. The super computer has 128 CPUs,\nand it should be very fast. But I found the rendering\nspeed is almost the same as my notepad. A stuff of\nthe super computer center tried to analysis the rendering\nprocess, and found out that most time was not taken by\ncomputation, but by outputing data to files. I think\nwriting data to the .unf file must take a lot of time.\nIs there any way to solve this problem?\n\nYours,\nHuang\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 4555 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060120/21a99df3/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Huangw", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C234AFF@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 20 22:50:07 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Huangwx", "subject": "[Radiance-general] output to .unf file"}
