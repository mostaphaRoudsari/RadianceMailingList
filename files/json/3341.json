The script could\njust\ncheck if next to the component's \".skp\" file another file with \".rad\"\nand \".dat\" extension exists and copy these files instead of exporting\nthe actual component geometry.\n\nIES support then would require you to create a Radiance file for the\nfitting (with geometry and correct \".dat\" file path), the \".dat\" file\nand a Sketchup component to represent the fitting in the scene. When\nyou load and use the component it gets replaced with the Radiance files\non the fly. Other options like dimming could be shoehorned into this\nprocess as well.\n\n\nIs there more than one way of handling an instance in Sketchup?\n\n\nUpdate for those who've faithfully read this far:\n\nI have created a google code project for this script:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/su2rad/\n\nThe download package is still at the last 'release' stage\nbut the SVN repository has the hot new features\n* export by layer\n* export by colour and\n* import with contour lines\n\nAs usual it hasn't seen a lot of testing yet.\n\n\nCheers,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sketchup exporter script", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon Nov 26 14:43:30 2007"}
