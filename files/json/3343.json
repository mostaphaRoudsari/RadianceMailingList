But I don't think that's\npossible on a managed cluster. (Perhaps there is a /tmp FS\nlocal to each cluster node?) But you still have to share\nyour ambient data (in the day.amb file) across all nodes to\nget the real benefit of multiple cpus.\n\nGiven your settings your need for render speed is _not_\nrender quality (pretty low). As well your image dimensions\nare small. What are you trying to render in the end?\nIf it's an animation you could use \"ranimate\" to distribute\nframe rendering to separate nodes explicitly.\n\n\nYou should share your ambient data (in the \"day.amb\" file)\nbetween all nodes to get the benefit of multiple CPUs and to\navoid variations between frames or image parts. If this slows\ndown your system don't use the \"-af day.amb\" option and\nrpict will use the memory during calculations (on each node\nseparately).\n\nThe image data is written to STDOUT by rpict. If you can\nredirect to a local FS on each node you don't have to use NFS\nall the time (like I said \"/tmp\" may be a local FS on each node).\nDon't forget to copy the final image to your NFS area, though.\nI use RAM discs when I have do create a lot of small files\nfor a short time only. Speed has not been a consideration,\nonly HD movements and noise.\n\nYour settings for reference. You should provide information\nabout your rendering setup (which commands, control files)\nand what you actually want to do (BIG image vs. animation vs.\nhigh detail rendering) on the cluster, too.\n\n\nHTH,\n\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] output to .unf file", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C656278B-2111-4808-9AB3-FBD78A00D8B0@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<200601141823.k0EINsdC025902@omls-1a.kuins.net>", "<001001c61fe1$bd848880$1f7af90a@hwxin>"], "datetime": "Mon Jan 23 11:19:28 2006", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] output to .unf file"}
