I\nmight be completely wrong on what I am saying. If so, please correct me and\ngive suggestions.\n\n\n\nMy aim here is to render some before and after images for analysis of\ndaylight. I want to show existing and proposed conditions (annual)\nirradiation maps using \"radmap\" tool.\n\nThe weather file that I am using is TMY2 .epw I used following to render\nexisting and proposed irradiation maps with \"radmap\" command:\nradmap -s 8 -a 40.8 -o 73.9 -m 57  -n 1 -w WeatherTMT2.epw --no-albedo\n--viewfile viewfile --radfile test.rad  -x 2048 -y 2048\n--keep-temporary-maps --sky-resolution 1024 --max-kWh 500 --max-MJ 150\n\n\nAs a result, I get irradiation maps in which the orientation of the shading\nlooks out by about 90deg (area on north/northwest looks brighter than\neast/southeast).\n\n-          Am I using the correct weather data or parameters?\n\n-          I would also like to use the rpict options to get better\nrendering, but whenever I specify the --optionfile   it says,\n\no        View file to be used: viewfile\n\no        Option file to be used: viewfile\n\no        Do I have to specify the rpict options on the viewfile?\n\n-          Anyone using Radmap for Daylight simulation who could further\nhelp me?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n\nPrasanta\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071129/df831c6f/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Prasanta Bhattarai", "datetime": "Thu Nov 29 14:34:19 2007"}
