{"body": "\nThis is not a Radiance-specific post, but an interesting little app\nthat I came across - as a lot of us model things in 3D, I thought the\nPC (XP to be exact) users among us might give it a whirl and let us\nMac users know how cool this is.\n\nhttp://ogle.eyebeamresearch.org/\n\nThe app logs the 3D data passed through the OpenGL DLL and \"captures\"\nthe 3D data, essentially creating a 3D screen grab of any OpenGL 3D\nobject you may come across.  It appears that you can then import the\nobject into a 3D app like Maya and proceed as usual.\n\nkirk\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kirk Thibault", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<18242034-BF3D-4F03-B2C9-8FB9BEB55042@biomechanicsinc.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jan 25 04:35:22 2006", "email": "kthibault at biomechanicsinc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OGLE - OpenGL capture"}
