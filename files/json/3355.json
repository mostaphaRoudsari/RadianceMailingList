Anyone can let me know which would be the best way to model it. Some questions I have regarding this are:\n\n- Is there any material readily available that I can try to use and validate in my case? As I am not very expert in Radiance materials, this would help me to learn things.\n- Which Radiance material would define a 'prismatic diffuser' well ?\n- Is there any good reference or text to understand well the Trans, Transdata, BRTDFunc etc. etc. diffuser related matters ??\n\nAny suggestion would be fine ....\n\nThanks,\nSharif\n-------------- next part --------------\nSkipped content of type multipart/related\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Shariful Shikder", "datetime": "Wed Dec  5 02:11:08 2007"}
