The\nresult would be a complex number, but of course this doesn't work\nsince a real result is required.\n\nYou can play with values using the \"icalc\" program, and it is even\npossible to debug a function file to some degree using the \"debugcal\"\nscript, which uses rtrace to assign the variables described in\nrayinit.cal.\n\nGood luck,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illegal Power warning", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Dec  5 10:45:54 2007"}
