The x, y, and z values are not defined globally.\nSee the attached .cal file as a simple example of how this is done.\n\nIf your refllection color changes as a function of angle, you need to\nstick with the BRTDfunc type, as metfunc only offers a single color\nfor highlights.  Keep in mind also that Radiance cannot calculate\ndirectional-diffuse components for anything other than highlights\n(i.e., light source reflections).  This is a limitation in Radiance's\nability to sample BSDFs in general, and has been covered previously\nin numerous posts.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: tim1.cal\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 692 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071206/7def94d6/tim1.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illegal Power warning", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Dec  6 09:54:47 2007"}
