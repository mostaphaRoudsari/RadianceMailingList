This sun displacement inaccuracy becomes less important\nwith bigger weather datasets, but for one month of hourly data it is\ninevitable.\n\nEnsure to use the -dt 0 option to account for all suns. It should\nbe on by default, and for the December month it should not do much\ndifference, but when evaluating annual cumulative irradiation\nit becomes important.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE:  Radmap: to produce irradiation ma", "tags": [], "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "datetime": "Mon Dec 10 15:04:36 2007"}
