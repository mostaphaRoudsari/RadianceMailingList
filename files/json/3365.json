Writing the function file was dead\nsimple thanks to the really powerfull and well-designed function file\nframework.\n\nI have used colorpict to modify a plastic material with parameters (1 1\n1 0 0), i.e. a perfect diffuse reflector. My function file tells\ncolorpict what uv coordinates to use for a given ray.\n\nMy question/problem is: how to handle the ray intersection points that\ndo not map to a pixel in the back projected image (i.e., points that are\noutside the field-of-view of the original image). The attached image\nclearly shows how the top and bottom image lines, and left and right\nimage columns get smeared across the geometry because I am computing uv\ncoordinates which in fact are outside the image bounds.\n\nWhat I really want is to be able to return a controlled (constant) RGB\nvalue for all uv coords falling outside the image bounds.\n\nSuggestions, anyone?\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: toprightview.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 20797 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071213/173730e3/toprightview-0001.jpg\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: input.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 39575 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071213/173730e3/input-0001.jpg\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: cbm.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 391 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071213/173730e3/cbm-0001.vcf\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Claus B.
