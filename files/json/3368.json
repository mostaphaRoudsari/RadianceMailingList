I have an HDRShop 2.0 license for\nacademic purposes and I havetried to install it on my new Windows Vista\nmachine. No luck. I get an error message from Microsoft Foundation Class\n... I have tried to contact the USC people behind HDRShop, but so far no\nresponse. Then I thought \"hey, maybe some of the Radiance users know\nsomething ...\"\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Claus B.
