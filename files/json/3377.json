The goal is to produce the\ncorrect result on average in a reasonably unbiased estimation\nprocess, rather than producing the same systematically inaccurate\nresult each time, as would be produced by a completely deterministic\nalgorithm.\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] REALLY STRANGE", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Dec 28 15:55:12 2007"}
