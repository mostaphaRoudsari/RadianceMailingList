{"body": "\nHi,\n\nits an iteresting coincidence that this question is asked right now. I\ndid spend some work on this, too, however tackling the topic from a\ncompletely different, namely the aesthetical/visualisation point of\nview.

As Rob already pointed out, this doesn't have to\nbe a 1000-entry catalogue, just a set of examples which covers usual\napplications and, more important, offers a guideline to the matter for\neach user to create new descriptions fitting the individual needs.\nApplying a material description to an object is already difficult enough\nwithin Radiance :), but this is another matter..\n\n-cb\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3D4AE0CD.B93623FD@t-online.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 02 Aug 2002 21:43:09 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] An open materials library?References: <3D4A6B25.4219.458CA0@localhost>"}
