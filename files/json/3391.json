I tried ranaming it and dialux doesn't manage it properly (it gives preview in windows' explorer but it doesn't import it.\n\nAnd I tried to export lights from dialux's database in .ies format, but I didn't find the command. Where is it? is it just to export luminaries  not from databases ? Do I need a plugin?\n\nThank you in advance\n\nLucio Boscolo\n\n\n..
