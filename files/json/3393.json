{"body": "\nHi Will,\n\nThe spotlight type is designed to make the calculation more efficient\nby avoiding testing for light sources that don't stand to make a\ncontribution.  If you used the regular \"light\" type with a narrow\nspot fixture, it would check for source visibility at all angles,\nonly finding out the contribution was zero afterwards.  Using the\nspotlight source, you can preempt this test for angles past the\nnormal cut-off of the fixture.\n\nThis is less important since the introduction of adaptive shadow ray\ntesting way back in 1991, but it was left in there for legacy reasons\nand because the code is handy for the virtual light source handling,\nanyway.  (Long story.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] splitting a render by light sources - rtcontrib", "sender": "Gregory J.
