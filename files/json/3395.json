{"body": "\nHi Will,\n\nThe reason you are seeing jagged edges to your spot is because the\ndefault \"direct jitter\" or \"-dj\" setting for rtcontrib is 0.5.  (You\nmay discover all the default values by typing \"rtcontrib -\ndefaults\".)  For spotlight's, the edges can be particularly strong,\nand I don't generally recommend this type unless you couple it with a\nlight output distribution and set the cut-off past the natural cut-\noff of the fixture -- unless of course you are simply going for an\nartistic effect.\n\nThe -u+ option is recommended for rtcontrib, particularly when you\nare using it to render images, because the correlations between\nvalues will show up in odd ways on a 2-D image that would not be\nnoticeable in a 1-D sample sequence.  This is why your original\nrendering looks so odd.\n\nAs for the -e option of pfilt, it is used as an additional multiplier\nif auto-exposure is employed with the default -2 (pass) operation, so\nit is not completely overridden.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] splitting a render by light sources - rtcontrib", "sender": "Gregory J.
