I am an researcher in architecture, and I do not have good knowledge in programming.\n\nies2rad -dm -t default -m 1.0   TPH710_8xTL5-28W_827_865_HFR.ies\n\nxform -rx 90 -t 4.52 -0.05  1.455 TPH710_8xTL5-28W_827_865_HFR.rad > artificial light.rad\n\nand here is my script\n\n\"oconv env.rad lab_surfaces_corrected_moved.rad lab_windows_and_doors.rad artificial light.rad> lab.oct\",\n\"echo '4.52    0.85 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\n\n\"' | rtrace -w -af /tmp/bpi.amb -as 512 -ar 64 -aa 0.15 -ab 3 -I+ -h lab.oct | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179'\"\n\n]\n\nThank you very much,\n\nBest regards,\n\nSokol Dervishi\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nNever miss a thing.
