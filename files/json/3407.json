Else I would do that, and it could be  interesting for the whole community.\n\nSo ... it exists a tachnical report from  CIE which is titled \"Test cases to asses the accuracy of lighting computer programs\". Briefly, it contains some sets os cenes well described to be reproduced and computed in any software..\n\nIf nobody did those tests using radiance, it could be a nice goal for my thesys to complete them or some of them at least.. If somebody already did them, I'd like to look at them, if possible.\n\nAnd.. well.. do you think it could be interesting for everybody ?\n\nThank you\n\nLucio Boscolo\n\n..
