Imagemagick can do it as well as convert\nbetween image formats (it even reads radiance pictures). A very powerful tool\nto encode or convert video is ffmpeg, it has support for a lot of file\nformats (e.g. avi, mpg, mpg4, and images) and really lots of codecs (e.g.\nmpg, mpg4 / \"divx\", ...). You should really take a look at this!\n\n\nThat's how I used the projection:\n\nrpict -vta -vh 360 -vv 360 -vp 0 0 1.6 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf\n\nThe result will be not a fisheye, but a view to every angle, 360 degrees\nvertically as well as horizontally. So you might try:\n\nrpict -vta -vh 360 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 3 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf\n(angular fisheye)\n\nrpict -vth -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 3 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf\n(hemispherical fisheye)\n\nBut, I think you should simply try what you need, using the different\nprojections (that's how I do this ;-) And use man rpict - there is a lot of\ninfo...\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] animation format", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
