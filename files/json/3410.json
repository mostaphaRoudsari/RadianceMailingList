The shell will see \"artificial\"\nand \"light.rad\"\nas two file names to search for. Use \"artificial_light.rad\" instead.\n\n\nSuggestion: save your data point one per line in a file\n\"my_data_points.dat\"\nand read from the file. \"echo\" will do that, too.\n\n\nHope that helps and have fun,\nThomas\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nNever miss a thing.
