Have to remember....\n\nOne note to Bill: There are two ways: compiling yourself and installing\nprecompiled. I do not even know what way you went, because you did not\ntell us what package you downloaded where. There used to be compiled\nRadicance binaries for Solaris on the official site, but I am not sure\nfor which releases and platforms. So, as others already wrote, first get\ncompilers (you can get the optimized C compilers for free from Sun, do\nnot waste your time with gcc on a Solaris installation), than makeall\ninstall. I used to install into /opt/radiance-max.min on Solaris as this\nwas the way most packages where handled on my Sun.\n\nGood luch!
