This one is needed to build and install from sources.\n\nI do not know where the binaries got installed (I guess something like\nin /opt or /usr/local), but you should set RAYPATH, maybe PATH, and go\nusing radiance.\n\nIf you download the sources, you will need a compiler, make, maybe some\nother tools found on most systems, and run makeinstall. The contributer\nwho created the binary package already did this for you!\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re:  Radiance-general Digest, Vol 47, Issue 11", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
