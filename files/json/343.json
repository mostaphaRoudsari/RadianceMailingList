We plan\nto get a coordinated effort going on unifying the Radiance code for\nUnix and Windows, and will be asking others to help us at that time.\n\nHaving said that, you can safely ignore the \"aux.h\" file in src/common\n-- this must have come from some OpenGL toolkit that may have been used\nor needed at one time, but now is just flotsam in the code tree.  In\nfact, I eliminated this file since the 3.4 release, and it won't be\nfound in future releases.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Porting to Windows", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 11 Feb 2003 08:47:47 -0800"}
