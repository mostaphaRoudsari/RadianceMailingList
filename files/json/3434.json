{"body": "\ndear all:\n\nI am using a supercomputer which has 128 CPUs,\nand should be very fast. But I found the rendering\nspeed is almost the same as my notepad. A stuff of\nthe super computer said that most time was not\ntaken by computation, but by outputing data to\nfiles. I think writing data to the .unf file must take\na lot of time. The supercomputer uses NFS\nstorage, so maybe because it is too slow, the\nrendering cannot be finished quickly. If there is any\nway that radiance do not use the NFS storage\nduring rendering, but only the memory, I think the\nspeed could be greatly improved.\n\nThe rendering parameters in .opt file:\n-dp 256\n-ar 28\n-ms 2.6e+02\n-ds .3\n-dt .1\n-dc .5\n-dr 1\n-sj .7\n-st .1\n-ab 2\n-af day.amb\n-ad 329\n-as 42\n-av 0.36 0.36 0.36\n-lr 8\n-lw .002\n-st .001\n-dj .02\n-aa 0.25\nThe image size: 256x176\n\nThank you very much.\n\nYours,\nHuang.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Huangwx", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001001c61fe1$bd848880$1f7af90a@hwxin>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jan 23 06:58:07 2006", "email": "ap.huangwx at archi.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] output to .unf fileReferences: <200601141823.k0EINsdC025902@omls-1a.kuins.net>"}
