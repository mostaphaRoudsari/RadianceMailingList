On a Mac, you would need the \"professional\" version of\nQuickTime to do this, I think.\n\nRegarding a fish-eye lens, there are two types built into rpict --\nhemispherical and angular fisheye projections.  These are explained\n(along with everything else) in the rpict man page.  If you have\ntrouble looking at this from the distribution, try the website:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/whatis.html\n\nNote however that some of these will be out of date, since the website\nhas not been synchronized with the release in many a moon.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: animation format", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 11 Feb 2003 08:51:49 -0800"}
