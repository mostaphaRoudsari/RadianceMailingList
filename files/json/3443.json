Radiance is a lot of fun.\n\nBy the way, am I late to this Google Books party?  Greg & Rob S.,\nperhaps this is a good venue for RwR?  Apparently each author can decide\nhow much of the book to make browsable; maybe posting the tutorial\nchapters and the juicy chapters at the end could be of great use for the\ncommunity, and generate some hard copy sales as well?
