(Did not have time to update with latest files...) Hope this is useful.\n\nCheers,\nYC Huang\nCenter for Building Performance and Diagnostics\nCarnegie Mellon University\n_________________________________________________________________\nEasily manage multiple email accounts with Windows Live Mail!\nhttp://www.get.live.com/wl/all\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080122/cd0bf996/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "yijun huang", "datetime": "Tue Jan 22 12:14:28 2008"}
