Daysim will\ntherefore interpret all illuminance sensors as workplane sensors, i.e.\nDaysim assumes that the core workplane extends over all illuminance sensors\nin your lighting zone. (Note: To select a work plane sensor, go to\nANALYSIS>>'SPECIFY WORKPLANE'.) \"\n\nin my case i have selected two sensors , one at 2 meters and the other at a\ndepth of 6 meters ,among the 105 sensors. and when i hit the start day\nlighting analysis, daysim is treating all the sensors as work plane in spite\nof specifying them initially . this is   problem is giving me\nincorrect blind setting profile. could any one please suggest me an solution\nto this.\n\nthank you,\n\nregards,\n\n--\nAditya Potipireddi\nMS Building Design ( Energy & Climate)\nArizona State University\ntel. 480.544.4936\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080205/83590757/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "aditya potipireddi", "datetime": "Mon Feb  4 23:33:34 2008"}
