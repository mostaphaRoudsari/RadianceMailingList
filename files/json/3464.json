Since I presume you\ndon't have a 3-D display in mind, this leaves you with the problem of\nprojecting a hemisphere onto a flat image, which is bound to\nintroduce distortions.  I am attaching two Radiance .cal files, one\nthat goes from a vector direction to a Tregenza sky patch number as\nused by Daysim, and the other which performs the reverse\ntranslation.  It shouldn't be too difficult to convert these files\ninto something Matlab understands.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n(Beware line-wrapping -- you may need to paste these links manually.)\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ray/src/\ncal/cal/tregenza.cal?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ray/src/\ncal/cal/tregsrc.cal?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylight coefficients representation.", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Feb  6 16:57:00 2008"}
