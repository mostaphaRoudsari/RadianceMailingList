{"body": "\nHi there\n\nA third question from me today, but agian I thought it better to start a\nnew thread for this one too.\n\nFrom looking over the past posts it seems that something has been\nchanged in the Tcl/Tk language that means that the trad utility will no\nlonger run with more recent versions. Does anyone know with which\nversion of Tcl/Tk this issue frst raised its head? I've only tried the\nmost recent versions. I also tried to install the version I believe trad\nis meant to run under (Tcl 7.4, Tk 4) but the source for these no longer\nunder the new gcc! I'm pretty new to the linux system im running (fresh\nfrom windows) and I dont really know what I'm doing changing code, so I\nthought I'd appeal to this list for advice about any other front-ends\nfor Radiance. I'm aware of Rayfront, but unfortunately I dont have much\nbudget to spend on this project (it's my 4th year undergraduate\nEngineering degree final project) and I am hoping for a free version!\n\nThanks again for all your help\nWill\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "william reynolds", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43C92216.90308@oriel.ox.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Jan 14 17:53:00 2006", "email": "william.reynolds at oriel.ox.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trad - TclTk"}
