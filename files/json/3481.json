{"body": "\nFolks - I have been reading up on the basics of using UV mapping in\n3D modeling apps, in general to apply textures, etc. to complex 3D\nsurfaces with greater control.\n\nDoes anyone use UV mapping here with Radiance?  Is there some\nworkflow that has been developed to take a model from an external\nmodeling app (I use Lightwave) and export a model (with a UV map and\nan applied image map) into a format that supports such mapping\n(say .OBJ) and then bring the model and its UV map and corresponding\nimage map into Radiance?\n\nMaybe this technique is fairly straightforward or maybe it involves\nmore thought with respect to writing .cal files and such.\n\nThanks,\n\nkirk\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
