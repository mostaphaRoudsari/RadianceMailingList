The data for the shading material is:\nLight reflection (for both sides): 30%\nLight transmission:  23%\n\nIt is important to include the both parameter (transmission + reflection) in the study in order to clarify possible glare and in order to maximize daylight distribution to the room.\n\nMy question is: what material would be the best to use for the shading material in order to model this scene correctly and do I need to include skyfunc and illum for this?\n\nThank you in advance :)\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________\n\nPer Haugaard,\nGriffenfeldsgade 33, 2.tv\n2200 K?benhavn N\nDenmark\n\nmobil:  +45 26 39 06 40\nE-mail: perhaugaard@yahoo.dk\n\n---------------------------------\n\nTr?nger du til at se det store billede?
