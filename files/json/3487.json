You will also note that it will show\nversions for gcc, I believe that you need to install the same version\nnumber (in this case 4.1, but you should check what gcc you have installed).\n\nThe compile that I did is generic, that is I did not make any\narchitecture specific settings. So I would hope that this would run on a\nsimilar linux installation.\n\n-Jack\n\nloscotec@libero.it wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HEAD - Radiance on Ubuntu - 7.10", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Tue Feb 12 11:38:07 2008"}
