{"body": "\nGreg - thanks for the explanation and your dedication to staying\nahead of the curve and supporting all of the RADIANCE user communities.\n\nFrom what I read leading up to this release, it was clear that Apple\nwanted to finally move its laptops to the next level, hence the Intel\nchipset.  I have a feeling that, as with most things Apple, there\nwill be issues - but the Apple faithful (me included) are willing to\nbe beta testers and see the bugginess as a badge of honor in some\nconvoluted way (paying money to be a beta tester will do that to your\nrationalizing psyche I suppose).  It is weird to mention Apple and\nIntel as complements, but I think all Mac users (again, me included)\nrealize Apple's shortcomings, even if we tend to defend the brand to\nthe death.\n\nAs Rob said:\n\n\nI imagine that a 17\" version of the Intel dual core laptop can;t be\nfar behind, given the performance-oriented, graphics-driven market\nthe new platform will benefit.....  Wouldn't it be interesting if\nApple offered a 17\" HDR display laptop someday? [wink]\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
