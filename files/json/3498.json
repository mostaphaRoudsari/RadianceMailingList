Sorry for that ...  :-(\n\n\nBTW, I'd like to say thanks to all people here for this amazing and very\nkind team of experts in a fantastic software like RADIANCE.\nAnd thank you specially for your great job!\n\nRegards from Brazil,\n\nVangelis\n\nPS: I'm an architect, I was born in Greece and living in Brazil for a long\ntime.\nI'm writing my PHD thesis about Real-time interactive visualization of\nGlobal illumination in the process of building design.\nAnd I'd appreciate to talk about it if anyone else wants to go over the\ntheme.\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMessage-ID: <1203015365.14737.8.camel@evangelos-desktop>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n\nDear sirs.,\n\nI have a strange problem with command \"genbox\" running Ubuntu 7.10.\nIts asking to install GROMACS application when I call the Radiance\ncommand genbox!!!!\n\nAny help, pD:ease?\n\nthank you,\n\nVangelis\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nMessage-ID: <25684765-33CE-473D-B638-8F3EA3DE7A8D@lmi.net>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; delsp=yes; format=flowed\n\nI think there may be a name collision.  Enter \"which genbox\" and if\nit doesn't point to the Radiance installed one, then it's something\nelse.  You can re-order your PATH environment variable to pick up the\nRadiance one first.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 48, Issue 13\n************************************************\n\n__________ Informagco do NOD32 IMON 2759 (20080101) __________\n\nEsta mensagem foi verificada pelo NOD32 sistema antivmrus\nhttp://www.eset.com.br\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<20080214195653.3793B538246@C2B3-POP3.unb.br>", "tags": [], "sender": "gward@lmi.net", "datetime": "Thu, 14 Feb 2008 11:06:43 -0800"}
