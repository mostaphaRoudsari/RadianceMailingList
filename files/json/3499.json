I am getting some quite hight DF (21% and 32%) 1 meter from the facade which I think are not realistic.\n\nBelow is the  model and  data I used to perform the calculation (I am so sorry for the length of this mail):\n\nThe dimension of the room are: (w x h x d) 4 x 3 x 16,8 m\nReflectance inside the room are: Walls: 0,7, ceiling: 0,8, floor: 0,3\nThe dimension of the window are: (w x h) 1,8 x  2,0 m\nThe window is placed 0,1 m below the ceiling in the middle of the wall facing.\n\nSome of the date used in Radiance:\n\n# LightShelve\nvoid trans refl_white\n0\n0\n7  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.950 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n# Lamella VSG 12/12 60% light gray printing\nvoid trans printed_glass\n0\n0\n7  0.359 0.359 0.359 0.080 0.000 0.939 0.600\n\n# The window\nvoid glass window_glass\n0\n0\n3 .87 .87 .87\n\n# SkiCIE for Olso\ngensky 6 21 12 -c -a 59.9 -o 10.8 -m -15.00\n\n# Outside\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\nskyfunc glow ground_glow\n0\n0\n4 1.4 .9 .6 0\n\nground_glow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180\n\nvoid plastic ground_mat\n0\n0\n5 .28 .18 .12 0 0\n\nground_mat ring groundplane\n0\n0\n8\n0       0       -.01\n0       0       1\n0       30\n\nThe lamellas are placed perpendicular to the window and the lightshelve is placed 0,5 m below the top of the window. The lamellas are placed on the exterior side of the pane and are used as shading on sunny days. The lightshelves are placed both on the interior and exterior side of the window., hence used as shading and to lead the daylight further into the room.\n\nHereafter I have initiated:\n\noconv SkyCIE.rad outside.rad office.mat office.rad window.rad LightShelve_ret.rad Lamella_ret.rad > DF_OfficeLL.oct\n\nand\n\nrtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 15 -aa 0.2 -ad 512 -as 0 -ar 128 DF_OfficeLL.oct < DFcoordinates.inp | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179/10000*100'\n\nDo the above defined 'rtrace' and 'rcalc' function take fully account for both interreflections between the lamellas?\n\nCan anybody spot why I get the unrealistically hight DFs (or are they unrealistic?) for the office with (21%) the lightshelve and lamellas and without (32%) these two ad ons.\n\nI appreciate any help :)\n\n\nBest regards\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n______________________\nPer Haugaard,\nGriffenfeldsgade 33, 2.tv\n2200 K?benhavn N\nDenmark\n\nmobil:  +45 26 39 06 40\nE-mail: perhaugaard@yahoo.dk\n\n\n\n\n\nTr?nger du til at se det store billede?
