{"body": "\nWith programs like 3DWin by Thomas Baier (PC-only), file conversion should\nnot really be a problem.\n\nWhat you say about polygonising everything is true. Only when using file\nformats that support other kinds of geometry (NURBS, Bezier-patches,\nCSG-constructs) then you'll be able to have the most economic conversion.\nThere is no \"general 3D-file format\" at the moment, so unless you can write\na plug-in for your software directly, you'll have to live with these\nlimitations...\n\nIf we could get the software-firms aware of the importance of Radiance, then\nthey could write export-plugins with a much better support of the\nradiance-primitives.\n\nRadiance is however capable of rendering files with a lot of polygons. It is\nnot the fastest way, but it'll get you there.\n\nI use the ConRAD-program from Ole Lemming and most models come through. It\nis not unlikely that these models generate octrees of more then 100MB, which\ntakes time... but the results are OK.\n\n--- stefkeB ---\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "stefke b", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<F4J2TUSzbAUfKRfcjcM000000f2@hotmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 24 Jul 2001 18:12:31 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 3DS to RAD"}
