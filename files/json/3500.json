While this is fine, you do need to tell\ngensky the output of the desired sky explicitly. To do this you can use\nthe -B switch and provide the horizontal diffuse irradiance. This can be\ncalculated as 10,000/179 = 55.866 w/m^2. With this your gensky line\nshould read:\n\ngensky 6 21 12 -c -a 59.9 -o 10.8 -m -15.00 -B 55.866\n\nWith this you should get some different results in your rcalc.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nPS: for further reading on this you should take a look at Chapter 6:\nDaylighting Simulation in /Rendering with Radiance/, this chapter is by\nJohn Mardaljevic.\n\n\nPer Haugaard wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080215/3477b8c4/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Calculating daylight factors", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Fri Feb 15 05:18:27 2008"}
