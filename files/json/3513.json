When I run oconv or getbbox on your scene file I get 28 warnings like this one:\n\ngetbbox: warning - zero area for polygon \"zone02.rad00000\"\n\nLooking at polygon zone02.rad00000 I find a valid polygon description but I guess Radiance has some limitation with regards to geometry. Are you sure you are modelling in the correct scale?\n\nRegards,\nErwin\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nTo:      radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "datetime": "Tue Feb 19 05:16:27 2008"}
