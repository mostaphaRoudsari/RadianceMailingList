{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI am pleased to announce quite a bucket load of improvements to WebHDR.\n\nFor those of you who are unaware of WebHDR: It's a web-based package on\ntop of Greg's hdrgen, allowing you to generate HDR images on-line. We use\nit for teaching purposes on our Masters course.\n\nHere are the improvements:\n- interactive Luminance Map\n- demo mode\n- updates/corrections everywhere\n- facilitates Response Curve Calibration and Absolute Luminance Calibration\n- output of tone-mapped JPEG\n- gallery page\n- option to remove lens flare\n- histograms are generated for every uploaded image\n- 'Test your camera' page to make sure your camera is supported by WebHDR\n- now supports more cameras than Greg's hdrgen\n\nPlease do give it a try. If you don't have an exposure bracketed sequence\nat hand, please upload any old picture to the Camera Test page to help me\nimprove the software. Your uploads are completely anonymous.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] WebHDR - update", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10173.213.58.97.130.1136857589.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<2C0020B9EB71CE4281B292F0E16A6DDE7FC742@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>\t<61FE56DB-9427-4AB0-B590-95D4FF32EC3D@gmail.com>\t<43C29B3A.9090603@visarc.com>\t<4020F2F5-CD73-47A9-833F-7C143383D546@gmail.com>\t<43C2CA2E.7060007@visarc.com>", "<10237.213.58.97.130.1136840394.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>", "<43C2DB1A.9060805@visarc.com>", "<10152.213.58.97.130.1136855477.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>", "<9A2582E8-5E0C-4C16-8EF8-2511E96F5196@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jan 10 02:54:13 2006", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] WebHDR - update"}
