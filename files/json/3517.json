I know there are places where formatting limits the number of\nsignificant figures produced in the scene files, but xform at least\ntries not to lose too much.  I also know that a frozen octree\nconverts the 64-bit floating point value to a 32-bit mantissa (with\nsign bit) and an 8-bit exponent, which maintains about 9 significant\ndecimal digits.  If what matters to you is in the 8th or 9th decimal\nplace, you're in dangerous territory.  (By comparison, a 64-bit IEEE\ndouble has about 15 significant digits.)\n\nSo, I agree with Erwin's recommendation of applying xform in cases\nwhere you are starting to strain your significant digits,\nparticularly if you are putting your scene into a frozen octree.  It\nis also a good idea to work in world units that don't make your\ncoordinate values too large or too small (large being on the order of\n10^8 and small being on the order of 10^-4).\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: Re-2: [Radiance-general] ecotect export - missing surfaces", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Feb 20 09:23:54 2008"}
