One other thing to check is taht typically when you're in\nUbuntu Bash or Dash is the default shell. I usually run into problems when\nrunning makeall for radiance in either of these two shells, so try using Csh\ninstead while compiling.\n\nHope that helps!\nDave\n\n2008/2/25 aditya potipireddi <aditect@gmail.com>:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080226/0ea24a43/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] adiance on Ubuntu7.10", "tags": [], "sender": "David Maino", "datetime": "Tue Feb 26 06:57:58 2008"}
