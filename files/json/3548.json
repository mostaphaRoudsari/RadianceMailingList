The following problems occured:\n\n***\nPage 55 - I defined brown_satin_paint in the material1.rad file like what the book suggested in P.46.  When I tried to use the function \"oconv\", however, the following line appears:\n\noconv: warning - (!genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_nw 4 ...... 0 0 2.5): empty file\n\nPage 55 - When I ran the \"rview\" function, either one of the following lines appeared:\n\nUnknown option argument: \"-10\"\nUnknown option argument: \"-av\"\n***\n\nIs it that Radiance commands have been revised and the book becomes obsolete, or have I not installed the program properly (I run it in Fedora)?  Any suggestions on how I can learn Radiance more effectively?\n\nThanks a lot for your help!!\n\nKam\n\n\n\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner@radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

Sounds like\nyou're running Windows, in which case you might want to check out\nDesktop Radiance, which is a windows version of an older variant of\nRadiance running behind an Autocad GUI. Francesco Anselmo (a regular on\nthis list) also maintains a set of Windows binaries based on the latest\nversion of Radiance, but unfortunately that one does not include any of\nthe graphical programs that you really need to start learning and using\nRadiance.\n\nBe advised, there is no \"radiance.exe\" that you double-click and get a\nsplash screen and a menu. Radiance is more of a collection of programs\nthat you can string together to get various results. It's far from\nintuitive, but it is the most capable lighting visualization/simulation\noption out there.
