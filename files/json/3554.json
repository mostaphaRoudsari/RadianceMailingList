I have a 3D model of the scene, I know the\ncamera position and orientation relative to the scene, and from the\ncamera I get the \"measured reflected radiances\". Given the per-pixel\nnormal information I have developed a method for estimating the\nillumination conditions in the scene ... makes sense?\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\nLars O.
