As suggested, a command like this:\n\nvwrays -ff scene.pic | rtrace -h -w -fff -on scene.oct > norm.dat\n\nwill write out a binary file of the normal at intersection for each\npixel.\n\nI'll own up to being intrigued.  The derivation of the \"illumination\nconditions\" at the pixel will be confounded by any deviation that the\nscene materials have from pure diffuse reflector.  In any case,\nyou'll need to know what those diffuse reflectances are on a per\npixel basis.  Can you expand a little on your method?\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Fri Mar 14 08:54:54 2008"}
