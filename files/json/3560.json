I'm a quite new user of Radiance and I'm\ninterested in energy performance of buildings. I would like to know if\nit is possible to calculate the performance of a shading system\n(venetian blinds, light shelf, etc.) in terms of reducing solar\nradiation. Does Radiance consider all the spectrum in calculating\nirradiance? My aim is to try different shading systems in a office\nroom and to analyse their bahaviour in terms of shading coefficient.\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance,\nValeria\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Valeria De Giuli", "datetime": "Mon Mar 17 07:57:33 2008"}
