{"body": "\nDear Alex,\n\nI am resending to the group since this might be of wider interest.\n\nA new Daysim version will be out within the next two weeks that should\nequally work under Windows and Linux. We had a really inspiring 3 day\nworkshop on Ecotect/Radiance/Daysim at MIT last week, and I learnt from\nover 30 individuals first-hand what can go wrong during a Daysim\ninstallation. I have put in some more tests to make sure that the new\nrelease will install properly. During the workshop, we used a beta\nversion of Ecotect ver5.5 that Andrew Marsh kindly provided for workshop\nparticipants. I can assure all of you that Andrew did a splendid job\nwith the new interface. The new Ecotect release should help to\nconsiderably widen the Radiance community. He put in a direct export\ninto Daysim so that it becomes easier to use as well.\n\nChristoph\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Axel\nJacobs\nSent: Monday, February 06, 2006 10:26 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi Jan, Christoph,\n\n\nprobability)\n3.7P2\n\n\nI was wondering if you guys are working on a new release of DaySim that\nfixes some of the LINUX problems:\n- only Java 1.4.1, not 1.5\n- rtrace_dc doesn't compile\n- dangerous permissions of all installed files\n- ...\n\nJust can't get it to work...\n\nThere is a 2.1 out for Windows, but not for LINUX.\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C396201423EF5@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Feb  6 16:39:01 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Download site forevalglare,photon-mapping and gendaylit"}
