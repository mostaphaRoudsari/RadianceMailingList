Thank you.\n\nCan you please explain how the \"planospheric\" fisheye projecting differs from the \"-vta\" angular fisheye project with \"-vh 180\"?\n\nThanks,\n-Chas\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMessage: 1\nMessage-ID:\n<100441490803161533r25c1f9d5o56744b255cfa18bc@mail.gmail.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nDear all,\n\nGreg was kind enough to leave this announcement to me, since it was me\nwho has been giving him a hard time over it. Thanks for implementing\nthis, Greg!\n\nSo here we go:\n\nI have the honor to announce a new fisheye view type for Radiance. It\nis called the 'stereographic' or 'planispheric' projection. It is\nparticularly useful for sun path diagrams, as commonly used in\ndaylighting and overshadowing studies. Yes, it's true: no more messin'\nabout with .cal files--it's a native implementation. The option to\nrvu/rpict/trace is -vts.\n\nI've put together a little comparison of the three fisheye views:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/projections.pdf\nThis will eventually be merged into the Advanced Tutorial, but I don't\nhave the time for this right now.\n\nIf you feel like doing a little exercise with pen and paper (like our\nstudents do), get a sun path diagram from here:\nhttp://luxal.eu/resources/daylighting/sunpath.shtml,\n\nand follow Andrew's the instructions on the SquareOne web site:\nhttp://squ1.org/wiki/Sun-Path/Overshadowing\n\nGood projections to you all\n\nAxel\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080317/50e7b282/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "jacobs.axel@gmail.com", "datetime": "Sun, 16 Mar 2008 22:33:23 +0000"}
