{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI am curious if there is a way to estimate material\nroughness/specularity based on gloss specifications. PPG provides a\ngloss range for its factory applied metal coatings (such as DURANAR).\nThe way they indicate this is as a range at a given measurement angle,\nfor example:\n\n25% to 35%  at 60 degrees\n\nThis is according to the ASTM-D523 - Specular Gloss.\n\nIs there some way to make this meaningful as a part of a radiance\nmaterial specification?\n\nThanks,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060206/94239d00/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43E77E19.5040802@visarc.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Feb  6 17:51:15 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gloss specifications to roughness/specularity"}
