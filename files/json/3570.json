{"body": "\nJack-\n\nThere is a paper in the SIGGRAPH 2000 proceedings called \"Towards a\nPsychophisically-Based Light Reflection Model for Image Synthesis\" by\nPellacini, Ferwerda, and Greenberg that looks at using visually\nevaluated measurements to formulate a model for gloss.\n\nThey relate their visually measured parameters to the phyically based\nparameters used in Radiance.  I'm not sure how it relates to other gloss\nparameters or how it would actually work if you tried to use it (I\nhaven't), but it might be worth a look.\n\nLet me know if you can't get hold of the paper...\n\n-Matt\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Jack\nde Valpine\nSent: Tuesday, February 07, 2006 11:24 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi Greg,\n\nWell I was pretty sure it was wishful thinking. I guess I had been\nhoping that with some understanding of the gloss appearance metric there\nmight be a way back into at least some meaningful ballpark for roughness\nand specularity.\n\nOk, well on a related note, other than a full BRTD what would be the\nbest way to simulate a so-called metalic paint, that is a paint that\nincludes metal flakes...? Is this still best qualified as a plastic or\nshould it in fact be a metal?\n\n-Jack\n\nGregory J.
