I'm not sure how it relates to other gloss\nparameters or how it would actually work if you tried to use it (I\nhaven't), but it might be worth a look.\n\nLet me know if you can't get hold of the paper...\n\n-Matt\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Jack\nde Valpine\nSent: Tuesday, February 07, 2006 11:24 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi Greg,\n\nWell I was pretty sure it was wishful thinking. I guess I had been\nhoping that with some understanding of the gloss appearance metric there\nmight be a way back into at least some meaningful ballpark for roughness\nand specularity.\n\nOk, well on a related note, other than a full BRTD what would be the\nbest way to simulate a so-called metalic paint, that is a paint that\nincludes metal flakes...? Is this still best qualified as a plastic or\nshould it in fact be a metal?\n\n-Jack\n\nGregory J.
