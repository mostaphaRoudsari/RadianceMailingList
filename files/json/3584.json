I know we worked on something like this at the LESO/\nEPFL, but I don't know what became of it.  I don't think much was\ndone with collecting specular materials.  You can find almost\nanything you like out there in the big wide world, so a library will\nnever be more than a random sample.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Thanks and materials..", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Mar 21 16:42:55 2008"}
