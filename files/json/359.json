The distributed binaries work with Jaguar (Mac OS\nX 10.2 and later), and include the necessary drivers for X11 and\nOpenGL.  You need only download the beta release of the X11 server from\nApple's website to get the whole thing operational.  From my\nexperience, hardware support for OpenGL rendering is pretty good with\nthe Apple server.\n\nThe issues here were raised by someone who needs to recompile 3.5 under\nMac OS X 10.1, which uses a different set of libraries.  There, it is\ndifficult to find the appropriate Xlib library to link to, as Apple\n(stupidly) doesn't include it with their gcc compiler.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: opengl and mac", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 1 Apr 2003 17:00:27 -0800"}
