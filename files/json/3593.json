I have\ncompared Dialux with\nRadiance in the past and the results differed by 10-15%. Have you\ndouble checked your\ngeometry?\n\n\n\n'-ab 20' - impressive! I usually don't go higher than 6. If your\nafraid of missing some\ntiny value in the third decimal you should use '-av' to set a\nbackground value. One\nway to find this is described in RwR using rvu, another is to check\nthe output of the\ngensky program for the 'Ground ambient level' and adjust that for\nyour indoor situation\n(1-2% of the outdoor level).\n\nIf you have a detailed geometry (small windows and openings) you\nshould also\nincrease '-ad' (4096), '-ar' (512) and '-as' (256). The speed penalty\nhere is less than\nthat of an increase in '-ab' so I tend to be pretty bold about these.\n\nI have noticed that Radiance seems to add to your rtrace results the\nhigher you\nset your '-ab'. I'd have expected the values to approach an upper\nlimit where a further\nincrease makes no noticeable difference. In reality I could add a\nsignificant percentage\nto the DF simply by increasing the '-ab' value. So I assume that your\nextreme\ndifference might be a result of the very high '-ab' setting.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080329/b07c68bf/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] DF calculated in Radiance and Relux", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sat Mar 29 02:44:40 2008"}
