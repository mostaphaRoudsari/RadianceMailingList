This alone is no\nprove but it shows the normals are exported. I don't know\nif *.obj _requires_ normals for each vertex. They still could\nbe face normals which would show no smoothing effect.\n\nTo check UV-coordinates check the lines starting with \"f \".\nThe three or four sets of numbers have the form\n\n<vertex index>/<uv-coord>/<vertex normal>\n\nIf no uv-coord is present the field will be empty (like \"1//1\").\n\n\nIf your app does not provide uv-coords and normals you could\nuse a 3D modeler with DXF import to convert your geometry to\n*.obj files. For simple DXF files Blender (www.blender.org)\ncan do that.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<OF38396E44.4FF82C7A-ONC1257116.0043AE03-C1257116.00445D57@DMZ01.WEB>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5FC817D-9452-43A2-9E85-395F3DBCEEBF@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<OF38396E44.4FF82C7A-ONC1257116.0043AE03-C1257116.00445D57@DMZ01.WEB>"], "datetime": "Wed Feb 15 13:59:33 2006", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OBJ2MESH - Phong smooth shading and texturemapping"}
