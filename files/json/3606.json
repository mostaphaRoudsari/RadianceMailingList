The\nNTFS file system (Window 2000 and XP) is not supported yet.\n\nI also managed to read some chapters of the Curtin PDF you gave a link\nto. I couldn't find mention of saving files.\n\n\n\nI had to smile to myself while reading the PDF - I am always puzzled by\nthe defining of electrical lighting as 'artificial'. Why is that?\n\n\n\nWell, here is a professional lighting designer's request to please\nconsider another term for lighting that is not Sunlight/Daylight!\n\n\n\nThanks again, regards\n\n\n\nAngela\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080404/78b2226a/attachment-0001.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Angela Giladi", "datetime": "Thu Apr  3 23:08:01 2008"}
