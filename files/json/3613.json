{"body": "\nAn alternative approach would be to use \"transdata\" or \"transfunc\" to model the roller blind using a single polygon. Of course, this would require one to measure or estimate the angle dependent direct hemispherical transmittance of the system. This information can be retrieved through integrating sphere measurements. Ad hoc, I do not see why a roller blinds system should exhibit the angular transmittance properties of a single glass pane. Maybe someone more qualified could comment on this?\n\nIf you are not sure how to use trans or transdata, we have done a Radiance validation study for this kind of work, comparing the trans and transdata models to measurements in a full scale mock-up. The results will be most likely be published in a special issue on 'Daylighting' in Energy and Buildings in June 2006. Anybody interested in a sneak preview of the paper, drop me a line.\n\nChristoph\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Wednesday, February 15, 2006 1:00 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nDear Caroline,\n\nI'd recommend to combine the radiance materials glass and trans assigned to two planes.\n\n1. With the material glass you take into account the angular reduction of transmission (which the trans material doesn't have). To achieve a transmission of 2.5% you should use for the R, G and B value of (2.5% * 1.088579).\n\n2. To give the roller blind a diffuse transmission you can add the material trans to the second plane. Here you should use for the R, G and B value 1 (100% transmission). The diffuse part of transmission you can control via the 7 th parameter (0 = all diffuse).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nKind regards\n\nAndreas\n\nALware Andreas Lahme\nLeopoldstr. 7a\nD-38100 Braunschweig\nGERMANY\nFon: +49 . 531 / 250 72 - 80\nFax: +49 . 531 / 250 72 - 81\nMail: a.lahme@alware.de\nInternet: www.alware.de\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Urspr?ngliche Nachricht-----\nVon: Radiance general discussion\nGesendet: 15.02.2006 18:39\nAn: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nBetreff: [Radiance-general] simulation of an internal roller blind\n\n\nDear Radiance-users,\n\nI would like to simulate in RADIANCE an internal roller blind, which has\naccording to the supplier (unfortunately they do not know more) the\nfollowing properties:\n\nas optical properties(reference to T65):\ntransmission: 2,5 %\nreflection (to the outside): 71,8 %\n\ncould anybody give me please a hint which is the best way to implement this\nin RADIANCE?\nI could accept a simplification, but what kind of material is the best\nchoice to do so (glass, trans)?\nHas anybody experiences with this?\n\nI would appreciate any help,\n\nsincerely yours,\n\nCaroline\n\n\n--\nTelefonieren Sie schon oder sparen Sie noch?\nNEU: GMX Phone_Flat http://www.gmx.net/de/go/telefonie\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060216/10ff2dca/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C396201424560@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Feb 16 15:08:36 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Antwort: [Radiance-general] simulation of an internal roller blind"}
