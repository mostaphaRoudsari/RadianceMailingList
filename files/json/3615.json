Imagine something\nlike a checkerboard, two materials, just not with squares but irregular\nforms. I have images of that surface, and of course I could simply map a\nfoto onto a white surface using colorpict and get something close to real.\n\nStill, as I have not only color but two materials involved, I do not\nlike that idea. I want to have different material properties, not only\ncolor variation.\n\nSo far the problem is solved using two cad geometrys, one for each\nmaterial. This is extremely inefficent, it produces tons of polygones\nand problems.\n\nWhat I need is to take a black white picture, map it onto my surface,\nand have the black be material a and the white be material b in radiance.\n\nIs there a reasonable way to do that in Radiance?\n\nTIA&CU, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080406/1a766a66/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
