You can read the code in src/\nrt/raytrace.c if that helps.  Look at the \"rayparticipate\" function,\nwhich is called from \"raytrace\".\n\n\nCan't you use -otvL with -me 0 0 0 in rtrace?  This will report the\nray length and value for the entire ray tree.\n\n\nOnly rays that are linked to tree branches that end in glow surfaces\nor light sources will have non-zero values if -av 0 0 0 (the default)\nis specified.  I suspect the problem in your case is that -me 0.2 0.2\n0.2 is so large that ray paths are never short enough to yield a non-\nzero result.\n\n\nTry the settings above and see what happens.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rtrace: -ospec options", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun Apr  6 10:00:56 2008"}
