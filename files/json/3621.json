Francesco, you had posted a\nlengthy analysis of your use of openmosix a while back, but I thought\nyour conclusion was that the performance was not worth the hassle.  I\njust re-read it and I see that my recollection is a little off.  It\nseems that if you have enough (fast) machines to dedicate to the effort,\nyou can set up a really killer rendering cluster.  I will have to delve\ninto this a bit more.  Lars & Francesco, I'd love to hear more about\nyour process(es) for doing distributed renderings.  I recently started\nusing rad -N on multiprocessor machines at work, but of course now I\nwant more. =)\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate, recovering from broken rpicts?", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<43F89C99.7010808@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<20b7f559db0e093ad73930afa5babe40@gmx.net>\t<43F7B4F9.2030104@visarc.com>\t<20857D59-57E3-4170-A2B2-B4824D1C7318@gmail.com>\t<200602190917.44566.pisuke@blueyonder.co.uk>", "<f474d9a6575e5b63d84bae47a102d6ce@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Sun Feb 19 17:30:12 2006", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ranimate, recovering from broken rpicts?"}
