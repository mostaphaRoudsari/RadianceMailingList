I was considering an external hard\ndrive for Knoppix/Radiance;\nit was a question of not wanting to deal with a further hard drive to\nback up the first.\nI admit that the severe warnings I read only helped to confound me more.\n\n\nWhat terms would you recommend to use for the generic description of\nlight from the sun and sky dome versus man made (hence artificial or\nconstructed) light sources such as incandescent, etc.\n\nI personally prefer the term 'electrical lighting' for that natural\nphenomenon that is electricity,\nwhich happens to be harnessed by man. I use 'natural light' for\ndaylight/skylight.\nCandle light I use for dinner!\n\nKind regards,\n\nAngela Giladi\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080409/8b647c0e/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Angela Giladi", "datetime": "Wed Apr  9 10:01:08 2008"}
