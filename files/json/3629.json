Radiance does not really do this, and the approximation\nof three primaries (RGB) multiplied between source and surface is not\nvery reliable.  See the following paper for more information:\n\nWard, Greg, Elena Eydelberg-Vileshin, \"Picture Perfect RGB Rendering\nUsing Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries,\" Thirteenth\nEurographics Workshop on Rendering (2002), P.
