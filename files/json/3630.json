We\nwill use a 'library' instead and define the Radiance description\nby assignment or name.\n\nSame thing with luminaires BTW. The typical 3D object 'lamp' has\nnot enough information to define a real world luminaire. Our\nlibrary backend for luminaires may be the topic of another post\nin a few days.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2mesh proposal", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DCB4F215-2228-427B-930F-1403B224B5D2@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<2C0020B9EB71CE4281B292F0E16A6DDE7FC869@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "<A22E9EEA-7920-44A8-836D-0DFCE7225045@arcor.de>", "<D211B7CE-6C1A-41EE-8B4B-BE90DAD476B3@arcor.de>", "<0F4C07C9-FBE7-4F63-9F9E-51F9B615ADF2@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb 20 19:32:57 2006", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] obj2mesh proposal"}
