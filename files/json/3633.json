That did the trick for me on OS X 10.4.4, Python 2.3.\n\n\nWhen your at Python 2.4 I think you know your way around Python\nand OS X. Keep an eye on the imports in the script. If they fail\nany error message could be the result. Perhaps add\n\ntry:\nimport ...\nimport ...\nexcept ImportError, err:\nprint \"ERROR\", err\n\nto the import section to check this explicitly.\n\n\nI got my version sometime after September 2005 from Francesco's web\nsite (tar ball, not CVS).\n\n\nMe too ;)\n\nYou can download the snapshots here:\n\nhttp://home.arcor.de/tbleicher/blender/bliff/download.html\n\nThere is no tutorial and they are not tested much. I have not\nyet separated the brad parts from the GUI toolkit so it's one\ndownload. The zip file is fresh and contains today's texture\nmapping update.\n\nDon't get frustrated,\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2mesh, UV coordinates and image aspect", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ABD85242-B505-4DE6-B996-825868C09D96@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<2C0020B9EB71CE4281B292F0E16A6DDE7FC869@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "<A22E9EEA-7920-44A8-836D-0DFCE7225045@arcor.de>", "<A9230BDD-27E2-4F7F-BA62-0BD03FB7B582@gmail.com>", "<CE3109FB-02D4-4E61-8ABA-3A7C9EA2F4D7@arcor.de>", "<9C959B0D-ED49-4FDB-9D4E-1CC6668AB4AF@biomechanicsinc.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb 20 21:44:25 2006", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] obj2mesh, UV coordinates and image aspect"}
