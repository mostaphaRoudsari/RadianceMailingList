In a scene with some\nthousand sources, it takes three hours until rpict writes the first\npixels (same is true for rtrace) - than it is going on fine. Is there\nanything I could do to speed up this phase of the rendering?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
