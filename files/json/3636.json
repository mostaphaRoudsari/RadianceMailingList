I do not know if this causes additional start-up\nprocessing.\n\nThe idea to deactivate the obstruction cache is quite promising for my\ncase. I have one illuminated room, so all those light sources are not\nhidden by surfaces any way. That means that all that caching is for\nnothing and just wastes the start-up time in this special scenario.\n\nI will try this as soon as the next image is done (I guess tomorrow) and\nreport any success.\n\nThe idea to use -P is a good one - but I wonder how to do this when\nusing ranimate to control the rendering. Maybe you remember, I am that\ncrazy guy using ranimate to render stills - which is nice cause I can\nuse it to continue after broken processes, distribute processes both on\nsmp and on clusters, and all that... ;-) I will have a look at the\nranimate documentation once again.\n\nCU and thanks, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080417/6436c50c/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<07D95AE8-8FEA-4A9E-8FE6-10BD6ABF628B@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
