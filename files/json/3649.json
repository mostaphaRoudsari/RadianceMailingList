It would cause no damage but if you copy a file on the\ncommand line you want it to appear in Finder as well. This would not\nhappen if your bash selects the fink \"cp\" because it's the first in\nthe search path.\n\n\nAny reason why you don't use\n\nif [ ! ${DISPLAY} ]; then\n\nas you did with SSH_TTY?\n\n\nMy cat recently peed on my laptop which is the reason I have to look\nfor a new one now.
