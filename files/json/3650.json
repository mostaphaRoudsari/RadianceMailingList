I will try\nto run the Stock benchmark today.  All the test scenes in the obj\ndirectory really fly!  The cabin holodeck scene is a lot more fun to\nplay with on this thing. =8-)\n\n\n\n\nYeah, it was installed when I installed xcode.  I don't recall having to\nspecifically tell the installer to install the X11 devel stuff, but it\nwas certainly there when I compiled Radiance.  No errors, and I have\nximage and rvu, etc.\n\n\n\nThanks for the heads up.  Believe it or not, I haven't had a need for\nfink on the old computer, but I thought I may install it on the new one,\nso I'll keep your warning in mind.\n\n\n\nthe reason it's written the way it is, is that's the way it was written\non the tip website that I copied the code from.  =)\n\n\nYikes!!  Guess you were spending too much time on the computer and not\nenough time petting the cat.  They get jealous.  =8-)  I think we'd have\na serious problem if Emma peed on my new computer though...\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] MacBook Pro Report", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<44048321.40709@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<DE5FF2CE-B75B-4DC4-AEB2-CDCC45AE296A@rumblestrip.org>", "<64D94A8D-873D-495D-AE92-6400B72171F1@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Feb 28 18:08:46 2006", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] MacBook Pro Report"}
