I am modeling my source in feet, but\nscale it later, before rendering, to metres. Now, I get the radiance\nderived from the total luminous flux of a source (10 lm) and its surface\n(from its diameter 0.02m). The result in units of radiance is per /sr\nm2, so if I apply the light modifier to a sphere and scale it, the total\nluminous flux would increase, right? So scaling light sources with xform\nis a stupid mistake? Do I get it right? I scale more or less everything\nin my model, and usually xform cares about everything, such as textures\nand transformations, but I guess in this case it does not work.\n\nThanks, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080423/85575102/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling an oil lamp sourc", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
