And you mention\nthat you're interested in computing DFs?  It seems as though you're\nmixing and matching your units here.  It is important to remember that\nfalsecolor has no idea what the images represent, you have to supply\nthat info and there is no error checking.  So you could easily supply\nfalsecolor with an illuminance pic and place a cd/m^2 label, as it\nappears you have done and Chris has pointed out as a problem...\n\nThis is great advice.  These images are quite powerful ways to convey a\nlot of scene information in one view, but the onus is on the user to\nmake sure the image tells a fair story.  This means dialing in the scale\nlogarithmically to present a fair case for contrast, setting the scale\nmaximum to fairly include the extrema (or at least identifying the\nextrema with the -e option to falsecolor) and of course making sure\nyou're presenting the correct units.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance falsecolor pictures", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Wed Apr 23 09:18:23 2008"}
