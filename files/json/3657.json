The default for\nrpict is to render 0 ambient bounces (reflections). Without an\nexplicit '-ab' you will only see\nthe sky through the window but nothing that is illuminated by it.\nThat's why you get a black\nand white picture. Try something like '-ab 2' for a test rendering\nand then increase it to 4 or\n5 for the final rendering.\n\nYou only need a high value of '-ab' for the irridiance picture. The\nsecond picture is only\nused as a backdrop to the contour lines and doesn't have to be\naccurate. Consider also\nthe use of an ambient cache file ('-af') to reuse the ambient\ninformation calculated in the first\nrpict call. This will speed up the rendering of the second picture,\neven with high ambient\nsettings.\n\nOnce your pictures render to your satisfaction you will have to play\naround with the\nscale of your contour lines. From your description I understand that\nyour scene contains\nboth window and room. In this situation you will most likely see no\nlines on the window/sky\n(scale too small but correct for the room interior) or no lines on\nthe room surfaces (scale\ntoo large for room). A logarithmic scale might help here but the\npeople who are looking\nat these pictures have to know what it means.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080423/840231ec/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance falsecolor pictures", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed Apr 23 15:32:58 2008"}
