When I ran it, the system responded:\n\nbash: ./makeall: /bin/csh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nI then searched for any csh files and found two files under a folder called 'etc'.  These files are:\n\netc/csh.login\netc/csh.cshrc\n\nAre they the files that \"makeall\" was looking for?   If so, how can I make it work?\n\nThanks a lot for your help!\n\nCheers,\nKam\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile.
