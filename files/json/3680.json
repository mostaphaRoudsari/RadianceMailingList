I am not sure of its first shared release date, but I recall exploring it's potential, with a gaping smile, in either 1989 0r 1990. Have we missed its 21st birthday?\n\n-Rob Shakespeare\n\n* assumed, based on past releases!\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Official Radiance 3.9 Releas", "tags": [], "sender": "Shakespeare, Robert A.", "datetime": "Thu May  1 16:02:27 2008"}
