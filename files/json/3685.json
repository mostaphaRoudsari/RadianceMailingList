{"body": "\nInteresting thing - I recently started using Blender 2.41 (from 2.37)\nand I hadn't gotten around to reinstalling b/rad.  So I downloaded\nthe latest and copied brad.py into the ./blender/scripts folder and\ncp -R copied the \"brad\" directory into the ./blender/scripts\ndirectory as well, per the install instructions.  Now, when I go to\nBlender's \"Scripts\" interface to update the menus, the only scripts\nthat appear in the scripts menus are the ones that are alphabetically\nbefore brad.py, (brad is not included).  As soon as I rm brad.py and\nthe brad directory, the Blender Scripts menu is back to normal, with\nall of the available scripts as before.\n\nAny thoughts on why this happens?  if I manually load brad.py in\nBlender (into the test window) from the Scripts directory and then\nAlt-P (well, Option-P on the Mac) I get a console error telling me:\nImportError: No module named brad_i18n - etc.\n\nMac OS X 10.4.4, G4 dual 1.25, Blender 2.41, Python 2.4 - brad.py is\nRev 1.8 from Aug 11, 2005 (from CVS) and the rest is from brad 0.1b.\nThe same thing happened with the brad.py file original 0.1b release,\netc.\n\n\nThomas - pretty neat interface to brad from within Blender - I'm\ninterested to see how this turns out.\n\nThanks,\n\nkirk\n------------------------------\n\nKirk L.
