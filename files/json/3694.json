I\nwas just re-running the PDF output, and it puts the date in without\nasking you. There is probably some way of turning this off, though...\n\nI remember that it took me a good few hours on the old Enigma engine\nto decrypt the thing. That was at least three or four years ago. I'm\nnot at all sure, but this might well be the original:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/doc/mapping.hqx\n\nI re-did all the vector drawings, and got a nicer image of beautiful\nDaphne off the Internet, but tried not to alter the text. I was\ninitially hoping to put this up on the next-generation Radiance\ncommunity web site (Wiki or whatever), but since this never\nmaterialised, I've kept it to myself ever since. Back then, I also\ntried to get hold of MC, but to no avail. Hope he's gonna sue me over\nthis... ;-)\n\nPlease note that the pickup directory on luminance.londonmet.ac.uk is\nonly there for temp stuff, so you might want to grab it by its\nextension and pull it over to the big servah.\n\nCheerioh\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri May  2 16:05:46 2008"}
