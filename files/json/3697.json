{"body": "\nThis time I have a question about UV mapping:\n\nI tried to export UV texture coordinates from Blender and used\nthe example from the manpage of obj2mesh to define a texture:\n\nvoid colorpict tiled_pat\n7 red green blue mytile.pic . frac(Lu) frac(Lv)\n0\n0\n\ntiled_pat plastic tiled_mat\n0\n0\n5 .9 .9 .9 0 0\n\ntiled_mat mesh tiled_mesh\n1 mymesh.rtm\n0\n0\n\nThe man page says this works for square images. My image was\na rectangle at first and was converted to a square later, but\nboth images had the same (wrong) look. I have uploaded two\nimages (one from Blender, one from rpict) to illustrate the\ndifference.\n\nhttp://home.arcor.de/tbleicher/blender/bliff/current.html\n\nMy questions now are:\n\n1) What went wrong?\n2) How would I define a non-rectangulare image texture?\n\nPlease not that I have not checked the quality of the generated\nUV coordinates. They are generated by a established *.obj exporter\nfor Blender and I think they are correct for now. My understanding\nof the Radiance texture mapping options is so bad that I expect\nthe error in the texture definition.\n\n\nThanks and have a nice weekend,\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<68E0B2D5-DE09-46EE-A3DF-FB399BF5CAAE@arcor.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Feb 19 12:24:31 2006", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] obj2mesh, UV coordinates and image aspect"}
