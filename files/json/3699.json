Final material look the same as original bands3 material.\n\nI'm not sure if I was clear enough, but if someone understands my\nquestion and have an answer that would be great.\n\nMarija\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, May 3, 2008 at 10:51 AM, Tom Young <thdyoung@mac.com> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] applied material to all faces of a genbox", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Wed May  7 03:33:03 2008"}
