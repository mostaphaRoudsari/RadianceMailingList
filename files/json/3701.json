{"body": "\nHi,\n\nit is the first time I ran into trouble with ranimate... I use it, no,\nnot render animations, but to distribute single picture renderings over\nan openmosix cluster (I simply use three host lines pointing to\nlocalhost). Now my rpicts died because of lack of memory (they all\ntried to migrate to one node at once), and I restarted ranimate in the\nhope that it would continue rendering (the pictures rendered almost one\nweek so far, and I donot want to start at zero again). I was surprised\nby the following:\n\n- When rpict failed, the frames were still filtered by pfilt, so I have\nframe001-003.pic in the output directory now.\n- Still, ranimate found that something went wrong, as it started with\n-ro. I hope it will not get confused by the fact there is already a\ntarget file frame001.pic.\n- Strange enough, ranimate recovered, but now it started just one\nprocess, though there are three broken (unfinished) frames and more\nwaiting in the viewfile. Will it try to recover the three frames one by\none instead of starting processes on all nodes now? That will take a\nvery long time too complete, and my machines are getting lazy ;-)\n\nSo, many questions from a ranimate-beginner (and mis-user, but I don't\nwant to imagine how much time it will take to render an animation of\nthat scene...)\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 2134 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060218/09f3500e/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
