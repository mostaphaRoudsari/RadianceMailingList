Here are a few caveats:\n\n1) The three vectors you give to the addrot() routine must be\nnormalized (length 1) and orthogonal to each other.\n\n2) The vectors specify the new axes orientations, so you give it the\ndestination position for each original X, Y, and Z axis.\n\n3) The axes must compose a right-hand coordinate system.\n\nI assume from what you've said, that it's probably #1 that is the\nproblem.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] applied material to all faces of a genbox", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri May  9 11:38:54 2008"}
