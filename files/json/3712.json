I find that\nextreme values for 'ar' are only required when the total scene size is\nmuch larger than the zone you're interested in. An example would be a\ndaylighting model for a single small room in a building that also\nincludes large external geometry many times larger than the room itself.\n\nTry -ar 200 and -ar 600. You may be surprised that high values don't\nimpact your results that much, but would have a strong impact on the\nquality of rendered images.\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080513/7ed3eaa0/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] out of memory in avstor", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Tue May 13 08:19:39 2008"}
