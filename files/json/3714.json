{"body": "\n\nHi all,\n\n\nI recently tried using OBJ2MESH for applying smooth shading to models, made\nusing a 3rd party CAD software, and also to map textures. None of it\nworked.\n\n\n- I did not see any option for implementing smooth shading in the obj2mesh\nmanual, can anyone helps explaining how it should be specified?\n\n\n- For mapping texture I used the following code, but there was no texture\non the object rendered (a ball) just plain color :\n\nvoid colorpict ball_surface\n7 red green blue ball.pic . frac(Lu) frac(Lv)\n0\n0\n\nball_surface plastic ball_finish\n0\n0\n5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0\n\nball_finish mesh ball_mesh\n1 ball.rtm\n0\n0\n\n\nThat's about it, any support will be appreciated.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nicolas Roy", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<OF38396E44.4FF82C7A-ONC1257116.0043AE03-C1257116.00445D57@DMZ01.WEB>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb 15 13:28:37 2006", "email": "nicolas.roy at VELUX.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] OBJ2MESH - Phong smooth shading and texturemapping"}
