If\nthe calculation point coincides with the wall everything is possible.\n\n2) Don't use a box at all. At the perimeter there is a dark horizon\n(black\nwalls) which is taken in into the calculation. You could create a sphere\nof the material around your calculation point instead.\n\n\nThe first is the result of rtrace's interpretation of the '-I' switch\n(uppercase 'I'!)\nrtrace creates a 'virtual surface' at the calculation point and\nstarts the calculation\nfrom the point of the view vector. In your case these are (6.216+0, 0\n+-1, 1.8+0)\nand (6.216+0, 0.05+-1, 1.8+0). Your rcalc command prints only the y-\ncoordinate.\n\nThe second problem I can't explane but depending on the size of your\nbox the 'dark horizon' might have some influence here.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lux-values for points in a pla", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue May 13 12:34:14 2008"}
