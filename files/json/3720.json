I have used also image-based for the same points to extract the luminance and I have very similar results. I need to use also simulation-based luminance values for the same points and compare the results with the measured and image based ones.\n\nBefore,  I have simulated only Illuminances. How can I measure the Luminances?\n\nHere is the code I use to predict the illuminance:\n\n# commands to run\ncommands = [\"rm -f /tmp/bpi.amb\",\n\"oconv env.rad lab_surfaces_corrected_moved.rad lab_windows_and_doors.rad strato_sokol2.rad> lab.oct\",\n\n\"echo '4.52    0.85 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\n\n\"' | rtrace -w -af /tmp/bpi.amb -as 512 -ar 64 -aa 0.15 -ab 2 -I+ -h lab.oct | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)* 179'\",\n\n\n]\n\n\nAny help would be really appreciated,\n\nThank you very much\n\nBest regards,\n\nSokol Dervishi\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080517/13e8d7d3/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminance predictions in a pla", "tags": [], "sender": "sokol dervishi", "datetime": "Sat May 17 07:41:42 2008"}
