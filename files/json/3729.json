In any\ncase, a careful reading of the rtrace man page should give the\nanswer.  Quoting from the first paragraph of:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtrace.1.html\n\n\"Input for each ray is:\n\nxorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir\n\"\n\nYou simply start the ray an arbitrary distance from your surface and\ngive it a vector corresponding to the desired luminance measurement.\nThe returned values (when you run rtrace without the -I+ option) will\nbe in SI radiance units (watts/sr/meter^2),which may be converted to\nluminance (in candelas/meter^2) using the formula specified under the\n\"Examples\" section:\n\nrtrace  -h  scene.oct  <lum_meas.pts |  rcalc  -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2\n+11.6*$3'\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminance predictions in a pla", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon May 19 08:22:26 2008"}
