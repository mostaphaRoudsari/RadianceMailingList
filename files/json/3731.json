{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nMany people have tried small -ad settings with the ambient cache, and\nthe universal result is splotchy images.  The reason it works when\nyou turn off the ambient cache is that each interreflection\ncalculation varies about the correct value randomly, and looks like\nnoise in the image because it takes up only one pixel (or with\ndownsampling, a fraction of a pixel).  Using -aa (anything positive),\nyou spread these high variance values into surrounding pixels, and\nthey look like the measles.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<23397.1139411369@www036.gmx.net>", "sender": "Gregory J.
