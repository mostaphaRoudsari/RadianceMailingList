Normally\nwhen we talk about \"IES files,\" we're referring to those produced by\nlighting manufacturers.  You must be referring to another program --\nthis perhaps?\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com/content/\n\nIn which case, you should be more specific so we'll know what you're\ntalking about...  If Nick was actually asking about IES luminaire\nfiles, then ies2rad is what he's looking for.  TMA (too many acronyms).\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n---------------\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Desktop Radiance and IES", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed May 21 08:18:16 2008"}
