However, I would\nlike to find the illuminance on a wall grid, thus the grid points must\npoint in either +y, -y, +x or -x. When I run 'rtcontrib' in this case\nthe number of columns varies between 438 and 435 (since rtcontrib\noutputs r g b values). Thus, 'rtcontrib' seems to be skipping a patch\nevery now and then. I have tried also to increasing the settings but the\nsame problem occured.\n\nIs it possible to resolve this problem somehow so that the number of\ncolumns is consistent all the time (i.e. 438 including the ground)? If\nyes, how?\n\nThank you,\n\nPavlina Akritas\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] a bug with rtcontrib?", "tags": [], "sender": "Pavlina Akritas", "datetime": "Thu May 22 02:36:05 2008"}
