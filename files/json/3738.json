Indirect\ncalculation settings in general should be different from what you\nwould use for rtrace.  Large values for -ad do not necessarily help\nyou that much in rtcontrib, but I haven't explored the parameter\nspace enough myself to really offer sound advice.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] a bug with rtcontrib?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu May 22 08:15:07 2008"}
