{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nI don't want to discourage you from reading this paper, because it's\nreally nice, but I don't think it will help in getting meaningful\nvalues from gloss measurements.  I almost mentioned it myself in my\nreply, but was too rushed to go look up the reference.\n\nAs for material type, you are better off using \"metal\" if the\nmetallic paint has a strong color to it, as they usually do.  If you\nwant to see the clear coat as well, you can try a mixfunc between\nmetal and plastic.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gloss specifications to roughness/specularity", "sender": "Gregory J.
