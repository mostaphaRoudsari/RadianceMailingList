This documentation is helpful but I found out the latest picture.cal packaged with radiance3.8 file has commented lines in picture.cal describing what each item does in the function.\n\nNow Im wondering if there is a valid way of mapping a panaromic pic for a view through those wonderful daylight views we love so much.\nThe doc shows mapping on a tube with cyl.cal as way of doing just that. But that might interfere with skyglow and ruin the lux readings? Would a HDR mage mapped to the sky itself with sky luminance values 'indexed' to the bitmap's rgb values achieve a more accurate result??\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFind hidden words, unscramble celebrity names, or try the ultimate crossword puzzle with Live Search Games.
