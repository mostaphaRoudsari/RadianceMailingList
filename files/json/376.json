{"body": "\nI recently posted a question regarding perforated\nmetal.  The material worked great, but I had to do a\nlot of tedious manual labor getting it to work right\non a 3D arch due to the changes in surface normal of\neach section of the arch.\n\nSo, I've been wondering if there is a better way to\nhandle adding orientation specific materials to mesh\ngeometry.  (practically all the \"advanced\" materials\nin radiance seem to be orientation specific)  So, is\nthere a tool that will facilitate this process?\nSeems like it would need to read a rad file,\ncalculate the surface normals for the polygons, and\nthen write out a corresponding material file &\npossibly new rad file to go with the material file.\nMy guess is that's how it would need to work.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks!
