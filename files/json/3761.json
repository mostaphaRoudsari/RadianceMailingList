Essentially, you want to modify\nyour BRDF data such that the Gaussian model you are using for the\nspecular_bit is taken out.  The basic principle still applies, however.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Specular instead of lambertian for indirect", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue May 27 22:23:20 2008"}
