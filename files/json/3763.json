{"body": "\nThank you Thomas,\n\ni understand your suggestions and the procedure worked for an .dxf file\ni grabbed from the internet. It was a luminaire file from ERCO Lighting.\nI defined different layers and named them. The dxf2rad worked fine and i\nended up with my desired modifiers.\nBut the files i got from this company didn't work! I opened them in\nAutocad 2005 and it said something that they were created with 'Pro\nLignum 3D'. I can work with the file in Autocad but when i save it as\n.dxf then the dxf2rad converter messes it up. I get an empty file like\nthat:\n## Radiance geometry file \"Video_Monitor.rad\"\n## Converted by dxf2rad 0.9: Sun Feb 05 18:33:59 2006\n## C:\\cygwin\\opt\\ray\\bin\\dxf2rad.exe Video_Monitor.dxf Video_Monitor.rad\n\n\n## End of Radiance geometry file \"Video_Monitor.rad\"\n\nI have no web space to post this .dwg  file to and i guess to send the\nfile to this list is a bad idea. Maybe i can send it to you and you can\nopen it and see whats wrong. I have to ask this company if i can give\nthese files away but maybe we can make a deal. ;-)\nThank you so far!\n\nChristian\n\n--\nChristian Fusenig\nDiplomand, Medientechnik\nUndergraduate, Media Technology\nHamburg University Of Applied Sciences\n\naddress: Beim Schlump 27/07\n20144 Hamburg\n\nemail:    christian_fusenig@gmx.de\n\nmobile:  ++49 179 5975845\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Christian Fusenig", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43E63938.4040400@gmx.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Feb  5 18:45:04 2006", "email": "christian_fusenig at gmx.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re:Re: Problems with CAD/dxf Import"}
