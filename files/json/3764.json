If your\nCAD model had only one layer your exported *.rad will have\nonly one material.\n\n\nThat's a problem of AutoCAD and your model. If you have\n\"color\" in your model when you open it in AutoCAD you can\nselect elements \"by color\" and copy/move them to a new\nlayer.\n\n\nPolygons (most likely triangles) are the universal \"currency\"\nof geometry interchange. You can try to export \"solids\" to Radiance\nprimitives (dxf2rad does that iirc) but this is limited to real\nspheres, cylinders etc. which are rarely used in complex objects.\n\nYou could try to find \"box\" entities in the CAD file and generate\na \"!genbox\" command for it but that will ulitmately expand to six\npolygons as well (quads in this case). There is little you can do\nin the DXF file.\n\n\nYou can find an online version of the man page for dxf2rad here:\n\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/download/dxf2rad/manual.html\n\nPerhaps the two versions are different but according to this man\npage your second command is correct (and works as you describe).\nYou can find examples near the end.\n\nAbout the modifiers there is this section right at the start:\n\nOutput primitives will have modifiers based on the layer of\neach entity in the form \"l_<layer>\". Floating layers within\nblocks are fully supported.\n\nThis means that you have to split elements in your CAD model\naccording to the desired material to different layers. If you\nhave a wooden chair with a leather cushion you have to copy all\nelements (\"faces\", triangles, boxes, whatever) of the cushion\nto a layer called \"leather\" and the rest to a layer called \"wood\".\n\nSave only these two layers to the DXF file. Use dxf2rad on\nthis file and you will get a *.rad file with two modifiers\n(\"materials\"): \"l_leather\" and \"l_wood\".\n\nThe Radiance geometry file format requires a modifier for\neach polygon so 'dxf2rad' has to make one up for the export.\nIt uses the layer name (as most would do if confronted with\nDXF) as replacement for the material. You still have to\nprovide a valid definition for this material:\n\n# bright leather (hornbeam_wood actually ;)\nvoid plastic l_leather\n0\n0\n5 0.61 0.47 0.29 0 0\n\n# dark wood: elm_wood\nvoid plastic l_wood\n0\n0\n5 0.46 0.27 0.13 0 0\n\n\nAdd these lines at the top of the file and you should\nhave two materials in the object.\n\nYou can find some r,g,b values on this page:\n\nhttp://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/student/resources/radiance/\nmaterial_db.shtml\n\n\nhth,\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems with CAD/ .dxf import", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<926A4BC3-6621-4045-BA74-452BDBE9BEE3@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<43E4D9D5.4060301@gmx.de>"], "datetime": "Sat Feb  4 20:54:27 2006", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problems with CAD/ .dxf import"}
