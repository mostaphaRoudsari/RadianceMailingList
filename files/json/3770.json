In effect the BRDF would be a \"correction\" to the\nGaussian lobe model, or at least the direct part.  The indirect would\nbe as good as it's going to be without writing your own BRDF sampler,\nwhich would be both difficult and extremely costly in any rendering\nyou might do.\n\n\nIf the diffuse part of your reflectance model is zero, then there's\nno Lambertian calculation.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Specular instead of lambertian for indirect", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu May 29 08:04:48 2008"}
