I wasn't\nsure if you were one of Alan's students or somewhere else at the\nuniversity.  The -vs and -vl options default to 0, and you need not\nworry about them.  You can use the stdview global or the STDVIEW macro\ndefined in view.h to set the default view parameters.  The ip[0] and\nip[1] variables return image position on a [0-1) scale.  You need to\nmultiply these values by your image resolution to get the actual pixel\ncoordinates, which is exactly what the loc2pix function is for.  It\nseems like you have figured this all out, so I'm not sure what is and\nis not working for you at this point.\n\nHope to see you next week.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Transform from 3D to 2D Coordinates", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 2 May 2003 10:26:25 +0100"}
