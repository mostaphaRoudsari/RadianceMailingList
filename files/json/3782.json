What I am\ntrying to do is to gauge the range of numbers one can get and the\ndifferences in different part of the building so I have a basis to speak\nto the engineer.\n\nTo do this I generate my Radiance model with only one material to start\nwith with 50% reflectance. I generate a 1/2 hour series of renderings\n(with -i switch on).\nAfterwards I add up the irradiances with pcomb to get one picture from\nwhich to get the falsecolor scale in kWh / m2.\n\nI'm using falsecolor with -m = 0.001 to get the output in kWh / m2 to\nget daily cumulative irradiances. Is this approach correct?\n\nI'm doing this because RADMAP for windows fails to work (even the\nexample files that come with it) so I wanted to play around with\nradiance and learn something on the way.\n\n\nI guess my next step is to feed real irradiance data into radiance and\nfoloow the procedure outlined before, Am I in the proper direction?\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\nIv?n Pajares\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Iv=E1n_Pajares_S=E1nchez?=", "datetime": "Thu Jun  5 02:46:59 2008"}
