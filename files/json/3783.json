{"body": "\nHey,\n\nThanks Kirk, I had made the \"void bright light\" mistake which I corrected to\nsuccessfully create the octree file.\n\nComing to the second error:\n\n$rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct\nI get a windows pop up error message saying rvu.exe - Unable to locate\ncomponent, This application has failed to start because cybX11-6.dll was not\nfound. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.\n\nMy installation folder \"C:\\radiance_stuff\\cygwin\\usr\\X11R6\\bin\" contains\nonly a run.exe file and nothing else. I rerun the setup with X11R6 selected\nand the message at the end says \"nothing needed to be installed\". Does that\nmean the file is missing from the installation itself? What can I do to\ncorrect the situation?\n\nRamana.\n\n\n\nOn 3/4/06, Kirk Thibault <kthibault@biomechanicsinc.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060304/f83df0ad/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance on Cygwin: Starting problems", "sender": "Ramana Koti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<cdf76d820603041618r3aa27faelf6dd621fee3034ae@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<cdf76d820603041511t4c89c87dhd9e334d8784173ac@mail.gmail.com>", "<731D7F61-CEC9-4B86-89F0-4D938D882C10@biomechanicsinc.com>"], "datetime": "Sun Mar  5 01:20:20 2006", "email": "ramana.koti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance on Cygwin: Starting problems"}
