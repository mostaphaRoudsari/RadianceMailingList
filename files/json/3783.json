This is why the exposure needs to be \"undone\"\nbefore passing the picture through pcompos.\n\nThe reason pcompos behaves thus is that it's designed to take\nmultiple input images and the combined result won't necessarily have\nthe same exposure.  I should have some more intelligent code in there\nfor combining the exposure values in case they're all the same, I\nsuppose....\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] getting pixel value at x,", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jun  5 08:31:33 2008"}
