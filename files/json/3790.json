{"body": "\nHi Ramana,\n\nWhen you are running rvu/rview there are a range of interactive\ncommands. Typing view or v in the window will enter into a \"dialog\" that\nlet you control view parameters. You can try it out and just step\nthrough the parameters by hitting return, it will not change anything\nunless you type in something. When you get a view set up the way you\nwant you can save the setting by typing:\n\nv my-viewname.vf\nor\nview my-viewname.vf\n\nwhen you want to use a view that you have saved you would type the\nfollowing:\n\nl my-viewname.vf\nor\nlast my-viewname.vf\n\nHope this helps it can be a bit confusing early on but it is worth it.\nYou may want to learn to check and explore the man pages as well for\nexample:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rvu.1.html\n\n\n-Jack\n\nRamana Koti wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060305/53e6f2fd/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] saving a view from within rview", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<440B93AB.1020106@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<cdf76d820603051710s61303f74w15b24ab52cf0a54@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar  6 02:45:03 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] saving a view from within rview"}
