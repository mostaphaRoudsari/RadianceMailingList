The easiest fix is to run\n\"which genbox\" to find the path to the other one, then change your\nPATH order for your shell initialization file to point to the\nRadiance executable directory before the other one.\n\nI hope this sorts out your problem.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] scene 0 tutorial error", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jun  5 10:10:35 2008"}
