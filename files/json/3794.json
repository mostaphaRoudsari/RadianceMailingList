For the energy simulations we use Energy Plus.\nEnergy Plus also performs lighting simulations. &nbsp;I wanted to ask for your opinion about accuracy/validation of Energy Plus when it comes to lighting simulation.\nI have read that Energy Plus has integrated DElight software (radiosity based lighting simulation software) and that measurements are within 10% error? Is this margin of error acceptable?\n&nbsp;\nOur building is very simple (10?x15? in the plan), and it has a 6'X6' window on a 10' X 11' wall. We expected sufficient\nlevels of illuminance &nbsp;for this room but we got low illuminance value of 270 lux at the workplane close to the window.\nI am concerned is that either Energy Plus is not accurate enough or we have some error in our input.\n&nbsp;\nHow would you compare Radiance and Energy Plus (or DElight) when it comes to simulation of blinds?\n&nbsp;\nWe are new to Radiance and work already in Energy Plus, so we want to see if we can use Energy Plus for lighting simulation instead of Radiance.\nOr Radiance is still the most accurate tool for lighting simulations?\n&nbsp;\nThank you.\nSvetlana\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080605/2adc1eb0/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Svetlana Olbina", "datetime": "Thu Jun  5 10:34:54 2008"}
