Ex: if a given pixel gets the highest level of\nirradiance on June 21 @ noon then that will be the value given to that\npixel in the final image.  Has anyone tackled this before? Thanks.\n\nRegards to all,\nChris H\nBerkeley,CA\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080608/0b2680d2/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Cumulative calculations of irradianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Humann", "datetime": "Sun Jun  8 11:08:55 2008"}
