Please\nlet me know of any difficulties you have running these executables on your\nsystem.  I did not link them statically, so there might be dynamic library\nissues.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Fri, 2 May 2003 14:24:30 +0100 (BST)"}
