I just keep adding to the values and then write them out in\nbrightdata format (much like was done for the measured sky luminance\npatterns).  I settled on this scheme since it followed on from the\nvalidation.  I doubt that it is faster, or significantly so, than the\naggregated image method.\n\nThe cumulative sun contribution is provided by a pre-determined grid\nof standard Radiance suns, where each sun contains the aggregated\neffect of all the nearby sun positions that occur throughout the\nyear.  Just 150-200 or so suns provides a spatial distribution that is\nequivalent to a time-step of around 1/2 hour.  So, much better than\ncreating a rad file with potentially several thousand suns (for a\ncumulative annual file).\n\nUnfortunately, it's not code that I can share since it is part of an\nunwieldy mass of IDL procedures and scripts that only ever gets used\nin-house and is probably not fit to be let out of the door.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Tue Jun 10 02:16:35 2008"}
