{"body": "\nHi!\n\nThank you for the help, mkillum is somehow still one of the radiance\nsecrets.\n\nOk, I am trying that now. I am curious about the \"complicated way\" using\n-o settings for mkillum. Still, now I want it to work first ;-)\n\nOne question arised now. I had been filtering my scene for the\nmkillum-faces' modifier, replacing it by void, and than run mkillum with\n-i=void. I would prefer not to filter, but still, I need a modifier that\nwill actually never be used to define my mkillum-faces. Can I define an\nalias to void for that? E.g. void alias mkillum_faces void? So that\nbefore I run mkillum, these faces just are not visible, but I can still\nrun oconv on the scene? Or should I better use a dummy material for them\n(e.g. a glass with 100% transmittance? So far I like to be able to run\nrvu on the scene before using mkillum, so I prefer not to have some\nthousand of these faces with a dummy modifier, but I guess that alias to\nvoid could cause problems?\n\nThank You, CU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3485 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060319/96f16bbd/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum useage with large scenes", "sender": "Lars O.
