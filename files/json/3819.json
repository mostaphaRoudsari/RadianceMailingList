{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nThe alias type demands a valid (previously defined) identifier, and\nwill not accept \"void\" in the current version.\n\nYou are introducing too many artificial constraints, such as\nrequiring your scene files to have everything intermingled, with\nillum surfaces visible beforehand then invisible afterwards, etc.,\netc.  Separating the surfaces you want to render and treat\ndifferently in separate files is by far the easiest way to go.  You\nare making life unnecessarily difficult by bundling it all together\nin one stream.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum useage with large scenes", "sender": "Gregory J.
