The best way to model frit glass is to use the\n\"glaze.csh\" script that I created with funding from Visarc.  For a\nsingle-pane glazing using a full covering of V-175 white frit, this\nscript produces:\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision: 2.7 $\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 1\n# Exterior surface s1 type: clear glass\n# Interior surface s2 type: V-175 white frit\n# s2 coating coverage: 1\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.33\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.59\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.21\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed\n10\nsr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\nst_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n0 0 0\nglaze1.cal\n0\n11\n0.59\n0.59\n0.59\n0.256\n0.253\n0.251\n0.21\n0.21\n0.21\n-1      1\n\nTry this for now, or run the script yourself to vary the parameters.\nIf you can't run the script because you only have a Windows machine,\nthen you may be stuck playing around with the \"trans\" material.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Modeling Question for Translucent Glass", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jun 12 15:35:42 2008"}
