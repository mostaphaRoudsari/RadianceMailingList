Each -ae value adds a material to\nexclude from ambient calculations.  Named materials will get the -av\nvalue rather than incurring any new interreflection calculations.  This\nmeans that the mountains will have a rather flat appearance, and the\nshadows will be too dark if you don't choose a reasonable outdoor value\nfor -av, which in turn could be too bright for your interior.  (It's a\nproblem.)\n\nAnother option is to capture (using HDR photography) or render the\nscenery using a fisheye lens in a separate step, then apply the results\nto the window as a luminance distribution using a fisheye perspective\nmapping.  The Radiance ray/lib/fisheye.cal does a lookup on a 180\ndegree angular fisheye image (-vta -vh 180 -vv 180).  I recommend using\ntwo pictures -- a high-resolution for the view out the window and a\nlow-resolution for the light distribution.  You can compute the low\nfrom the high using pfilt with the -1 option:\n\npfilt -1 -x 32 -y 32 -r 1 window_hires.pic > window_lores.pic\n\nThe scene specification for a west-facing window might look like so:\n\nvoid colorpict window_pict_hires\n9 red green blue window_hires.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rz 90\n0\n0\n\nwindow_pict_hires glow window_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nvoid colorpict window_pict_lores\n9 red green blue window_lores.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rz 90\n0\n0\n\nwindow_pict_lores illum window_illum\n1 window_glow\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\nwindow_illum polygon window\n0\n0\n12\nwindow_with_inward_normal\n\n------\nI haven't tried this, so I can't say for sure if it will work.  I\nstarted this e-mail before I saw Carsten's, but didn't get a chance to\nfinish it until today.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 1 Jun 2003 11:59:45 -0700"}
