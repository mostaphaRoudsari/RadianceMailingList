{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI ask this question with a very basic knowledge of radiance's functioning so\nexcuse me if the question is not framed well.\n\nIs it possible to program/loop radiance modeling to produce daylight\nilluminance or daylight factor values at various points on a work surface of\na space for each hour through the year? (24x365 = 8760 values for a point on\na work plane)\n\nIf any, what are the constraints to such a process and how can they be\novercome so as not to model each hour individually?\n\nI am using Radiance on Cygwin.\n\nThanks in advance,\nRamana.\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060325/aa00606b/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Ramana Koti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<cdf76d820603251739u771a36ccq64ae518feef28813@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Mar 26 03:40:05 2006", "email": "ramana.koti at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] modeling hourly daylight illuminance/daylightfactor values for a year"}
