{"body": "\nGreg\ni have been thinking a bit more about this idea of rendering with\ncloured light sources, and i've realised i'm still a bit confused!\n\nwhere i get lost is why we should get better accuracy by using a white\nsource, and modelling the colour we want the source to have into the\nreflection calculation from the surfaces in the scene.\n\nin your paper you say this avoids a colour cast in the rendered image,\nbut why is this? presumably it wouldn't be that difficult to apply a\nwhite-point shift to the rendered image to correct this colour cast?\n\nbut as well as this colour cast, your results show quite a dramatic\ndifference in accuracy between the naive and premultiplied renderings.\ni appreciate that you probably don't have time to go into a detailed\nphysics lesson by email, but can you point me towards anywhere i can\nread up on why this is?\n\ni want to render lots of images of the same scene, but to change the\nsingle light source each time. so far i have written a script which does\nthis quite nicely (it turned out simpler than using rtcontrib, because\nof the way i wanted to structure the scene description), but i have only\nused white sources.\ni want to be able to use colour filters with my sources, but if i do all\nthe premultiplicaton i will have to do it for every different colour\nfilter i want to use, which will complicate the autamation of the\npreoccess immensely, so i'm trying to think of simpler ways to do it!\ni guess i might have to do without, and just accept a less slightly\naccurate image.\n\nthanks\nwill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory J.
