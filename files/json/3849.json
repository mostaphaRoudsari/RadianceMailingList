If\nyou don't have spectral data, then it's the same as using the Sharp\nRGB color space, which will at least be an improvement over standard\nRGB (or XYZ, which is the worst).\n\n\nThat's what a white point correction does, but it does it in such a\nway that the colors still have close to the correct appearance.  A\nnaive normalization to some average gray does the wrong thing, and in\nsome cases it is very wrong, indeed.\n\n\nSimply put, spectral peaks and troughs in the source and reflection\nspectra require more than the three dimensions of a standard color\nspace to resolve.  You only need three primaries to present (nearly)\nany color to the eye, since the eye only has three spectral\nsensitivity curves that it uses for color vision.  (The rods\nrepresent a fourth sensitivity curve, but this does not seem to take\npart in distinguishing colors.)  However, you theoretically need an\ninfinite number of spectral samples to exactly simulate light\ninterreflection.  You also need an infinite number of rays, and we\nget by with fewer.  As a practical matter, most rendering systems use\nonly three colors, and the paper we've been discussing shows how to\nbest leverage this machinery.\n\nFor a detailed description of color in computer graphics, Andrew\nGlassner's \"Principle of Digital Image Synthesis\" is an excellent\nreference.  Roy Hall has a classic text on the subject as well, but I\nbelieve it's out of print.\n\n\nAs I said, it makes no difference to the result if you don't have\nspectral data whether you incorporate your source color into your\nsurfaces or not.  The result will be the same, so you might as well\nscript it if you don't have spectra.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] specifying sources", "sender": "Gregory J.
