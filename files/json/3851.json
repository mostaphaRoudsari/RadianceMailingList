Yes, I am talking about the latest release on\nthe Radiance download page. I am using Linux (Fedora 8). If you could\ncompare the compiled package for linux with that for Mac OS, you would\nsee that there are about 80 less programs for the linux version.\nIncluding ximage and pvalue. Moreover, if one compiles the source\npackage (for linux), using makeall install, the resulting package of\nexecutable files still lacks the above mentioned ones.\nAny other suggestions?\nkatja\n\n\n\nOn Jun 20, 2008, at 7:07 PM, Rob Guglielmetti wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] radiance missing executables", "tags": [], "sender": "Katja Doerschner", "datetime": "Fri Jun 20 09:38:31 2008"}
