{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\n\nThe ies2rad program should convert the xyY value in the lamp.tab file\nto a Radiance RGB multiplier for the source.  The Y value in lamp.tab\nis the lumen depreciation factor.\n\nChanging the white point in the _second_ set of primaries in color.h\n(not the first set, which is only used if NTSC is defined), should\ndefinitely affect the output of ies2rad, but you would have to rerun\n\"rmake install\" in the src/common directory, then remove ies2rad and\nrun \"rmake install\" in the src/cv directory (in that order).\n\n\nIt should work.  You would have to give more details about how your\nvalue was unexpected, or your scene files.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "<442A5B3B.1020307@gmx.de>", "sender": "Gregory J.
