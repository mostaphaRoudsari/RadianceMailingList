{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThanks for the pointers John and Christoph.\n\nI did manage to install DAYSIM and model an office space. When I ran the\nsimulation I got the 'uncommented lines in the dc file' error which I looked\nup in the tutorial and fixed the PATH and RAYPATH environmental variables. I\nam using Windows XP on my notebook (the tutorial points these fixes for\nWindows 2000, I tried them nevertheless).\n\nI encountered the same error even then. I was trying to fix it and in the\nprocess uninstalled and installed the program 2 to 3 times. Now the program\ndoesn't start after installation. I can't get it to start despite some\neffort. It would help my thesis a lot if I can make it work.\n\nNeed your help.\n\nThanks again,\nRamana.\n\n\nOn 3/27/06, Reinhart, Christoph <Christoph.Reinhart@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca> wrote:\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060327/c7c9157a/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C3962018CBCC6@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "sender": "Ramana Koti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<cdf76d820603270903j3e088cf9uc6532925cc9f04c9@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<AcZQu758m2zgadw9S+qJSRk0lP9UAgA4rq6Q>", "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C3962018CBCC6@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 27 19:03:34 2006", "email": "ramana.koti at gmail.com", "subject": "FW: [Radiance-general] modeling hourly daylightilluminance/daylightfactor values for a year"}
