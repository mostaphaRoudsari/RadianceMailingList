I ran into a few weird compatibility type problems\nwith SFU (I don't remember the specifics now) and in the end decided to\nswitch to Cygwin because it seems to be better supported (for other Unix\ntype tools as well as for RADIANCE).\n\n\n\nI've also previously made a comparison between Linux (Suse) running as a\nvirtual machine under windows (using MS Virtual PC) and Cygwin.  Using\nthe test case from Mark Stock's benchmark page I found that Cygwin was a\nbit faster than the virtual PC (something like 15-20% faster) - at least\non my specific PC for that specific test case.\n\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080701/341008a0/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy Stone", "datetime": "Tue Jul  1 07:50:11 2008"}
