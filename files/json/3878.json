{"body": "\nHi Ian,\n\nI didn't realize they only had a Windows version -- they should have\nat least have a Linux edition, since that was where it was developed\n(as I understand it).  Hopefully, they will add MPEG-HDR encoder\nlibraries for Linux and OS X in the near future.  Don't let this stop\nyou, though.  You can always generate a sequence of HDR frames and\nfigure it out later.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Animation Contest", "sender": "Gregory J.
