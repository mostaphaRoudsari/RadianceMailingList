However, as\nit seams to be related to climate, not only illumination, I really\nwonder if a more general simulation tool such as esp-r could be used\nhere. To decide what grows where, assumptions of temperature, humidity,\nair flows would be important too. So you would get a climate profile of\na location from a simulation run and could try to find suitable\nvegetation according to that. I know of lists of plants used e.g. in\nparks, public spaces and gardens, showing basic requirements, but\nnothing in terms of physical units. So I guess this is something that\nwould have to be started yet... I am very curious about what you are\ndoing, and will try to get some details from a friend who is in botanics.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance and Photosynthesis", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
