I've only used Windows before, and I have no\nprogramming background so I'm sure I'm just looking at this the wrong way.\nThat aside...\n\nI downloaded and extracted \"rad3R9_linux.tar.gz\" to the folder\n\"rad3R9_linux\" to my desktop. I'm using the Ubuntu GUI called Gnome (I\nthink). I just installed the Ubuntu LTS Desktop Edition version 8.04.\n\nInside the rad3R9 folder seems to be no installation file (again, I'm\nthinking like a Windows user). I understand there should be some time of\ncommand line for Ubuntu... can someone get me started with a few steps or\npoint me to a link that might have some step-by-step instructions for the\nUbuntu/Radiance novice?\n\nThank you,\nNick\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080706/bd931d00/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 53, Issue 5", "tags": [], "sender": "Nick Calcagni", "datetime": "Sun Jul  6 15:52:16 2008"}
