I'd recommend\nto read and follow the documents linked on this page:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml\n\nThis should give you a good understanding of the basic interaction\nbetween\nthe Radiance tools. Further you can download a lot of e-papers from\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framer.html\n\nSome of these documents are a bit dated but the principles have not\nchanged.\n\nThat should keep you busy for a while.\n\n\nFurther notes on Ubuntu/Linux:\n\nIf you're new to Linux/Unix you have to become familiar with the command\nline and a friendly text editor of your choice. There're a lot of\nbooks available\nthat will make you an Unix guru in 7 days for $9.95. Just pick one.\n\nOn Ubuntu (or Debian etc) you should check /usr/share/doc/radiance\nor where ever the distribution stores the docs. In particular search for\nthe notes about renaming of applications (genbox -> genrbox in\nparticular)\nor you won't have much fun with the old tutorials. Radiance comes with\na bunch of PDFs and text files which are worth reading.\n\nThen read the man pages for the most interesting apps:\nrad, rpict, rtrace, oconv, ximage, rvu. They contain examples of\ntheir use\nand all together should give you an idea about how things are supposed\nto work.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance in Ubuntu", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed Jul  9 13:25:54 2008"}
