Surprisingly, the only real thing I had\nto change was to make a copy of xform.exe in the same directory and\ncall it cat.exe - xform without any transformation arguments is\nessentially cat (right?), and none of the cat lines had arguments. I\nmay have had to rename genrbox to genbox, but I think I did that a\nwhile ago.\n\nAfter downloading and unpacking the benchmark package (try 7zip), make\na batch file (a text file with a .bat extension) with the following\nlines (based on the Makefile):\n\nobj2mesh -n 15 -r 16384 lens.obj > lens.msh\noconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube2f.rad > cube2f_instance.oct\noconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube4f.rad > cube4f_instance.oct\noconv -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad scene.rad > scene.oct\nrpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o windows.unf scene.oct\npfilt -1 -e +0 -x /4 -y /4 -r .6 -m .15 windows.unf > windows.pic\ndel windows.unf\nra_bmp windows.pic > windows.bmp\n\nMake sure your PATH variable is set to the MinGW installation's bin\ndirectory, and run the batch file from a DOS prompt in the folder with\nthe benchmark files. This 2.13 GHz Core 2 got 4614.84 sec, on XP Pro\nSP2 (683733972 rays) without Cygwin, XMing or virtualization.
