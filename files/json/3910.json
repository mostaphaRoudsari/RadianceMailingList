As most parts of your room\nwill receive only indirect illumination, this will result in zero. Try\nsetting -ab to 2. To understand the effect of -ab for your scene, render\nimages of your room using -ab 0, -ab 1, -ab 2, -ab 3 with -av set to 0 0\n0 for all renderings. You should see only a bright splotch of (direct)\nsunlight for -ab 0, and increasing luminances for the areas receiving\nreflected light with higher -ab bounces. Try it!\n\nAlso make sure to measure illuminance slighty OVER the plane - if you\nare INSIDE geometry we all do not know what you will get for illuminance...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] the reference illuminance?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
