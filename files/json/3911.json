I do not know if you have any experience as a photographer,\nbut you would most probably use a wide angle lense, as the room is small\nand you want to see a perspective v?ew, not just one wall. Try something\nlike -vh 90, which would open the horizontal field of view to 90 degree.\nAlso, sketch a plan of your room, and mark view-point and field of view\n(which would be an angle at the viewpoint), so you can get an idea how\nmuch you can see of your room at a given point with a given lense.\n\nThis is much more about photography/sketching then Radiance.\n\nYou could use rvu and just play around, but it is still better to KNOW\nwhat you are doing ;-)\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<1578.144.214.86.109.1216092446.post4u@144.214.86.109>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
