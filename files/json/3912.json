Radiance\nis extrapolating the distribution function, which is a bad idea in\nthis case.\n\n-Greg\n\n\nIt covers 20 degrees horizontally and vertically, and proportionally\nmore than 20 degrees diagonally.\n\n\nActually, it's radiance -> degrees.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] lighting fixtures data", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<AB9109DA-008B-4E8D-BE97-EBD70C69A574@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<Pine.GSO.4.62L.0602281420240.2678@scrubbing-bubbles.mit.edu>\t<44082EB9.4080609@oriel.ox.ac.uk>\t<A922809C-2114-4DC9-8A25-941ABDAE4B4B@gmail.com>\t<44083E21.3020304@oriel.ox.ac.uk>\t<DD6BC913-5162-4DAD-9842-DDDC4E51F422@gmail.com>\t<440AED7B.2080306@oriel.ox.ac.uk>", "<8725C1C5-6B6B-42C6-BA2B-1237991C6C40@gmail.com>", "<440C4ED5.2040709@oriel.ox.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar  6 18:52:56 2006", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] lighting fixtures data"}
