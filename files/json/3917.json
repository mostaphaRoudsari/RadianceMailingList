I find calculated\nilluminances of 6 days is basically close to the measured data. But1 day is\nexceptional, there is a big difference between calculated illuminances and\nmeaured ones. That1 day is a very clear sky because that day has a highest\ndirect and diffuse radiation of those 7days, but the simulated illuminance\nwith radiance is\nmuch lower than other six days. Anybody can tell why? and how to modifiy?\n\nThank you for your time.\nZZ\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "ZZ", "datetime": "Tue Jul 15 01:04:21 2008"}
