I was away on a short vacation, and just got\nback.  I'm still more than a bit confused about accurately modeling\ndirect/indirect luminaires.  Could you tell me if I have this right?\n\nBackground info:\nMy space is modeled in inches.\n\nThe photometric file is in feet (as reported by ies_read):\n\nLuminaire Dimensions\n--------------------\nMeasurement units =       Feet\nWidth =                   0.46\nLength =                  4.00\nHeight =                  0.00\n\n\nQuestion 1:  I have noticed that the height for all of the\ndirect/indirect luminaires is 0.  How is that physically possible?\nMore importantly, how would a dimension of 0 ever \"enclose\" the\ngeometry of the luminaire?\n\nQuestion 2:  The actual luminaire dimensions are larger than the\ndimensions given by ies_read.  For instance, the length of the\nluminaire is listed in the cut sheet as being 53-5/8\".  Which dimension\ndo I use to create the illum \"enclosure?\"\n\n\nI used the command:\nies2rad -di -t white -i .56419 -o light2 d21998.ies\n\nand the resulting light2.rad file reads:\n\n# ies2rad -di -t white -i .56419 -o light2\n# Dimensions in inches\n#<IESNA:LM-63-1995\n#<[TEST] 21998\n#<[DATE] 05/31/2001\n#<[LUMCAT] AGDMWU232-F3-120-1/2-EB\n#<[LUMINAIRE] DAY-BRITE ADAGIO DIRECT/INDIRECT W/33-CELL SPECULAR LOUVER\n#<[LAMP] F32T8\n#<[BALLAST] ADVANCE REL-2P32-SC\n#<[MANUFAC] DayBrite-Capri-Omega(Genlyte Thomas Group)\n#<[_TIFF_FILE_NAME] AGD2\n#<[_VERSION] fo2ies 2.01\n#<Reflection factor 0.92, Test distance = 26 ft.\n# 60 watt luminaire, lamp*ballast factor = 0.88\n\nvoid brightdata light2_dist\n5 corr light2.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta\n0\n1 1364\n\nlight2_dist illum light2_light\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\nlight2_light sphere light2.s\n0\n0\n4 0 0 0 0.56419\n\n____\n\nI edit this file to use lboxcorr.  I convert inches to meters (multiply\ninches by .0254).\n...\nvoid brightdata light2_dist\n5 lboxcorr light2.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta\n0\n4 .815 1.363 .305 .0921\n...\nQuestion 3:  Because I used the -di option in the ies2rad command, I\nthought that converting inches to meters was the way to go.  Should I\nbe converting feet to meters?\n____\n\n\nQuestion 4:  When I replace the illum sphere with a box, should I be\nusing the units of my model (inches) or sticking with meters?  In other\nwords, should I be using:\n\n!genbox light2_light light2.s 1.363 .305 .0921 \\\n| xform -t -.6815 -.1525 -.04605\n\nor\n\n!genbox light2_light light2.s 53.625 12 3.625 \\\n| xform -t -26.8125 -6 -1.8125\n\nI have tried both, and when I used meters, my image is black.  When I\nuse inches, I get a reasonable image of my space.\n\nQuestion 5:  Can the dimensions of the illum geometry be slightly\ndifferent than the dimensions defined for the lboxcorr function?  The\nrounding required in converting back and forth between units would\ninevitably result in some differences.\n\n\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: direct/indirect photometric", "tags": [], "sender": "John An", "datetime": "Tue, 3 Jun 2003 15:52:57 -0400"}
