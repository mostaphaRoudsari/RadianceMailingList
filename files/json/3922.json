But for\nthe questions regarding gains definitions etc, you should use the esp-r\nsupport lists.\n\n\nAs much as I know, you must also define the operation parameters. Will\nlight be switched on 24 hours, or is it just that at night, light will\nbe off also at near-zero illumination? Where is the sensor - is it at\nthe same position you use for getting your illuminances? Or might it be\nexposed to more light, so even when you see very low illumination, it\nswitches off because it receives more?\n\nesp-r is a jungle of control files and parameters. I would always try to\nmodel a \"static\" model first, e.g. get the illumination only by\nsunlight. Next, switch on some lights. And than, when you have control\nover the model, start experimenting with photocell-sensors, which will\ndynamically switch on/off lights.\n\n\nI haven't done much work with esp-r yet (though I am very interested in\nit). So that is all I can advice. Did the higher -ab setting solve the\nlow illuminance problem?\n\nLars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Hi, Lars,", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
