{"body": "\nHi,\n\nThe oconv error probably relates to a problem in the scene definition\nfor the room. Unfortunately I do not have the book handy so I cannot\ncheck description. I would suggest double checking against what is\nindicated in the book.\n\nSince the scene does not compile (oconv: fatal ....) you will not be\nable to rvu it anyway. It also sounds likely that you do not have X\ninstalled with Cygwin. I would suggest checking to see of X was\ninstalled as part of the cygwin installation. If not you should be able\nto run through the cygwin setup program to get additional\nprograms/software such as X.\n\n-Jack\n\nRamana Koti wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060304/0423d5ce/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance on Cygwin: Starting problems", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<440A21BE.1080200@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<cdf76d820603041511t4c89c87dhd9e334d8784173ac@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun Mar  5 00:26:40 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance on Cygwin: Starting problems"}
