{"body": "\n\nThis was basically what Greg proposed in clear text (the\nxform-arguments of the mesh primitive, I just somehow managed to\ndescribe it 100x more complicated ;-). Jack's ideas are all right, my\nproblem is that I have existing files (many) and thus cannot change all\nmarkers. I also have files containing markers for some instances and\nreferences that come already scaled (as both obj2rad and dxf2rad\nprovide a scale option), with mappings fitting to those. So I cannot\npipe the output of replmarks. I will add a line to my script to write a\nsmall rad-file for each mesh, including the scale transformations, and\nuse that one with replmarks -x than.\n\nThanks, CU and good night, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 2134 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060301/26910de9/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2mesh and scaling?", "sender": "Lars O.
