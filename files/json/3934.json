Details: see README file of the package.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nYou can download the actual code (small changes included, that it\ncompiles under linux and cygwin) including the revised  README  at:\n\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance\n\nFor the evalglare users: Also a new version of evalglare is available at\nthe same location. If you are using a version older than 0.6 you should\nupdate, some errors were fixed.\n\n\nCheers\n\nJan\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
