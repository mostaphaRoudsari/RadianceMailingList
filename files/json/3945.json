Bright pools at the edges of walls/ceilings/etc. indicate a\nproblem.\nIf the inside doesn't show anything, place a light source inside and\nrender\nviews from the outside without sky.\n\n\nThere is no point in recreating a model if you don't know what was wrong\nwith the first one.\n\nPlease also post your questions in proper English and provide as much\ninformation as you can. If you want us to take the time for meaningful\nreplies you should take the time to type an understandable question.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080722/4729d3fe/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] light leakage problem", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Jul 22 11:44:28 2008"}
