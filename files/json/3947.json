{"body": "\nDear John,\n\nI meant a different thing: The implementation of the Perez sky model in\nRADIANCE is made in a way, that you plug in site information and direct\nand diffuse irradiation (regardless if those values a measured data or\ntest reference years) and you will get a RADIANCE description of the sun\nas light and source. This model has been validated on different datasets\nin the past. If you change then the size of the source(from 0.533  to\n0.5) without a change of the \"light\" parameters (which are produce by\ngendaylit) and keeping all other factors, than you decrease the total\nflux of the sun (not of the sky, this remains the same since the\nparameters are the same). And therefore you get different results than\nusing the original version.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the accuracy of the input radiation data,\nwhich is another issue which could be discussed.\nIt's just a simple implementation matter of the tool. I totally agree\nthat the size change of the sun has no significant impact as long as the\ntotal flux is kept (which isn't in our case here).\n\nJan\n\nJohn Mardaljevic wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
