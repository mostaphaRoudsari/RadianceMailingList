(phi & theta are in the right order...)\n\n\n\n2) i created .rad file with:\n\n\n1 sphere (surface equals to .0056419m @ 10m hight ) as light geometry=20\n\nthe ground @0m height\n\n=20\n\n\nthe light material has this definition:\n\n\n<italic>void brightdata dist\n\n5 corr source.dat source.cal src_phi2 src_theta=20\n\n0\n\n1 2681\n\n\ndist light point\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3 1 1 1</italic>\n\n\nwhere 2681 is from: (1/179 * 48000lm/1000lm * 10000)=20\n\ni m working with 1 * 400W SAT  and a sphere of radius equals to\n.0056419....)\n\n\nNOW THE QUESTION:\n\ni used rtrace to calculate orizontal illuminance (echo \"x y z 0 0 1\" |\nrtrace -I+ *.oct):\n\nthe point under the light  (theta is 0) gives the same value  i\ncomputed manually:\n\nilluminance =3D intensity/height^2 * cos theta where theta =3D 0)\n\n\nthe bad thing is that points with different angles give not right\nvalues ( i tried 45=B0 and 30=B0 that are from .dat file)\n\n(i got an error 10% plus or minus)\n\n\nwhat's the matter???\n\nsome rtrace's settings.... what else?\n\n\nthanks for every kind of advice you'll gave me\n\n\n\npillo (g.antonutto)\n\n\n</excerpt>=\n\n--Apple-Mail-2-249023672--\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] about luminaire modeling", "sender": "pillo", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D4896F67-CA04-11D6-ADA2-0003930BCBE6@tin.it>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 17 Sep 2002 08:15:14 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] about luminaire modeling"}
