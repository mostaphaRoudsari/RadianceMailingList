Why do you\nsuspect 'light leakage'? To high values for daylight factor?\n\n\nFirst check your material definitions. If you have windows and your glass\nmaterial is incorrect too much light might enter the room through the\nwindow panes.\n\n\nIf you think that the geometry is the problem try a few fisheye views of the\ninside. Bright pools at the edges of walls/ceilings/etc. indicate a problem.\nIf the inside doesn't show anything, place a light source inside and render\nviews from the outside without sky.\n\n\nIs thr ne odr option except reconstructing model..? I have done my Model in ecotect....\n\n\nThere is no point in recreating a model if you don't know what was wrong\nwith the first one.\n\n\nPlease also post your questions in proper English and provide as much\ninformation as you can. If you want us to take the time for meaningful\nreplies you should take the time to type an understandable question.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080724/6c558d56/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleich", "datetime": "Thu Jul 24 06:18:44 2008"}
