{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI have problems with macbethcal. I use it with a scanned photo of the\nmacbeth-target, as I have some mappings and material definitions to do. But I\ndon't reasonable results. If I use the \"debug\"-option (-d debug.pic), the\nright side of the square (the \"calibrated\" one ) is black, while I don't get\nwarnings by macbethcal itself.\n\nHow much tolerance concerning the color fields of the macbeth chart does\nmabethcal provide, e.g how big is the region per color field the program uses\nfor it's calculation? And is it ok to have variatons per field, does it\ncalculate an average color per field?\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
