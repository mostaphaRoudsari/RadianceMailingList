{"body": "\nFabienne,\nIf I understand your problem correctly, then the DOS window appears and then\nquickly disappears without any error message. If this is the case, the most\nlikely cause of your problem is that you have defined a material that\nRadiance cannot find (as Christoph mentioned). What I would recommend as a\ntroubleshooting step is to redefine the materials of all objects in your\nmodel into a material in the Ecotect library, and then try rendering. Please\nlet us know if the issue persists.\n\n--\nJohn An\nEnvironmental Designer\nAtelier Ten\n45 East 20th Street\nNew York, NY 10003\n212-254-4500 (o)\n212-254-1259 (f)\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John An", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C06CF19D.1521%ja@a10nyc.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Apr 20 14:07:05 2006", "email": "ja at a10nyc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Import from Ecotect to Radiance"}
