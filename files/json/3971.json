Having many surfaces for each ray, all having function\nevaluations, is bound to be slow.  Combining or eliminating such\ncalls would help a lot.  I don't know enough about your situation to\nrecommend \"how.\"\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun Jul 27 15:35:08 2008"}
