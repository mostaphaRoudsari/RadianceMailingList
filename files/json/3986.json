The location used is Dubai (United Arab\nEmirates), and because this location is not available I had to define it.\nAlthough I had all the required parameters, when I do the runs the results\ndoes not seem to  change, and to check it out correctly I tried to do the\nruns during night times, around 10 pm and to my surprise I had light in\nthe space.\nCould anyone help..\n\nThank you,\nMaitha Dalmouk\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Maitha Dalmouk Al-Nuaimi", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<43871.209.189.225.226.1145909289.squirrel@neoweb.tamu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Apr 24 22:08:19 2006", "email": "m.dalmouk at tamu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylight Simulation"}
