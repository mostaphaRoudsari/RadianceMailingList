{"body": "\nHi Adriana,\n\nWhat do you want your surface to look like?  What do you want your\nnormals to do?\n\nThe string arguments of the \"texfunc\" primitive define expressions\nfor a \"perturbation\" of the surface normal, i.e., a value to be added\nto the default surface normal.  In your example, depending on the\nvalues of A1, A2, and A3 (and assuming \"PZ\" should have been \"Pz\"),\nyou would get a surface normal that would change gradually according\nto the position in 3-dimensional space, forcing whatever object was\ncovered to have a surface normal resembling that of a sphere the\nlarger the object became.  This seems a very strange goal to me.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Textures: perturbations in x,y,z normals", "sender": "Gregory J.
