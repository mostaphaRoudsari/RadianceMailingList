So\nrpiece can take rpict arguments, and -PP is an rpict argument telling\nit to fork as necessary, is it a good idea to pass that along to\nrpiece?\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried running enough rpiece -PP commands for each\nprocessor and wound up with a bunch of rpieces running but only one of\nthose had rpicts that were actually doing anything. Additionally, I\nthink rpict thought it as doing a sequence of frames. The images\nappear to be rendering, but is this the proper method? Are rpict -PP\nand rpiece mutually exclusive on platforms that support both?\n\nThanks in advance,\n--Dave\n\n\nP.S. - Here's the process tree from htop:\n\n`[...two more rpiece's like the first two below]\n|\n|\n|\n`- rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @arguments\n|   `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n|       `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @arguments\n|   `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n|       `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @arguments\n`- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpict -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpict -PP pp -w -i [...]\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Smith", "datetime": "Fri Aug  8 07:00:14 2008"}
