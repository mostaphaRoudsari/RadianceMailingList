So far, we have titles\nfrom a handful of presenters, and abstracts from just a few.  It\nseems to happen this way every year, but the sooner we get these\nmaterials, the better everyone's experience will be.  So, if at all\npossible, please send a complete abstract via e-mail to Rapha?l\nCompagnon <Raphael.Compagnon@hefr.ch> and myself\n<gregoryjward@gmail.com> by this Friday, August 15th.\n\nThank you.\n-Greg\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
