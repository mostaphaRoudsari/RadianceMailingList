{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nOK, i think i was dead wrong! Thinking about some things makes your\nbrain go crazy.\nBut i don't want to give up. I went through your paper, several times,\nand through your discussion with Will on the list about \"specifying\nsources\".\nAdditionally i read \"Tools for Lighting Design an Analysis\".\nTo get this right from scratch:\n\n1. I have reflectance values for surfaces in XYZ. Measured with an\nspectrofotometer with a D65 test source inside. Actually it was the same\nMinolta CM-2002 as in your paper. I have data with and without the\nspecular component. (SCI or SCE) Which on would you suggest or does it\ndepend on the surface?\n\n2. These surfaces are to be seen in a scene with sources which have\ncolor temperatures ranging from 2400 to 3000 Kelvin.\nFor these sources i calculated the xy coordinates with blackbody.cal.\n\n3. I think this is the first problem.  The reflectance values for the\nsurfaces should have been measured with a tungsten test illuminant in\nthe spectrofotometer.\nAnd the spectral data would have been better than XYZ. Is that right?\n\n4. As i understand you in your conversation with Will, the\npremultiplying part is only efficient if i would have spectral data. If\ni have only XYZ data, i convert both reflectance values and color values\nof the sources to Sharp RGB color space like so:\nrcalc    -f xyz_rgb.cal      -f Sharp.cal    -e '$1=R($1,$2,$3);\n$2=G($1,$2,$3);  $3=B($1,$2,$3);'\n\n5. Now i render my picture and add the correct primaries to the picture\nheader with your suggested script. (addSharp.csh)\n\n6. When i call 'ximage' with rtrace -I, i should get the right\nilluminance values or not?\n\n7. To change the primaries for a special display i use 'pcond' later. I\nguess 'pcond' does a white point transformation?\n\n8. Does 'normtiff' does a white point transformation as well?\n\nWould this procedure be the best what i can get out if my data for\n\"correct\" color display?\nMany thanks again and regards,\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<20060425165232.5401gmx1@mx013.gmx.net>", "sender": "Christian Fusenig", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4450B140.5090701@gmx.de>", "refs": ["<20060425165232.5401gmx1@mx013.gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr 27 13:55:58 2006", "email": "christian_fusenig at gmx.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Re: Again transmissivity for color filter,/ glass"}
