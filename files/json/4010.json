(I am doing this to create a powerpoint slide that\nillustrates that luminance can be extracted from each pixel in a radiance\nimage for a very general audience).\n\n(Actually i click a pixel on the image in Photosphere and then track down\nit's record in the pvalue output)\n\nI noticed that the 0,0 Origin in Photosphere is the upper left corner, and\nfor Radiance images it is the lower left (i believe ? ).\n\nSince my image is 1536 x 1536 pixels, pixel x=256,y=550 in Photosphere is\nthen row:\n\nx=256, y=abs(550 - 1536), brightness.value\n\n. . . . as output from Pvalue.\n\nI take brightness.value*179 to get my pixel luminance and it matches\nclosely with the output from Photosphere, but not exactly. I want to ask\nif I am using the correct conversion from pvalue's output to luminance,\nand that my understanding of the (0,0) origin locations in Radiance and\nPhotosphere is correct.\n\n\nI'm a relatively new user so any help would be appreciated!\n\nKyle\n\n******************************************\nKyle Konis\nPhD Student\nLawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)\nUC Berkeley Center for the Built Environment (CBE)\n206.303.9786\n******************************************\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "kkonis@berkeley.edu", "datetime": "Sat Aug 16 19:51:49 2008"}
