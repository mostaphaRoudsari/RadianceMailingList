I'm finally sitting on a dual-processor\nbox here at work, though I have insufficient RAM here to render\nthe kinds of scenes that I want. The image for SIGGRAPH this\nyear will probably take up 1.5 GB of RAM once the ambient cache\nbecomes fully populated. I'm shooting for a final resolution of\n28800x14400 pixels.\n\nA year or two ago, someone submitted a speed test for the\nsame scene, Paul's bench2, using a dual-processor box and\nrad/rpiece. See note 8 on my bechmark page. The author found\na 1.6 speedup for dual processors using 20-25 divisions in\nrad/rpiece.\n\nIs there no newer gcc for OSX than 3.1?\n\nMark\n\nOn Wed, 4 Jun 2003, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance timings on PowerMac", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Wed, 4 Jun 2003 14:29:48 -0400 (EDT)"}
