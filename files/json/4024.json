I also looked at the examples in the rtcontutor\ndirectory (which seems to have disappeared in the 3R9 tar ball). The\ngeometry you used for the light ducts is relatively simple. I am\nparticularly interested in round light pipes, not square light ducts.\n\nI noticed that in model.mat, you define the material for the duct as\nmetal, only to immediately re-define it as mirror:\n\n----------------8<-----------------\nvoid metal mirror_mat\n0\n0\n5 .9 .9 .9 1 0\n\nvoid mirror mirror_mat\n0\n0\n3 .9 .9 .9\n----------------8<-----------------\n\nI understand why you would prefer mirror instead of metal: it creates\nvirtual sources of the sun, dealing with the direct component. So\nwould the only option with a round pipe be to break it up into\npolygons?\n\nIt strikes me that this particular example of rtcontrib is useful for\ndemonstrating its use with sky components, so a large number of sky\ndistributions and sun positions may be computed rather quickly once\nthe coefficients (individual images) are generated. Guess you used the\nlight ducts simply to add some interest to the scene. The same scene\ncomplexity could as well have been simulated without rtcontrib if an\nanimation (\"input/output relations\", as you called it) was not sought.\n\nMany thanks\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lightpipes and rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Aug 22 17:35:18 2008"}
