I vaguely\nremember simple skylights like in Walmart performing better than roof\nmonitors with louvers or something to that effect.\n\nI don't even know if there is a paper written up on the subject matter. I do\nnot have Prof Moeck's current contact information so I'm hoping to find him\nor someone else who can help through this email.\n\nThanks,\n\nRAMANA KOTI Assoc.
