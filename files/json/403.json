It's a hack to\navoid artifacts.  You're right that it cannot enclose any geometry this\nway.\n\n\nWhatever you need to enclose the geometry you create.\n\n\nThe A2, A3, and A4 arguments should be in meters.  Where did you get\nthe 0.815 value?  I assume this is a lumen depreciation factor.\n\n\nYou should use whatever corresponds to your -d? option -- inches in\nthis case.  I would recommend generating the box in meters then adding\n-s 39.37 to your xform command to make it clear:\n\n!genbox light2_light light2.s 1.363 .305 .0921 \\\n| xform -s 39.37 -t -26.8125 -6 -1.8125\n\n\nThey should be close -- they don't have to be exact.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: direct/indirect photometric", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 4 Jun 2003 11:49:33 -0700"}
