{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\n\nWhy is the filter material not shiny?  Does it have a rough texture\nthat scatters light?  If it is solid and transmits light, then it\nalso reflects light.  It might have a low index of refraction if it\nis a gel filter, similar to water with n=1.3, whose surface\nreflection is around 2%.  You can give the index of refraction to the\nglass type as a fourth argument.  (If you give a value of 1.0, there\nwill be no reflection at all.)\n\nWhether you end up using 'glass' or 'trans' as your material, be sure\nto leave a small gap between the surface you use for your filter and\nthe surfaces you use for your cylinder.  Otherwise, the rays will see\none or the other surface at random.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "<4451EAD2.8000902@gmx.de>", "sender": "Gregory J.
