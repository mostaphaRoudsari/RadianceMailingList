{"body": "\nDear Community,\n\nEvents have necessitated that the dates of the workshop be moved back\nto Wed/Thu 13/14 September (original dates were 11/12 September).\n\nApologies for this change which has proved unavoidable.  I have\ninformed everybody that has already expressed an interest (e-mail\nsent 26 April) but I expect there are others that have not yet\ncontacted me.\n\nI will post a flyer about the event next week once I get some details\nabout presentations that have already been offered.\n\nRegards,\n\n-John Mardaljevic\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<0D23EE04-B5B0-4432-84FF-CCEC45E45AE3@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Apr 27 17:43:27 2006", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] URGENT: Proposed shift of dates for the Radiance2006 Workshop"}
