The whole\nexercise seems a bit exotic, what's your reason not to use rpict ?\n\nShould you'll be looking for converting from a pic file (rendered by\nrpict or rview) to PPM, use ra_ppm .\n\nregards\nPeter\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3D9C0093.B10A7097@pab-opto.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 03 Oct 2002 10:32:19 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] transform from Radiance to PPM fileReferences: <3D99C77A.67FC2696@itc.it>"}
