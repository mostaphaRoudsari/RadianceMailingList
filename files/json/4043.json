For example I thought that setting\nQuality=High and Variability=High will give an -ad parameter above 1024.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rif settings: quality variability detai", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Fri Sep  5 08:45:09 2008"}
