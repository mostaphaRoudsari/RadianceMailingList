{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\nI'm afraid you lost me, here.\n\n\nOK, I see these values on the URL you sent earlier <http://\nwww.leefilters.com/LPFD.asp?PageID=193>.\n\n\nSince the XYZ values were measured using a 3200 K tungsten\nilluminant, converting to sRGB only gives you back the same orange\ncolor.  You haven't really changed illuminants, because xyz_srgb.cal\ndoesn't do a white-point conversion.\n\n\nDoes the scene your simulating use a tungsten source or not?  If it\ndoes, you should model it as a pure white light, because you have\nincorporated the illuminant color into your filter.  (This isn't a\ngood idea for transmission as the angular function will be incorrect.)\n\n\nThis where you lost me completely.  What made you think to subtract\neach value from 1?  It doesn't work that way, even if it gets you\nwhat you were expecting.\n\n\nIf you want blue out of your filter from a tungsten source, you won't\nget it.  You'll get something bluer than the source, but not truly\nblue.  This all gets involved in the white balance issue, which I\ncover in depth in the paper I keep mentioning:\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/\n\nI know it's a difficult read, but until you understand white\nbalancing, colors are going to look consistently wrong to your eyes.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Again transmissivity for color filter / glass", "sender": "Gregory J.
