In fact,\nthe spheremap nonsense is simply the projection of the fisheye view onto an\nobject.

This angular distribution then is of course\nindependent from the point of view, as it should be.\n\nOK, this all is self evident and not worth to be mentioned at all for the\nexperienced scientists, but  - - -\n\nCarsten\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Wed, 4 Jun 2003 22:30:01 +0000"}
