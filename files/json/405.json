{"body": "\nHi Anton,\n\nWhat you describe sounds a bit like a bug, so I looked into it.\nHowever, my tests indicate that version 3.4 (at least) of\nRadiance is working correctly for the glass type.  What\nversion/platform are you using?  Are you certain it is not\nan exposure issue -- that your level is set so that everything\nis clamped to white no matter what the actual color is?\n(You can use pfilt or the ximage '=' command to change\nthe exposure.)\n\nUsing mkillum may actually average the window contribution\nto white if you do not use the correct options, but just a\nregular glass window should work without mkillum, really.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<AA-20373E0E1E8B64A1D02B32C4F7337E3C-ZZ@www2.prodigy.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 03 Oct 2002 09:09:25 -0500", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: trouble creating coloured window glass"}
