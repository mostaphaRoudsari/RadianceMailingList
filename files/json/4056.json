The ximage viewer from Radiance package\nexpects radiance values in RGBE files and uses the WHITE_EFFICACY\nconstant equal to 179.0f to convert from radiance to luminance. This in\npractice means that the values displayed with pfsview maybe higher than\nexpected. To compensate for this incompatibility we suggest to use\npfsabsolute command:\n\npfsinrgbe measured_luminance.hdr | pfsabsolute 1 179 | pfsview\n\nThis is not necessary when RGBE files are saved using pfsoutrgbe,\nRadiance package, mkhdr or Photospheare. This is also not relevant when\nonly relative absolute values are considered.\"\n--\n\nCan you please try the work-around and tell us if you get the expected\nresults than?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n[1] http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/pfstools/man1/pfsinrgbe.1.html\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080906/49636260/smime-0001.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Pvalue for converting to luminanc", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
