On irradiance image when I try to trace value\nof some pixel on the window surface, what do I get? Is it irradiance of the\nobjects behind the window (outside ground, buildings etc)? Does\nwindow/curtain transmittance has an influence on reported value?\n\nWhat happens for surfaces made of transparent BRTfunc materials (like double\nglazing)? Are they ignored too, or their irradiance value is reported?\n\nThanks again,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080909/871a5230/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<8DA1BD2B-A662-46EB-9269-FE6F9DD60E9D@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Tue Sep  9 01:42:49 2008"}
