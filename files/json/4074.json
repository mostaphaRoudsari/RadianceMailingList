Jacobs and some of the\ntutorials in Rendering with Radiance, but I have not come across a text\ndescribing how to obtain the different contributions to the total\nilluminance on a surface. I would like to hear how I can obtain the direct,\ndiffuse and reflected component of the illuminance? Do I have to find the\nparameters in the source code, or is there someone who has made it easy for\nme and created a command for this (my fingers are crossed)?\n\n\n\nIn advance ?
