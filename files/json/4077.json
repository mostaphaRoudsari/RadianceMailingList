In RadDisplay tool\nhttp://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html you can define\ncustom palette for radiance images.\n\nPalette is not defined with the functions (we didn't implement that\nfeature yet), but you can select individual palette colors or define\nstart and end color and program will generate the palette. You can\nalso define palette maximum and minimum value, which can also be very\nhelpful in some cases.\n\nIf you must follow the formula then it is better to work with\nfalsecolor program.\n\nMarija\n\nOn Thu, Sep 18, 2008 at 12:10 AM, David Smith <dbs176@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Custom false color palett", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Thu Sep 18 01:44:06 2008"}
