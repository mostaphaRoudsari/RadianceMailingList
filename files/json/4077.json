{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nAs Vangelis pointed out in an earlier post, Desktop Radiance is out\nof date -- about 7 years and counting.  Unfortunately, there's no way\nto bring it up to date, and the current effort is to put out a\nWindows edition of the current version.  Large parts of the system\ncompile, but there appear to be some problems remaining with the\nparallel processing bits and rvu, which needs a user interface or a\nworking X11 server.  This is why some people are using the Cygwin\nbinaries, which run in a subenvironment to Windows.\n\nPersonally, I think you're 10 times better off with FreeBSD, Linux,\nor OS X if you want to run Radiance.  The latest iMac's and MacBook\nPro are basically as fast as the PC's, if a little more expensive.\nThey're also better built, unless you're willing to spend the time\nbuilding your own machine, as some people like to do.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] desktop vs compile?", "sender": "Gregory J.
