{"body": "\nHello,\n\n\n\nThanks for your answer Christoph, I have done what you said but I fear that my problem is something about installation. I already have a Windows-based version of Radiance but it was telling me: \"C:\\Adeline3\\bin\\rad.exe: error running rview\"\n\nI think the Radiance program is not well-installed because it does not work with Ecotect neither.\n\nCould this message appear because the view is not well defined too?\n\nMoreover, does anyone has used Adeline before and think it is reliable?\n\n\n\nFabienne\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nDe: radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] En nombre de Reinhart, Christoph\nEnviado el: mi?rcoles, 19 de abril de 2006 19:10\nPara: Radiance general discussion\nAsunto: RE: [Radiance-general] import from Ecotect to Radiance\n\n\n\nHi Fabienne,\n\n\n\nYou have to install Desktop (or another Windows-based version of Radiance) before you can use it with ECOTECT. In order to install Desktop Radiance, you can follow these instructions -> http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/arch447/fall2005/Radiance/InstallDesktopRadiance.html. Good luck,\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Wednesday, April 19, 2006 11:43 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nHello,\n\n\n\nI am just starting to use Radiance. I would like to know how to import from Ecotect to Radiance. I already have my building defined in 3D by the software Ecotect, I tried it but it seems to have a problem and the rendering image does not work. Does anybody had this problem before and knows how to solve it?\n\nIn the documentation of Ecotest it was said that you have to create a camera view inside the building and then exporting to radiance simply but it could happen that there is an installation issue and the windows that is supposed to appear disappear.\n\nAt this first step I really do not know what\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060420/6ede2a33/attachment-0001.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<818242D66AA6E643B1EC61F5DEE28DE2D8091B@CSRVEXCHANGE.incener.local>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Apr 20 11:32:32 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] import from Ecotect to Radiance"}
