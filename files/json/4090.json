{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\n\n\nThe glass material is probably a better approximation in this case,\nas it will account for the change in reflection and transmission with\nangle.\n\n\nThat is correct.  If you set the -dj option to something between 0.5\nand 0.8, you will sample over a larger subregion.  (A setting of -dj\n1 is allowed, but only works if all the sources in your scene are\nrectangular.)\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "<44468A27.8070605@gmx.de>", "sender": "Gregory J.
