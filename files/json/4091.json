However, I'm not sure how to interpret the results!  To test I\ncreated a flat ground plane and looked at the cumulative map - the\nresults were about 822kWh/m2.yr when I traced points on the original kWh\nimage and approximately the same in the false coloured kWh image.  If I\nlooked at the source EPW data I found a cumulative global horizontal\nradiation to be more like in the region of  1200kWh/m2.yr.  Shouldn't\nthey be the same (assuming I set lat/lon/mer correctly)?\n\nThe MJ scaled image didn't make much sense - I thought that 1kWh is\n3.6MJ, but I get a much lower result when I look at MJ than kWh.\n\nAre there any papers describing the program in more detail (I've looked\nonly briefly at the man page and a .pdf presentation so I'm probably\nmissing something)?\n\nThanks,\n\nNick\n\nOn Thu, 18 Sep 2008 15:02:13 +0200, \"Jelle Feringa\"\n<jelleferinga@gmail.com> said:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] radmap (on windows)", "tags": [], "sender": "Nick Doylend", "datetime": "Sun Sep 21 15:47:34 2008"}
