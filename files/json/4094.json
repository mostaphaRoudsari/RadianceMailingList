This\nis causing the big difference, I assume.\nBut  be careful: -R is expecting horizontal direct irradiation, not\ndirect normal irradiance!\n\nJan\n\nNicolas Roy wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080922/5243b335/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] DAYSIM vs. Radiance illuminance values", "tags": [], "sender": "Jan Wienold", "datetime": "Mon Sep 22 07:47:23 2008"}
