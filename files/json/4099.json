{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\nThe two spectra do not have to be normalized to the same value.  In\nfact, you can multiply the cspec output by mgfilt by the lumens of\nyour light source and the transmission of your filter (between 0 and\n1 at each wavelength) and get something related to the lumen output\nover the spectrum.\n\nMan pages for MGF can be found on the website -- I assumed you had this:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: Re Re: [Radiance-general] mgfilt, degree Kelvin into spectral data", "sender": "Gregory J.
