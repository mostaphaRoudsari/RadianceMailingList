{"body": "\nHi Gurneet,\n\nI will try to answer your question. Based on your description the aspect\nratio of the images is 1 to 2 (X to Y).\n\nFirst thing to note is that the picture.cal function depends on a\nparticular assumption about aspect ratio. For the sake of this function\naspect ratio is considered as (Y/X) with the following implications (I\nhope I get this correct as I do not have RwR in front of me):\n\n1. if Y/X > 1, (vertical aspect ratio) then the unit dimension of the\npicture is the X dimension\n2. if Y/X = 1, then the picture is unit dimension 1x1\n3. if Y/X < 1, (horizontal aspect ratio) then the unit dimension of\nthe picture is the Y dimension\n\nSo in your case the following material definition should work\n\nvoid colorpict 10by20image\n9 red green blue your_image.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 10\n0\n1 2\n\nsince the image is vertical in aspect if we scale by 10 then we get an\nimage that takes up 10x20 units.\n\nNow to get an image to tile automagically, you can use the tile_u tile_v\nfunctions of picture.cal as follows:\n\nvoid colorpict 10by20image.tile\n9 red green blue your_image.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v -s 10\n0\n1 2\n\nThis should get you 10 tiles in X and 5 tiles in Y on a surface that\nmeasure 100x100. Note that you will need to apply transformations (-rx,\n-rz, -ry, -t x y z) if the geometry is not located at the origin or is\ntransformed out of the x,y plane.\n\nHope this helps (and that I do not have things backwards on the aspect\nration stuff).\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nG.S.Monga wrote:\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060405/37c20854/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] reg texture/picture mapping", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4433C1A8.6060902@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<A609792C-66DC-4CD7-BC9F-46C7647DD668@dmu.ac.uk>", "<019901c65880$135b8160$6600a8c0@gurneet>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr  5 15:10:26 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] reg texture/picture mapping"}
