It is illegal to refer to an undefined index\nin obj2rad, hence the reported error.  None of the other OBJ file\nconverters will like it, either.  The faces up until that point in\nthe file don't use vertex normals, so they pass without complaint.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  To those of you confused by this exchange, Erwin sent me his\nOBJ file in a separate e-mail at my request.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: obj2rad failing", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Oct  7 22:20:44 2008"}
