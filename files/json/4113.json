This means that Archicad produces faulty OBJ files or something went wrong during the export. I will have to ask the folks who gave me the file. I tried importing this file into other modellers, some of them seem to ignore all faulty objects, and some of them import everything only up to that line. But I have not checked this out in great detail. Maybe I can implement some kind of syntax checker that does some sanity checks on obj files before I throw them at obj2rad. I guess my goal will be to import at least the geometry, even if the vn or vt info is not correct.\nRegards,\nErwin\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nTo:      radiance@rendigo.com\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "datetime": "Tue Oct  7 23:44:57 2008"}
