It was great.\nI found myself agreeing with everything you wrote.  Thanks for using my\nimage, I sent the link to my family and friends (I'm such a tool).  One\nthing though, could you add ArupLighting to the image credit?\n\nThanks,\nAndrew\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Sunday, October 06, 2002 10:21 PM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHowdy folks-\n\nI just wanted to drop a line to let you know that a brief article about\nthe recent Radiance Workshop was published on CGArchitect.com, a\ncomputer graphics website run by a friend of mine.  The story should\nshow up on the main page (www.cgarchitect.com) in an hour or so, but\nthe direct link will take you there now:\n\nhttp://www.cgarchitect.com/news/Reviews/Review013_1.asp\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to say that I had a great time there,\nand learned a lot.  It was great to meet some folks I have known\nelectronically for many years!  I wanted to send the editor a copy of\nthe picture Greg took of all of us, but my email for the last 24 hours\nhas been fairly well screwed up.  I seem to be able to send, but cannot\nreceive.  This, as you may expect, is causing me a great deal of\nfrustration.  Raphael, keep trying.  I hope to have my email back up by\ntomorrow, or I look for another host!!\n\nAs an aside, I am deeply depressed over the early exit of the New York\nYankees from baseball's post season.  But I am enjoying watching the\nAtlanta Braves get spanked by the Giants this evening.  (I'm fully\naware that the majority of the workshop attendees could not care less\nabout the whims of a band of jocks swinging a wooden stick at a hurled\nball, but I feel the need to vent.)\n\nI hope you all had a good return trip from the workshop.  When's the\nnext one? ;-)\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C26F0A.FDD29E30\nContent-Type: text/html;\ncharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN\">\n<HTML>\n<HEAD>\n<META HTTP-EQUIV=3D\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=3D\"text/html; =\ncharset=3Diso-8859-1\">\n<META NAME=3D\"Generator\" CONTENT=3D\"MS Exchange Server version =\n5.5.2653.12\">\n<TITLE>RE: [Radiance-general] Radiance Workshop article</TITLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi Rob,</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I finally got around to reading your article on =\ncgarchitect.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; I found myself agreeing with =\neverything you wrote.&nbsp; Thanks for using my image, I sent the link =\nto my family and friends (I'm such a tool).&nbsp; One thing though, =\ncould you add ArupLighting to the image credit?</FONT></P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Thanks,</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Andrew</FONT>\n</P>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>-----Original Message-----</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>From: Rob Guglielmetti [<A =\nHREF=3D\"mailto:rpg@rumblestrip.org\">mailto:rpg@rumblestrip.org</A>]</FON=\nT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Sent: Sunday, October 06, 2002 10:21 PM</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>To: radiance-general@radiance-online.org</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Workshop =\narticle</FONT>\n</P>\n<BR>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Howdy folks-</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I just wanted to drop a line to let you know that a =\nbrief article about </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>the recent Radiance Workshop was published on =\nCGArchitect.com, a </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>computer graphics website run by a friend of =\nmine.&nbsp; The story should </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>show up on the main page (www.cgarchitect.com) in an =\nhour or so, but </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>the direct link will take you there now:</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2><A =\nHREF=3D\"http://www.cgarchitect.com/news/Reviews/Review013_1.asp\" =\nTARGET=3D\"_blank\">http://www.cgarchitect.com/news/Reviews/Review013_1.as=\np</A></FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I'd like to take this opportunity to say that I had a =\ngreat time there, </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>and learned a lot.&nbsp; It was great to meet some =\nfolks I have known </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>electronically for many years!&nbsp; I wanted to =\nsend the editor a copy of </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>the picture Greg took of all of us, but my email for =\nthe last 24 hours </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>has been fairly well screwed up.&nbsp; I seem to be =\nable to send, but cannot </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>receive.&nbsp; This, as you may expect, is causing =\nme a great deal of </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>frustration.&nbsp; Raphael, keep trying.&nbsp; I =\nhope to have my email back up by </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>tomorrow, or I look for another host!!</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>As an aside, I am deeply depressed over the early =\nexit of the New York </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Yankees from baseball's post season.&nbsp; But I am =\nenjoying watching the </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Atlanta Braves get spanked by the Giants this =\nevening.&nbsp; (I'm fully </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>aware that the majority of the workshop attendees =\ncould not care less </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>about the whims of a band of jocks swinging a wooden =\nstick at a hurled </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>ball, but I feel the need to vent.)</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I hope you all had a good return trip from the =\nworkshop.&nbsp; When's the </FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>next one? ;-)</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Rob Guglielmetti</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>rpg@rumblestrip.org</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>www.rumblestrip.org</FONT>\n</P>\n\n<P><FONT =\nSIZE=3D2>_______________________________________________</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Radiance-general mailing list</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Radiance-general@radiance-online.org</FONT>\n<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2><A =\nHREF=3D\"http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general=\n\" =\nTARGET=3D\"_blank\">http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radian=\nce-general</A></FONT>\n</P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C26F0A.FDD29E30--\n\n------=_NextPartTM-000-92f77583-2341-4022-8a2c-fbff8ef5aa3e--\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "rpg@rumblestrip.org", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<373E115448042A408DD136870F3FE04CC649CA@n-ynts07.us.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 8 Oct 2002 21:40:51 +0100", "email": "Rob Guglielmetti", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Workshop article"}
