However, I still have problems with the\nilluminance values. I am defining it like this:\n\nvoid colorpict skyfunc\n7 noop noop noop sky_orig.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 180\n0\n1 1\n\nAnd then using skyfunc normally, like from gensky. The \"mapped\" sky gives me\nan illuminance 5 to 7 times lower than the original sky (although the\ndistribution is the same). I could define the sky source seven times\nstronger to compensate, but I`m sure there must be an explanation for this\nand a correct solution. Please, what am I doing wrong?\n\nAnother problem is when I apply the sky to a scene with a room and a window.\nIf I follow Greg`s method to define the window, it works perfect, however if\nI use the mapping to define a sky and then define a window as I would do\nwith a \"gensky`d\" sky, there seems to be no direct sunlight in the room.\nAgain, what am I doing wrong?\n\nI assumed that the mapping to source could replace gensky more or less\ndirectly, but it seems I am missing something. Sorry for bothering again and\nthanks in advance for your help,\n\nSantiago.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "tags": [], "sender": "Santiago Torres", "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jun 2003 12:55:10 +0900"}
