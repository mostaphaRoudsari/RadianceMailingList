{"body": "\nHi list!\n\n\nI have a model that is getting close to 2GB here.\n\n\nMost floating point values are doubles, thus 64bit. Still, the whole\n64bit-point is about address pointers. All the old \"32-bit\" cpus support\ncalculations on 64bit values - double floats are not that new (a SSE2\nunit as found in recent 32bit intel cpus can even perform calculations\non 2 64bit values at once). So we are only talking about increasing the\namount of addressable memory here.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong. I am not a cpu expert. But do not compile\nRadiance in 64 bit if you do not need memory. If you do, take a look at\ncompilers. E.g. Sun has a free compiler that is known to produce 64 bit\ncode that can compete with 32 bit in speed.\n\nLars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3485 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060505/e1d7cb9a/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] compiling Radiance 64-bit?", "sender": "Lars O.
