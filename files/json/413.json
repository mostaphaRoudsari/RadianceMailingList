I think fisheye.cal just\nignores it.\n\n\nWhat is in sky_orig.pic?  Is it possible that you exposed it with pfilt\nor something -- you need to have the original values in there.  The\ndirect output of rpict should work, but passing it through pfilt would\nnot.\n\n\nGensky creates a separate source for the sun, whereas it gets included\nas a small spot in sky_orig.pic, which the indirect calculation is\nhard-pressed to find.  To get it to work as gensky, you would have to\ntake the solar source from gensky and reapply it in your model.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jun 2003 08:06:35 -0700"}
