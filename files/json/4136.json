This part\nworks fine.\n\nI also want to texture-map my cube,  and the texture should scale\ntogether with the geometry. I tried this several ways using brightfunc\n(with a modified version of  Mark Stock's checker.cal) and colorpict,\nhowever all my animations look similar to this:\n\nhttp://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~katja/cube.html\n\nInstead of what you see I would like the texture to \"squeeze\" (i.e.\nstripes getting thinner in z-direction) as the object shrinks in height.\n\nIf any one could point me to information that helps me solving this\nproblem, that would be most appreciated.\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nKatja Doerschner\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Katja Doerschner", "datetime": "Wed Oct 22 08:08:42 2008"}
