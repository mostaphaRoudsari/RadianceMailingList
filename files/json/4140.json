The scripts are simple and\ngenerally follow the library model used in makeall. They work with the\ncurrent Radiance head and are very alpha--the scripts do not install\nthe built files and there are other limitations--but I think they\nmight be interesting for experimentation. If anyone is interested in\nexperimenting with them, I would be delighted to share them.\n\nRandolph\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "R Fritz", "datetime": "Thu Oct 23 10:38:49 2008"}
