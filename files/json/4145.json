The thing is, you are closer to real numbers than\nmost lighting designers, by having the wherewithal to tackle\nRadiance.  Don't short-change yourself.  A good model and sound\nparameters in Radiance beats any of the tools commonly used in\nlighting design, IMO.\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "<4462ABCD.9090406@becausewecan.org>", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<37989395-8767-4FCC-B378-15716735ADD3@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C39620118A757@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "<4462ABCD.9090406@becausewecan.org>"], "datetime": "Thu May 11 06:38:37 2006", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Glass & MTL file troubles...
