I personally still use trad a\nlot--it's convenient, fast, and doesn't get in the way.\n\ntrad still puts the old .pic extension on image files. The general\nconsensus nowadays seems to be to use .hdr. Since it's a quick\nfind-and-replace jobbie, may I propose to use this convention for rad\nand trad as well. I'd be happy to send you patch.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Sat Oct 25 07:20:17 2008"}
