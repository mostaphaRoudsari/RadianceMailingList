The \"hdr\" suffix has\ndefinitely been picked up by the mainstream as a Radiance image file,\nwhile the \"pic\" suffix gets confused for other types on the different\nsystems.  In this respect, I agree with Axel that it would be\nbeneficial to change this convention, if people are OK with that.\n\nAlthough I can see Rob's point that it's nice to have a suffix that\nuniquely identifies a Radiance-generated image from other possible\nsources, the de facto use of extensions does not support this these\ndays.  An extension indicates the file type, not its creator.\n\nIf anyone else has a good reason why we should not switch to using\n\".hdr\" in place of \".pic\" in rad/trad/etc. in the next release, now\nis the time to speak up.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR extension in rad, trad", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Oct 25 10:10:39 2008"}
