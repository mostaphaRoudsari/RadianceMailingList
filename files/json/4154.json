I don't remember what\nmodifications were, but I think if you try to compile daysim and look at the\nerrors the necessary modifications can be deciphered.\n\nI used Daysim version 2.2P2 (Linux) to do this.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn 7/18/08 3:04 AM, \"Tom Young\" <thdyoung@mac.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daysim on osx", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Mon Oct 27 11:39:06 2008"}
