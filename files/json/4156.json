{"body": "\nRamana,\n\nOkalux has nice product specifications at\n\nhttp://www.okalux.com/Okalux_2003/englisch/frames_e.html\n\nSelect \"Products\" at the bottom.\n\nThey have a good database since they specify the direct and diffuse light transmission, UV protection, U-value, sound reduction, etc. You can use those in pyramidal toplights. For a translation of the direct and diffuse light transmission into the Radiance trans material, see the radiance knowledge base and digests.I would also look into the glaze.cal script.\n\nDr. Martin Moeck, Pennsylvania State University\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Fri 5/12/2006 3:04 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello all,\n\nCan anyone point me to a commerical manufacturer's website where there's specifications of a diffuse skylight (preferably withouth well) that can be modeled in Optics and imported into Radiance material format? (Anything close or suggestions on an alternative way of doing it will work too!)\n\nRegards,\nRamana.\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\nwww.daylit.org\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5021 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060512/2aabfaa9/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Ramana Kot", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A1751205CFFEB548B3E78F10333DCF8805F110@ENGRMAIL1.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 12 21:28:29 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Ramana Koti", "subject": "[Radiance-general] diffuse skylight without well"}
