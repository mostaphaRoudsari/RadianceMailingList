I misinterpreted the phrase \"center of a parallel\nprojection\" in the rpict man page for -vp. I guess the plane version\nmakes more sense when you start to throw clipping planes into the mix.\nA negative -vo clipping plane an interesting concept, I hadn't\nconsidered that.\n\nI was looking at views from the sun, so I just subtracted a huge\nmultiple of the -vd vector from the -vp position and everything worked\nout well.\n\nThank you very much,\n\n--Dave\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Smith", "datetime": "Tue Nov  4 12:45:39 2008"}
