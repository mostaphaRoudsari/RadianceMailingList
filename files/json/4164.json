If the frit is on the inside\nyou have at least one surface that will produce specular reflections\nand might cause glare. A glass material would simulate that to some\ndegree. You can simulate the colour and transmittance with a trans\nmaterial behind the glass.\n\nIf you are interested in glare from reflected sunlight you should also\nconsider a 'mirror' material to trace the sun position more accurately.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081104/143c3ea3/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5AD4CD82E@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Nov  4 15:34:11 2008"}
