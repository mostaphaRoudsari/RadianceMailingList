I would suggest a reflectance of 50-60% for\nwhite marble.  The specularity is probably around 0.01 and a\nroughness of 0.08 for an unpolished surface is a reasonable guess.\nI would start using the \"glaze\" script, entering the above\nparameters.  This should give you good results.  Attached is what I\nused for your 60% fritted glass and the output produced.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n% glaze\nEnter the number of panes in the system: 1\n\nWindow normal faces interior\n\n| |\n| |\n| |\n| |-->\n| |\n| |\n| |\ns1 s2\n\nSupported surface types are:\n1 - clear glass\n2 - VE1-2M low-E coating\n3 - PVB laminated\n4 - V-175 white frit\n5 - V-933 warm gray frit\n\nWhat is the type of s1? 1\nWhat is the type of s2? 4\nEnter fraction coverage for s2 (0-1): .6\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision: 2.7 $\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 1\n# Exterior surface s1 type: clear glass\n# Interior surface s2 type: V-175 white frit\n# s2 coating coverage: .6\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.228534\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.384534\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.478928\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed\n10\nsr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\nst_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n0 0 0\nglaze1.cal\n0\n11\n0.354\n0.354\n0.354\n0.1536\n0.1518\n0.1506\n0.126\n0.126\n0.126\n-1      .6\n\n---------\nP.S.
