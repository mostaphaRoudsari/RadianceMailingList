Even for highly\nreflective, enclosed scenes, Radiance 3.7R2 with Russian-roulette\nenabled (-lr -20 or so) and no irradiance caching (-aa 0), you can\ngenerate many bounces to get a converged result.\n\nOf course, you are better off with a zonal cavity approximation at\nthat point!\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  You should seriously consider picking up a copy of \"Rendering\nwith Radiance\" from BookSurge.com <http://www.booksurge.com/\nproduct.php3?bookID=IMPR02587-00002>.
