{"body": "\nHi Martin,\n\nsome short comments to your suggestions:\n\nwould be a nice thing to have. Indeed, I already wrote something like\nthis (although not based on rpiece, but generally on a separate parallel\nprocessing library (PVM)). The problem is, however, that the succesive\nrefining scheme of rview needs a lot of data shuffling when sending the\noutput of different processes to the display, so the parallel rview came\nout really slooooooow, which is why I abandoned it and do parallel\nprocessing only in rpict mode.\n\ntry to include the picture/texture mapping and the object on which it is\nmapped in one file. When placing this file with xform to an arbitrary\nposition and orientation, the mapping function gets transformed\nautomatically as well\n\nthe smoothing option in e.g. gensurf (-s) works very well. I don't have\nany experience in cases when polygon meshes are imported from CAD\nprograms, although I already thought about an independent smoothing\nprocess which could be let loose on any given polygon set.\nQuestion: does the smoothing generally get lost when importing stuff\nfrom, say, Autocad ?\n\nwell, there's no easy way to accomplish difficult tasks. Intricate\ngeometry demands a high sampling density, interpolation always is some\nsort of 'secondary' measure which - no matter how sophisticated it is\nperformed - often reaches its limits rather soon . Nevertheless, I judge\nyour given settings to be very high. I had much succes in achieving\nvisually appealing images (judged not only by myself.. :) with far\nlesser parameter settings.\n\n-Carsten\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3DAD4E11.7C7AC960@t-online.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 16 Oct 2002 13:31:29 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance workshop, etc.References: <937AC68A9AFF694991B176C5E13831170185A411@engrmail1.cedcc.psu.edu>"}
