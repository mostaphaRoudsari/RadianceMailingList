Others have provided names of\nother CAD packages, some of which are available on Linux.\n\nHope this helps,\nbye\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] a note of thanks", "sender": "Ian Tester", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20060520111715.64b209b5@saavik.ian.testers.net.au>", "refs": ["<2C2E01334A940D4792B3E115F95B722631A561@exchsvr1.npl.ad.local>", "<446DB959.6000108@oriel.ox.ac.uk> <20060519153051.102570@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Sat May 20 03:17:39 2006", "email": "ian at testers.homelinux.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] a note of thanks"}
