{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI have been having problems rendering a glossy bumpy surface composed of\nintersecting ellipsoids illuminated under a rectangular light source.\nThe image appears to contain some random point source reflections on the\nsurface in addition to the direct reflection of the area light.\n\nTo view the rendered image, see:\nhttp://homepages.nyu.edu/~yxh201/bumpysurftest.jpg.\n\nThe bumpy surface is made of the following material:\nvoid plastic gray_plastic\n0\n0\n5 .2 .2 .2 .1482 0\n\nand a 30x24 flat rectangular light source is defined as:\nvoid light bright\n0\n0\n3 25 25 25\n\nI use the following parameters to render the scene:\n-ab 2 -aa .08 -ad 1024 -as 512 -av .2 .2 .2 -sj 1 -st .01 -dj 1 -ds .05\n\nAny suggestions to clean up the \"noise\" in the image? Much thanks...\n\n--xian\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Yun-Xian Ho", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4471A59B.2060301@nyu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon May 22 13:50:55 2006", "email": "yunxian.ho at nyu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gloss and area light source rendering problem"}
