Re-posted\nwith proper Subject line...\n\n\nJan Diepens of University of Technologie Eindhoven sent me a complete\nlist of RAL colours some time ago. I have to admit that they are still\nnot in the ColourPicker. I've put them up for your perusal:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/ral_mat.tgz\n\nIf anybody is going to translate the names to English, please bounce\nthe changes back to me for inclusion in the ColourPicker. The values\nwere measured with a Minolta chroma meter from samples. YXZ was then\nconverted to Radiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file, so the values\nshould be accurate.\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Nov  7 05:09:01 2008"}
