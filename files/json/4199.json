{"body": "\nYay! It works, Thanks!  I should have known to go straight for the\nHead...\n\nI'm surprised at how easy it is to use rtcontrib.  I've been avoiding it\nfor almost year because I assumed it was complex, but not so!

Ward\nSent: 23 May 2006 14:25\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi  Andrew,\n\nYou aren't really doing anything wrong, but the problem is that\nrtcontrib reports the contribution *coefficients*, which is not the\nsame thing as the contributions.  To get contributions, you need to\ndownload and compile the latest HEAD release, and use the new -V\noption to rtcontrib.  Then, you should get the results you expect.\nThis is a subtle point that I actually missed in the design of the\nprogram, which is why the option was only added more recently.  Here\nis the description from the new man page:\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n-----------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<5AE9E82331596E4C9F1A1B602407637D01A60113@ldcexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue May 23 16:34:04 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Rtcontrib with ies2rad"}
