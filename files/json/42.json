(I see, Chapter 7 of Rendering with Radiance\nwould say it, but it is not on-line and I've not the printed copy.)\n\ndark and peaceful skies,\nJenik Hollan\n\nPS.\nAs an advocate of prevention of light pollution\n(http://www.astro.cz/darksky is a hint, most my texts are just in Czech\nhowever), I need to be able to compute the same things as lighting\nprofessionals, but with a free software, of course.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jan Hollan", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Oct 2001 00:10:48 +0200 (CEST)"}
