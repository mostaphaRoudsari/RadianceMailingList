{"body": "\nGreg,\n\nsorry if I sounded too complicated. What I meant is simply:\n\nI have two machines,\n\nA. SGI INDIGO2, IRIX 6.5.22, MipsPro 7.4.2 compiler, \"Extreme\"\ngraphics\n\nB. SGI FUEL, IRIX 6.5.28, MipsPro 7.4.4 compiler, \"VPro12\"\ngraphics\n\nNow, after re-compilation on A and B respectively, I have on\n\nA. Radiance 3.1.11: ximage displays pics *ok\" color-wise\nRadiance 3.7.2: ximage displays pics *ok* color-wise\n\nB: Radiance 3.1.11: ximage displays pics *ok* color-wise\nRadiance 3.7.2: ximage displays pics *wrongly* color-wise\n\nPerhaps something in the way X visuals are selected changed from\n3.1 to 3.7 [my default on B is an 8-bit PseudoColor visual - but\nI could alter that to something else if necessary].\n\nMaybe it helps if I recompile 3.7.2 on B with -DDEBUG to see\nwhich visuals are recognized and which one is finally selected in\nx11image.c?\n\nBTW, running \"rmake ximage\" in ray/sr/px didn't change any...\n\nThanks.\n/oskar\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis e-mail and any files transmitted with it are intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to which they are addressed and may be legally privileged and/or confidential.
