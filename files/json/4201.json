I think both your RAL file as\nthe Kodak grayscale chart measurements I send in my earlier mail are\nvery usefull for Radiance.\n\nIn my previous mail I mistakenly wrote that we used a Kodak\nphotospectrometer for the grayscale chart from Kodak's Q-14 color\nseparation guide. That chart was also measured with a Minolta device, I\ndon't remember exactly wich model it was -  but it was a pretty advanced\none that we hired for two weeks, so the file wich the greyscale\nmeasurements should be accurate also (which are YXZ values converted to\nRadiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file).\n\nA list of all RAL colors in English (and other languages) can be found at:\nhttp://www.ral.de/en/ral_farben/anwender/farbnamen_classic.php\nI will be happy to translate it and send it back.\n\nMaybe we can discuss a little bit more about the issue if such accurate\nmeasurements could be part of the Radiance distribution? I like to hear\nmore about the pros and conts. My idea is that it would help users a lot.\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\nAxel Jacobs wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials..", "tags": [], "sender": "iebele", "datetime": "Mon Nov 10 01:52:14 2008"}
