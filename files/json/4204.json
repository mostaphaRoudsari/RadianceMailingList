{"body": "\nHi Oskar,\n\nI'm moving this to the Radiance development list, since it is a code\nissue that's of limited use to others.  Please respond there rather\nthan replying to this.  (You will need to subscribe first if you\naren't already on that list at <http://www.radiance-online.org/\nmailman/listinfo/radiance-dev>.)\n\nDefinitely run both versions of ximage on both machines after\ncompiling with -DDEBUG, because the visual selection code changed\nconsiderably between 3.1.11 and 3.7.2.  It seems the color table code\nalso changed, though, and the problem might be there.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] [Help] Problem with ximage in 7.3.2", "sender": "Gregory J.
