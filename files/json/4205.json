{"body": "\nHi All,\n\n\n\nI?ve looked through the archives regarding modelling\nwater, but the posts seem to be concerned with making\nsomething that looks like water, without being\nphysically accurate.\n\nWhat I want to do is test for reflections off a\ntraining pool ? the coach needs to see a swimmer?s\naction in the pool and early morning sunlight may\ncause problems. If I use glass with a bumpy function,\nit looks really cool but I?m not sure if the amount of\nreflection is right. I tried a dielectric, but the\n?water? becomes a mirror.\n\nIs there a material to use that gives properties\ncloser to water than glass? If so, I?d love to hear\nabout it.\n\nCheers\n\nNick L\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nicholas Lander", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20060525071350.6631.qmail@web54614.mail.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May 25 09:14:47 2006", "email": "njlander at yahoo.com.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] another water question"}
