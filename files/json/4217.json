I use objview all the time to preview\nscenes, set views and check geometry, and the speedup on our quad core\nmachines is really great!  I thought I might be able to hack objview to\nsupport this new switch, but it looks like objview relies on rad to\ncreate the scene and defaults to x11 as the output, spawning rvu.  Is\nthere a way to pass the number of processors available to the new rvu,\nvia an objview command?\n\nI see you can also pass one of the standard rad views in lieu of the\ndefault XYZ; is there a way to specify a saved view, or is this a\nlimitation of the way the script is all pipelined through rad?  This is\nthe first time I've really looked at the objview script, and I don't\nimmediately see a way to get the desired options sent to rvu.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Nov 20 15:34:07 2008"}
