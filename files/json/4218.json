The\nrad program passes whatever is set with -N to the new rvu -n option.\n\nAs for using a saved view, the syntax:\n\nobjview -v \"-vf myview.vf\" octree\n\nshould work, but it doesn't because I forgot to put quotes around the\nargument to the -v option.  On line 35 of objview, fix it to:\n\nset vw=\"$argv[1]\"\n\nHopefully, that will work.  (I'll fix this for the next release and\nadd a -N option as well.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] objview & rvu", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Nov 20 17:32:13 2008"}
