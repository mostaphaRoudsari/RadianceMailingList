The maximum ambient value\ndensity is the scene\nsize times the ambient accuracy (see the -aa option below) divided by the\nambient resolution.\n\nThis seems to imply you can set it higher than 128, and also decrease the\n-aa\n\nthanks\n\nrob fitz\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Fitzsimmons, Rob", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Sep 2003 10:55:43 -0700"}
