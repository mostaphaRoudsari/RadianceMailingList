Were the panels used on all sides or to one direction only? My\nidea was to have a big diffuse-translucent wall (only) to north. Also\nIthink that for an exhibition pavillion, especially for architectural\nmodels, a diffuse environment is a terrific idea. All those I know use\nspots to take fotos of their models and to show them (of course with a\ndiffuse environment around).\n\nBut I really wonder on the impact of these panels on color, did you\nexperience any noticable effect? It would also interesting to know what\nhappens after some years, at least with those based on plastics (I would\nnot worry about the glass-based products, but I am also not sure here).\nChristopher has done validation work on such panels, maybe he has more\nto say about it.\n\n\n************************************************************************\n***********\nprivileged.\nyou\n************************************************************************\n***********\nBox\n************************************************************************\n***********\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars Grob", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B8DD8375FCE2C94B9F170D9277C1FA2B8C6047@corvallis>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 26 20:24:34 2006", "email": "Lars Grobe", "subject": "Re: RE: [Radiance-general] Art work surface"}
