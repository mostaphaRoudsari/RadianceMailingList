It's just there to 'take over' when the proper ray tracing\ndoes not produce a light source in an acceptable time. That means\nit's only applied it the renderer has not found a light source after\ntracing a ray for '-ab' bounces through the scene.\n\nIn your case with a box open to the dark void every ray that leaves\nthe box adds nothing to the illuminance level of a point. The closer\nyou are to the (front) edge the more rays escape the box and the\ndarker this point will be in the image.\n\nThe points at the back of the box are only 'bright' because the\nrenderer assigns an artificial brightness to the ray after the first\nbounce (-ab 1). You can probably achieve a smoother gradient\nin your image by increasing the -ab value.\n\nIf you enclose your open box and the camera with another\nclosed box you will probably see that there is no directionality\nto the ambient light and everything will be uniformly grey (if\nthere is only one material). Every ray not hits a surface and\nthe brightness is only modified by the reflectance of the\nmaterial.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient light", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Nov 25 09:55:20 2008"}
