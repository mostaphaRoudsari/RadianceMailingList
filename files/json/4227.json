{"body": "\nAdriana,\n\nThere is Joe Lynes et al. paper titled 'The flow of light into buildings'\n(1966, IES Transactions), defining what he called 'vector illuminance'. It\nhas never really taken off big time, though...\n\nThe concept was implemented later on by Megatron in their 'CIM - Cubic\nIllumination Meter', which to my knowledge is the only instrument of this\nkind.\nhttp://www.megatron.co.uk/homepage.html\nThe idea is to measure the light in the six main directions (+/-x, +/-y,\n+/-z), thus defining a vector of illuminance.\n\nThe Advance RADIANCE Tutorial under\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml, pp 43-...\nwill show you how to measure vector illuminance in RADIANCE (lots of shell\nscripts). Since you're after the RGB, just separate the individual\nchannels.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<DD0ED5D1-6595-4C8F-A8DF-46D3ED423417@gmail.com>", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10250.213.58.97.210.1148986054.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C39620118A785@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "<32031.24.61.4.37.1148960943.squirrel@mail.gsd.harvard.edu>", "<DD0ED5D1-6595-4C8F-A8DF-46D3ED423417@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue May 30 12:51:16 2006", "email": "a.jacobs at londonmet.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Measuring red,green and blue light component in certain space"}
