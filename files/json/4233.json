Did you discuss this with Greg already? Seems to me it would improve the accuracy especially with circular light sources quite noticably.\nWe too did some work on Radiance together with Arne Duer in 2003/2004 so I was happy to see there is still interest in improving Radiance at the University of Innsbruck.\nRegards,\nErwin Zierler\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nTo:      radiance@rendigo.com\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "datetime": "Thu Nov 27 01:08:04 2008"}
