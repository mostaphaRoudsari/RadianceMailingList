{"body": "\nHi,\n\none idea... as this will require generating the octree for every frame, I wonder if it helps to make a frozen octree of the whole scene except the water, scene.oct. Than exporting only the water objects for each frame, lets call them water[FRAME].rtm. Now if you write a script that creates scenes with only two objects, one being an instance of scene.oct, the second a mesh object water[FRAME].rtm. That way you will not have to run octree each time on the whole scene, right?\n\nIn fact, I wanted to propose to use the -i option of oconv so that you can type oconv -i scene.oct water[FRAME].rad > scene[FRAME].oct. But who uses obj2rad any more... ;-)\n\nWhat do you think folks, I cannot try that at the moment to find if the gain from less work in oconv is worth the overhead. Also instance and mesh would overlap completely.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] another water question", "sender": "Lars Grobe", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20060526110305.97470@gmx.net>", "refs": ["<20060525071350.6631.qmail@web54614.mail.yahoo.com>", "<C1706414-8780-4652-8F8A-A10DC267E0D2@gmail.com>", "<4475D06C.2050701@rumblestrip.org>", "<19C1B2EB-03AE-4426-86B1-CFB3F32443C8@gmail.com>", "<4475D730.5080601@rumblestrip.org>", "<79949B3F-B6AB-44BC-9F97-224DC6FF7CC3@biomechanicsinc.com>"], "datetime": "Fri May 26 13:03:08 2006", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] another water question"}
