{"body": "\nHi Thomas!\n\n\nOk... that is what I wanted to describe as continous ;-)))\n\n\nWell, if you have no clear window at all you also might get mad.\n\n\nThat sounds interesting, as I actually do not have experienced such a room. Were the panels used on all sides or to one direction only? My idea was to have a big diffuse-translucent wall (only) to north. Also Ithink that for an exhibition pavillion, especially for architectural models, a diffuse environment is a terrific idea. All those I know use spots to take fotos of their models and to show them (of course with a diffuse environment around).\n\nBut I really wonder on the impact of these panels on color, did you experience any noticable effect? It would also interesting to know what happens after some years, at least with those based on plastics (I would not worry about the glass-based products, but I am also not sure here). Christopher has done validation work on such panels, maybe he has more to say about it.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Art work surface", "sender": "Lars Grobe", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20060526090524.97450@gmx.net>", "refs": ["<FCCB55B3313F2341AB3C91810FE1166B013E50BA@ln-s3xch1.bdp.holdings.network>"], "datetime": "Fri May 26 11:05:27 2006", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Art work surface"}
