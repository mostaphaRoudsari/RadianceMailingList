The shape shown does not correspond necessarily to the\nactual shape of the sources.  The shape shown is the centroid of the\nactual source with the estimated source solid angle drawn as a circle\n(which may appear as an ellipse depending on the view projection used).\n\nDoes this clear up your confusion?\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Quantifying Glare Sources", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Dec  3 09:14:06 2008"}
