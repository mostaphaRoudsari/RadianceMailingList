If you\nknow that you want an image 786 pixels wide, with any arbitrary\nhorizontal and vertical view angles, you could use options like:\n\n-x 786 -y 10000 -vh [anglex] -vv [angley]\n\nwhere the values in brackets are whatever view angles you want. This\nwill fit the image to the horizontal and allow the image to be whatever\nvertical size it takes to meet your view angle parameters (in this case\nwith a cap of 10000 pixels). This works based on the default pixel\naspect of -pa 1. This way if the vh and vv are equal, it generates a\nsquare, otherwise it will make an appropriately sized rectangular image.\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Greg\nWard\nSent: Wednesday, December 03, 2008 12:16 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nGood start, but the formula is just a little more complicated for\nperspective (-vtv) views.
