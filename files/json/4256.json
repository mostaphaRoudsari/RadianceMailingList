{"body": "\nHi  Andrew,\n\nYou aren't really doing anything wrong, but the problem is that\nrtcontrib reports the contribution *coefficients*, which is not the\nsame thing as the contributions.  To get contributions, you need to\ndownload and compile the latest HEAD release, and use the new -V\noption to rtcontrib.  Then, you should get the results you expect.\nThis is a subtle point that I actually missed in the design of the\nprogram, which is why the option was only added more recently.  Here\nis the description from the new man page:\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n-----------------\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtcontrib with ies2rad", "sender": "Gregory J.
