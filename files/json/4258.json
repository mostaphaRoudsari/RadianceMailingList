I would at least increase '-ad'\nand add '-as' unless you know it's not going to change the\nresults.\n\nnewglares.csh:\n\nYou calculate a picture for findglare with default view settings\n(-vtv and -vv 60 -vh 60). The findglare man page recommends\nto use a fisheye (-vta) and 180 degrees for the view angles. With\nyour images findglare has a lot to compute from the octree.\n\nThe rpict options are left at the defaults (including ab=0!). I don't\nthink that's your intention.\n\nfindglare itself could do with more options as well. Best thing\nto do is to set the rpict/rtrace options in  a variable and use\nthis on the command line for all of the commands (rtrace, rpict\nand findglare).\n\nYou also should look at the way how findglare works. The\ndefault threshold to identify glare is 7 times above the average.\nGiven that you're looking at a bright window (very large\nsource) you may never find a glare source unless you're\nlooking directly into the sun. If that's all you need, fine, otherwise\nyou have to work out a reasonable threshold for your scene.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glare Index calculati", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Fri Dec  5 05:26:46 2008"}
