{"body": "\nUnfortunately, I couldn't read Martin's posting, as it came out as an\nencoded sequence that my mailer couldn't decypher.  Folks, if you're\nsending text, see if you can use ASCII.  It's a good standard, and it's\nbeen around for some time.  My mailer figures out most things, but it's\nnot 100% reliable.\n\nI'm gathering my notion of what was said by Carsten and Schorsch's\nresponses...\n\n\nThe new rholo program is runs like rview in parallel, as you can start\nas many processes as you have processors.  I never got around to making\nit work over a network, and I have doubts it would really pay off due\nto the latencies involved.  Carsten's statement would seem to confirm\nthis.\n\n\nGensurf will also take vertices from its standard input or a file and\ngenerate smoothed polygons, but the vertices have to be laid out on a\ngrid.  (I added for the next release a feature to enable you to cut\nrough holes into gensurf meshes.)  If you have a triangle mesh and you\nknow the vertex normals, you can use the tmesh2rad or mgf2rad\nconverters to get these into smoothed triangles in Radiance.  The\nmgf2rad program will also smooth quadrilaterals, but it does so by\nbreaking them into triangles.  The obj2rad program can also take\nsmoothed surfaces in Alias/Wavefront format, so there really are many\noptions for getting smoothed surfaces into Radiance.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance workshop, etc.", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<65CC54A6-E1F2-11D6-9C73-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 17 Oct 2002 10:03:46 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance workshop, etc."}
