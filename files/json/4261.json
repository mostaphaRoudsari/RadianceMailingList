Any help in that direction will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe BSDF types in Radiance only work for \"highlights\" currently --\nindirect components default to diffuse, as you point out.  I am\nlooking at ways to correct this in future releases, now that BSDF\ndata is becoming more available, thanks in large part to Peter A-B\nand his continuing efforts to improve the measurement side of things.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] experiences with the photon ma", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Dec  5 08:55:41 2008"}
