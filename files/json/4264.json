I did a quick informal survey of the data\navailable from four manufacturers which distribute in the USA.  Here's\nwhat I found:\n\nCorelite\t\tlinear\t\t  \tIES 1995 (one file checked)\nLightolier\t\tbroad line\t\tIES 1995, 2002 (two files checked)\nLucifer Lighting  \tcutting edge\t  \tIES 2002 (one file checked)\nSIMKAR\t\tinexpensive linear\tIES 1986 (426 files)\nIES 1995 (18 files)\n\nSIMKAR seems to have licensed a number of older designs, and this\nprobably accounts for the large number of 1986-format files.  The\nnewer Lightolier file I checked was 2002 format; the older was 1995.\n\nRandolph\n\nOn Dec 7, 2008, at 3:16 AM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES photometry file formats", "tags": [], "sender": "R Fritz", "datetime": "Mon Dec  8 14:25:46 2008"}
