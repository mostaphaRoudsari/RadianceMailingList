{"body": "\nHi Christian,\n\nIf you need to pose a figure in a particular way, you will need to use\nPoser. However it is possible that you might be able to buy a posed\nhuman figure online at a site like www.turbosquid.com. You might also\ncheck if poser can export in another format such as obj or 3ds  (obj\nwould be preferable as then you can use obj2mesh).\n\n-Jack\n\nChristian Fusenig wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] human dxf models", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<446DCBCE.4010008@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<446DC623.6040304@gmx.de>"], "datetime": "Fri May 19 15:44:59 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] human dxf models"}
