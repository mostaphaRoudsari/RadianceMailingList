{"body": "\nChris,\n\n\nHard to make any sort of recommendation without knowing what you\nintend to model.  Unless you are already up to working speed with\nAutoCAD, you may find that it is much easier to learn how to use\nRadiance scene generators to create the model than it is to learn how\nto use AutoCAD.  The 3D models for these (now ancient) scenes were\nall created using scripts (images at the foot of the page):\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/resources.html\n\nThe Radiance book gives lots of examples on creating geometry using\nscripts etc.  I'd certainly recommend considering this approach in\nthe first instance.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<2679D32D-4606-49A5-81A3-23930F1393D1@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 19 14:31:23 2006", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] a note of thanks"}
