{"body": "\nHello Chris.\n\nNice to see a new face.\n\nYou might be interested in the RADIANCE course notes linked on this site:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml\n<http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml>\n\nand - if you have trouble getting Radiance to work - LEARNIX\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/index.shtml\n<http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/index.shtml>\n\nI think the 'notes' as well as the RwR book are an excellent introduction to\nRadiance and how the tools work. Kudos to Axel Jacobs for this.\n\nBTW: You should get used to the feeling of being lost in all the options of\ncountless programs. For most of us it never will end.\n\nThomas\n\n\n_____\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Chris\nFoster\nSent: 18 May 2006 16:54\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHello everyone,\n\nMy name is chris and as i have just became a new member of this mailing list\nso\ni thought i would introduce myself. i'm a student undertaking a 4-5 month\nplacement at npl in order to do my dissertation as part of my one years\nmasters\ncourse. i graduated in physics in 2004, took a year out and have been\nstudying\nagain since oct. the reason ive joined this mailing list is because i have\nchosen to learn how to use radiance for my project. the only trouble being\nive not a very good programmer and ive never seen radiance before tuesday!!\none of my aims is to eventually use it to model a lighting chamber, but as i\nstarted on tuesday i feel im a long way of. so far ive followed most of\ntutorial one from the radiance site.\nbe good to hear from anyone who still uses this list.\n\nthanks chris\n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
