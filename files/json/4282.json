And you\nuse mix-func to describe the reflected component? Has this been\npublished somewhere? I never came across it so far...\n\n\nHm, is this something that could be better modeled using the pmap\nextension? Or is the number of interreflections between the surfaces\n(with their little distance) simply too high? I guess that you mean the\ninterreflections under low angles, right?\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081211/be0288e4/smime-0001.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRTF for glazing", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
