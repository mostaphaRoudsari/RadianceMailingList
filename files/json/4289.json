Older releases\ndon't support the binary options, so you'll need the slower version:\n\nrlam '!pvalue -h -H -b -d input1.pic' '!pvalue -h -H -b -d\ninput2.pic' \\\n| rcalc '$1=$1-$2' | total -m\n\nYou may need to escape the '!' in the above commands if you use the C-\nshell, which claims this as its history character.\n\nNote I've added the -m option to each of the total commands.  This\ncomputes the \"average difference\" between pixels, rather than the\nsum.  I don't know what the sum would mean, which is why I added -m.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<BAY125-W49AF2AE0D0703C677A87DDB0F50@phx.gbl>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Dec 15 16:48:08 2008"}
