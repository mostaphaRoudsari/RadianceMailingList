I want to model a PVB single glazing pane\n(which means two glass panes with interlayer). Still, as their is no\nspace between the panes, I choose number of panes=1, and I am pretty\nsure that this is the right way to do this - am I wrong? Next, I have to\neither define the outer and inner surfaces (s1, s2). I choosed s1=clear\nglass and s2=laminated pvb, according to the rule that all glass\nmaterials are defined from the viewer's side. Still this is not really\nclear, so I would like to ask if I am doing something completely wrong\nhere or if I understood the script right?\n\nTIA, CU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
