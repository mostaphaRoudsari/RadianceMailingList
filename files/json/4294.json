It\ndepends on its structure and index of refraction.  The glaze script\nwas not really designed to model such systems, but I can't point you\nin a better direction at the moment.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] PVB laminated single glazing & glaz", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Dec 16 11:13:58 2008"}
