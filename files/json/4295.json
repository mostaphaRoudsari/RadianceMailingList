{"body": "\nSome really good glazing types, including highly diffuse museum glazings (one of the best being Opalika from Schott at http://www.us.schott.com/architecture/english/references.html) have no Radiance descriptions or are often not archived in the Window database. You can model those in different ways. The easiest way is to start out with the radiance material trans.\n\nExample:\n1) http://www.us.schott.com/architecture/english/products/colored-glass/opalika/index.html\n2) Download the pdf file on the link below\n3) See http://www.us.schott.com/architecture/english/download/schott_farbglas_us_kl.pdf and take a look at Opalika\n4) Go to the product information which contains technical data:\nhttp://www.us.schott.com/architecture/english/download/\n5) Select the technical information at the bottom:\nTechnical Information\nOPALIKA?-Physical and chemical properties\nhttp://www.us.schott.com/architecture/english/download/opalikae.pdf\n6) This product sheet tells you all optical properties, including a nice intensity distribution plot on p. 6.\n7) The total transmittance is around 30%. Nevertheless, the material has a spike caused by the Radiance trans parameter number 7, which is the transmitted specular component.\n\nLet's define this material. The general format of trans is:\nvoid trans opalika\n0 0 7\na1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7\n\nWe need additional parameters from the datasheet:\n\nrd = diffuse reflectance of opalika, say 0.2\nrs = specular reflectance of opalika, say 0.02\ntd = diffuse transmittance of opalika, say 0.28\nts = specular transmittance. Play with this value and see how close you can get to the intensity distribution displayed on the data sheet.\n\nLet's start with ts = 0.01\n\na7=ts/(td+ts)\na6=(td+ts)/(rd+td+ts)\na5=0 (roughness - lets just assume 0 for convenience)\na4 = rs = 0.02 let's say (specular reflectance of Opalika)\na3 = a2 = a1 = rd/ ( (1-rs) *(1-a6) )\n\nIf you do the calculations, you will find the following:\nvoid trans opalika\n0\n0\n7    0.5   0.5   0.5   0.02   0.0   0.592   0.0345\n\nDefine this material in radiance as a polygon, and put a light source/horizontal sun rays behind it. Determine the luminance at nadir. Determine the luminance at 1, 2, 3 ... 20 degrees off nadir. See if you can get the plot listed in the data sheet. If not, change the ts parameter.\n\nThis is a good exercise since you should use data that are verifiable. Create your own values, verify them and don't rely too much on others :)  I have found substantial transmittance mistakes in manufacturers published data. We discussed some concerns about the windows database before in this group.\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Fri 5/12/2006 4:07 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHello,\n\nProf Moeck, thanks for the quick pointer. I couldn't ascertain if it can be done okalux products but I need glass types that I can model in Optics and Window for Radiance material format and DOE-2.1E glass library format. I looked up Optics and Window databases and could not locate Okalux in them. Please advise.\n\nRegards,\nRamana.\n\n\nOn 5/12/06, Martin Moeck <MMoeck@engr.psu.edu> wrote:\n\nRamana,\n\nOkalux has nice product specifications at\n\nhttp://www.okalux.com/Okalux_2003/englisch/frames_e.html\n\nSelect \"Products\" at the bottom.\n\nThey have a good database since they specify the direct and diffuse light transmission, UV protection, U-value, sound reduction, etc. You can use those in pyramidal toplights. For a translation of the direct and diffuse light transmission into the Radiance trans material, see the radiance knowledge base and digests.I would also look into the glaze.cal script.\n\nDr. Martin Moeck, Pennsylvania State University\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Fri 5/12/2006 3:04 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello all,\n\nCan anyone point me to a commerical manufacturer's website where there's specifications of a diffuse skylight (preferably withouth well) that can be modeled in Optics and imported into Radiance material format? (Anything close or suggestions on an alternative way of doing it will work too!)\n\nRegards,\nRamana.\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\nwww.daylit.org\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nVenkata Ramana Koti\n1137 E Orange St Apt #35\nTempe AZ 85281 USA\nTel: 480.326.9275\nwww.daylit.org\n\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 9724 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060512/9872c0c1/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Ramana Kot", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A1751205CFFEB548B3E78F10333DCF8805F114@ENGRMAIL1.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 12 22:59:00 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Ramana Koti", "subject": "[Radiance-general] diffuse skylight without well"}
