One way to do things is as follows:\n\n1. compile all non light source fixture geometry (not geometry with\nlight, illum or glow materials applied) into an instance object\n(eg a frozen octree)\n2. define your light source elements, such as ies photometry and\npossible glow sources to represent glowing sources (highly\ndependent on what you are trying to accomplish)\n\nThen these two sets of data can be deployed via replmarks or xform (item\none then needs to be incorporated into a radiance \"instance\"\ndefinition). Another added step could be to merge these two together as\na radiance scene description referencing the instance (1) and sources (2).\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Jack\n\ndbs176@gmail.com wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081216/0e2374df/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Oconv and IES photometrics", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Tue Dec 16 11:16:58 2008"}
