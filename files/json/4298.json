It\ndepends on its structure and index of refraction.  The glaze script\nwas not really designed to model such systems, but I can't point you\nin a better direction at the moment.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] PVB laminated single glazing & glaz", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Tue Dec 16 12:02:46 2008"}
