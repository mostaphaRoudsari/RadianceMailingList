On p. 9 the manual says:\n\n\"The incident flux from distant sources is evaluated at each port\nand the sources are checked for occlusion. However, no interreflection\ncalculation\nis made; ports differ from illums in this respect. Photons are scattered\nby the port\nupon emission as if they had passed through it.\"\n\nThe general approach rendering a typical architectural scene would be to\nuse surfaces at the windows as photon ports. To account for any kind of\nshading devices, I would have to place the photon port surface outside\nthese devices.\n\nStill, almost every architectural simulation includes obstruction from\nnearby building, trees etc. Now, as far as I understand the manual,\nthese obstructions would only influence my scene following a visibility\ntest (so either blocking light or not), but e.g. the surface\ncharacteristics of geometry such as reflectance would be neglected. Is\nthis the case?\n\nThank you, CU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Thu Dec 18 19:20:06 2008"}
