This is a test version\nand must not be used in a production environment!\n\nUnfortunately it does not work with Internet Explorer\nyet so Windows users will find little joy in installing\nit. My apologies.\n\nMac OS X users are advised to upgrade to Sketchup 7 and\ngrab the zip file from the google code project page:\n\nhttp://su2rad.googlecode.com/files/su2rad_Xmas_special_2008.zip\n\nI have set up a web page with screen shots and some\ncomments here:\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/su2rad/xmas-special-2008\n\nI will be available on Monday for feedback or help, then\nI'll leave for the holidays where I will most likely not\nhave internet available. I will resume support on the 2nd\nof January next year.\n\nSo I hope it works for you (and if it doesn't ask yourself\n'Have you been naughty ...?' ;)\n\n\nHappy winter solstice celebrations,\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sat Dec 20 09:31:23 2008"}
