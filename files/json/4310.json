The manpage of findglare says:\n\n\"By default, findglare only computes glare sources and indirect vertical\nilluminance for the given view [...]\"\n\nSo I would get only the indirect irradiance, while, to calculate the\nilluminance, I would need the total irradiance including direct\nirradiance e.g. from light sources visible from the point of view -\nright? So I cannot automate this using an existing tool but must write a\nscript to integrate fish-eye projected pictures over the whole\nhemisphere, right?\n\nThank you for your support on all that pmap-related stuff!!!\n\nLars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] experiences with the photon ma", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
