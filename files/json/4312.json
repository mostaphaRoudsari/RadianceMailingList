Is similar parallelization\npossible in rtrace program?\nI've found \"-PP pfile\" option but I'm not sure how to use it. I supposed\nthat \"pfile\" should be empty so program can write into it some control\nvariables. When I started rtrace with -PP option 2 processes are created:\none for my  rtrace and one child rtrace process with the same parameters.\nWhen I tried to explore running processes it seems that only the first one\nis really running, while the second one is sleeping - so I don't have real\nparalellization here.\n\nI suppose I haven't understood something well, so if someone has the\nexperience with rtace running on multiprocessor machines, please send me\nsome ideas/hints.\n\nHappy holidays to all list members and their families,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081222/5e5f9c37/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Mon Dec 22 04:56:44 2008"}
