The annual Radiance Workshop is an\nexcellent place to meet the minds of the Radiance community, but there\nis not always a formal tutorial component to those.  There was one in\n2003 in Berkeley, and also in 2005 I believe at De Montfort Uni in the\nU.K., both taught by John Mardaljevic.\n\nI would say the best place to start is with the tutorials in the\nRendering with Radiance textbook, and trolling the archives of this\nmailing list.  Axel Jacobs also has two fantastic tutorials in pdf\nformat but I can't locate the links to those right now.  Axel?  A little\nhelp?  =8-)\n\nGood luck!\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Cours", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon Dec 22 08:03:20 2008"}
