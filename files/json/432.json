{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI am back working on my image maps.. and still in trouble. While I finally\nknow how to do the transformations of my image maps, I have some problems\nwith the different types of modifiers radiance offers.\n\nFirst, I have a limited set of photographs that are to become imagemaps. I\nhave some of rather good quality in black/whithe, showing the complete\nobjetcs' surfaces. I would like to map these onto the objects in my scene.\n\nThan, I have some pictures which give me color values (they are\ncolor-corrected), but which don't show the complete surfaces. So I cannot use\nthem as patterns.\n\nSo which modifier should I use? If I use colorpict, I get grey surfaces (as\nthe gray colorpict is mapped ON the material?). I would like to use\nbrightdata, but how do I convert my grayscale image into the data-format I\nwould need? Is this possibile at least?\n\nOne last possibility might be to use the color information from the color\ncorrected pictures and apply this color to the greyscale-images. Is this\npossible with the radiance tools (e.g. pcomb)?\n\nThank you, have a nice weekend, CU,\n\nLars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
