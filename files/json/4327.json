I have updated the guide with your recommended\nprocedure and a few more references.

Given link to Greg's\nmessage suggesting workaround for the same.\n\nDec 29, 2008\n\nFirst, I am a relatively new user of Radiance and Ubuntu. I would like to\nhelp\n\nnewbies like me to get Radiance working on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon with as\nlittle\npain as possible.\n\nWhy?\na) For using Radiance on older machines.\nb) I find Ubuntu 7.10 perfect for my needs and am reluctant to upgrade to\nUbuntu 8.10.\n\nThere may be others like me, so this small guide is intended for them.\n\nWe will install Radiance from source, but there are alternatives though\nlike:\n\n1) change your distro or upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10\n2) try intrepid (Ubuntu 8.10) packages by using backports\n\nBinary files for Ubuntu 8.10 are available for download at the following\nsite:\n\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/radiance/3R9+20080530-4\n\n3) get live CD, learnix-2008-1_beta.iso (which uses Ubuntu 8.10) from:\n\nftp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pub/learnix/learnix-2008-1_beta.iso\n\n4) Bernd Zeimetz (Debian GNU/Linux Developer) has recommended a faster way\nto\ncompile Radiance. Try this first as it is given by a power user. I am\nreproducing his message with the installation routine from the archives\nat the end of this file [1].\n\n\nIf that fails then try what I did:\n\n\nOK, let's start the process to compile radiance from source package:\n\n\nFirst Step:\n-----------\n\nWe need to download the required packages and their dependencies to compile\nusing\n\nsynaptic package manager [2]:\n\n-   tcsh\n-   libtiff\n-   g++\n-   g++4.1\n-   tcl8.5\n-   tk8.4\n-   libc6-dev\n-   libx11-dev\n\nor type following in terminal:\n# sudo apt-get install tcsh libtiff g++ g++4.1 tcl8.5 tk8.4 libc6-dev\nlibx11-dev\n\nDepending on your internet connection and your machine this may take some\ntime.\n\n\nSecond Step:\n------------\n\nPrepare the Radiance for compiling\nCreate a directory in your HOME directory:\n# mkdir build\n\nChange the working directory to it:\n# cd build\n\nDownload Radiance sources:\n# wget http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download/rad3R9all.tar.gz\n\nUnpack it:\n# tar -xvf rad3R9all.tar.gz\n\nChange the working directory to the source directory:\n# cd ray\n\n\nThird Step:\n-----------\nCompiling it:\nThis generates the necessary files and checks your system:\n\n#sudo tcsh makeall install\n\nGive following answers to the queries generated by the install script:\nQ1. Default editor [vi]?\nAns: y\n\nQ2. Install to location usr/local/bin:\nAns. y\n\nQ3. Read the license agreement ...\nAns. Scroll down using space bar. At the end it will ask:\nq. Do you agree [n]:\nans. y\n\nQ4. Type of install? Choose from Sun, Sparc, Linux, etc.\nLinux is listed at number 6\nAns. 6\n\nQ5. Copy library files to 'usr/local/lib/ray'?\nAns. y\n\nQ6. Install library files now?\nAns. y\n\nQ7. Current rmake command is\n#!bin/sh\n....\nDo you want to change it?\nAns. n\n\n\nThe programs and libraries are copied to usr/local/bin and\nusr/local/lib/ray respectively.\n\nThe environment variable Raypath is automatically set.\n\nIf all goes well you will have a working installation of Radiance.\n\n\nNote\n----\n1) In my case, the installation ended with the message\n\"there were some errors\"\nAs far as I was able to make out, this was because:\n\n- libtiff was not compiled due to some compiler sanity check [3]\n\n- However, since latest libtiff was already downloaded and installed in\nfirst Step in Ubuntu, this did not cause a problem.\n\n2) Some binary files from installation directory:\n\ni.e. /build/ray/src/px\n\nlike macbethcal, pcomb, pfilt, ra-bmp, ... ttyimage, etc.\nwere not automatically copied to the /usr/local/bin directory.\n\n- So I manually copied the files using the nautilus file manager\nas root by using the following command:\n\nsudo nautilus\n\nNote: copy the files whose icons are a rotated square with gears\nto the /usr/local/bin directory\n\n3) The developers of Radiance are aware of the above problem.\nGreg has suggested an alternative to remove the error [4]\n\n4)  For more details about the errors please refer to a file\nnamed as config.log. You can search for this file from the desktop\nmenu:\nPlaces--->\nSearch for files (with magnifying glass icon)\n\nThe config.log file in my case was located at:\nubuntu/build/ray/src/px/tiff/config.log\n\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\n\nI hope that this guide is helpful. It has been written with the best of\nintentions.\n\nThere may be errors, so I request advanced users to kindly review it and\nupdate the\n\nsame.\n\nWishing you all the best.\nJiten\n\n\nBernds' Installation Routine\n----------------------------\n\nType the following steps as given by Bernd in Terminal to make a backport of\nradiance\npackages from Debian's Lenny/testing or Hardy (or upgrade to Hardy).
