To simplify a model, where direct sunlight is not important and\ndaylight can be considered as a hemispherical light source (uniform\nsky), I would like to do manually what mkillum does when producing a\nlight modifier (not the default illum modifier). The surface to be\nmodified is a horizontal flat rectangular face of, say, 1sqm. If I would\nnormalize the sky source in a way that I would get a horizontal\nilluminance of, lets say, 1000 lux, ignoring obstructions, how would I\ncalculate the 1 sqm light source's modifier that would replace the sky\nin my scene? Is mkillum basically calcultating an iradiance image here?\n\nLars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Mon Dec 29 00:58:06 2008"}
