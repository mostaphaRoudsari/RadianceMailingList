I'm still\nfeeling a bit weak, so apologies if none of this makes sense...\n\nSetting d=0 in one of the #@mkillum comments in your scene file will\ncreate a diffuse source, which is what you want in this case.  (And\nyes, it will be computing irradiance in effect.)  Since it takes\nalmost no time to compute such a source, you may as well use mkillum\nif you're comfortable with it.  If you want to create the source by\nhand, then simply divide your external irradiance by PI to get the\nradiance of the source, whatever size it may be (doesn't matter),\nmultiplying of course by the transmission as well.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Doing manually what mkillum does...", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Dec 29 11:37:13 2008"}
