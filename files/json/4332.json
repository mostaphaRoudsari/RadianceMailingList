I am pretty safe from flue and cold, sitting\njust some meters from the equator in nice and warm Singapore...\n\nThank you for your reply!  It made me think once more about what I am\nasking for, and essentially the funny thing is that in my case, having a\nuniform sky, this led me to the (late) insight that I can simply use the\nluminance of the sky source (in this case 1000/pi) to modify a surface\non the entrance of the system - nothing else I do when applying the\ngensky-created description to a window pane. So the luminance of my\nreplacement-source is the same as the luminance of my uniform sky source\n(as long as I ignore the transmission properties). It just took me a\nwhile to get it that, when looking through a perfectly transparent\nwindow, I see the sky luminance and not the window glass. Maybe a sign\nthat I have been working in a window-less office space for too much time\nnow...\n\nI wish you all a happy new year and a nice celebration, those in cold\nclimates beware of the flue,\n\nLars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Doing manually what mkillum does...", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
