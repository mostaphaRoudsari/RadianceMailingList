{"body": "\nHello Radiance Users, Abusers and Confusers,\n\nPlease excuse my ignorance, but assuming one has a computer with a\n64-bit operating system (SuSe Linux) installed, can Radiance be compiled\nas a 64-bit application?  And if so, has anyone done it?  What's the\nmakefile look like?  The reason I ask is that I'm looking at possibly\nbuilding up a quad system (two dual-core cpus) and with the potential\nfor four jobs running at once I think I need more addressable memory.\nAs I understand it, with a 32-bit application you're limited to 4GB\ntotal, whereas with everything 64-bit, the system can address 8GB of\nRAM.  Since I rarely see jobs needing more than 2GB of RAM, I figure\nhaving 8GB available for a maximum of four jobs means no job would\nlikely ever run out of RAM and start paging.  Maybe my first question\nshould really be: am I thinking about this correctly?  =8-)\n\nAny input appreciated.  (I think I need coffee.)\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4458CA55.5040500@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed May  3 18:21:15 2006", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] compiling Radiance 64-bit?"}
