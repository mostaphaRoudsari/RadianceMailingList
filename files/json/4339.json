I do not get it... to get the illuminance from a 180 degree\nfisheye picture (no matter if taken by a camera or rendered by rpict), I\nhave to integrate the luminance values over the circular surface of the\nprojected hemisphere. This means that I somehow have to sum-up the pixel\nvalues. Still I do not really know the maths to do it, can anyone give\nme a hint, please? Is it the average of the pixel values multiplied by\nthe surface area, the  pixel values being weighted according to the\nsolid angles they cover?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] experiences with the photon ma", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
