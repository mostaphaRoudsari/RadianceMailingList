Straight Noob here, attempting to revitalize an old ibook with os jaguar.  I have been enjoying the past couple days learning some fundamental commands.\nI seem to have a similar problem that which this thread was started on.  Coming across something like this in the terminal after several errors.\n\nAdd /usr/local/bin to the beginning of your execution path:\nFor C-shell users, put the following into ~/.cshrc\nset path=( /usr/local/bin $path )\nFor Bourne shell users, put the following into $HOME/.profile\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\nI do not get anything for raypath or tshcrc.  I am unfamiliar with setenv or alias.  Admittedly, I have little idea of what I am doing up until this point and no idea what to do beyond this point.\nYour help is appreciated.\n\nKevin\n\n\n________________________________\n\"This message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.
