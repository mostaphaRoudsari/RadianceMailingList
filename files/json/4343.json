{"body": "\nHey Guys,\n\nThanks for the insight. First, concerning my oddly shaped lighting fixtures,\nthe ones that I have modeled actually look like this:\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/bathroomview.jpg\n\nSo I think they are actually more complicated that the example that I showed\nto you before. Out of curiosity, just as many modeling software estimate a\ncomplex surface as a mesh of planes or triangles, could the same principle\nbe used for the lighting fixtures themselves. In other words, instead of\nseeing each fixture as a single complex surface, can it be considered it as\njust a group of flat planes? One item that I need to have addressed is\nwhether I should model the diffuse shades a single surface or if it\nacceptable to have inner and outer surfaces (you can think of it as having a\nthickness to it). See here:\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/luminaireview.jpg\n\n\nThe information in Rayfront's user manual and pages 325-326 from RwR were\nVERY useful to me in gaining insight as to how Radiance treats light. There\nwas a word that was mentioned that has me worried. Measure. Aside from not\nhaving any experience with performing a empirical test of light\ndistribution, measuring light sounds very expensive. May I ask, would\npurchasing the needed equipment require a second mortgage to be taken out or\ngiving up one's first born? Is it required to use transfunc or transdata in\nlieu of trans to obtain acceptable accuracy?\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Material", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY115-F374CC0645B5C765C453B1BA4960@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Jun  3 16:30:34 2006", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Material"}
