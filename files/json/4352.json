Composite done in photosop.  Radiance view did not match pic, so I\ndid a little skewing in PS.\n\nThanks for all the input on art lighting - I'll post  pics as it comes\nalong.\n\nRob\n-----Original Message-----\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nSent: 5/26/2006 2:05 AM\nHi Thomas!\n\n\nOk... that is what I wanted to describe as continous ;-)))\n\n\nWell, if you have no clear window at all you also might get mad.\n\n\nThat sounds interesting, as I actually do not have experienced such a room.\nWere the panels used on all sides or to one direction only? My idea was to\nhave a big diffuse-translucent wall (only) to north. Also Ithink that for an\nexhibition pavillion, especially for architectural models, a diffuse\nenvironment is a terrific idea. All those I know use spots to take fotos of\ntheir models and to show them (of course with a diffuse environment around).\n\nBut I really wonder on the impact of these panels on color, did you\nexperience any noticable effect? It would also interesting to know what\nhappens after some years, at least with those based on plastics (I would not\nworry about the glass-based products, but I am also not sure here).\nChristopher has done validation work on such panels, maybe he has more to\nsay about it.\n\n\n************************************************************************\n***********\nprivileged.\nyou\n************************************************************************\n***********\nBox\n************************************************************************\n***********\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list Radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list Radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars Grob", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B8DD8375FCE2C94B9F170D9277C1FA2B8C609A@corvallis>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun 12 21:51:30 2006", "email": "Lars Grobe", "subject": "Re: RE: [Radiance-general] Art work surface"}
