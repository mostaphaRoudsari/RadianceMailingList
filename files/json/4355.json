The thickness of\nglass panes in buildings is rather standard (4 or 6\nmm) so there should be minimal errors due to this\noptimisation.\n\nIf you want to model exactly how a solid body of\nglass would behave you should use other primitives\nlike 'dielectric' (see the whale sculpture and\nanti-matter examples in RwR). Arguably, the Radiance\napproach is not the best algorithm for this.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\nOn 14 Jan 2009, at 05:41, Lars Oliver Grobe wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glass modifier under different angles", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed Jan 14 01:11:07 2009"}
