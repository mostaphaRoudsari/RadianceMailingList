Still it would be possible to\naccount for the angular dependent distance given a single polygon if you\nrely on that average of about 6mm. But the internal calculation should\ninclude the angular dependency than, and that is what I am wondering. So\nis the fact that a ray entering a glass face at 0 degree (perpendicular)\nwould travel a much shorter distance through the material then one\nhitting it at 45 degree considered in the glass modifier code?\n\nBTW yes I think this is explained in RwR, though I do not know if this\nquestion is answered there. Unfortunately my book is 10.000km from my\ncurrent location and the one we ordered weeks ago seems to be not\navailable.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glass modifier under different angles", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Oliver Grobe", "datetime": "Wed Jan 14 02:17:47 2009"}
