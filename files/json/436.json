You need to make sure that source rays\ncan't sneak past this geometry, which is why you want it to make a\ntight seal around your luminaire system.\n\n-G\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: -ar, -ad, -as, ahh $#*@!", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 9 Sep 2003 10:05:20 -0700"}
