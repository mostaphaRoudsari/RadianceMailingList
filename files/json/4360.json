I think that this will you get the most\nsophisticated description for a glass material. You can incorporate data\nthat is output from Optics for single monolithic glass types to build up\ndouble pane insulating units if needed. A coating can be applied to a\nselected layer of the make-up. Note, that using the simple BRTDfunc\ndescription output from Optics (unless this has been updated in the past\nfew years) does not account for variation due to incident angle. There\nis actually a way to set up the glaze script so it accepts a file of\nglass types as input rather than using the rather minimal inputs that\ncome with script.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I will do the best I can to\nhelp out.\n\n-Jack\n\nGalen Burrell wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090114/1769d356/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glazing transparency/reflectivity stud", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed Jan 14 15:08:07 2009"}
