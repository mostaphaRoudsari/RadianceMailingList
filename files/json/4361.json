This should be for a single pane monolithic glass\ndescription (not a multi-layer make-up). The file will have three\nRadiance material definitions, the two BRDTfunc definitions are the ones\nto pay attention to. The makeup is something like the following:\n\nvoid BRTDfunc some.glass.front\n10\n\nRfr Rfg Rfb\nTr Tg Tb\n0   0   0\n.\n\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid BRTDfunc some.glass.back\n10\n\nRbr Rbg Rbb\nTr Tg Tb\n0   0   0\n.\n\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo you need to take the two rgb triples for reflectance and one for\ntransmittance. So an entry in the data file could look like this (you\nwill need to figure which represents the coated side if needed):\n\nSurface Tr      Tg      Tb      Rcr     Rcg     Rcb     Rgr     Rgg     Rgb     Part\n<name>  Tr\tTg\tTb\tRfr\tRfg\tRfb\tRbr\tRbg\tRbb\t0\n\n\n\nA file for a double pane insulating unit might look like the following:\n\nSurface Tr      Tg      Tb      Rcr     Rcg     Rcb     Rgr     Rgg     Rgb     Part\ngreen-lowe  Tr\tTg\tTb\tRfr\tRfg\tRfb\tRbr\tRbg\tRbb\t0\n\n\nThe glaze script contains a default \"clear\" glass. I seem to recall that\nthis is required for the script to output a material description (eg it\nmust have a \"clear\" glass description\"). If this is not suitable the\nscript requires some modification, which I think I can offer some\nguidance on so that you can include your own \"clear\" glass description.\n\nI would suggest before you do anything else you should test out the\nscript as is with the built in values. This will let you see how it\nworks. You will assign different materials to different layers to build\nup the composite unit.\n\nTry it out and let me know if you have more questions.\n\n-Jack\n\nGalen Burrell wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090115/a7f9ce06/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 59, Issue 8", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Jan 15 18:07:19 2009"}
