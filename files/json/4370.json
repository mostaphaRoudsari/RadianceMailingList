Your suggestion is better, and should\nwork, since the glaze script only uses the transmittance and\nreflectance values for it's models.\n\nCreating a model that properly accounts for the deepening hue\nexperienced at off-angle transmission through colored glazing would\nrequire hand-modeling, since the glaze script only considers a\nsurface coating.  I don't know the construction of the Evergreen\nglass, so I'm not sure what's appropriate.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Glazing transparency/reflectivity stud", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Jan 16 08:36:05 2009"}
