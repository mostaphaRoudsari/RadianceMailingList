First you need to find out whether your settings\ntake effect or if they are taken from somewhere else. I'm\nalways puzzled by the variety of bash configuration files\nand need to consult the man page to work out what .bash_profile\n.bash_login and .bashrc are doing exactly.\n\nTo find out if your settings are effective, you should 'log off'\nfrom the cygwin environment and start a new session. This will\nreinitialise your environment. Then type\n\necho $PATH\necho $RAYPATH\n\nat the command prompt and see if the output is what you expect.\n\nIf you don't get your settings read the bash man page regarding\nthe startup sequence and the Cygwin documentation about the\nlocation of configuration files and the environment paths.\n\nThat should give you an idea how the path should look like\nand where it should go.\n\n\nFor image viewing you use 'ximage'.\n\nThe 'rview' program has been renamed to 'rvu' (the tutorial\ndoes not reflect that). It provides an interactive preview of\na scene, not an image. You can use it to control your view\nsettings before you start a long running rpict calculation\nwith high quality settings.\n\nI don't know if ximage or rvu work on cygwin but you will need\na running X server if you want to use either. Again, check the\nCygwin documentation on this topic (eg. http://x.cygwin.com).\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090120/f52d76f7/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problem", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Jan 20 04:15:19 2009"}
