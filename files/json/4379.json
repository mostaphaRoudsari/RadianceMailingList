{"body": "\n\nI used a semi-specular 90% reflective plastic material for the shelf under\nboth cloudy and intermediate sunny skies.  I guess this explains why no\ndirect sunlight was being reflected.  I'll read up on the virtual light\nsource calculation and try using a mirror material later.  I'm still not\nsure why I saw virtually no improvement in daylight distribution, even\nwithout the direct reflection shouldn't there be some bouncing of diffuse\nlight deeper into the space.  I used quite a high ceiling reflectance and I\nthink I used sufficient ambient parameters, number of bounces etc.\n\nThe test room was based on the one in chapter 6, with a 500mm clerestory\nwindow, 500mm internal projection and 750mm external projection.  I used\nskies for spring, summer and winter at midday, latitude 51 degrees north: a\nCIE cloudy sky, and four intermediate sunny skies rotated to give N S E W\norientations.\n\nNick\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Doylend", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6DEC377FFC82574CA8D35173808330BC01099189@bart.battlemccarthy.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jun 20 15:31:35 2006", "email": "ndoylend at battlemccarthy.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance and lightshelves"}
