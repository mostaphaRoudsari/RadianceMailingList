That's a lot of response. OK, I'll pack it up & get it out.\n\nWhat I've got plots the photometry diagrams in 3-D like, I believe, the\nAGI photometry mechanic does. It's a very simple viewer. Unlike the AGI,\nI don't have an editing capability. There's a text HTML summary facility\nwhich \"almost\" works. I'm not sure where that fits in people's ideas of\nsuch things, but it sounds like it's worth bundling up & distributing.\n\nSystem requirements: I have a Mac application which one can just run on\n10.5, or you need python, wxpython, and pyopengl. It works on Mac,\nsort-of works on Windows.\n\n--\nRandolph Fritz\ndesign machine group\narchitecture department\nuniversity of washington\nrfritz@u.washington.edu\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file viewer", "tags": [], "sender": "Randolph Fritz", "datetime": "Wed Jan 21 15:45:26 2009"}
