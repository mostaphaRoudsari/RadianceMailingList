It would be\nnice to put some short text.\n-Maybe some legend about planes colors should be aded. Maybe in About dialog\nor some tool-tip when we are on image.\n\nOtherwise, I think it can be very useful for fast IES files exploration.\n\nMarija\n\nOn Thu, Jan 22, 2009 at 8:23 AM, R Fritz <rfritz@u.washington.edu> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090122/fc8e5948/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file viewer", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Thu Jan 22 03:13:15 2009"}
