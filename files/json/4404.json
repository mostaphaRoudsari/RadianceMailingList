The six month long exposure compresses the time from\nDecember 17, 2007 to June 21, 2008 into a single point of view.\nDubbed a solargraph, the remarkable image was recorded with a\nsimple pinhole camera made from a drink can lined with a piece of\nphotographic paper. The Clifton Suspension Bridge over the Avon\nRiver Gorge in Bristol, UK emerges from the foreground, but\nrising and setting each day the Sun arcs overhead, tracing a\nglowing path through the sky. Cloud cover causes dark gaps in the\ndaily Sun trails. In December, the Sun trails begin lower down\nand are short, corresponding to a time near the northern\nhemisphere's winter solstice date. They grow longer and climb\nhigher in the sky as the June 21st summer solstice approaches.\n\nPhoto by Justin Quinnell.\"\n\nAnd here are some more:\n\nhttp://www.solargraphy.com/\n\nMark\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Fri Jan 23 16:28:10 2009"}
