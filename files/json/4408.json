I can take\nall pixels which have not a value of exactly 0 (as this should never\nexist for a valid material), but this seams to be not very accurate. I\nknow that I can test if a pixel is inside the field of view using pcomb,\nwhich defines S(n) as zero for pixels outside the view, but I do not\nknow how to access this value to count pixels inside the view. At the\nmoment, the easiest way for me would be to render a fisheye pointing\ntowards a 180 degree source without any geometry and count all\nnone-black pixels, but I am sure that there must be a better way to test\nfor the pixels' validity.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
