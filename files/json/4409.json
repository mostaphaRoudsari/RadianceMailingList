{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nIt sound's like Reflection X is a commercial X server? Some other\napplications to consider that enable X on Windows might be:\n\n* Cygwing with XFree - I know that some people have bashed Radiance\non Cygwin a bit, but getting the basic Cygwin plus X has be quite\na reasonable solution for running remote X sessions to our Linux\nRadiance servers.\n* Mix - this is a commercial application that we have used in the\npast, it is quite stable. It is just an X server so it does not\ncome with some of the applicaitons that a Cygwin setup might have.\nThe cost is very reasonable ($25 US), check out:\nhttp://www.microimages.com/mix/\n\nAn alternative to all of this would be to run a VNC server/client setup.\nCheck out http://www.realvnc.com/ where they have free and commercial\nclients and servers. This would provide the whole remote desktop in a\nwindow on the local host.\n\nNote also if you want to consolidate resources, instead of having two\npieces of hardware (windows box and linux box), you can try vmware\n(www.vmware.com) to run a virtual instance of one operating system\nwithin another. Thus giving you two \"machines\" on the same (1) physical\npiece of hardware. I think I posted on this earlier.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack\n\niebele wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060628/1917d009/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] coherent advice on running Radiance on win32", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<44A277B2.6080004@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<002001c69131$4a0abac0$0c01a8c0@JELLE>\t<10B2BDA8-72B6-42CF-B264-1BAEE8C0E9DC@gmail.com>\t<4492AA12.5060205@visarc.com>\t<4492D448.1070607@rumblestrip.org>", "<44A23AF2.8070905@iebele.nl>"], "datetime": "Wed Jun 28 14:36:19 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] coherent advice on running Radiance on win32"}
