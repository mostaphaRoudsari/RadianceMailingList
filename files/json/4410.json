So\nyou set the brightness to 1 if S(1) is greater then the very low\ntreshold, else set it to 0, and sum up the pixel values (which are\neither 1 or 0, thus resulting in the n of pixels > 0)? This is very\nsimilar to what I did with grep, removing all values that have zero\nluminance, and counting the lines than. I was just not sure if it is\nreally safe to rely on that pixels with zero luminance must be out of\nthe view... But most probably they are, if I do not have a perfect\nabsorber in my scene.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Getting number of pixels for fisheye view", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
