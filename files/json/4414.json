Does it just sample one ray at\nthe input point <xorg yorg zorg> in the direction <xdir ydir zdir> and\ncalculate the light gained from that direction, or it will sample many\nrays through the hemisphere and calculate all the light that reaches\nthe hemisphere? In the second case, the input direction <xdir ydir\nzdir> is the normal at point <xorg yorg zorg>.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nYu\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Sheng Yu", "datetime": "Wed Jan 28 23:32:25 2009"}
