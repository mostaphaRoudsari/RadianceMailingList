However, I don't have a good method of turning that ASCII text\nback into an image (aside from PIL, ImageMagick, and the ra_* commands). Is\nthere a way to take a series of numbers/values and convert it to a Radiance\npicture, like rpict with the ability to input data instead of a scene? If\nso, which values would I need?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n--Dave\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090130/24f88445/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "dbs176@gmail.com", "datetime": "Fri Jan 30 06:42:44 2009"}
