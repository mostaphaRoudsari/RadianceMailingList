Grobe\nSent: 04 February 2009 10:51\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi,\n\nI am completely stuck with my attempt to get some rather generic\ndiffusor into my scene. I have a room which is lid by a light pipe, and\nto simulate this I use radiance 3.7 with the pmap extension. Everything\nworks rather fine. Now I wanted to put some diffusing body under that\nlight pipe, and I chosed the trans material to do so. The material\ndefinition I used should result in a simple diffuse transmitting box:\n\nvoid trans genericDiffusor\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 .5 0\n\nAnd I applied this to a box:\n\n!genbox genericDiffusor Diffusor60x60 .3 .3 .01 | xform -t -.3 -.3 0\n\nThe opening is .6x.6m and centred at the origin, so that my diffusor\ncovers only part of it. I want to see the effect of the material... And\nthe effect is - somewhat unexpected. The \"diffusor\"-box appears black in\n\nmy rendering. So is there anything completely wrong in my scene? Is\nthere anything I got wrong about trans and surface normals, is it the\ncombination of trans and pmap?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans, pmap and head-ache...", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Feb  4 03:07:50 2009"}
