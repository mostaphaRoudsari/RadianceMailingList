{"body": "\n\n\nJust to mention such a workflow that works fine:\nWe have Refelction-X running on the windows-os machines. This tool\nallows us to open a shell using a variety of protocols on every\nunix/linux/mac machine available on the network. Reflection X allows us\nto intertface with Radiance and other unix tools/scripts using a native\nshell/xterminal from the unix box (bash, csh, etc) on a Windows pc\n(which runs 3d modelling, photoshop etc.). Reflection-X also allows rvu\nbeing displayed on a windows machine. This workflow asks for at least\none 'radiance server' and a windows workstation. Reflection X is\ncommercial software, I bought it for a low price from 2nd hand, but it\nis quite expensive new. There are other, cheaper comparable apps\navailable which I do not recall at the moment.\n\nCheers, Iebele\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] coherent advice on running Radiance on win32", "sender": "iebele", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<44A23AF2.8070905@iebele.nl>", "refs": ["<002001c69131$4a0abac0$0c01a8c0@JELLE>\t<10B2BDA8-72B6-42CF-B264-1BAEE8C0E9DC@gmail.com>\t<4492AA12.5060205@visarc.com>", "<4492D448.1070607@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Wed Jun 28 10:15:43 2006", "email": "info at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] coherent advice on running Radiance on win32"}
