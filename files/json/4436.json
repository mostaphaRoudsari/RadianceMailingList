{"body": "\nDear all\nI'm looking into buying a Luminance meter in order to carry out some light\nmeasurements in urban open spaces. The ideia is to have some sort of\nreference values in key open spaces of different configuration and surface\nmaterials, that we can use as a basis to understand what the brightness\nvalues we get in our simulated scenes actually mean in the real world.\n\nI've been looking at Minolta LS100\n(http://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaLS100.asp\n<http://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaLS100.asp> ) with very greedy eyes. But\nthe price is quite high (more than ?2,000 and as high as ?3,000 in some\nwebsites). I was wondering if this is the sort of price I should expect to\npay for a good meter or if there are others that will do the same job and\nare less pricey? Would anyone suggest any other instruments?\n\nThanks in advance.\nRaquel\n\nRaquel Viula\nFoster and Partners\nRiverside Three\n22 Hester Road\nLondon, SW11 4AN\n\nwww.fosterandpartners.com <www.fosterandpartners.com>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060626/a44be2ca/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Raquel Viula", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<68824848526ADA11B16C000D9D93A1B773BFE2@lons3004.corporate.foster.network>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun 26 13:01:22 2006", "email": "rviula at FosterandPartners.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Luminance meter"}
