{"body": "\nUsually it helps to draw a section of the room.\n\nIndirect component from sky - 1 bounce.\nInterreflection in the tower (I guess you mean no SPECULAR reflection,\ncannot ?magine non-reflective surfaces there) - 1 or two more bounces.\nNow you want to consider that even the room's ceiling gets some light\nfrom the tower, which is reflected by walls and floor (are there any\nother openings to illuminate the room?), so add one or two.\n\nAll in all I get between 3 and 5 bounces. If you use rad and a rif file,\nnote that the quality setting influences the ambient bounces calculated.\n\nBTW, if you use an illum surface, you will need far less. How important\nis it to get \"nice\" pictures in your case?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Bounces", "sender": "Lars O.
