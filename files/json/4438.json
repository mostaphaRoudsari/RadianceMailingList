If that's not possible use the\nfull path (something like '/usr/local/bin/rview').\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn 10 Feb 2009, at 12:49, Kevin Kyte wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090210/3db536fc/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rview opens VIM in VM", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Feb 10 06:06:59 2009"}
