I put a koffer around the open side of the room,\nand define these surfaces as illums using mkillum. In the next step, I\ndisplay only the scene illuminated by the mkillum-generated illum - the\nsky dome that was used to generate the illum has been removed here, to\nhave only the contribution by the illum visible.\n\nNow the illum replaces the indirekt contribution into the room, and this\nlooks ok. But - the illum also illuminates the outside geometry in my\ncase. So I have a bright area on the wall opposite of my test room. This\nis also clearly visible from inside (the sky dome has been switched on\nagain in that case).\n\nI never came to think about it, but this would mean that in all those\ncases, where we place an illum inside a fenestration, the fenestrations\ninner surfaces will appear brigther then they should be, right?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nImages are available at:\n\nhttp://www.larsgrobe.de/mkillum_inside.jpg\nhttp://www.larsgrobe.de/mkillum_outside.jpg\n\nthe yellow wireframe is supposed to explain the illum surfaces...\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
