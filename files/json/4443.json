{"body": "\nI'm interested in using RADIANCE for visual psychophysics. I've done a\nlittle bit of experimentation with an old laptop running Linux and now\nwant to set up a dedicated RADIANCE system. The work I'm intending to\ncarry out involves producing fairly large numbers of short animations so\nrendering speed is important but, as I don't want to spend large amounts\nof money, I'm thinking in terms of a consumer-type PC running Linux. Am\nI correct in assuming that rendering performance will be almost entirely\ndetermined by CPU and memory? I'd be glad of recommendations\n(specifically for using RADIANCE) about CPUs (basically Pentium 4 vs\nPentium D) and memory (I assume 2G is ample - my scenes only contain 5\nor 10 objects and one or two light sources). Some PC graphics cards\n(e.g. nVidia 6800) claim to handle more that 24 bits per pixel and hence\nsupport HDR imaging - will these improve the pixel-depth of my RADIANCE\nrenders? The system will be calibrated with a spectroradiometer so we\nreally can exploit improved colour resolution if it is there to be had!\n\nmany thanks,\n\nBob Kentridge\nUniversity of Durham\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Robert Kentridge", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<449E91C1.6080502@durham.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Jun 25 15:38:28 2006", "email": "robert.kentridge at durham.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] PC hardware advice"}
