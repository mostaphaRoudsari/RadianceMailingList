When I replaced the polygon\nsurface that I had been using before by a !gensurf-line, I ended up with\na wrong surface normal. This made my illum become oriented to the\noutside world. As the other surfaces where still facing inwards, the\nculprit surface still got enough light from the sides to illuminate the\nopposite wall. I only found this when I switched to the light modifier\ntype using mkillums l+, because than the surface appeared completely\nblack when seen from inside (the illum being not visible itself makes\nthis kind of debugging more difficult, and I was 100% sure that the\norientation was ok because I had tested it before - but than there had\nbeen the polygon).\n\nSo, this is my second non-problem reported to the list, sorry for\nmessing up your mail boxes...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum illuminating outside?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
