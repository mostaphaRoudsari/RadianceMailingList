I have been informed that this is the latest\nversion of Radiance for Windows OS. Unfortunately I now have trouble reading\nimages exported from Ecotect.\n\nWhen I export the Ecotect example file \"RADIANCE_example.eco\" I am able to\nsee a rendered view of the space in the image viewer, but I cannot run any\nof the options for the information overlay (e.g. contour lines, false color,\ndaylight factors etc.) and get the message \"RGBE read error\"\nWhen exporting the file from Ecotect, I noticed that when checking whether\nRadiance is functional, the exporter returned a message saying that the\napplication \"rview\" is missing from the directory. Could this be the\nproblem? If so, what are alternative ways for evaluating the radiance image?\n\nI have uploaded an image of the error message to the Autodesk discussion\nforum:\nhttp://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=6124907#6124907\n\nThanks,\n\nKrystyna\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090213/0fb3a19a/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "datetime": "Fri Feb 13 17:57:30 2009"}
