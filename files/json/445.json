The option I\nmeant was the last one with the one polygon that closes the coffer. I\nwas counting 1, 2, 3 after the base case diagram, sorry.\n\nAs far as the light \"artifacts\" around the coffers, I have to guess that\nthose are geometry. You may want to make sure everything is an illum\ntype. And  also triple check the orientation of polygons (maybe make\nthem lights or glows and objview just the light polygons to check\norientation.\n\n-Jack\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu, 11 Sep 2003 13:30:26 -0400"}
