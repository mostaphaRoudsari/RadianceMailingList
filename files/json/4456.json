I just compiled it on Mac OS with gcc\n4.01. I didn't use any flags ('CCOPTS=') and set 'CC=gcc'.\n\nI always got an error when compiling it. Today I looked\nthis up and found that there is a macro fropen() that\nconflicts with the definition in the gensky source file\nfropen.c (on Mac OS X BSD at least). I renamed 'fropen'\nto 'fzopen' in fropen.c and gendaylit.c and it worked!\n\nYou may also include 'string.h' to avoid a warning\nabout strcpy.\n\nHth and servus,\n\nThomas\n\n\n\nOn 16 Feb 2009, at 12:42, Chandrayee Basu wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Installing gendaylit", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon Feb 16 06:08:20 2009"}
