So what does\nthis mean, are the values related to the way the reflectance is measured\nand calculated using different procedures according to standards?\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: lars_grobe.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 299 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090218/6299b372/lars_grobe.vcf\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
