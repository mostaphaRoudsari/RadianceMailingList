The command you quoted from Greg's\nmail does not change the projection (or view-type). It corrects for the\nweigth of luminances according to their angle from the optical axis (or\nthe view-direction of the sensor) when contributing to the illuminance\nof a point, which is also known as the cosine law. So you can expect a\nfall-off. Do you want to change the projection of an existing image?\n\nLars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] vta 2 vth", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
