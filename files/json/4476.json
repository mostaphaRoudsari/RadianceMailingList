You may investigate blender and brad\nor an alternative commercial solution (maya, cinema, max, rhino...).\n\nAdditionally there is a script that eliminates the material descriptions\nfrom 3ds converted files and allows you to use a custom file for them\n(this would facilitate updating the model if using 3ds). Look for it on\nthis email list, it's somewhere.\n\nAnyway the strategy is almost the same with all of them: you create a 3d\nfile within your favourite software, save as an exchange format, run the\nconversion command, compile the scene and generate the results.\nEvery time you change the model in a 3d software you need to import it\nagain (this can be automated with a script).\n\nhope this is useful.\nciao\nG.\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of sasa\nmj\nSent: 13 June 2006 18:27\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nDear All,\n\nI am a fairly new user.
