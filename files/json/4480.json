The higher value (82) seems like a way to define the BRDF.i.e. BRDF(theta-i, phi-i, theta-r, phi-r) = 82/76 = 1.079You'd need to know (manufacturer definition)what the actual angle configurations (theta and phi) are for the 60-degree measurement, then working backwards using the Radiance equation, you'd get the roughness (RMS) value.for example, if both angles are zero, roughness = 0.272.if both angles are 30 (60-degree split evenly), roughness = 0.292 What exactly is the material? If it is more smooth than rough (polished metal rather than plastic-ky) then obviously my guess is wrong. cheers,YC Huang  I think that what you want to do is:\n\n<total reflectance> - <diffuse reflectance> = <specular reflectance>\n\nthus\n\n86 - 10 = 76\n\nThe specular reflectance that is provided is for a measurement at 60\ndegrees incidence, if I understand this correctly.\n\n-Jack\n\nLars O.
