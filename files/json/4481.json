{"body": "\nBRLCAD (which is a free csg-based CAD) supports both IGES and OBJ. So\nyou could try to convert from IGES to G (the model format in BRLCAD) and\nfrom G to OBJ. As BRLCAD is a unix application, just like radiance, it\nshould be possible to easily integrate this into your radiance workflow\nby piping through the conversion chain (import and export filters are\nstandalone command line tools).\n\nCool...
