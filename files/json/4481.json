Quite\nan odd question, I'm thinking.\n\nHere's an image to get you started, showing half the sky, latitude lines,\n\"former longitude\" lines, ground, and a sun, projected onto a 2D circle:\nhttp://auror.us/radiance/skyout.png .\n\n--Dave\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090219/90388c38/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Smith", "datetime": "Wed Feb 18 21:04:19 2009"}
