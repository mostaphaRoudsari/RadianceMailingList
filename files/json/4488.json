Is there any other way\nthen modeling the lenses' geometry (or its equivalent full lenses')? As\nfar as I got it, I cannot model it in prism2, as the distance from the\nlense center is not available when calculating the outgoing ray. Generic\nbrtf is not supported with pmap.\n\nI guess the best way to determine the properties of the lense is a laser\npointer, millimeter-gridded paper and moving the pointer parallel to the\nlense surface, right? Or is there another way recommended for those of\nus who do not have a full equipped lab at home?\n\nI have that strange feeling that I am leaving Radiance's application\nfocus right here, but this is something quite relevant. These diffusers\nare commonly used with ligh redirecting systems, and these systems can\nbe (and are) modeled using Radiance+pmap.\n\nCU...
