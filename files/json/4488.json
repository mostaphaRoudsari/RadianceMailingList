But I'm afraid I may have misunderstood your question.  As\nfor the single/dual surface question, I guess it depends on how close\nyour views will bring you to the shade.  The trans material is\ninfinitely thin, and it'd be best to model the thng as a single\nsurface.  For closeup work, you may need to introduce thickness but\nthat's gonna get a lot more complicated from a valid material\ndefinition standpoint.\n\n\n\nMmmm, measurements, yeah.  The gear can be expensive.  Let's see, at\nmy old job, where I did these measurements, I used an illuminance\nmeter, a luminance meter and a theatrical spotlight (ETC Source Four\nHID, aka \"leko\", or ERS).  The light fixture was a free sample, but\nyou could use other sources too.  The illuminance meter (Minolta\nSomethingorother-nowdiscontinued) was about $800 and the luminance\nmeter (Minolta LS-100) was more expensive, I believe almost three\nthousand USD.  Actually, here are a couple of links I just found for\nthe meters I used (the illuminance meter I link to here is a newer\nmodel than I used, but it's basically the same thing).\n\nhttp://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaTL1.asp\nhttp://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaLS100.asp\n\nIt's expensive not to mention time-consuming, but it's also fun and\nis an excellent example of the power of Radiance, in that Radiance is\nhappy to accept material data as complex as you are willing to gather.\n\nMaybe Peter can chime in with his thoughts on this stuff, and maybe\nan update on his goniophotometer project?\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Material", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<23AF4B12-E53E-4881-85E0-5F6BE47AFB77@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<BAY115-F374CC0645B5C765C453B1BA4960@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Sat Jun  3 18:56:52 2006", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Material"}
