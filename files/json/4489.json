If somebody needs packages for Etch,\nplease let me know.\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nGPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "datetime": "Sat Feb 21 08:02:18 2009"}
