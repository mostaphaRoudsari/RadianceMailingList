{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nWelcome to the wonderful, confusing world of \"trans\".\n\nI don't know of any good way to measure oddly-shaped translucent\nmaterials.  Perhaps others on the list will have suggestions for\nthat....\n\n\nThe reason the trans parameters are so peculiar is so their valid\nrange is easy to understand -- between 0 and 1 for everything except\nroughness.  (For physical value ranges, you may also consult the file\n\"ray/doc/notes/materials\".)  Pages 325 and 326 from Chas' chapter in\n\"Rendering with Radiance\" are also invaluable.  There have been a\nnumber of threads on trans over the years, and this is definitely one\nfor the Radiance FAQ, should it ever materialize -- no pun intended.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Guidelines for trans Material", "sender": "Gregory J.
