As the light\nmodified surfaces as generated by mkillum with l+ block direct light\nsources, the direct components should be included into their\ndistribution. At least if this is what they are made for. So is this\nswitch only for debugging purposes and does not change the actual\ncalculation done by mkillum, or does it also generate a valid\nrepresentation of the environment?\n\nThanks & CU, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: lars_grobe.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 299 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090302/6601d49a/lars_grobe.vcf\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
