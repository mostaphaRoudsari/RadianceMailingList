This will NOT produce an\nappropriate model for blinds that admit direct sunlight, but will be\nfine if sunlight is excluded by the blind angle or for diffusing or\nother surfaces where the direct component is negligible.\n\nIt's not merely for debugging purposes -- using light sources rather\nthan illum's is appropriate under some circumstances.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<49ABC15E.9000803@nus.edu.sg>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Mar  2 09:37:35 2009"}
