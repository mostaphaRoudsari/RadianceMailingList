But the first step would indeed be to\nfeed all those rays to rtrace, and I don't see an automatic way\nto get that information from any Radiance program.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not very hard to construct that set\nof vectors with a little program of your own for a standard\nperspective. Two or three dozen lines of code will do the trick.\nYou don't even need to understand the actual view transformation.\nJust walk through a regular grid on your image plane, subtract\nthe view point from each of those grid points, and write the\nresult into a file. There's no need to normalize the vectors to\nunit lenght.\n\nI'm not sure if this could be done with cnt/rcalc, and frieds,\nas I have rarely used them myself. I suspect that a more complete\nprogramming language (eg. Python) will be more effective to work with.\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrac", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Wed, 10 Oct 2001 22:47:53 -0400 (EDT)"}
