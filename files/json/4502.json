{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have rectangular surface with sensor points organized as a regular 2D\ngrid. The color of each sensor is defined based on sun exposure data, I\ncalculate separately (some kind of false-color). With this data I can\ncreate an image with the surface and sensors on it, where color of\nsensors define the distribution of sun exposure on the surface.\nNow, I want to make this representation continual (like the results of\nfalsecolor program), so I must somehow interpolate the color data from\nthe sensor points.\nMy idea is to define the rectangular surface near the original one, made\nof plastic with colordata pattern. Colordata takes next form:\nmod colordata id\n7+n+\nrfunc gfunc bfunc rdatafile gdatafile bdatafile\nfuncfile x1 x2  transform\n0\nm A1 A2 .. Am\n\nrdatafile gdatafile bdatafile will be defined with my sensor colors.\n\nHow should I define rfunc, gfunc, bfunc to enable bilinear or bicubic\ninterpolation of color?\n\n\nRelated question:\nAre there any example of coloradata definition? I tried to find them in\nthe Book and in mail archives, but without success!\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Cvetkovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<44C4A66C.7030006@bankerinter.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jul 24 13:19:15 2006", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Colordata question!"}
