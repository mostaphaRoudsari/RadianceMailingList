I use it quite frequently for quick\nconversion to jpg (using convert -gamma 2.2 in.hdr out.jpg) when I want\ne.g. to send a preview by mail. Not urgent really, but if you should\never want to update the record, you could include this.\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: lars_grobe.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 299 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090306/d3ce0c58/lars_grobe.vcf\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] vnd.radiance is now an IANA image media t", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
