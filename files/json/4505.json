{"body": "\nHi Chris.\n\nI never checked the angles gensky prints but I remember that Radiance\nunderstands \"+\" as west and \"-\" as east. (Remember that it was written\nin and for America and it's always good for your ego to have a \"+\"\nassociated\nwith you ;) So the output should be fine. You can check the output of an\nhourly\ncycle to see how the value changes.\n\nYour main problem can be solved by using a file with the diffuser as a\nvertical\nplane at a position \"south\" of the origin and \"!xform\" it into place\nwith the altitude\nand azimuth as arguments for the \"-ry\" and \"-rz\" options:\n\n!xform -ry <altitude*-1> -rz <azimuth*-1> diffuser.rad\n\nThe order of -ry and -rz is important!\n\nTo model the \"perfect diffuser\" have a look at Schorsch excelent\nexplanation\nof the trans material at\n\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html\n\nIf I understand you right you want a material with 100 % diffuse\ntransmittance.\nI'm not sure Radiance does this correctly as it is physically imposible\nbut it's\nworth a try.\n\nHave fun,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Chris\nFoster\nSent: 24 July 2006 13:39\nTo: Radiance general discussion; Radiance general\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\nI have an aim to find out the luminance of the sun after it hits a\nperfect diffuser. I'm sure i have done this the very long way round, but\nat least this step by step way i understand what is going on.\n\nI have used gensky to create a sun, and have created a sky and a ground\n(see bottom).\n\nAside question- the default for meridian using gensky is -120, and as im\nin london i have put my meridian to 0. this seems to give me a negative\nazimuth angle for my early morning sun and a positive for my afternoon\nsun. this means that the sun is rising in the west and setting in the\neast....im sure its the other way round?????????? the first four lines\nof the 10am automatically generated gensky file can be seen below\n# gensky 07 24 10 -a 52 -o 2 -m 0 +s\n# Local solar time: 9.76\n# Solar altitude and azimuth: 48.8 -52.0\n# Ground ambient level: 18.3\n\nI have created different files for the sun throughout one day, started\nand finishing at 7, so that i have 13 different sun's.\nI have then oconv each file to my material file, found a nice view\ndirectly at the sun for each time in rview and then rendering the image\nin rpict and finally pcond each image with a -h- option to get a good\nexposure level. So i have 13 images all looking directly at the sun.\nWhen i then click on a point and press l it gives me a value for (i\nthink????) luminance.\n\nI now want to place a perfect diffuser with a normal pointed directly at\nthe sun in each of these 13 positions and measure the illuminance\nreflecting off of the diffuser. My big question is, how do i orientate\nthe diffuser so that it is normal to the sun each time, and any\nrecommendations as to what material/values i should make the diffuser\nfrom??\n\nMy sky.mat file just for completion\n\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\nskyfunc glow ground_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nground_glow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180\n\n# ground plane\n\nvoid plastic ground_mat\n0\n0\n5 .28 .18 .12 0 0\n\nground_mat ring groundplane\n0\n0\n8 0 0 -.01\n0 0 1\n0 30\n\nThanks\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential and/or\nprivileged material; it is for the intended addressee(s) only.\nIf you are not a named addressee, you must not use, retain or\ndisclose such information.\n\nNPL Management Ltd cannot guarantee that the e-mail or any\nattachments are free from viruses.\n\nNPL Management Ltd.
