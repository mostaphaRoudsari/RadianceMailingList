{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\nIf you use the default \"red\" \"green\" and \"blue\" functions for rfunc,\ngfunc, and bfunc, you will get a bilinear interpolation by default.\nIt may not look very nice, though, as bilinear interpolations tend to\nshow \"mach band\" artifacts.  A simpler approach would be to convert\nyour data into a low-resolution image then upsample it with pfilt.\nThe conversion can be done using pvalue.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Colordata question!", "sender": "Gregory J.
