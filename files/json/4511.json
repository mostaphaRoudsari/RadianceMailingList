At the same\ntime, medical and health research is focusing more on light and its effect\non human health and a unified understanding of light and its impact on\nhuman beings has evolved; in general, buildings that use daylight are\nhealthier places to live in.\n\nThis third daylight symposium will focus specifically on benefits in\nconnection with energy use and health. The programme will provide updates\non the scientific progress in the field as well as experiences and\nviewpoints from architectural practices. The programme will also include\nseparate sessions addressing particular aspects of daylighting as well as\nopen discussions between the speakers and the audience. The symposium will\nfeature invited papers and commentaries from leading scientists and\npractitioners.\n\nFor more information on the programme and registrations please visit\nwww.thedaylightsite.com.\n\nhttp://www.thedaylightsite.com/symposium.asp?tp=1024&y=2009\n\nDeadline for registration on 4 April 2009.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nNicolas Roy\nVELUX A/S\nnicolas.roy@velux.com\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090313/53dffbe3/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Nicolas Roy", "datetime": "Fri Mar 13 09:19:27 2009"}
