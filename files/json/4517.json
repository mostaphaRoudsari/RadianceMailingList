{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI have some monitor screens facing quite big window. Therefore, there may be  glare occured on the monitor screens. I would like to study this through radiance. I wonder how to model the monitor screen in radiance (what material, what reflectance?) and what glare assessment should be used (dgi?ugr?cie?or others?)\n\nThank you very much. I really appreciate your help.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYuni\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNext-gen email? Have it all with the  all-new Yahoo!
