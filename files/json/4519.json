{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nthank you for your quick reply and your attached LCD info.\n\nYes correct, I am thinking of veiling glare on the screen that will reduce visibility. Before I received your email, I tried mirror as LCD material. Surely, there is glare (as shown in file.pic), but when I calculate all glare parameter in radiance (dgi, ugr, cie, and others) the results are 0. May be those parameter cannot be used to calculate veiling glare on monitor screen? (high contrast occur vertically on the screen)\n\nThank you very much, Greg.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYuni\n\n\"Gregory J.

You can substitute\nany 1024x768 screen shot you like for \"VDTdisp.pic\". Make sure the\nmaximum value is <= 1.0.\n\nAs for glare analysis, I don't know how you mean to associate\ndiscomfort glare with a VDT. Perhaps you are thinking of veiling\nglare -- reflections from the screen that reduce visibility?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
