Did  you perform the cosine sensitivity\nexperiment I suggested?  You could mask off a portion of the center\nof a tube if you don't have a small UV source, and see how the sensor\nresponds as a function of incident angle at a fixed distance.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<3acd9e4a0904050446o3418968fr6ee649c8389ff474@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun Apr  5 07:19:49 2009"}
