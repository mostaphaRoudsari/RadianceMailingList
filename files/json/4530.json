What kind of \"cosine-corrected\nsensor\" do you use? I know that type of probe head which is connected to\na fibre leading to the sensor. As far as I understood it, the cosine\ncorrection happens simply by using a diffusing piece of transmissive\nmaterial, that scatters light entering from any direction. I have always\nbeen curious how these can achieve a real cosine correction, as the\nscattering material is always mounted behind a thin ring to hold it in\nplace, thus never seeing full 180 degree. In the case of uv, the\nwavelength dependance of the scattering may also play a role. Have all\ncomponents been tested for uv transmittance, or is it possible that any\ncomponent is made for i.e. visible light only? Or are you using an\nentirely different set-up, e.g. not a probe connected to fibre but a\nspecific uv sensor?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<DB77915B-7DFD-45CE-8B58-DBA5BDA757FB@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
