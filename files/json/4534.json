{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nIf anyone should be kicked off, it's me -- I've been answering e-\nmails when I'm rushed and tired and doing a bad job of it, so\napologies to everyone.\n\nYou are correct that the last value reported (the one with an 'L'\nnext to it) in rvu is the luminance in candelas/meter^2, or nits.  To\nget illuminance instead, turn on the -i option via the \"set i y\"\ncommand in rvu then do the trace again.  You can switch irradiance\nmode off again with \"set i n\".\n\nI hope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR & Isocontour help.", "sender": "Gregory J.
