The most useful way would be\nfalsecolor images. As falsecolor by default multiplies pixel values by\n179 to get from radiometric to photometric units, you must tell it to\nuse a multiplier of 1 instead of 179. Than, you most probably have to\nset the scale in a way that you see the irradiances in your image. One\nexample, using a scale of 0-5000 and the multiplier 1 (to avoid the\nconversion to lx) would be like this:\n\nfalsecolor -i input.hdr -m 1 -s 5000 -l \"Watts/m2\" > output.hdr\n\n\nSorry but I have no idea wether you can do that.\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: lars_grobe.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 299 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090407/24d649e5/lars_grobe.vcf\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance and irradiati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
