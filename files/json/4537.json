Most probably something is wrong with your\nRadiance installation, the most common origin of all trouble are PATH\nand RAYPATH settings not pointing to the right directories. But here we\nhit a point that I cannot really help you - I have zero experience with\nRadiance on Windows, and usually it is guaranteed 100% more pain for\ndoing the same. Can you check your installation?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Tue Apr  7 06:01:48 2009"}
