In this case they should increase\nthe daylight factor further into the room. If the room\nis too long even a light shelve will not help. The room\ngeometry (and of course surface colours) have to fit to\nbenefit of a light shelve treatment.\n\n2) Because they are effectively an obstruction in the window\nthey will reduce the DF for the front and the middle of\nthe room. At the front we usually have plenty of daylight\nand don't mind; in the middle the loss in DF might in fact\nbe bigger than the gain at the back which would reduce the\noverall DF.\n\n3) Daylight studies (at least DF calculations) are usually done\nwith a standard CIE overcast sky. This sky model has no sunlight\ncomponent and is therefore most inappropriate to estimate the\nefficiency of light shelves. A light shelve will only reduce the\navailable window opening and the light coming in.\nHowever it's the only sky model mentioned in the British Standard\n- and I suppose everywhere else - so it's used to get the one or\ntwo numbers the architects need to get their BREEAM or LEED browny\npoints.
