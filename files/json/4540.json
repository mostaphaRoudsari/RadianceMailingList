{"body": "\n\nHi Ramana,\n\nI think it will be imprecise to answer your question in terms of black or\nwhite. In fact it depends on several factor such lightshelf type, geometry,\nsize, location, materials, window orientation and size, room dimensions, sky\nconditions (\"luminous climate\"), building maintenance among others.\n\nSometimes, controlling the amount of radiation entering a room and therefore\nreducing very high light levels close to the window wall helps creating a\ncomfortable lighting environment, by reducing the contrast between levels at\nthe view window and those at the back of the room, yet sacrificing on\nilluminance levels.\nBest regards,\n\nGuedi Capeluto\n\nArch.

Why?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRamana Koti, Sustainable Building Analyst\nLEED AP\n\nELEMENTS | a division of berkebile nelson immenschuh mcdowell architects\n106 W. 14th Street Suite 200\nKansas City, Missouri 64105\n\np 816.783.1635 f 816.783.1501\nwww.bnim.com| elements.bnim.com\n\nMobile Phone: 480.326.9275\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060728/9\nb6b1668/attachment-0001.html\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 29, Issue 13\n************************************************\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "ramana.koti@gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001601c6b3c8$704ddd20$6402a8c0@GuediLGLW20>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 28 Jul 2006 14:56:13 -0500", "email": "\"Ramana Koti\"", "subject": "[Radiance-general] effectiveness of light shelvesTo: \"Radiance general discussion\""}
