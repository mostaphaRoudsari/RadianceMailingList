{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nI am attempting to use illums in conjunction with translucent light fixtures\nin order to produce smoother renderings. One problem that I am having is\nthat the illums themselves are causing shadows (see here)\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/room7a_day_Camera07_day_pcyl_tr3.jpg\n\n\nFor the wall fixture, you can see the shadow of the spherical illum. I am\nusing a void material for the illum so it's invisible to the eye but\nobviously not invisible to shadow rays. Is there any work around for this?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illums Causing Shadows", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY115-F2D913024E4DC1836927ACA45F0@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Jul 30 17:28:30 2006", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illums Causing Shadows"}
