{"body": "\nHi all, I'm running a radiance calculation, and as always, I compare my radiance calcs with AGI to make sure I didn't mess up.  I know enough to be dangerous!  :)\n\nMy comparison consists of placing a calculation point 10' below an iesfile based light fixture.\n\nAGI calc = 64810 lux\n\nRadiance = 40,822 lux.\n\nies2rad -di -t white iesfile.rad\nrtrace -w -h -I -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 2048 -as 512 -ar 512 -ds .1 -aw 0 test.oct < input_pt.txt | rcalc -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'\n\nOK, red flag, I've messed up somehow.  The numbers are off by 30%.\n\nAfter almost giving up, I ran the same command but deleted the \"-ds .1\" and got 64844 lux!\n\nWhat's going on here?  I would think source substructuring \"-ds .1\" would be better than the default (which I think is .2)  I appreciate your thoughts.\n\nMark\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060731/ec225736/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<44CE362102000049000004F1@wmtao.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Aug  1 00:28:42 2006", "email": "MdelaFuente at wmtao.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] calculation weirdness"}
