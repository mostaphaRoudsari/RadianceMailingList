We are performing comparison for two sets of blinds, one\nis the normal conventional horizontal blinds and the other one is\nthe split blinds in which the the blinds system is split into\nthree equal parts. when measuring illuminance values for year long\nsimulations . I observe that we get large errors in values in\nDecember  varying from 10% to 60% ( difference in values between\nconventional and split blinds though they are at the same angle\nand same geometry) I observe these disturbances only in the month\nof December and at the sensor point closest to the window. Is this\nkind of error normal..?\n\nThank you\n\nG V Deepak\nGainesville, Florida\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "G V DEEPAK", "datetime": "Fri Apr 17 15:59:29 2009"}
