Even less than 12 minutes.  Yes, it's because of mkillum.\nIf you think of mkillum as a tool to generate an \"ies file\" for a\ncomplex bit of geometry, it makes a lot of sense (to me).  You move the\ncoffer's contribution to the room illuminance from the indirect\ncalculation to the direct one, which is much faster.\n\nSo now I have a great looking room, but a bad-looking coffer.  The illum\nbug that Georg & Greg have been discussing also seems to have shown up\nfor a visit in my current renderings.  =8-\\\n\nBefore I can use Greg's tip about excluding the coffer materials, I need\nto learn a bit about coming up with a valid -av number.  But, to be\nhonest, this already gives a good impression of the space.  The whole\npoint of the rendering was to see how bad the glare would be from the\ncoffers (answer: bad), which can be judged just fine from the direct\ncomponent of the glows.\n\nThat said, I would still like to get the coffers looking better. I will\nhave to revisit this problem when I have time...\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] coffers, glows & illums", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon, 15 Sep 2003 17:01:33 -0400"}
