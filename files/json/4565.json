{"body": "\nHi Yuni,\n\nDiscomfort glare and reflected glare off a VDT screen are very\ndifferent, which is why using findglare doesn't tell you anything.\nThe contrast lost on a VDT due to reflected glare is a little tricky\nto measure, and there are no corresponding standards.  You can think\nof the contrast as the difference between the foreground and the\nbackground divided by the adaptation luminance (usually the same the\nbackground):\n\nContrast = (L_fore - L_back)/L_back\n\nSince reflected glare increases foreground and background equally,\nthe new contrast becomes:\n\nContrast_veil = (L_fore - L_back)/(L_back + L_veil)\n\nThe larger the veiling luminance, the lower the contrast.  Does this\nmake sense?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare on monitor screen", "sender": "Gregory J.
