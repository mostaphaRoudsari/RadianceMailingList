It's best if you interleave\nyour wavelengths so that RGB still roughly corresponds to reds,\ngreens, and blues, but it isn't completely critical.  The bright()\nmacro is only used for determining ray weights and the like, so\nshould have only a modest effect on the result.  Running individual\nwavelength calculations will not help at all.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<73D529D687144D77B030A34DCC1366E6@UNIVERSI047A23>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Apr 24 07:55:49 2009"}
