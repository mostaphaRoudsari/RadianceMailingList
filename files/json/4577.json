You could try\nto disable the 3D acceleration (won't affect rview/rvu, but other things\nlike blender) or use a standard\ndriver and see if that helps when you run rvu. If that's your problem\nupgrade/downgrade to a different\ndriver version or replace the graphics card with another type/chip.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090425/d682d3c8/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: Fwd: [Radiance-general] fatal XIO - newbi", "tags": [], "sender": "tbleicher@arcor.de", "datetime": "Fri, Apr 24, 2009 at 10:29 PM"}
