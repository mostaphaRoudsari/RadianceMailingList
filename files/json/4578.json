I\npersonally would not ever go for nVidia.\n\nIf you are using a distro which default-enables Compiz desktop effects,\nsuch as Ubuntu, try disabling them:\n\nSystem > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects\n\nUbuntu defaults to a setting which give you semi-tranparent windows,\nsmooth animations when launching apps or switching desktop. It's called\n'Normal' in the control panel, When set to 'Extra', all the whizz-bang\nis enabled, leaving OSX and Windows 7 in the dust.\n\nTry setting it to 'None', and see if your problem goes away. I had a\nsimilar problem on an Ubuntu box with nVidia card some time ago. rvu\nwould launch, but then get stuck for up to 30 seconds.
