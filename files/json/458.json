As mentioned in the rpict man page, when using -ds and -dj\nfor getting penumbras, you need to set -ps to 1 or you'll get\nvery uneven results. Rendering at multiplied resolutions can\ncompensate only for a part of the pixels that are skipped in the\ncalculation with -ps 4.\n\nWhile you ended up needing up to 8x and more resolution, I think\nyou'd get acceptable results at no more than 3x with -ps 1.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Testing rpict's -aa 0 opti", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Tue, 16 Sep 2003 17:16:33 -0400 (EDT)"}
