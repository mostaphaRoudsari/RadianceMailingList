Some of the interesting features of VIPS are that concurrency comes\nfree, it reads / writes radiance HDR files natively, and operates\ntile-based, such that unreasonably large image are processed\nefficiently. Given the complete API, its an incredibly effective way\nof processing HDR data.\n\nCheers,\n\n-jelle\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "jelle feringa", "datetime": "Sat Apr 25 10:42:00 2009"}
