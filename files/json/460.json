I used obj2mesh.\nI remember there were some difficulties with the mesh primitive in the\nofficial 3.5 release.\nYou might need to recompile with the latest Head sources ?\nIf there are too many overlapping triangles obj2mesh will create an error\nmessage.\nAlso with ambient bounces >0 Radiance has difficulties smoothing the normals\ncorrectly. You will get\nsome smoothing artefacts if -ab >0.\n\n\nBernhard\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Poser to Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Bernhard Spanlang", "datetime": "Wed, 24 Sep 2003 13:00:44 +0100"}
