{"body": "\nHi Bei,\n\nRpict doesn't do any tone-mapping on its output -- what you get are\nin fact the radiometric values in a floating-point image format.\nPcond or normtiff can be used for tone-mapping.\n\nThe differences between machines may be due to variations in the\nrandom number generator.  If you set -ps 1, I expect your results\nwill look more similar, though they still won't be an exact match.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] .pic file and tonemap", "sender": "Gregory J.
