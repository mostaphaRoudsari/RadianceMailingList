{"body": "\nThanks to Thomas for offering that thoughtful reply.  I'm a little\nswamped at the moment...  The files I gave to Yuni under the subject\n\"glare on monitor screen\" a couple weeks ago are the best I have to\noffer at the moment.  Note that I used a \"mixfunc\" type to get the\ndiffuse, specular, and emission to happen together in one material.\nThe \"glass\" isn't really appropriate, for the reasons Thomas\nmentioned among others.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] displays", "sender": "Gregory J.
