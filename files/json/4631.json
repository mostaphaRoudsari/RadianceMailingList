{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nYou can try it, but if your purpose is to reduce rendering times, I\ndon't expect you'll see much difference from taking the surface\nnormals away.  The implementation of normal interpolation in Radiance\nmeshes is fairly efficient.\n\nI also wrote a utility for manipulating .OBJ files (a bit), but it\nwas written under contract with someone else and depends on some\nother code I developed that isn't part of Radiance.  I could\ndistribute binaries, but compiling under multiple architectures is\nbeyond my abilities right now.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] filtering normal information from an obj", "sender": "Gregory J.
