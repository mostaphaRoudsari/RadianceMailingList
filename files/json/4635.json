I'm not sure where that project stands, to be honest.  I\nknow it is possible to compile the command-line tool hdrgen under\nWindows with some effort, but it hasn't been done for many a year.\n\nThe Canon 5D camera with Sigma fisheye is a good choice, and Sigma\nhas a 180-degree fisheye that works on APS sensors now as well, so\nyou could get a Nikon D90 (or whatever) and use that as a lower-cost\nalternative.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR images", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu May 14 08:54:35 2009"}
