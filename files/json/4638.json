I typically use IES Virtual Environment as the\ninterface for Radiance, and I find I like it a fair amount, in terms of\nease-of-use.  Since this is where I started using Radiance, I'm\nwondering if anyone has any insights into what IES Virtual Environment\ncan/cannot do when compared to scripting from scratch.  Anyone offering\ninsight here would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChien Si Harriman, LEED AP\n\nSenior Building Performance Engineer\n\n\n\nG U T T M A N N & B L A E V O E T |  C o n s u l t i n g  E n g i n e e\nr s\n\n2351 Powell Street | San Francisco, CA 94133\n\nCommitted to the 2030 Challenge <http://architecture2030.org/>\n\n\n\nDirect  415.655.4005 | Main  415.655.4000 | Fax  415.655.4001\nEmail charriman@gb-eng.com | www.gb-eng.com\n\n\nSan Francisco |  Sacramento |  Santa Rosa\nCertified Green Business, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Santa Rosa |\n2007 Sacramento Sustainable Business of the Year Award Recipient\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090518/933aabe4/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Chien Si Harriman", "datetime": "Mon May 18 15:02:08 2009"}
