After many lengthy iterations (20+ hours for each\nsimulation) the best image I could generate is the image attached.\n\n\n\nMy problems are the splotchy nature of the light being reflected off the\nceiling space and the baffled louvers under the skylight. The render\nsettings that I used to generate the image are as follows;\n\n\n\n*-dp=*\n\n*-ar=*\n\n*-ms=*\n\n*-ds=*\n\n*-dt=*\n\n*-dc=*\n\n*-dr=*\n\n*-sj=*\n\n*-st=*\n\n*-ab=*\n\n*-af=*\n\n*-aa=*\n\n*-ad=*\n\n*-as=*\n\n*-av=*\n\n*-lr=*\n\n*-lw=*\n\n512\n\n128\n\n3.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.7\n\n0.1\n\n8\n\nRCP.amb\n\n0.1\n\n1023\n\n512\n\n0.01 0.01 0.01\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\n\nI?ve increased the accuracy of the variables which I thought were critical\nto the accuracy of this particular render. These were; ambient resolution\n(ar), ambient bounces (ab), ambient accuracy (aa), ambient divisions (ad)\nand ambient super-samples (as).\n\n\n\nIs it a case of increasing the accuracy of these specific variables further\nor is there an easier or quicker way to achieve better rendering?\n\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090519/332d1bd5/attachment-0001.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Paul Chilton", "datetime": "Mon May 18 17:19:56 2009"}
