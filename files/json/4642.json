I'm having a hard time understanding what the\nlighting design is in this image. There seems to be a cove or\nsomething on the left, and some baffled ceiling condition to the right\nof that, that changes in plan. maybe you could describe the lighting\ndesign and the section of that ceiling? Where is the skylight and what\nis the section of that in relation to this scene? What are the\ncharacteristics of the media between the external daylight and the\ninterior scene? That information might inform a solution to these\nrendering issues (because there may be a solution to them that takes\nless than 20 hours to get results better than what you have posted).\nEither way, for a scene this apparent size, the -ar seems low right\noff the bat; also, the -ab is way high for an image (generally\nspeaking); and the -ad and -as are probably too low.\n\n\nOn May 18, 2009, at 6:32 PM, Paul Chilton wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090518/e2e85c16/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<63252a3e0905181732m3ddc2e50xd6a6d83e02979aff@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon May 18 22:04:02 2009"}
