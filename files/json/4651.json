Lars has explained that mkillum will do the\n\"bringing of the direct component closer to your scene\" as I\nsuggested. A couple of other pointers:\n\nYou want to create impostor geometry or define your skylight apertures\nas illum sources. You do this by adding \"illum=\" lines to the .rif\nfile. Let's say you have a skylight defined by a skylight.rad file,\nthat describes the polygons that make up the skylight opening; you\nwould remove that reference from the \"scene=\" line(s) and add an\n\"illum=\" line. You are telling rad to take any polygons defined in the\nillum= files and do a backwards raytrace from those polygons and out\ninto the scene beyond. Generally this is the exterior environment, and\nas such the rays traced stand a much better chance of hitting the sun.\nThe results of this raytrace operation are saved and applied as a data\nfile to the polygons defining the skylight or aperture and that\naperture becomes a light source. I would not worry about an -av value\nfor your mkillum= line, but I would definitely increase the -ab value\nto 2 or 3, and -ad 512.\n\nYou should not do anything to the .rad files from there. rad is great;\nif you tell rad (via the illum= line(s)) which surfaces should be\nprecalculated as light sources, rad will manage the creation of these\nsecondary light sources as they are called and create its own separate\nrad files that substitute the precalculated illums for the\ncalculations and/or renderings. Definitely look at the rad manual page\nfor more info on this...\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<63252a3e0905191909u67cdf21dj6ec4db9981fcdb7a@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Tue May 19 21:09:03 2009"}
