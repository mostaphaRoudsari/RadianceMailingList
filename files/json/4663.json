{"body": "\nHi all.\n\nI'll step in on this:\n\nThe basics are spelled out in the man page of  'replmarks'\n(not 'xform' as Giulio wrote).  He has explained the usage\nhimself in the meantime. Just two things to note:\n\n1) Check the orientation of the lumiaire or box created by ies2rad.\nFor linear luminaires the 'main luminous axis' runs right across,\nnot along the luminare. If you have a fitting for a 35 W fluorescent\ntube (about 1.5m long) it will extend from y=-0.75 to y=0.75 while\nthe x dimension may only be 0.1 m. The replmark marker therefore\nis orthogonal to the luminare body.\n\n2) Photometric files are usually created with the luminaire pointing\ndown, even if the fitting is intended and constructed to light up a\nwall.\nCheck a photometic plot and decide wether you have to turn around\nthe luminaire.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n_____\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Mark\nde la Fuente\nSent: 16 August 2006 14:51\nTo: Radiance\n\nGiulio,\n\nHow would you do this?
