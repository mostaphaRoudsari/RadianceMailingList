{"body": "\n1) triangle must be rectangle, the longer leg is the X axis and with the 90? corner in 0,0,0.\n\n2) add to the triangle a line pointing in the main photometric axis\n\n3) displace and rotate the triangle by the 90? corner, copy freely where you wish and use the line to understand where are they looking at.\n\n4) save the file as a radiance file and note the modifier of the triangles, that ideally is the same for all of them (assuming you are placing 1 type of light)\n\nnow use:\n\n5) replmarks -x the-object-to-copy.rad modifier-name the-file-with-the-triangles > the-file-with-the-light-in-place\n\nthe only variant is to use -i instead of -x but this applies to instances and therefore not good for your task (lights) since instances cannot have light inside.\n\nhope this is a quick hands on,\n\nfor further information man replmarks will help :-)\n\nciao\n\nG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: 16 August 2006 14:51\nTo: Radiance\n\n\nGiulio,\n\n\n\nHow would you do this?
