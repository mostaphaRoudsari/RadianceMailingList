Im havin immense trouble\nrotating them so that they face the same way. i have tried using a range\nof values for rx ry and rz in my xform command and keep gettin odd\nresults. instead of rotating my spot they seem to actually move it.\n\nthis is incredible frustrating! my xform file is below.\n\n# move display into place\n\n!xform -n display -t 2.4 7 2 display2.rad\n\n# move 3 spotlights into rear of room\n\n!xform -n spot1 -t 1.25 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad\n\n!xform -n spot2 -t 2.5 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad\n\n!xform -n spot3 -t 3.75 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad\n\nmy spotlight dimensions\n\nspotc_light ring spotc.d\n0\n0\n8\n0 0 -0.00025\n0 0 -1\n0 0.15\n\ni have tried this for a couple of days now and it is beginnin to get my\ngoat. i want them in the same position as in the translate command, just\npointing in a different direction. the spotlights defualt is aimed\nvertical down and i am trying to get them to aim about 45-60 degrees\nfrom the horizontal as well as all converged to one point (the display).\ncan anyone please help in this matter before i throw my computer out the\nwindow...(probably just throw myself though as the computer can only do\nwhat i tell it!)\n\nthanks in advance.\n\nChris\n\np.s. thanks for ur display help tom\n\n\n\nvoid light display_light\n0\n0\n3 2.23 2.23 2.23\n\nvoid mirror display_surface\n1 display_light\n0\n3 0.8 0.8 0.8\n\n(example for something with 80 % reflectance).\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential and/or\nprivileged material; it is for the intended addressee(s) only.\nIf you are not a named addressee, you must not use, retain or\ndisclose such information.\n\nNPL Management Ltd cannot guarantee that the e-mail or any\nattachments are free from viruses.\n\nNPL Management Ltd.
