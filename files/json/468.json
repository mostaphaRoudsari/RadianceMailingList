For testing and comparing my \"off\" results i had to remove the sunshading device in SCRIBE but it's not an easy way. The results of my invisible materialsimulation are different from the one after i had removed the sunshading device in SCRIBE. The differences are not large.\n\nthanks in advance again\nWaldo\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "WA Bont", "datetime": "Fri, 26 Sep 2003 15:27:40 +0200"}
