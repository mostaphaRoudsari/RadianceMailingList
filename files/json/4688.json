{"body": "\nDear Greg,\nGreetings!\nI have two questions. First, does rpict involve any tonemapping\nprocedure?  In other words, does the .pic file contain the original\ndata without any tonemapping? Second, I rendered the same input files\nwith the same rendering parameters using the \"rad\" comman complied\nfrom the same version of Radiance on a mac and a linux machine. I got\ndifferent .pic files. Not only the images look different ( the\nhighlight on one sphere look brighter), but the .pic values are\ndifferent.  I wonder why this happened. Has anyone experience this?\n\n\nThanks for the advice,\n\nBei\n\n--\nBei\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "bei.xiao@gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<a38244780608081330x138a879fm4613e44c13fa6f9e@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Aug  8 22:30:47 2006", "email": "bei.xiao at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] .pic file and tonemap"}
