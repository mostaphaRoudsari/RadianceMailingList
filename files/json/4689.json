Reversing the normals was very easy,\nI use Ecotect as the CAD interface to radiance and it was just a case of\nselecting the object and hitting 'cntrl R'.\n\nI'll be running the simulation over the weekend with the new glow surfaces\nin replacement of the lights to see how much quicker it is.\n\nAs for you suggestions about ab, dj and ds parameters, I'll give them a try\nseparately once I have the glow sorted.\n\nThanks again,\n\nRegards,\n\nPaul.\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, May 28, 2009 at 11:50 PM, Jack de Valpine <jedev@visarc.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nPaul Chilton\n\nRenewable Energy Engineer\n\n[m] 0400 306 791 | [e] p.chilton@gmail.com\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090529/bf88aeec/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4A1E9688.4060409@visarc.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Paul Chilton", "datetime": "Thu May 28 23:35:02 2009"}
