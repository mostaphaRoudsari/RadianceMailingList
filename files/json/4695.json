{"body": "\nChris.\n\nYou need to get the terminology right:\n\nThe \"lamp\" you're describing is a \"luminaire\": the lamp\nis the small glass bulb that's inside it. (Yes, we do this\non purpose to confuse people ;)\n\nThe lamp for your luminaire is indicated as\n\nHMI 4000 W/SE G38\n\nand is described here:\n\nhttp://www.osram.com.ro/pdf/service_corner/technicalinfo/4000WSE_E.pdf\n\nand gives you a modes 380000 lumens.\n\nI suppose that's why the luminaires are called 'daylight'\n\nThomas\n\n\n_____\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Chris\nFoster\nSent: 03 August 2006 15:29\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHi Dave\n\nyeah i know what type of lamp, it was in the last email i wrote to\nchristian, its a 4000w fresnal lens spotlight from Arri. how do the mean\nand initial lumens value help me? do i use one of them in the 'lumens\nper lamp' value for the ies file\n\nthanks chris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nMaino\nSent: Thu 8/3/2006 2:09 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nIf you know what kind of lamp you want to use, you can go to philips or\nge's website and find the\nlamp there. They should have the mean and initial lumens listed that you\ncan then put into your IES\nfile. For the ballast factor, you can use 1, or you can go to a site\nlike advancetransformer.com and\nfind a ballast that will work with whatever lamp you've chosen and use\nthat ballast factor (although\ngenerally you can find a ballast for your lamp that has whatever ballast\nfactor you want, so you\ncould probably just set this at whatever you want it to be).\n\nDave\n\nChris Foster wrote:\ndata\nhowever\nbrackets\nsimply\n60000 0\nim\nnot\nspotlight??\ngive\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential and/or\nprivileged material; it is for the intended addressee(s) only.\nIf you are not a named addressee, you must not use, retain or\ndisclose such information.\n\nNPL Management Ltd cannot guarantee that the e-mail or any\nattachments are free from viruses.\n\nNPL Management Ltd.
