They should have the mean and initial lumens listed that you can then put into your IES\nfile. For the ballast factor, you can use 1, or you can go to a site like advancetransformer.com and\nfind a ballast that will work with whatever lamp you've chosen and use that ballast factor (although\ngenerally you can find a ballast for your lamp that has whatever ballast factor you want, so you\ncould probably just set this at whatever you want it to be).\n\nDave\n\nChris Foster wrote:\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential and/or\nprivileged material; it is for the intended addressee(s) only.\nIf you are not a named addressee, you must not use, retain or\ndisclose such information.\n\nNPL Management Ltd cannot guarantee that the e-mail or any\nattachments are free from viruses.\n\nNPL Management Ltd.
