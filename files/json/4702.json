Ecotect has a button that creates the batch process in a semi automated way, but you can not input the -B and -R parameters. I'll be happy to do it with command line scripting but I am not sure from where to start (the only thing I've managed to do so far in the command line was to use pcomb... not much I guess...).\nCan you give me some help on that?\n\nThanks a lot for your time,\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 05 June 2009 12:22\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Giovanni.\n\nI'm not quite clear if you want to use the Radiance tools from the command line or if you expect that there is a 'use these values' button in EcoTect.\n\nIn the fist case you have to find the file that contains the sky description in the scene that's exported by EcoTect. -B and -R are options to the gensky command that should be on one the lines in this file.\n\nFor a batch calculation of different values you have to loop over\n\n1) modify the gensky command\n2) recreate the scene octree\n3) do the calculation again\n4) move the images (or rtrace results) to a different place\n\nThis is possible with a bit of command line scripting.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 4, 2009 at 6:07 PM, Giovanni Betti<gbetti@fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Fri Jun  5 05:16:36 2009"}
