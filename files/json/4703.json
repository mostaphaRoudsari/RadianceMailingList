It might even have an extension like '*.sky'.\n\nIf Ecotect allows you export a batch rendering for different times of\nday or similar you\ncould do that and see how it is realised in the export. We could use\nthose files and\njust modify them to include changing '-B' and '-R' params.\n\nI'll be a bit busy this afternoon. So it might take me a bit to reply.\n\nThomas\n\nOn Fri, Jun 5, 2009 at 1:16 PM, Giovanni\nBetti<gbetti@fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3017F65AA@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Fri Jun  5 05:36:14 2009"}
