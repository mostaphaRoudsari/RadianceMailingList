I guess I could go into the command line with those information and run everything from there, although I've never tried it...\n\nWhen I create a series of batch images, I need to provide ecotect with a *.brf (txt) file with the following information\nOutput name\t\tMonth \tDay\tTime\tSky\tLat.\t Long.  TimeZone\tOrientation\n\nWhich looks like this:\n\nrow: ty3_001, 4, 1, 10.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000   55.9\nrow: ty3_002, 4, 1, 11.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\nrow: ty3_003, 4, 1, 12.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\nrow: ty3_004, 4, 1, 13.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\nrow: ty3_005, 4, 1, 14.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\n\nWhat gets output is a batch file (*.bat) which automatically runs the command prompt and generates the different images and a *.rad file that overrides my previous sky definition and changes at every subsequent run.\n\nI hope this answers your questions,\n\nThanks again,\nCheers,\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 05 June 2009 13:36\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nSure.\n\nA few things I need to know first:\n\nDo you use Radiance on Windows or Linux?\nDo you change anything else in the scene (like blinds) or just the sky?\nCan you locate the exported scene and find the file with '!gensky ...'\nin it? It might even have an extension like '*.sky'.\n\nIf Ecotect allows you export a batch rendering for different times of day or similar you could do that and see how it is realised in the export. We could use those files and just modify them to include changing '-B' and '-R' params.\n\nI'll be a bit busy this afternoon. So it might take me a bit to reply.\n\nThomas\n\nOn Fri, Jun 5, 2009 at 1:16 PM, Giovanni Betti<gbetti@fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Fri Jun  5 09:19:49 2009"}
