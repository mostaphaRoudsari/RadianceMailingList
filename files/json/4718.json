See 6.4, Case Study II in RwR dealing with daylight factor\ngeneration. If you need images you could use pvalue to create an image\nfrom the grid of results and process it through falsecolor to put a\nscale on it.\n\n-Chris\n\n________________________________\n\nIn terms of post processing I would\n\n\n*\tconvert each pic to daylight factors\n\n*\tQuery the PIC by tracing an \"Area of Interest\". This is used to\nwork out DF min, max, ave, uniformity, etc. With this I can exclude\noverlapping spaces and other features such as notional corridors from\nthe working plane calcs.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090618/4ea695e2/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight factors", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Thu Jun 18 07:27:51 2009"}
