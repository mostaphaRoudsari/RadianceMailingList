{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI would like to translate a grid with dimensions m X n consisting of equally spaced cartesian coordinates in x and y, but varying heights in z, into a 3D acad file or 3D acad readable format. The file format is as follows:\n\nx1 y1 z\nx1 y2 z\nx1 y3 z\n...\nx1 yn z\nx2 y1 z\nx2 y2 z\nx2 y3 z\n...\nx2 yn z\n...\nxm y1 z\nxm y2 z\nxm y3 z\n..\nxm yn z\n\nwhere z is a variable with different real positve values indicating variable different heights. This set could come from a radiance mesh primitive, but this is not important here. It is just topography, such as the geometry of a landscape. How would you approach this problem? Intermediate steps using the obj or other formats might possibly help.\n\nThanks\n\nMartin\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 2913 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060904/236ba75e/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Martin Moeck", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A1751205CFFEB548B3E78F10333DCF8805F304@ENGRMAIL1.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Sep  4 19:52:26 2006", "email": "MMoeck at engr.psu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Translating a grid into an acad fileReferences: <54C9B07B-0C81-4BEA-9D1F-EE1A42F4EA76@dmu.ac.uk>"}
