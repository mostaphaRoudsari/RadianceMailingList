{"body": "\nMartin,\n\nYou must first select a small region of the \"orig\" image - then the pano orig option will be available.  Select \"pano orig\" then go to the next image in your sequence snd find that point.  Select it and choose \"pano dest\" to complete the pairing.  Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nKirk\nSent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile\n\n-----Original Message-----\nTo:Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nHello,\n\nI can't find pano orig under the apply button. It only lists crop,\nspotmeter. Sometimes it lists two more options (redeye, calibration),\nbut none of them is pano orig. I am using the latest Photosphere 1.6U.\nCan somebody outline the steps, please? I have a series of HDR images in\nthe catalog and would like to turn them into one panorama image. The\nimages have common features/an overlap.\n\nRegards,\n\nMartin\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: HDR question pano orig howto", "sender": "MMoeck@engr.psu.edu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1840012104-1157401947-cardhu_blackberry.rim.net-879859669-@bxe026-cell01.bisx.prod.on.blackberry>", "refs": ["<A1751205CFFEB548B3E78F10333DCF8805F305@ENGRMAIL1.engr.psu.edu>"], "datetime": "Mon, 4 Sep 2006 16:02:15", "email": "Martin Moeck", "subject": "HDR question pano orig howto"}
