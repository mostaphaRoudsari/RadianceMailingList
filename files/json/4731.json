'vinfo' is a true and proper Greg-style csh script\nthat strips the binary part from the image and shows you only the header\nin the editor - which is vi.

In 'vim' this shows a greeting message\nwhich you probably saw.\n\nIn fact if you have 'vim' I think you can edit the image headers directly,\nwithout splitting the binary bits. I think I did that before.\n\n\nUnfortunately I haven't actually done a script yet (just manual testing) but\nwhat I will need to do is adding view lines to Sketchup images. I found that\nin Ruby or Python you can just use something like\n\nview = \"VIEW= -vta -vp 3.5 4.5 1.5 ...\"\nimg = file(\"mypic.hdr\").read()\nimg.sub(\"\\n\\n\", \"%s\\n\\n\" % view)\nnewfile = file(\"newpic.hdr\", 'w').write(img)\nnewfile.close()\n\nBasically you just replace the two newline characters at the end of\nthe header with a \"VIEW=\" line followed by 2 newlines. (I hope this\nis proper Python code - haven't used it in a while).\n\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Adding view information to hdr files", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon Jun 29 00:35:21 2009"}
