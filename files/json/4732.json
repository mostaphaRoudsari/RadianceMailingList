Select an arbitrary zenith radiance, Z (eg. 100 W/m2/sr).\"\n\nWhat is the meaning of arbitrary here? The value is used later by the\ncal-file creating the distribution. I was hoping to create a\ndistribution from the coefficients and the horizontal illuminance, but I\ndo not know where to get data on zenith luminance.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: lars_grobe.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 299 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090701/61e5733c/lars_grobe.vcf\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
