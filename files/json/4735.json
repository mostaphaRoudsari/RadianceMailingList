{"body": "\nGiven a well formated data file such as Martin originally posted, one\ncould write an autolisp routine to read in the data file and do\nsomething with it in Autocad. This could be simple such as calling the\n\"3dmesh\" command and feeding it points as part of a script. The lisp\nroutine could ask for the MxN resolution of the mesh and feed this to\n3dmesh (or these could be written in as the first lines to the data\nfile). Then the data file could be opened and successive calls to get\ncoordinates to pass to the running 3dmesh command. Alternatively, with a\nlittle poking about you could determine the underlying format for the\nmesh data structure in Autocad and just build it directly...\n\n-Jack\n\nRandolph Fritz wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Translating a grid into an acad file", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<44FDB932.3050303@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<FCCB55B3313F2341AB3C91810FE1166B013E51BD@ln-s3xch1.bdp.holdings.network>", "<44FD7F11.1080705@panix.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Sep  5 19:52:18 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Translating a grid into an acad file"}
