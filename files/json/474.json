You have\nover 114,000 uniquely named colorpict primitives in your input files.\nIf you had named them all the same, this error would not have occured.\nThere was a place in my hash table function where I was overflowing a\nsigned integer on the secondary hashing scheme.  This was quite easy to\nfix, and now oconv runs and produces a 63 Mbyte octree on your files\nwith no trouble.  I have included the fix on the HEAD distribution if\nyou wish to download it (src/common/modobject.c).\n\nThanks for discovering this bug!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: OCONV Error", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 29 Sep 2003 17:21:01 -0700"}
