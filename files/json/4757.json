Then the rtrace rays would hit the back\nof the obstruction and not the ideal reflector.\n\nBut then, perhaps Greg has anticipated this case and added some magic to\navoid it ...\n\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 16, 2009 at 5:17 PM, PAUPELIN-HUCHARD\nValere<v.paupelin-huchard@elioth.fr> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Thu Jul 16 09:46:05 2009"}
