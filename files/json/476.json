Will we be doing that again this year?  I\nvote yes; Peter, is there room/bandwidth available on\nradiance-online.org?  Reason I ask is that I'm writing a little report\non the Workshop for my friend's computer graphics website, and I'd like\nto mention whether this is available (as I did last year).  I recall\neveryone voted on it last year, at the workshop.  Maybe we could reach\nan e-consensus here?  Let me know.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Tue, 30 Sep 2003 21:56:02 -0400"}
