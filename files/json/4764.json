No actual\nintersection calculation is done, so no worries about intervening\nrays.  This is something I should fix, but since you give the origin\non input, it hasn't come up very often where people want the same\norigin on output.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jul 16 19:45:03 2009"}
