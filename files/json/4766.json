I'm a bit afraid to\nchange it, though, because there might be someplace in the code where\nzero ray lengths are problematic, and the initial \"false primary\" ray\nis needed for consistency for rtrace's reporting routines.  I suppose\nI can try it and see if anything bad happens.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean, though, about the -I option changing the\neffect of -ab.  I suppose it depends on how you think about it.  With\n-ab set to 0, only direct illumination arriving at that position is\nconsidered.  Setting -ab 1 sends out sample rays over the hemisphere\nto gather indirect contributions.  Is this other than what you would\nexpect?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jul 16 23:02:01 2009"}
