{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nWow, 2 weeks. That seems pretty extreme. What is your scene? Are you\nrunning on your OpenMosix cluster?\n\nBelow are some answers and thoughts....\n\n-Jack\n\nLars O. Grobe wrote:\nYes, you can do this but NOT for all ambient parameters.  You should be\nable to make some adjustments to  aa, ad and as, for example:\n\noverture calc: -aa .15 -ad 1024 -as 512\nimage:            -aa .25 -ad 512 -as 256\n\nwhere ad and as are getting halved and aa increased by some amount.\n\nHow many ambient bounces are you using? I think for an interior scene\nwith illums at the window openings you should be able to set -ab 1....\nIt may be worth it (at 2 weeks running time) to do some pretty serious\nexperiments with ambient parameters. You might also want to consider if\nthere is geometry that could be excluded from the ambient calculation\n(-ae or -aE), some examples might be very small geometry and/or geometry\nthat has very dark materials applied. Lastly, if you have not even got\nyour artifical lights on then you might want to consider if some of\nthese could be managed with a glow material with a radius of influence\ninstead of illum/light. Also worth considering is whether there are any\noptimizations that you might be able to do to the scene geometry...\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient resolution and memory", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4508428A.2000203@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<4506A61F.4000305@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Sep 13 19:40:58 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient resolution and memory"}
