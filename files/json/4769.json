Using -i, a ray is sent\nthat hits the ground then looks skyward, where it sees the sun\nagain.  The sun doesn't need -ab 1 to contribute.\n\nDoes this make sense, yet?\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Jul 17 08:37:48 2009"}
