Light sources not in the water", "email": "sotos.enveng at gmail.com", "body": "Message-ID: <4a6668a5.1c07d00a.09e3.2718@mx.google.com>\n\nDear list,\n\nHello my name is Sotiris Papantoniou MSc student of Welsh school of\narchitecture doing my dissertation in the field of lighting. I am trying to\nidentify if Radiance can simulate correctly the light ray movement within\nthe water. An actual swimming pool will be simulated and the data from\nradiance will be compared to real time underwater light measurements. The\noverall purpose is to identify if possible glare problems can be found with\nthe use of radiance before the actual construction of the swimming pool.\n\n\nReading all the previous mails about water I have found that dielectric\nmaterial is the most appropriate to use.\n\nApart from that mist pseudo-material has been suggested as well. Since my\nlight sources are not in the water but 3 or more meters above it, would you\nsuggest to create 2 mist volumes as it is described in RwR or avoid using\nmist?\n\n\nAny other suggestions are accepted since I am actually lost within all these\ninformation\n\nThank you for your time\n\nSotiris Papantoniou\nMSc Environmental Engineering\nCardiff\nMob: +44(0)7724711345\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Sotiris Papantoniou", "datetime": "Tue Jul 21 18:19:37 2009"}
