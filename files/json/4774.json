The last line of the\nview file is considered to be the view spec.  Considering a view file to\nbe a collection of multiple views is counter productive.\n\nIt seems to me that there are a few ways to do what you want:\n\n1. create multiple rif files with each one representing a \"view\ngroup\" and containing multiple \"view=\" lines, note this is really\none of the things that rif file is for, that is to create coherent\ngroupings of views with respect to a set of\ngeometry/materials/lighting as defined in an octree....\n2. enhance your script to include a separate \"view group\" file, the\nscript can parse the view group file and pass the relevant views\nto the rif file, in essence building a rif file on the fly....\n3. ranimate, as Thomas suggests, you could probably do something with\nthe ANIMATE parameter for ranimate pointing to a script to produce\nthe correctly modified octree and use a VIEWFILE with all your\nviews in it.\n\n-Jack\n\nThomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090722/41eeb274/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<89355c0f0907220502m19f12a2p3ed66f8b867980f6@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed Jul 22 06:27:19 2009"}
