I know\nthat there are work-arounds, but I cannot imagine any case where one\nwould need the current behaviour of rad to render only the first view of\na viewfile, as in that case one would not have added other views to the\nsame file (or had commented them out.\n\nJack wrote:\n\nRegarding the idea, that there should always be only one view per view\nfile, this is a contradiction to the behaviour of core radiance tools.\nrvu e.g. appends views to an existing view file, and I can cat a view\nfile with hundreds of views into rpict, which will happily render one by\none. I cannot use these view-files only in rad, as (only) this tool\nreads only the last line of a view file.\n\nAt the moment I am using a \"<myview.vf\" at the end of the render= line\nin my rif file. This is a work-around, but not a nice one, as it\ndisables filtering and naming.\n\nBTW, we should also change the default extension for filtered frames to\nhdr in rad, now that there is a mime-type registred.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090722/58ed6996/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<89355c0f0907220502m19f12a2p3ed66f8b867980f6@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
