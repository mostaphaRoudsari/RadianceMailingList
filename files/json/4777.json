Rpict reads a view file and\ntakes the last line of the file and uses that as the view parameters to\nrender. Rad is designed to pass named view parameters or view files to\nrpict, if you want rad to do multiple views you can input multiple\n\"view=\" lines in the rif file. By using \"cat\" you are using a unix tool\n(outside the Radiance toolbox) to output each line of the file to\nstdout, this is different than what rad does, and creates a different\nexpectation for what a viewfile contains, eg mapping of one view file to\none camera location vs mapping of one view file to many camera\nlocations.... Effectively a rif file serves as a way to group multiple\nviews to a particular octree definition, thus resulting in a mapping of\none file (a rif file) to many views by means of the rad tool.\n\nIf you have only three groupings of views why not just create three\nseparate rif files?\n\n-Jack\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090722/a3ddcc17/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4A671593.7070905@gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed Jul 22 07:05:43 2009"}
