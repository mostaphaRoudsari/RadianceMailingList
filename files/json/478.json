I model everything\nwith AutoDesk Revit, and then export to AutoCAD &\nuse RADOUT to generate my Radiance files.\n\n(Once Revit gets better export control for 3D or\nan API I'll just export from Revit directly).\n\nI use AutoCAD to 'clean-up' my model and set things\non more specific layers, which in turn translate those\nitems into separately named .rad files.\n\n\nI too get this error sometimes, but not with the windows\n(because my windows are rectangles), I get it with the\nlight fixtures, because the luminescent bit of the light\nfixture isn't a radiance object, but rather a bunch of\ntriangles or polygons exported from CAD, which cause\nproblems as light sources. (it makes since why when\nyou read the documentation on it).\n\nWhat I've found to be the best way around this is to\nmake the luminescent part of the light fixtures into\na 'place holder' object, that I then go in and replace\nwith a radiance object within the .rad files.\n\nFor example, I might have a bulb within a light fixture.\nWithin CAD, I'll just have a point or a single triangle\nmarking the location of that point in space. Then, once\nthe model is exported to .rad files, I go in, and replace\nthose 'placeholders' with Radiance spheres, and then I\ndon't have any problems with aiming failures when that\npart of the light fixture is made into a light source\nfor my render.\n\nBut I'm just using Radiance for rendering, not for\nlight analysis, so I would think that this isn't a\nterribly accurate approach if you're trying to\nmodel a fixture for testing.\n\nJeffrey\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "datetime": "Wed, 1 Oct 2003 09:36:24 -0700"}
