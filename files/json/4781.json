That's a tidy way of doing it but I still need to figure where my original expression is wrong as I also need to run some further expressions to the file if the result is true.  Looking a bit more closely at the result it appears the expression creates a tab and extra line to the value...I wonder if this is why the script thinks the expression is not an integer?!\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 22 July 2009 18:47\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Dan,\n\nit is easier then that. You can use the special variable cond in rcalc to decide whether any output is to be generated or not.\n\npextrem -o 9.pic | rcalc -e 'illummax=($3*0.265+$4*0.670+$5*0.065)*179'\n-e 'cond=if(illummax-15000,1,-1)' -e '$1=illummax' | total -u > 9.dat\n\ndoes the job (ok, you will get an empty file 9.dat if the illuminance value is below 15000).\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Bash problems", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Wed Jul 22 11:01:01 2009"}
