{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\n\nYes, John plans to assemble people's talks into a CD to share at\nradiance-online.  I'm sure he'll announce it when it's available.\n\n\nThis should work fine.  You should set your glow radius to the\ndiameter of your illum sphere -- assuming you are using a sphere to\nenclose them.  Radiance will ignore all glows inside an illum, as\nthis is a recommended optimization for light sources.\n\n\nYou should.  I coded the shadow cache to look for just such \"hidden\"\noccluders.\n\n\nApologies to Carsten for my careless remark.  Of course, it is\npossible to do this correctly so that it is physical.  Likewise,\nthere are many non-physical things you can do in Radiance \"classic\"\nand care is required always if you are using any simulation as a\npredictive tool.  As Carsten pointed out in his e-mail, this only\nsaves substantial time when the texture/pattern evaluation is\nexpensive, as it is for complicated procedural descriptions.\n\nRegarding Radzilla, I'll reiterate my previous position that I am\ndelighted about this branch, and I see it as a great service to our\nlittle corner of the Open Source world.  It takes the burden off me\nwhen people ask for \"artistic\" additions to Radiance, which have a\nmuch better place now in Radzilla.  Thanks, Carsten!\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient resolution and memory", "sender": "Gregory J.
