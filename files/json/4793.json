It seems to have crashed in a sprintf()\nstatement, which means it could have bombed while trying to print an\nerror message.  You should recompile with the -g option and crash it\nagain.\n\nJust as a guess, you wouldn't happen to have any strings longer than\n127 characters in your material descriptions, would you?\n\nThis probably belongs on the dev list, so I'll cross-post and we can\nfollow up there.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4A6B2B38.3080007@gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Jul 25 09:07:59 2009"}
