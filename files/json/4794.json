I did not try this command in advance, and made\nsubsequent modifications to rtcontrib that make the calls to \"total\"\nsuperfluous.  If you look at my Nov 17, 2007 post on the same thread,\nyou'll see a different version of the rtcontrib command that uses the\nnew -c option in lieu of calling \"total.\"  Use this method instead.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] water any news ???", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Jul 25 16:03:03 2009"}
