{"body": "\nHi Xian,\n\nOK, well 20M from 50K probably means something is not quite right. I am\npretty sure that you are not going to be able to translate Radiance\nmodifiers such as \"texfunc\" to vrml. I expect you will only be able to\ntranslate basic materials such as plastic, metal or glass. Probably the\nfirst the to do is define some simple geometry with a basic material\napplied and see if you can get that to work. If this works then for your\ngeometry you probably need to define an alternate set of materials using\njust the base material types.\n\n-Jack\n\nYun-Xian Ho wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rad to wrl", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4511CCE4.6000503@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<d4f6bfc45ad4.451159aa@mail.nyu.edu> <45114FF3.9040701@visarc.com>", "<4511B21F.4060401@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Sep 21 01:21:47 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: rad to wrl"}
