{"body": "\nHi,\n\na note, vrml1 is tricky today. Also, there might be an alternative. If\nyou manage to get Renderpark to run, it can load mgf and write\nprecalculated (radiosity) vrml. Modifying mgf2inv to write vrml2 or x3d\nwould also be great.\n\nYou can use grep to filter out all lines starting with #. That will\nreduce files size and should give working scenes.\n\nLars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rad to wrl", "sender": "Lars O.
