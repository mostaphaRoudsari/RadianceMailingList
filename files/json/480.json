As I mentioned, rad\nis pretty good at getting the image exposed & scaled properly.  I\nusually just run my images through pcond -h after that, and end up with\na satisfactory image.  But as with most aspects of Radiance, there is\nfantastic option complexity, if desired.\n\n\n*Still learning, statements could be rubbish!\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sequence for using pfilt and pcond", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Wed, 01 Oct 2003 15:29:28 -0400"}
