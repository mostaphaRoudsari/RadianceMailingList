I think radiance\nexpects ?c to be followed by an argument, which it is taking to be ?n in the\nfirst case and ?f in the second case.  The following argument (2 or\npool_coords.cal) is then interpreted as an option that doesn?t exist.\n\nTry putting a ?1? after ?c :\n...| rtcontrib -w -ffc -c 1 \\\n??? ??? ??? -f pool_coords.cal -o %s_caustics.pic \\ ...\n\nAnd see what you get.\n\n\n-Andy\n\n\n\n\nOn 8/3/09 7:27 AM, \"??????? ???????????\" <sotos.enveng@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090803/dd7c313f/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] water any news ???", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Mon Aug  3 08:39:56 2009"}
