{"body": "\nHi Jelle,\n\nThe -a option is supported by xform, only.  When it is applied, xform\nreplaces a single file with many copies, each using the -i option to\nindicate how many times to apply each transform.  In short, you need\nto create a file with a single instance in it and call it using !\nxform with the -a option to get multiple copies.\n\nBe sure to pay attention to the tips in the reference manual <http://\nradsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Surfaces> about when and how\nto use instances.  In particular, instances work best with cubicle\nvolumes (ideal) or at least square-ish pieces to avoid too many\noverlapping instance boundaries, which are always cubes.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] instance primitive & xform", "sender": "Gregory J.
