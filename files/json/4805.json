{"body": "\nHi Jelle and Giulio,\n\nI may be about to learn something here, but as far as I understand I do\nnot think you can do this the way you are trying to. I know for certain\nwhat will work is the following:\n\nstep 1: define your instance such as inst.rad\n\nvoid instance test\n1 some-instance.oct\n0\n0\n\nstep 2: to deploy your instance in an array use a call to xform perhaps\nin its own file (or in some scene description) such as array.rad\n\n!xform -a 10 -t 10 0 0 inst.rad\n\nthis will make an array in X of inst.rad repeated 10 time at unit\nintervals of 10.\n\n-Jack\n\nJelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060925/e408c34c/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] instance primitive & xform", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<45183EA4.7080508@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<005c01c6e0db$a09e0cd0$c000a8c0@JELLE>"], "datetime": "Mon Sep 25 22:40:37 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] instance primitive & xform"}
