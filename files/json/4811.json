{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm struggling a little with setting my ambient parameters.\n\nThing is that my scene is far larger (~10000m) than my area of interest\n(~90m), which is an interior scene.\n\nIf I follow the logic of 'setting radiance ambient parameters' part of Lash'\nthesis, setting -ar should follow this formula:\n\n\n\nminimum_distance_between_samples = (aa/max_scene_dimension) / ar\n\n\n\nWhich in my scene would lead to a -ar setting of ~5000. Which seems absurd\nto me.\n\nSo what would be the appropriate thing to do here?\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\n-jelle\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060928/44a28084/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<00c101c6e323$95ac37d0$c000a8c0@JELLE>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Sep 28 19:24:54 2006", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient setting for very large scenes"}
