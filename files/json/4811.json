Now I am wondering whether this\ncombination hides some risks.\n\nFirst, when I add a gensky-sun to the ssld-sky, in my understanding this\nshould not change the horizontal illuminance but be kind of a technical\noptimization, replacing the bright glow spot where the sun is seen by a\nsource of type light, thus making sure that shadow-test actually hit it.\nThis would require the flux of the sky (glow) part to be covered to be\nthe same as the flux of the sun light source.\n\nSecond, gensky manipulates the sun position when coming close to the\nzenith and sets it to 87.5 altitude. I am in a tropical country, where\nthis 90 degrees can be reached. In such a case, I would have two suns in\nmy sky definition - the one in the ssld glow source (at 90 degree) PLUS\nthe gensky light source at 87.5 degree, right?\n\nI am just trying to debug my sky setups, so any comments are appreciated :-D\n\nCheers Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
