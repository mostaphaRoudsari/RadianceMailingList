I generally know the exposure\ncorrection for my scene by the time I reach the filtering stage, so I\njust set it explicitly with the -1 and -e options.  This is what rad\ndoes as well when you specify an EXPOSURE= value (as you should).\n\nIn either case, the exposure that's set by pfilt is completely\nreversible and doesn't affect the time taken or output produced by\npcond.  As a side note, using pcond without the -h option is pretty\nmuch the same as displaying the image with ximage -e auto.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Sequence for using pfilt and pcond", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 1 Oct 2003 14:02:26 -0700"}
