The job is mostly on measurements and data modeling,\nbut you can get the details from the description, and as it is written\nthere, radiance plays some role. Ah, and it is in always-summer-land\nSingapore ;-)\n\nCheers Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Tue Sep  8 03:36:55 2009"}
