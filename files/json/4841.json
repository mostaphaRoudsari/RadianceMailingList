Grobe\nSent: 08 September 2009 19:03\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi!\nIt would be nice if you could share the scene as well as the resulting\nimage by e.g. uploading it to a web oder ftp server. Please not by\nposting any attachments.. If you have a bright ring in the result - do\nyou have a bright ring in your source image, e.g. at the edge of the\nimage circle? How did you prepare the image, do you crop it? Does the\ncal-file expect a 180 fov. and does your image provide that?\n\nUnder 2) you write that the image is less bright then the original, but\nat the centre you have only an error of 1% - do you have a constant\nerror of 1%?\n\nAre you sure that the fisheye projection assumed by the script assumes\nyour camera/lens projection?\n\nDoes the source image include direct sun (visible)?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: test00_sky.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 279 bytes\nDesc: test00_sky.rad\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090908/ff6b8814/test00_sky.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: test00.rif\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 494 bytes\nDesc: test00.rif\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090908/ff6b8814/test00.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: test00.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 109 bytes\nDesc: test00.rad\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090908/ff6b8814/test00-0001.obj\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Tue Sep  8 11:17:51 2009"}
