Grobe\nSent: 09 September 2009 02:44\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Giovanni,\n\nI have used fisheye.cal, which comes with radiance. I also used the\nangular fisheye with the vta-view, as you did. The only important point\nwas to translate the mapping, as fisheye.cal expected the image center\nto be +y (north in most models), while for sky capturing you point up.\n\nThe mapping for me is\n\nvoid colorpict skyhdrmapping\n11 red green blue sky.hdr fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx -90 -rz 180\n0\n0\n\nAnd sky.hdr has the north on the top when seen as a 2d image.\n\nI am not sure whether Peter's cal-file does any more advanced stuff\nrelated to his fisheye - it could be that he is correcting for some\nvignetting stuff that does not exist in you synthetic image. That would\nexplain the higher pixel values close to the edge.\n\nCheers,\n\nLars.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Sep  9 03:04:22 2009"}
