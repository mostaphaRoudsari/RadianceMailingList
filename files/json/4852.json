{"body": "\nHi Lars, Greg, and Carsten,\n\nFirst off. Carsten, it is always great to get you input and thoughts on\nRadiance related topics! So please please let us know your thoughts any\ntime.\n\nOn the thread at hand. I just wanted to pass along to Lars. That after\nGreg's comments regarding the source occluder caching and\ninstancing/meshes, I decided that I needed to do an experiment. Like\nyou, we make heavy use of instancing to manage assembly of complex\nscenes from component parts. This is so much so that whole buildings\nwill end up being an instance (even if though there is only one). From\nthe standpoint of scene management this has been quite helpful. However\nafter Greg's comments, I went back and recompiled a current scene making\nit \"flat\" (eg, no instances). All, I can say is WOW! The computation\ntime was reduced significantly! So, now I am looking at the best way to\nadd an option to produce flat scenes and make more sparing use of\ninstancing in our scene management tool.\n\n-Jack\n\nLars O.
