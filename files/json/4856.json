Unfortunately,\nthere are stars everywhere, so I'd need illums to cover pretty\nmuch the whole hemisphere. Since that'll wind up being 50-200 of\nthem, it will cost a lot in render-time, and add some complexity\nto the preprocessing. This is disappointing because a single glow\nsource would have sufficed, and accomplished almost the same\nthing.\n\nDo \"illum\" surfaces respond to \"rpict -ds\" ? I'll want smooth\npenumbras. If so, I can get by with fewer illums.\n\nMark\n\nOn Mon, 14 Sep 2009, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Multiple spherical glow sources?", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Mon Sep 14 16:12:59 2009"}
