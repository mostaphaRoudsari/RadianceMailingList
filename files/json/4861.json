{"body": "\n\nI had been looking at it because I wanted a format for my models that\n\n- can be exported from CAD\n- preserves CAD geometry, e.g. no meshing\n- can be imported into radiance and other formats using scripts\n- is independent from any company / product\n\nThat way, I can directly access my CAD models from the scripts that set\nup the rendering, and do not have to export at all. Of course, if there\nis no iges-interface as in native AutoCAD, this has to be purchased.\n\nI still use obj in the chain (scripts). If you have a defined workflow\nand are only editing in Autodesk software, then buying an obj-exporter\nmay still be fine of course.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?", "sender": "Lars O.
