Ko\nPhD, LEED AP\nResearch Associate\nCollege of Architecture\nIllinois Institute of Technology\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIIT ECOTECT Seminar\n\n(AUTODESK? ECOTECT  ANALYSIS 2010)\n\nOctober 12-13, 2009 (One and half day seminar)\n\nDay 1: Monday, October 12, 8:30am ? 4:30pm\nMorning:           Introduction of ECOTECT & 3D modeling (import file)\nAfternoon:        Weather Tool, Solar Tool & Shadow, Sun path, and Shading Analysis\n- Solar Access Analysis, Daylight level, Shading,\nSolar radiation\nDay 2: Tuesday, October 13, 8:30am ? Noon\nMorning:           Evaluation of various building performances using ECOTECT\n(Building Analysis, Lighting, RADIANCE & Green Building Studio)\n\n\nIn this seminar, you will learn\n\n? How to use ECOTECT programs that will help you make better design decisions\n? The purpose and benefits of ECOTECT modeling\n? How to interpret and report their results\n? When to use ECOTECT for improving green & sustainable design\n? To understand the techniques and design principles for low energy buildings\nand the review of energy-efficient design strategies\n? To understand the interdependence of design, location, weather, and scientific\nfactors in developing energy-efficient buildings\n? To acquire the simulation skills to research weather and contexts in the\nschematic design process and run simulation programs to analyze building energy\nperformance\n\n\nPROGRAM\n\nDay 1: Monday, October 12\n\nLecture-1 (08:30-09:00): Registration and Opening Remarks\nLecture-2 (09:00-09:30): Introduction ?
