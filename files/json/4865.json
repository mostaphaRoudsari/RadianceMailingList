To simplify\nprocessing your star map through mksource (if this is the way you go),\nit might make sense to downsample (significantly) the super large hdr\nimage and then sample it back up to some manageable size. This should\nsmear out the values. Feeding this to mksource might then be easier.\n\n-Jack\n\nAndrew McNeil wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090921/0eaf18a7/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Multiple spherical glow sources?", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon Sep 21 06:16:20 2009"}
