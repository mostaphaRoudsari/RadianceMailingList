{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nThere are a few ways to get obj from cad. I presume that you are\nprobably using Autocad.\n\n1. use an intermediate package such as polytrans from www.okino.com -\nwe have used this and it works fine for surface models, though the\nworkflow is different\n2. consider a obj exporter such as from www.fpsols.com - I have only\nlooked into this a bit. I am not sure how the export organizes\ndata, that is are objects determined based on layer/color\norganization or what.\n\nThe two radiance obj converter (obj2rad and obj2mesh) seem to work just\nfine. So once you have an obj format file then I guess this should be\nok. Obviously one issue centers around correct normal orientation. This\nis probably where a full bore translation package such as polytrans can\nhelp out by providing capability to manage the geometry.\n\nI guess I had not thought about Torad for quite some time. How are you\nfinding the speed of the export process with Torad? I guess the nice\nthings about this, is that there is probably a group of users who might\nbe able to support this since we can actually see the source code.\n\nNevertheless, I would also like to find a good way to deal with ACIS\nbased solids.\n\n-Jack\n\nMark de la Fuente wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20060914/5fc1132a/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<450963E3.90703@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<450919CD.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Sep 14 16:15:30 2006", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Acad2004 Exporters?"}
