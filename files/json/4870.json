I should have had a bit more of a look before my\nresponce. As I previously said, I've never used the BRTDfunc material\ntype so I'm afraid I'm not any help with the use of the funcfile??\n\nAnyone else?\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nEdilberto Calixihan\nSent: 05 October 2009 11:16\nTo: 'Radiance general discussion'\n\nHi Erik,\n\nThanks for giving some ideas on this and pointing in the right\ndirection. I was already stuck.\n\nIt seems BRTDfunc is already a material and we may not need the glass\nmaterial definition anymore (pls. correct me here).\n\nAlso it may seem that we may need to add the use of glazing.cal as\nmentioned in\nhttp://finance.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/DesktopRadiance/message/14.  I\ntried the below definition and it worked.  Although I'm still not sure\nif this is the correct way.  Any additional clues is highly welcome.\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    Clear\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\nglazing.cal\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nYou're right on the same numbers of front and back reflectance from\nOptics 5 .rad file and will need to check the glass.  I think Optics 5\nmay have a bug on Radiance export but will verify:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop5/2006_Radiance_Workshop\n/Presentations/Ward_RadianceFeatures.pdf\n\nThanks and best regards,\nJun\n\n\nSent: Monday, October 05, 2009 4:47 PM\nTo: jcalixihan@cladding.com; Radiance general discussion\nHi there Jun,\n\nI'm not an expert and I'm sure that someone might correct me but.... you\nneed to apply the modifier that you are using to the glass description.\nthe term 'void' means that you are not applying a modifier. Also, you\nwill need to change the name of the modifier (or the name of the\npolygons) as I think that your polygons have been named 'clear'.\n\nTry this:\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    01_Clear_8_front\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n01_Clear_8_front  glass   clear\n0\n0\n3     0.934     0.974     0.955\n\nPlease note the order.... Radiance will need to read what the modifier\nis BEFORE it can be applied to anything. I have never used this sort of\nmodifier before, so I'm not too sure on what the arguments are (and\nhence can't comment on them..??) and I'm not too sure why you have two\nof them (front and back) which are identical?\n\nhope this helps. Anyone else who can correct me on anything please but\nin!\n\nErik\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nEdilberto Calixihan\nSent: 05 October 2009 08:21\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nI'm new to Desktop Radiance and use Ecotect to create and run the\nsimulations.  I need advise on using BRTDfunc.  Below is the .rad file\nfrom Optics 5 for the clear glass that I need:\n\nvoid  glass       01_Clear_8_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.934     0.974     0.955\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    01_Clear_8_front\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    01_Clear_8_back\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nWhen I insert it into the my scene file (replace the default glass\ncommand lines) I get an \"unidentified modifier \"Clear\"\" error.  Which\nmeans the polygons referencing \"Clear\" cannot find the glass\ndescription, right?  I would modify the glass description to various id\ncombinations like the one below but I get a \"bad arguments for \"Clear\"\"\nerror.\n\nvoid  glass   Clear   Clear_8_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.934     0.974     0.955\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc  Clear_8_front\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc  Clear_8_back\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nHow can I properly run BRTDfunc and the glass reflection numbers from\nOptics 5?\n\nThe one that seems to run ok is below but not sure if I got it right..\nAlso, we don't have a Unix pc at work but I'm interested in the newer\nversions of Radiance.  Shall I start to learn Cygwin or MinGW to access\nadvance glass functions?  Any advice would be very helpful.\n\nvoid  glass   Clear\n0\n0\n3     0.934     0.974     0.955\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    Clear_8_front\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    Clear_8_back\n10\n0.077     0.082     0.082\n0.857     0.894     0.877\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\nThanks so much!\nJun\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091005/66db9eb8/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Help on BRTDfunc", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Mon Oct  5 03:36:38 2009"}
