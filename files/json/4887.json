I think that first thing to check is if there are carriage\nreturns in the file (appearing as ^M), if so these need to be removed.\nWhat program are you using to create/edit your script? You should make\nsure that the editor is saving the files appropriately for Unix/Linux\nnot DOS. You should be able to use the \\ to continue a command to the\nnext line without any problems....\n\nAlso you might want to add:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nto the head of your script. Then if you set the script file to be\nexecutable:\n\nchmod u+x /scriptfilename/\n\nyou can run the script simply by typing its name at the command line\nrather than sourcing it.\n\n-Jack\n\n\nPer Haugaard wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<687843.45824.qm@web26606.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Oct  8 07:19:38 2009"}
