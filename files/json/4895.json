I would have usually done the same,\nand used a WHITE keyword in my IES. However, I am not sure about the\nconversion of a source with a non continous spectrum to radiometric\nunits (which is what I need). I had been hoping that the lamp-lookup in\nies2rad might care about this.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091011/6398b5e4/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<C6F3BA96.D80%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
