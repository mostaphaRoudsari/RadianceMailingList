{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI still didn't manage to try it wirh radiance, but (open)mosix might be a\ngreat addition, as it represents a cluster as a smp-machine, so you don't\nneed rsh and co., and it has an included file system that gives you access to\nall clustered filesystems. So the nfs issue might belong to the past in\nmosix-environments.\n\nRegarding the original question: I didn't need more than on processor working\non a scene so far. Current machines usually render one picture in a time to\nshort to make me think about using rpiece, if I need more than one picture, I\nusually start two rendering processes (I had some very large renderings with\n5000x5000 pixel on a 4way-Sun 880, that was one case that I had more than one\nrendering process at a time). Of course, the memory might become a problem if\nyou do so.\n\nI still want to try mosix, but at the moment, I simply don't have the time ;-)\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] multiprocessor systems, Radiance, and you", "sender": "Lars O.
