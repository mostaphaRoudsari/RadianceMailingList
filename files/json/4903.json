I'll answer as I'm able inline...\n\n\nThe sensor file is normalized to 1.0 in arbitrary \"response\" units.\nThink of it as a multiplier on the incoming radiance value in each\ndirection.\n\n\nYes to the second question, with 90 degrees being the maximum polar\nangle, whose value is zero at all azimuths.  For this distribution,\nrsensor will produce horizontal irradiance in watts/m^2, which\nconverts to lux using the standard 179 multiplier.  A uniform sky of\n100 watts/sr/m^2 would produce a value of 314.16 watts/m^2, or 56235\nlux, for example.\n\n\nIt should be a simple proportion, so multiplying all values by 2.0\nshould give you what you expect.  I just confirmed that it works that\nway.\n\n\nAs I understand it, SPOT is an Excel-based program, so putting the\ndata in a format that isn't Excel-friendly didn't really suit Zack\nRogers and the other developers.  Charles Ehrlich had written an\nearlier equivalent to rsensor that already used this data format, and\nsince ArchEnergy hired me to develop a more efficient approach, they\nhad the prerogative to specify the input and output.\n\nI hope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rsensor file format", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Oct 12 14:53:38 2009"}
