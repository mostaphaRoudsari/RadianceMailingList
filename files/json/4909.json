It all depends on your application. Most systems either use\nrefraction or total reflection to have a dielectric surface redirect\nlight. Sometimes this works like with lenses, sometimes it is simply\nreflecting light from selected directions into another direction.\n\n\nIn general - not at all. Most of these systems can be modeled using the\nphoton map, which is an addition to Radiance but not part of Desktop\nRadiance. There is also rtcontrib which may be used, but this is a\nrather new tool, while Desktop Radiance, as far as I know, is based on\nvery old code. It is possible to model redirecting materials as long as\nthey do not concentrate light (so most planar surfaces) using prism.\n\n\nI was not aware of anyone using Desktop Radiance any more. As far as I\nknow, all updates during the recent years were in Radiance only, I do\nnot know whether anyone is working on Desktop Radiance. Folks on windows\nsystems in general use one of the windows distributions of Radiance,\npeople who need integration into a GUI have options like brad or the\nSketchup-extension, there are tools such as Rayfront. I do not know\nanyone using Desktop Radiance these days.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glass diffuser?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
