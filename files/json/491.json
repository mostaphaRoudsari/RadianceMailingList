This facilitate the use of\nlibrary objects, allowing you to collect common Radiance scene files in\naddition to the usual auxiliary files and frozen octrees in your own\nlibrary location(s).\n\nIf you have set RAYPATH without including \".\", you should add it.  This\nis necessary anyway for Radiance to find .cal files and the like in the\nworking directory.  If for some reason you don't wish to do this, then\nyou can change your inline xform commands to:\n\n!xform -n (name1) ./file1.rad\n!xform -n (name2) ./file2.rad\n!xform -n (name3) ./file3.rad\n\nI hope this fixes your problem.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] OCONV and Radiance 3.5", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2003 23:05:02 -0700"}
