The rsensor program reports the\nsensor-weighted sum of RGB radiance values over the hemisphere, and if\nyou have an idea of how to multiply the RGB results based on the\nspectral sensitivity, you can get a more accurate output.\n\n\nI think Jennifer answered this pretty well, and she knows more about\nit than I do.\n\n\nYes, effectively.  The rsensor program actually inverts the sensor\ndistribution to derive Monte Carlo ray samples, so it's a bit tricky,\nbut amounts to the same.\n\n\nRadiation as we use it normally is not a volumetric quantity.  It can\nbe area-based, but since we report things as a proportion of area\n(e.g., watts/meter^2), this factors out again.  I'm not really sure\nwhere you're confused, since there are so many things that are\nconfusing about lighting units.  I spent months in the beginning\ntrying to get my head around them.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rsensor file format", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Oct 13 13:41:52 2009"}
