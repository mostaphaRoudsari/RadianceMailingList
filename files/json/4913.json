Except from one orientation the results look valid. But the illuminination entering from the north facing window is over estimated. I get a DF above 10 up til 15 m from the facade. It looks like north wall is not taken into account in the calculation. There are no problems when I excluce the north window.\n\nHere is data extrated from my geometry file:\n\n# north wall\nwhite_paint polygon t_2_0\n0\n0\n36\n??? 115.981526? 75.891011? 0.000000\n??? 115.981526? 75.891011? 28.000000\n??? 0.000000? 75.891011? 28.000000\n??? 0.000000? 75.891011? 12.800000\n??? 17.292543? 75.891011? 12.800000\n??? 0.528300? 75.891011? 18.200000\n??? 115.477026? 75.891011? 18.200000\n??? 115.477026? 75.891011? 19.850000\n??? 0.528300? 75.891011? 19.850000\n??? 0.528300? 75.891011? 18.200000\n??? 17.292543? 75.891011? 12.800000\n??? 17.292543? 75.891011? 0.000000\n\n# North window\nLT70 t_33_0\n0\n0\n12\n??? 115.477026? 75.891011? 19.850000\n??? 0.528300? 75.891011? 19.850000\n??? 0.528300? 75.891011? 18.200000\n??? 115.477026? 75.891011? 18.200000\n\nI have debugged the geometry and calculation procedure and found no mismatch. Have anybody experienced the same illumination mismatch before?\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n\n/Per\n\n\nTr?nger du til at se det store billede? Kelkoo giver dig gode tilbud p? LCD TV!
