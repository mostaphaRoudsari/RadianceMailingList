However, I've just read up on this in Walsh: \"Photometry\", 1958:\n\n\"It might at first be thought that the total luminous flux given by a\nsource could be found from the area of the polar curve, or the volume of\nits solid of revolution about the 0-180 deg axis. But a moment's\nconsideration will show that this is not the case.\"\n\nThis is where I was coming from. After a lot longer than just one\nmoment's consideration, I stand corrected.\n\nLet theta be the altitude (zenith, nadir) angle, and phi be the azimuth\nangle. I is the intensity.\n\nThe total flux, assuming rotational symmetry of the 3d curve around the\nnadir-zenith axis (I(theta) is not a function of phi), is\n\nintegral(zero, 2pi) integral(zero, pi) I(theta) sin(theta) d theta d phi,\n\nwhich is\n\n2pi integral I(theta) sin(theta) d theta,\n\nin other words, there is a simple linear relation between flux F and\nI(theta):\n\nF is proportional to I(theta).\n\nSo much to light emitters (IES data), and receivers are identical but\nthe other way 'round. Simple, really...\n\nq.e.d.\n\nOther than to myself, I hope I didn't cause too much confusion.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rsensor file format", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed Oct 14 05:55:05 2009"}
