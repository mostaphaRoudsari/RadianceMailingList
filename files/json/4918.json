I don?t have BSDF data from panelite, they are looking into\nhaving a sample measured but that won?t help me right now.  I was thinking\nthat I could build a radiance model of panelite and use rtconrib to generate\na BSDF of sorts.  Is this a terrible idea?\n\nChallenge 2 ? Writing a rtcontrib expression to separate contributions\naccording to exiting direction from the portal.  Can I use directions from\ntreganza.cal?  Is there some reason that this isn?t a good idea?  Klems\ndirections has been mentioned.  I have no knowledge of klems directions.  Is\nthat a better alternative?\n\nAnd I guess the overall questions:  Are there more challenges I have yet to\ndiscover?  Is anyone who has done this willing to share experiences?  Would\nI be better off creating a model with thousands of cylinders between glass\npanes and using rtcontrib + brute force?  Is there an even better method\nthat I haven?t discovered trolling through archives?\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091015/d7b589e1/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Oct 15 12:17:14 2009"}
