As a few of you already know I am really new with Radiance and am now shifting from Desktop Radiance to Radiance. (Thanks a lot Francesco.. Cygwin is a real hit, Thanks Rob for getting me started )\nI have been trying to do some runs in Radiance wherein I am calculating illuminance levels at a workplane grid for 4 daylighting configurations. I will be comparing these results with results from Superlite and eventually with DOE 2 so as to determine the error in the calcs in DOE 2\nThe configurations are 36wide  x 30 deep x 10' high  room with one window on the whole south face.\nThe same room with 2). a light shelf   3). 4 skylights  4) roof monitor.\nPresently I am still doing the calcs with simple room with one window.\n\nNow for the newbie questions.\n1. When I am running rtrace I am getting a message warning no light source found. I am using a sky without sun and specifying -B. Is this because of the sky type or some other reason since I am getting the values which seem reasonable.\n2. Since I am comparing results from superlite it is important that the geometry and material properties are exactly the same.The glass type in Superlite is a clear glass with  85% transmittance and 5% reflectance. How do I specify a similar glass type in radiance. The lib shows one with same properties as\n\nvoid  glass       E178-6_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.61271     0.84589     0.68805\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    E178-6_front\n10\n0.56202     0.77639     0.63125\n0.24487     0.09924     0.22543\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nvoid  BRTDfunc    E178-6_back\n10\n0.56202     0.77639     0.63125\n0.22373     0.13212     0.24437\n0 0 0\n.\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIs this what I should be using or simply put it as (for 85%transmittance)\n\nvoid glass class_lglass\n0\n0\n3\n0.927 0.927 0.927\n\nI know the questions may seem really simple  for the advanced users but I need your guidance to proceed.\n\nThanks\nArvinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
