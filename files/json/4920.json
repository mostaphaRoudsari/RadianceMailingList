{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\nI'm really sorry to raise this topic again, but I've been doing\nsome tests recently with a cluster, and got into this strange problem.\n\nNot using OpenMosix this time, just redhat (after nearly 7 years of\ndebian), nfs mounts and pdsh distributing rpiece through ssh.\n\nI launch the big script, wait, got the image done, looks good,\nthe ambient file is good too but ...\n\n... but some of the picture tiles, randomly, got rendered twice,\nthree times, four times, so I loose quite a bit of processing power.\nJust to explain better, the syncronisation file, after the picture\nis completed, looks something like this:\n\n1   12\n0    0\n\n0   11\n0   10\n0    9\n0    9\n0    8\n0    8\n0    8\n0    8\n0    8\n0    8\n0    8\n0    8\n0    0\n0    7\n0    1\n0    6\n0    4\n0    5\n0    2\n0    3\n\nSo tile 0.9 has been done twice, and tile 0.8 has even been done 8\ntimes!!!\n\nI haven't found an explanation, yet. Has anybody come across a similar\nissue?\n\nI've tried as well directly with ssh, but still the same problem.\n\nThanks in advance for any input on this.\n\nHave a nice week-end.\n\n--\nFrancesco\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<2C0020B9EB71CE4281B292F0E16A6DDE016A2384@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Sep  1 19:32:19 2006", "email": "Francesco.Anselmo at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] NFS and rpiece"}
