{"body": "\nThanks for the mkillum suggestion Greg!\n\nJust to have a complete understanding of setting -ar to 0, which is an\ninteresting idea: is it something as setting the ambient radius to a pixel?\nRecently Mental Ray allowed setting its final gathering based on pixel\nradii, which is actually a very neat idea. How would such an approach work\non Radiance? I remember it's been quite a help, but am not sure if it would\nmake sense for Radiance.\n\nCheers,\n\n-jelle\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jelle Feringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<013601c6e610$10f98110$c000a8c0@JELLE>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Oct  2 12:46:32 2006", "email": "jelle.feringa at ezct.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient settings"}
