{"body": "<EC9E9D59-4040-4503-A855-28CD23DFB2C9@gmail.com>\n\nI am looking for a good spherical panoramic tripod mount. It should be sturdy, precise, and have good markers and levels for repeatable measurements. The camera lens should be placed at the center of the sphere.\n\nThanks for your suggestions.\n\nMartin Moeck\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 2711 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061019/7a106d96/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Martin Moeck", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A1751205CFFEB548B3E78F10333DCF8805F353@ENGRMAIL1.engr.psu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 20 02:00:05 2006", "email": "MMoeck at engr.psu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: tripod heads for spherical camera rotationReferences: <013701c6e3b1$b5bc4950$c000a8c0@JELLE><451D223B.1040405@visarc.com>"}
