I am\ntrying to model a series of openings in a screen using antimatter and I\nam getting really confused.\nThe screen is modelled as a single surface intersected by a number of\ncubes. As in the antimatter description I read:\n\"The viewpoint must be outside all volumes concerned for a correct\nrendering.\" I assume that means that the camera should not be inside one\nof the cubes and that (I guess) the cube normals should point outward.\nDone that, I am able to see through the cubes but I do not see the\npattern of light coming through the antimatter holes, I just have a big\nsolid shadow...\n\nIs that how it is supposed to behave? Does anybody have any clue about\nwhat I am doing wrong?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBest,\n\nGiovanni\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Giovanni Betti", "datetime": "Fri Oct 30 09:40:29 2009"}
