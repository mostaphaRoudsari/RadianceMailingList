{"body": "\nHi Greg\n\n\nI think a functional organization fits the need of the user most,\nindeed. Applications and tutorials might be added to the end of the\nlist, just for those who want to browse through them, which can be very\nlearnfull for both beginners and experienced users.\nEvery search in the tree will end in some article. If just each article\nwill end with related tutorials and applications, that in itself is a\nway of organizing tutorials and applications.\n\nWhat might be added is an Installation chapter, which covers also\ndifferent platforms, different shells and additional software\ndevelopments like radzilla.\n\nI don't know what you exectly have in mind, but as you say : \"help,\nplease!\", using wikipedia  (there already is a small wiki about Radiance\nsoftware) might be an option to have lots of us working on the same\ndocumentation. If those who now are active in this mailinglist spent\njust some time in writing articles and updating hyperlinks now and then,\nthen over some years a real nice documentation will be just there.\nWikipedia also has an option for creating Wiki-books as pdf.\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance documentation organization", "sender": "iebele", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<453F6FFD.5050909@iebele.nl>", "refs": ["<BF9D74D0-E5F6-4B7C-9559-C6DD1419D786@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct 25 16:07:08 2006", "email": "info at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance documentation organization"}
