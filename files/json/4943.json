Thanks for making the trip\nover to the states!\n\nIt has been awhile since I did anything with antimatter but here is an\nexample that should work:\n\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\nvoid plastic red\n0\n0\n5 1 0 0 0 0\n\nvoid antimatter am\n2 red white\n0\n0\n\n!genbox white wall 10 .1 10\n\n!genbox am holes 1 1 1 | xform -t -.5 -.5 -.5 -t 1 0 5 -a 5 -t 2 0 0\n\nThis will make five holes in the \"wall\" geometry, where the holes are\ncut will be red.\n\nThe main trick here is understanding the antimatter material definition\n\nvoid antimatter <name>\n2 <mod1> <mod2>\n0\n0\n\nwhere I think of it as \"make a hole using material <mod1> in material\n<mod2>.\" If you do not want there to be any material where the hole is\ncut then mod1 can be void.\n\nAt first I was thinking that this only works on \"volumes\" rather than\nsurfaces. But a quick test shows that it does work on surfaces as well:\n\nwhite polygon wall\n0\n0\n12\n0   0   0\n10   0   0\n10    0   10\n0   0   10\n\n!genbox am holes 1 1 1 | xform -t -.5 -.5 -.5 -t 1 0 5 -a 5 -t 2 0 0\n\nNOTE however that if you want to punch holes in planar surfaces then\n<mod1> needs to be \"void\" in the antimatter definition.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\nGiovanni Betti wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Antimatter", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Fri Oct 30 10:25:50 2009"}
