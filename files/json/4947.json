I am\ntrying to model a series of openings in a screen using antimatter and I\nam getting really confused.\nThe screen is modelled as a single surface intersected by a number of\ncubes. As in the antimatter description I read:\n\"The viewpoint must be outside all volumes concerned for a correct\nrendering.\" I assume that means that the camera should not be inside one\nof the cubes and that (I guess) the cube normals should point outward.\nDone that, I am able to see through the cubes but I do not see the\npattern of light coming through the antimatter holes, I just have a big\nsolid shadow...\n\nIs that how it is supposed to behave? Does anybody have any clue about\nwhat I am doing wrong?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBest,\n\nGiovanni\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091030/3c00d8ec/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Giovann", "datetime": "Fri Oct 30 10:44:37 2009"}
