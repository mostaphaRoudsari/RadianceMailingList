Happens anytime you spec an overcast sky too...\n\n\nI know nothing about Superlite, and little more about Radiance, but a\nclear 85% transmittance glass in Radiance looks like this:\n\nvoid glass Avrinder's_glass\n0\n0\n3\n.85 .85 .85\n\nNow, the glass material in Radiance has a fixed reflectance value, but\nI don't recall what it is (but it's not 5%).  If you wanna explicitly\nspec the reflectance you will have to use the fancier BRTDfunc, which\nis the domain of the gurus on the list. Sorry I can't be of additional\nhelp on that one.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Warning message and glass definiti", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sat, 4 Oct 2003 23:14:06 -0400"}
