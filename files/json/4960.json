{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nGood point about installation.  That definitely deserves its own\ncategory, which I simply forgot.  I've also added a tutorials\nsection, which we may as well break into categories as well:\n\nI. Installation and Set-up\nA. Standard (UNIX) distirbution\nB. Radzilla\nC. Windows alternatives\nD. Other packages\n\nII. Tutorials\nA. Basic\nB. General, Advanced\nB. Electric Lighting\nC. Daylighting\n\nIII. Input\nA. CAD links and conversion tools\nB. Photometry & Sky models\nC. Generator programs\nD. Scene processing (xform, replmarks, oconv, etc.)\n\nIV. Computation\nA. Rendering (batch & interactive)\nB. Illumination calculations\nC. Executive programs (rad, rayfront, etc.)\n\nV. Output\nA. Image processing\nB. Image viewing\nC. Image format conversion\nD. Graphing & plotting\n\nRegarding Wikipedia, I think the discussion we had at the workshop\nwas leaning towards a more controlled environment, where people would\nstill be very free to contribute but responsible for particular parts\nof the documentation tree.  This was the plone-based solution that\nPeter Apian-Bennewitz proposed last year.  Much hints on getting some\nseed (and hopefully ongoing) funding for that.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance documentation organization", "sender": "Gregory J.
