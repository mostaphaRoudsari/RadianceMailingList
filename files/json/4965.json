I think I will add one more.\nThis is a binary install procedure for all users of the system; there\nis no need to recompile.\n\n1. Download the following two files from the Radiance Online site:\n\nrad3R9_macosx.tar.gz\nrad3R9supp.tar.bz2\n\n2. Double-click on both of them to unpack them.  These will create two\ndirectories:\nrad3R9_macosx\nray\n\n3. Rename rad3R9_macosx to \"bin\" and move it into the \"ray\" directory.\n\n4. Move \"ray\" to /usr/local.\n\n5. Add the following lines to .bash_profile in your home directory:\nRAY=/usr/local/ray\nRAYBIN=/usr/local/ray/bin\nRAYPATH=.:$RAY/lib export RAYPATH\nMANPATH=$RAY/doc/man:$MANPATH export MANPATH\nPATH=$RAYBIN:$PATH export PATH\n\nAt this point, the software is installed.  To test the installation,\ndo the following steps:\n\n1. Start a Terminal window.\n\n2. Issue the command \"cd /usr/local/ray/obj/cabin\"\n\n3. Issue the command \"make\"\n\nIf you are using Mac OS 10.5, I expect you will see an rvu window\nappear.  It will not behave like a normal Mac GUI window, but that's\nOK--that's how rvu works.\n\n--\nRandolph Fritz\ndesign machine group, architecture department, university of washington\nrfritz@u.washington.edu -or- rfritz333@gmail.com\n\nWhen I find time, I'd like to write a Mac installer...\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Randolph Fritz", "datetime": "Sun Nov  1 13:01:56 2009"}
