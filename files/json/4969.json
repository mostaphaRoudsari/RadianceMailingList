{"body": "\nHi Terry,\n\nThis is no help, really, but I would suggest transdata with some\nappropriate angular measurements.  Are there any?  Plain\ntransmittance isn't enough to capture the distribution of light,\nwhich I wouldn't expect to be diffuse.  In the absence of any\nmeasurements, I suppose you have to assume it's close to diffuse and\nuse their value of 3% of 88% for 4% fiber volume density.  So, that\nworks out to a formula of:\n\ntransmittance = 0.66 * fiber_density\n\nYou can then plug this into a trans primitive:\n\nconc_pattern trans litracon_TM\n0\n0\n7 {refl+trans} {refl+trans} {refl+trans} 0 0 {trans} 0\n\n(Replacing the things in curly braces with appropriate values.)  I\ndon't know what the reflectance is -- between 10% and 30% I suppose\nbut they don't say.  As for the concrete pattern, you can use a noise\nfunction if you like, but I doubt it would look very convincing up\nclose:\n\nvoid brightfunc conc_pattern\n2 '1+0.2*fnoise3({sca}*Px,{sca}*Py,{sca}*Pz)' .\n0\n0\n\nYou'll have to pick the scale to suit your coordinates, and you may\nwant to use different ones for Px, Py, and Pz to get a grain\nappearance, for example.\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I love the spotlight selector thing on their website -- very hip.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<092BF7A1BC389E489A69DC764F23CD8708BBEB59@exmsp2.perth.ad.curtin.edu.au>", "sender": "Gregory J.
