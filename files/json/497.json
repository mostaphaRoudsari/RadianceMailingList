{"body": "\nHello\n\nI am currently making an attempt to port Radiance 3.4 into Windows 2000. I\nhave a question concerning the aux.h header file. As some of you already\nknow, the header file aux.h is reserved exclusively for Windows. I was able\nto get the file onto my hard drive by renaming it aux2.h. What I am curious\nis to know which files (*.c) are associated with this header file. I did a\ntext search for \"aux.h\" to see if it was listed as an <include> directive in\nany files but nothing turned up. I know this file is used somewhere and\nsomehow but I don't know where. Please help.\n\nMarcus Jacobs\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
