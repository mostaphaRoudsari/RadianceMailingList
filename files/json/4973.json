{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nThis is just traditional time reporting on most Unix's.  \"u\" is short\nfor \"user\" time, or time spent in normal execution mode.  The \"s\" is\nfor \"system\" time, or time spent executing system calls -- usually\ndisk i/o and the like.  The final \"r\" is \"real\" time, or hours passed\nin total, and gives an idea of what percentage of the cpu you are\ngetting, e.g. (50.244+0.452)/53.318 means you're getting 95% of the\nprocessor.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reporting Info", "sender": "Gregory J.
