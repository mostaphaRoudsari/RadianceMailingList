I get however an oconv warning\nthat my srcs.rad file is empty. The experience I have with this warning is\nthat it is related to a missing material description, which in this case is\nincluded in the Environment.rad.\n\noconv Environment.rad > iblmksource.oct\n\nmksource ?a 0.5 iblmksource.oct > srcs.rad\n\noconv -i iblmksource.oct srcs.rad > ibl1.oct\n/Anne\n\nHi!\nDoes this pass oconv without error messages? I think you just need to\nremove everything in the second line except the zero here, so it becomes\n\nlum_sun source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.6410 0.5537 -0.5315 0.5323\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n--\nAnne Iversen\nGuldborgvej 44 3.th\n2000 Frederiksberg\n\nmobil: 20646857\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091120/09d26213/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Anne Iversen", "datetime": "Fri Nov 20 13:41:55 2009"}
