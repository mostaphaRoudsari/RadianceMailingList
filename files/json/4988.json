The rule of thumb is that the source object is enclosing the\nwhole scene's octree - in other words, it catches rays sent out that did\nnot hit anything else to get them reflected back or absorbed.\n\nSo if you wanted to model with a sphere representing the sky, you'd have\nto go with a disk (ring with inner radius 0) for the sun. You do not\nwant this. Instead, use source for both. And again - do not start using\nmksource before you got the scene running without. Optimization is great\nsometimes, but only once everything is working fine.\n\nSo good luck, and once again, the wonderful many ways to get confused\nand hide some nasty bugs in a radiance scene ;-)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4D16A091CF93B04D91453602000F97C42D5BA1@eurxmb05.global.arup.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
