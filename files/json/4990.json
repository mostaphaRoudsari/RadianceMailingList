And yes, I'll keep it\nsimple, no optimization with mksource at this point ;o).  And a third: Yes -\nRadiance is tricky, therefore it is so good that this list is active!\n\nHowever, when changing the 'sphere environment' from sphere to source I\ncannot display my scene any longer. My source description is\nenv_glow source sphereenv\n0 0\n4 0 1 0 360\nThe simulation approach now follows exactly the one in the Image Based\nLighting tutorial from Debevec, p. 31,\nhttp://www.debevec.org/CGAIBL2/ibl-tutorial-cga2002.pdf. I get a white image\nand the rvu message:\nrvu: warning - compute error for colorpict \"hdr_env\"\nrvu: Division by zero\nrvu: Division by zero\n\nDo you maybe also have tips on how I can solve this?\nThanks!\nAnne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091123/4d0ff1dc/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Anne Iversen", "datetime": "Mon Nov 23 17:38:27 2009"}
