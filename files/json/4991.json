Just\nhappened to me, as I got some Eulumdat-formatted files. First I tried\nCarsten's eulum2ies, but it crashes - I guess due to the hight\nresolution in 1 degree steps for my files. Then I found something quite\ninteresting:\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/qlumedit/\n\nIt is a QT-based tool, loading eulumdat files, processing the content so\nthat it can be displayed and edited in tables, creates some plot, and -\nconverts to IES!\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to compile the QT3-sources, my knowledge on\nQT is limited. But at least the Windows-binary runs without any problems\nunder Wine here.\n\nSo maybe someone finds this useful, cheers,\n\nLars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
