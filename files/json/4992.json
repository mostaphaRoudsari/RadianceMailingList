{"body": "\nDear Group,\n\nI have a question concerning anisotropic roughness vector alignment.\nSpecifically I would like to know is there anyway to correlate the u and v\nmapping values to a desired roughness vector. Here is an example what I am\nattempting to simulate (see photo below)\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/100_0050.jpg\n\nYou can see how the brush strokes follow the base of the clock\ncircumferentially. Ideally, if one were to model the same object, one\nroughness vector value would align itself around the clock base. The other\nvalue would be in the radial direction. For an object such as this, I can\nmodel the object such that the image map will align around itself in a\nsimilar manner (see image below):\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/ring01_render.jpg\n\nSince I can align a texture in the direction that I want, I was wondering if\nthere is I can translate the uv coordinates in a manner that could be used\nfor specifying the anisotropic roughness values.\n\nPlease let me know if I do not make sense. Sometimes I have been known to\nconfuse myself :>)\n\nThanks,\n\nMarcus\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nStay in touch with old friends and meet new ones with Windows Live Spaces\nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwsp0070000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://spaces.live.com/spacesapi.aspx?wx_action=create&wx_url=/friends.aspx&mkt=en-us\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Anisotropic Roughness Vector Alignment", "sender": "Marcus Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY115-F122C173D2459B7D565D1C4A4FD0@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Nov  4 01:47:28 2006", "email": "marcdevon at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Anisotropic Roughness Vector Alignment"}
