That is, instead of using a clipping plane, is there a means to \"hide\" specific surfaces?  I need to pull off certain surfaces and look into the room, but the plan is sort of squiggley, and a simple cutting plane doesn't do a very good job.\n\nthank you,\n\ndave bosworth\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Dave Bosworth", "datetime": "Thu Nov 26 07:45:33 2009"}
