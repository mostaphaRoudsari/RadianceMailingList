Everybody on\nx86? Or are there some Sparc/Alpha/PowerPC-users here?\n\nIn fact, I have never been interested too much in cpu-performance,\nbenchmarks\netc... I only wanted my machine to run stable ;-) But as I have access\nto wider\nrange of platforms at the moment (sparc and ultrasparc, alpha, powerpc)\nI\nwould like to hear if there is the ultimate platform for radiance, or at\nleast\nif these non-x86 are used by radiance-users.\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
