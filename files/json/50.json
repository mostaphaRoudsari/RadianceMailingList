{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI just downloaded Compaq's C Compiler from their ftp-server and simply\nrecompiled with -fast. I gain about 17% speed on rpict with this\ncompiler (tested on Paul Bourkes bench2-package). So if there's someone\nout there working with Linux on alpha, you just should try this... I\nhave an old 21164, results on 264s which should allow even more\noptimizing might be interesting. As my latest rendering took 4 days\nhere, I'm quite happy with this improvement for the moment - 17 % of 4\ndays... hmmm ;-)))\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
