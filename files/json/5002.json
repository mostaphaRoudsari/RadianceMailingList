The resolution of your sensor points depends on the\nview and image specification; it has it's limits but compared to a grid\nit should be better. You can probably restrict the area to test to a\nrepresentive patch.\n2) the direction is the surface normal at that point\n3) with -ab 0 and only the sun (no sky dome) you create an image\n4) If any of your image points is bright (not 0) you have a hit. You can\nuse pvalue to do this automatically or just look at the image.\n\nB - search for material:\n1) define grid resolution to apply to building facade\n2) use sun direction as test direction\n3) use rtrace with -os (surface) or -oM (material) and without -I+\n4) if you get a \"sun\" or \"solar\" for any of the points you have a hit\n\nC - combined method:\n1) from stencil to create the grid points\n2), 3), 4) as B\n\nOr\nto\n\nIn the second case all these settings do not matter. We are using the\noutput format spec to let rtrace report about the material it hits instead\nof the radiance of that surface. For the stencil method I do not think\nthese settings are an issue because you only have the sun in the sky\nand a single light source is tested automatically by rtrace. I might be\nwrong, though.\n\n\nIn the example I \"tested\" 3 directions from point (0,0,0).\nIn an rtrace output you would have 3 lines of materials.\nAssuming that the sky material is called \"skyglow\" only\nthe first ray actually hits the sky. You can name the materials\nas you like, of course. In fact, I don't use a sky at all and\nlook for \"*\" in the output which rtrace reports if it doesn't hit\nanything.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"Sensor Surfaces\"", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Fri Nov 27 02:40:46 2009"}
