This is the only way to get\nlocal texture coordinates, which you have in your .OBJ file.\n\nTo do this, I created two files -- Box.mat and box_mesh.rad.  Box.mat\ncontains:\n\nvoid colorpict patt\n7 red green blue image_1.pic . Lu Lv\n0\n0\n\npatt plastic map_image_1\n0\n0\n5 .75 .75 .75 0 0\n\nAnd box_mesh.rad contains:\n\nmap_image_1 mesh box1\n1 Box.rtm\n0\n0\n\nI then ran the following commands:\n\n% obj2mesh Box.obj > Box.rtm\n% oconv Box.mat Light.rad box_mesh.rad > scene.oct\n\nYou can then produce renderings from scene.oct.\n\nIf you are under Windows, none of this will work as the mesh primitive\nis not part of Desktop Radiance.\n\n-Greg\n------------\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Fitting texture to mesh", "tags": [], "sender": "gward@lmi.net", "datetime": "Tue Sep 30, 2003  4:11:53  PM US/Pacific"}
