Even without\nthem, rtcontrib works fast and good enough in Windows.\n\nThanks again,\nMarija\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 3:45 PM, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091207/2155e1fb/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Parallel processes within rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Mon Dec  7 00:38:28 2009"}
