The mapping between\ntrans and something like glass is not 1:1. Note also that the Radiance\nglass material uses \"transmissivity\" not transmittance, this term can be\ncalculated from transmittance. How did you figure out the parameters\nthat you have for your trans material?\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\nVictor Li wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091210/ad4915dd/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 06:12:52 2009"}
