Thus, a daylight factor of 5% on an internal surface means\nthat it received only 1/20th of the maximum available natural light.\n\nso we can calculate daylight factor by RADIANCE with a overcast sky.\nThen i calculated the illuminance under overcast sky. I found the\ndistribution of illuminance and skyfactor in the room is different. For\nexample, in the room ratio of minimum to average of daylight and\nilluminance are quite different. Would you tell me the reason?\n\nBest Regards!\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091210/ea89be8c/attachment-0001.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight factor", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 06:34:08 2009"}
