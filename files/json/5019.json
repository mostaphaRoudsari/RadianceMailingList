I would also not expect exactly the same results, as both materials are optimized for different applications. The transmissive specularity of 0.3 you use in your trans material also certainly does not match the perfectly clear glass material.\n\nEspecially I do not understand why using trans to be able to get daylight illuminance. It is not really made for this. Is there a special reason that you cannot use the glass modifier?\n\nCheers,\n\nLars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 10:23:39 2009"}
