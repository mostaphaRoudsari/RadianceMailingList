If I\ndo it the other way I think it omits the bsdf data.  Am I missing a trick?\n\nBest,\nAndy\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091210/4edfda5a/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 12:42:59 2009"}
