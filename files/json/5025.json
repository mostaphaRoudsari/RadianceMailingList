I don't have an explanation for adding one to each dimension.\n\nFinally, the sampling pattern of my BSDF (18x24) and the hemisphere division\nused by mkillum (13x39) results in double-sampling of some BSDF angles and\nnon-sampling of others.  In conclusion I would be best served by using the\ntypical radiance hemisphere division ( m x pi*m ) to generate a BSDF that\n\"agrees\" with mkillum.  (or should I stop speculating...)\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/10/09 2:55 PM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mkillum bsdf + sample densit", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 16:24:00 2009"}
