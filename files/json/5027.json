I just want to compare the glass 3     0.325 0.325\n0.325  and trans 7     0.325 0.325 0.325 0 0 1 1 (not 0.3).\n\nIn trans, the transmissive specularity is 1 which means the total daylight\ntransmitted through the material will be specularly transmitted, like glass.\nSo i defined the transmissive specularity is 1.\n\nActually i had a look the webpage and i define the trans followed the\ninstruction in the page.\n\nNote also that the Radiance glass material uses \"transmissivity\" not\ntransmittance,\nso does trans use \"transmittance\" in the first three paremeters? What is the\ndifference between transmittance and transmissivity?\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091211/bf065d5e/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?", "tags": [], "sender": "Victor Li", "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 19:22:38 2009"}
