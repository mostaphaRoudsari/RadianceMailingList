What do you think?\n\n2009/12/10 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush@arup.com>\n\nIt would help to know your command process for calculating illuminance\nand daylight factor to troubleshoot.\n\n\n\nAlso, if your rpict/rtrace ambient sampling settings are not stringent\nenough, differences could be due to random sampling variation between\ntwo different calculation runs.\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nVictor Li\nSent: Thursday, December 10, 2009 4:04 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nDear:\n\nDaylight factors are expressed as the percentage of natural light\nfalling on a work surface compared to that which would have fallen on a\ncompletely unobstructed horizontal surface under exactly the same sky\nconditions. Thus, a daylight factor of 5% on an internal surface means\nthat it received only 1/20th of the maximum available natural light.\n\nso we can calculate daylight factor by RADIANCE with a overcast sky.\nThen i calculated the illuminance under overcast sky. I found the\ndistribution of illuminance and skyfactor in the room is different. For\nexample, in the room ratio of minimum to average of daylight and\nilluminance are quite different. Would you tell me the reason?\n\nBest Regards!\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091211/add490c7/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight factor", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Fri Dec 11 07:19:18 2009"}
