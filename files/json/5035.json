I'm afraid I can't help much more, as I'm not\nsure what Ecotect does with the data that comes out of your Radiance\nprocess.\n\n\n\nAlso, I'm still not sure what command you're actually using to generate\nyour data results.\n\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nVictor Li\nSent: Saturday, December 12, 2009 11:29 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\nActually i uesed ECOTET exported to DESKTOP RADIANCE to calculate. The\nonly differernce between Daylight factor and Illuminance calculation is\nthe -B 0.558659 definition in 11_SKY.RAD\nIn Daylight factor calculation the sky is defined as following:\n\n!gensky 12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000 -B 0.558659 |\nxform -rz -27.000\n\nskyfunc glow sky_mat\n0\n0\n4\n1 1 1 0\n\nsky_mat source sky\n0\n0\n4\n0 0 1 180\n\nskyfunc glow ground_glow\n0\n0\n4\n1 .8 .5 0\n\nground_glow source ground\n0\n0\n4\n0 0 -1 180\n\nIn Illuminance calculation, the definition is :\n\n!gensky 12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000 -B 0.558659 |\nxform -rz -27.000\n\nThe rest is all the same.\n\nFor converting the output, the ECOTECT can convert it automatically.\n\n\n\n2009/12/11 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush@arup.com>\n\nWhat are the dimensions and resolution of your grid in 11.pts compared\nto the full boundary of your scene (including ground plane and anything\nelse) in 11.oct? Maybe -ar is not high enough.\n\n\n\nWhat is your sky definition going into 11.oct?\n\n\n\nDo you have an rcalc command to convert the output in 11.dat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nVictor Li\nSent: Thursday, December 10, 2009 8:34 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nThe rtrace setting is \"rtrace -I -h -dp 2048 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt\n.05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01 -ab 8 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -av 0.01\n0.01 0.01 -lr 12 -lw .0005  -af 11.amb 11.oct < 11.pts > 11.dat\"  And\nthe two calculations of daylight factor and illuminance are all the same\nsettings. What do you think?\n\n2009/12/10 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush@arup.com>\n\nIt would help to know your command process for calculating illuminance\nand daylight factor to troubleshoot.\n\n\n\nAlso, if your rpict/rtrace ambient sampling settings are not stringent\nenough, differences could be due to random sampling variation between\ntwo different calculation runs.\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nVictor Li\nSent: Thursday, December 10, 2009 4:04 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nDear:\n\nDaylight factors are expressed as the percentage of natural light\nfalling on a work surface compared to that which would have fallen on a\ncompletely unobstructed horizontal surface under exactly the same sky\nconditions. Thus, a daylight factor of 5% on an internal surface means\nthat it received only 1/20th of the maximum available natural light.\n\nso we can calculate daylight factor by RADIANCE with a overcast sky.\nThen i calculated the illuminance under overcast sky. I found the\ndistribution of illuminance and skyfactor in the room is different. For\nexample, in the room ratio of minimum to average of daylight and\nilluminance are quite different. Would you tell me the reason?\n\nBest Regards!\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091214/25e68a15/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight factor", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Mon Dec 14 09:13:26 2009"}
