Without changing\nthe original file ids, I simply add a line:\n\n!xform  French_mat_file.rad\n\nvoid      alias      red      rouge\n# modifier  alias  additional_id  original_id\n\nThe function has additional benefits. If the alias command is modified,\nonly the new identifier acquires these modifier properties.  I use this\nmethod as a convenient way to combine picture data from a colorpict\ndescription with a predefined material.\n\n!xform   picture_descriptions.rad\n!xform   paint_surfaces.rad\n\npicturedata  alias  painting   canvas\n\nOf course there are other ways to achieve the same end, but when working\nwith several large material description libraries, I find that alias\nprovides the most convenient method.\n\n-Rob Shakespeare\nIndiana University\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-admin@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Jeffrey\nMcGrew\nSent: Tuesday, October 07, 2003 12:37 PM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHello all,\n\nSo I hate to ask a stupid, basic question (yet again :)\nhowever I've read all I can, and not being able to find\na copy of the 'Rendering with Radiance' book anywhere,\nthis is the only place I can turn to.\n\nI can't figure out what application the 'alias'\nmaterial modifier is for. I understand how to\napply modifiers, and patterns, and I've read the old\ntutorial, the new tutorial, the help files,\nand the man pages, and still can't get my head\naround what this is for or where you would apply\nit.\n\nIf anyone could point me to a help file,\nor just give a few quick examples of what the\nalias modifier would be used for in application,\nI would be incredibly grateful.\n\nThanks a ton,\n\nJeffrey\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 'Alias' material modifier questions...", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-admin@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Tue, 7 Oct 2003 13:14:27 -0500"}
