{"body": "\nWell this is a funny little thing...  Giulio has found something\nstrange!\n\nHaving followed his test below, both sky definitions provided a global\nirrad of 55.7 W/m2.

Just be careful of your\nground definition.\n\nThe gensky model includes a default ground reflectance of 0.2.  This can\nbe changed using gensky's -g option.  So, the normalised emittance of\nNick's groundglow material should be 1.0, not 0.1 or 0.2 as Giulio\nsuggested.\n\nCheers all,\nPhil.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nGiulio Antonutto\nSent: 22 November 2006 10:25\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nNick,\n\n-R -B are supposed to specify direct and diffuse contribute.\na quick and easy check is to create a -s (diffuse only) and a +s\n(global) sky with the same -R -B and check illuminances at a point (0 0\n0, 0 0 1) Now try without the sky dome and +s (direct only) and see...\nyou should get diffuse and global and direct values.\nPlease try it.\n\n\nAbout the source primitive, you need it all the time.\nCoefficients can be just (1 1 1) for the sky and a reduction like (0.1\n0.1 0.1) or (0.2 0.2 0.2) for the ground depending to the model you are\nworking on.\nIf you use your coefficients you will be working with colour but you\nneed to check that the photopic average is correct.\n\n\nHope this is +s,\ni.e. 'clear'\n:-)\n\nCiao\nG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Nick\nDevlin\nSent: 22 November 2006 09:56\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHi All,\n\nI have a GENSKY question that I cant find the answer to in the archives.\nI\nsuspect that the answer is straightforward, but I am now challenging all\nmy old assumptions as I have just switched from old school desktop\nradiance to\n3R7P2 with photon mapping running under Ubuntu on VMware Workstation.\nDaunting, but I like it!\n\nPerhaps first I should state that I am aware from the listings that\nperhaps I should be using Gendaylit rather than Gensky, but I have not\nmanaged to compile it yet. Compiling makes me anxious. I used\nFrancesco's Linux binaries in the end as I couldn't get photon map to\ncompile properly after 3R7P2. My /bin and /lib files are not in the\nstandard location, but I have altered PATH & RAYPATH accordingly.\n\nSo, to the questions:\n\nFirstly, I have some data for sky brightness from BRE Availability of\nDaylight, for diffuse and direct illuminance. If for example, I have\nilluminance values of 34 klux diffuse and 26 klux direct can I\nexplicitly set these in Gensky (assuming 179lux per watt) with\n\nGensky (location details, azimuth etc) +s -B 189 -R 145.25 > skyfile.rad\n\nMy concern is whether -B or -R overrides the other, or will I ultimately\nresult in approximately total 60klux horizontal illuminance?\n\nSecondly, do I have to manually add the following to the bottom of\nskyfile.rad. I presume that I don't need to alter any of the parameters\nhere for a basic sky and ground plane and that it references the skyfunc\noutput from the gensky command.\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4\n.85 1.04 1.2  0\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4\n0 0 1  180\n\nskyfunc glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4\n.8 1.1 .8  0\n\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4\n0 0 -1  180\n\nFinally, if I explicitly set -B & -R for an intermediate sky with +i\ndoes the +i setting result in an adjustment to the -B & -R values?\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nNick Devlin.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business systems are\nscanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6ED05107D715BD48BEA0EFABD1D082D402E36FA1@ldcexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Nov 22 13:08:33 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] FW: Gensky Question"}
