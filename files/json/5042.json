This\nfunction is called by any of the shared-memory parallel execution\nmodes to maximize static shared data, thereby minimizing system memory\nuse.  The same thing would happen with the -PP option.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New rtrace -n opti", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Dec 15 15:20:48 2009"}
