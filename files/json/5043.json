Compiling makes me anxious. I used Francesco's Linux\nbinaries in the end as I couldn't get photon map to compile properly\nafter\n3R7P2. My /bin and /lib files are not in the standard location, but I\nhave\naltered PATH & RAYPATH accordingly.\n\nSo, to the questions:\n\nFirstly, I have some data for sky brightness from BRE Availability of\nDaylight, for diffuse and direct illuminance. If for example, I have\nilluminance values of 34 klux diffuse and 26 klux direct can I\nexplicitly\nset these in Gensky (assuming 179lux per watt) with\n\nGensky (location details, azimuth etc) +s -B 189 -R 145.25 > skyfile.rad\n\nMy concern is whether -B or -R overrides the other, or will I ultimately\nresult in approximately total 60klux horizontal illuminance?\n\nSecondly, do I have to manually add the following to the bottom of\nskyfile.rad. I presume that I don't need to alter any of the parameters\nhere\nfor a basic sky and ground plane and that it references the skyfunc\noutput\nfrom the gensky command.\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4\n.85 1.04 1.2  0\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4\n0 0 1  180\n\nskyfunc glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4\n.8 1.1 .8  0\n\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4\n0 0 -1  180\n\nFinally, if I explicitly set -B & -R for an intermediate sky with +i\ndoes\nthe +i setting result in an adjustment to the -B & -R values?\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nNick Devlin.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB501E7E6E3@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Nov 22 11:24:53 2006", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] FW: Gensky Question"}
