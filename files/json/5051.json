(a script found in the standard radiance installation). With this script, you can convert Optics (?Optics? being the freeware program from the LBNL) spectral data into a more detailed Radiance description (type ?BRTDfunc?) by exporting from Optics in ?Radiance Format? and then entering this data in the ?glaze? script.\n\n\n\nI am laboring under the possible delusion that this is generally a better description for ?advanced? glazing products (and possibly any translucent materials). However, I am quite new at this.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Donnerstag, 17.

I try to introduce it in RADIANCE.\n\n\n\nMeasurements on the exterior side (glossy) give :\n\nTransmittance_diffuse = 75.5% and transmittance_spec = 9.1%\n\nReflectance_diffuse = 7.7%\n\nAbsorptance = 7.8%\n\n\n\nMeasurements on the interior side (mat) give :\n\nTransmittance_diffuse = 81.6% and transmittance_spec = 8.9%\n\nReflectance_diffuse = 7.8%\n\nAbsorptance = 1.6%\n\n\n\nI?m not sure that I introduced it in RADIANCE in a correct way ?\n\n(following formulas p325 in Rendering with Radiance)\n\nvoid trans vitr_dif\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7     0.71 0.77 0.77 0 0.1 0.99 0.0012\n\nWith\n\nCr = 0.074\n\nCg = 0.08\n\nCb = 0.08\n\nRd = 0.265*Cr+0.67*Cg+0.065*Cb = 0.07841\n\nRs = 0\n\nSr = 0.1\n\nTd = 75.5\n\nTs = 0.091\n\n\n\nThank you for your help !\n\n\n\nCoralie\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoralie Cauwerts\n\nResearcher\n\nUniversit? catholique de Louvain\n\nBelgium\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091217/73c1a11b/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] translucent panel ( trans material )", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Thu Dec 17 02:47:20 2009"}
