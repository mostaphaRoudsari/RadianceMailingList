If you don't have an ambient file each rtrace process will build\nits own cache.  I'm guessing that each process spends most of the time\nbuilding the cache with a first point and the subsequent calculations are\nvery quick.  Because getting the cache to saturation is the majority of the\ncalculation time and each processor is doing this independently before\nreally getting going on the points it won't matter if you have 1 or 16\nprocessors, the simulation will take the same amount of time.\n\nTo completely turn off the ambient cache use -aa 0.  I expect you will see a\nlinear correlation between number of processes and simulation times, but the\nsim times will be much much longer.\n\nOn a side note, I'm very jealous of your 16 core mac pro!\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/17/09 8:30 PM, \"Rob Guglielmetti\" <rpg@rumblestrip.org> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -n questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Dec 17 23:09:26 2009"}
