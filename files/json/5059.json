It's not as if I wouldn't use caching normally, I just saw something that didn't make sense to me. Thanks for straightening me out.\n\nAs far as the hyperthreading, I did do some tests and it seemed to be nearly linear to 15 or so, for mkillum at least. But those weren't as controlled as the testing I did yesterday with rtrace -n. I'll have to look at that some more. Anyway thanks guys!\n\n- Rob\n\nOn Dec 18, 2009, at 8:47 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -n questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri Dec 18 08:26:43 2009"}
