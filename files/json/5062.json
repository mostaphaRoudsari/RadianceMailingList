I had forgotten about this bit of trickery near the\nzenith.  The general assumption with mkillum is that it won't be\nrelied upon for the direct component, which is why an illum is\nproduced rather than a light by default.  Once you have a non-\ndiffusing system that is relying entirely on mkillum, you're in a bit\nof trouble.  This is a key caveat that needs to be worked out somehow\nin the BSDF case....\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mkillum bsdf + sample densit", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Dec 18 10:14:28 2009"}
