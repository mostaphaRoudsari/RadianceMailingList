And your measurements suggest high diffuse\ntransmission.  Is it possible that you are confusing Td with Rd?  That would\nexplain concerns regarding inconsistent transmission values for front and\nback.\n\nAfter talking with a materials guy, I now know that it is possible for a\ncomposite material to have different absorbance depending on direction of\ntravel (ie if you have a silver coating on one side of glass, light from one\nside will pass through the glass twice while light from the other side may\nnot pass through the material at all).  So for me that is no longer a\npuzzle.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn 12/18/09 9:45 AM, \"Coralie Cauwerts\" <coralie.cauwerts@uclouvain.be>\nwrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091218/1ef01c00/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: translucent panel ( trans material )", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Fri Dec 18 10:19:23 2009"}
