Turns out, my recollection of rpict scaling was related to a different test I did, where I subdivided a view into 40 tiles and sent them off to a cluster, not to my local machine. So in that case it should have been expected that I got a linear speed-up because it was distributed to different physical cores. But I did do a test of mkillum with the -n option and I thought I saw a linear increase to 15 on my local machine. This was a little while ago and I'll have to dig it up and look closely at it, as well as do a proper test of rtrace. I'll let you know what I find out but I'm not optimistic at this point. =8-/\n\n- Rob\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -n questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri Dec 18 10:23:55 2009"}
