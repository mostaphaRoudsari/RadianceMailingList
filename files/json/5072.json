There is an even simpler method, though.  So\nlong as the ambient file was written correctly, you can append it from\nanother source using getinfo to remove the header:\n\ngetinfo - < machine2.amb >> machine1.amb\n\nIf you are concerned that one or the other ambient file may not be\ncomplete, the safer method is lookamb:\n\n(lookamb -d machine1.amb ; lookamb -h -d machine2.amb) | lookamb -r >\ncombined.amb\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Combining Ambient Files", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Dec 22 10:15:30 2009"}
