{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nA radial anisotropy is one of the easiest types to generate.  The\nvalues for the vector [ux uy uz] are variables for a reason.  These\ncan be set to [(Px-xcent) (Py-ycent) 0] for a clock face in the x-y\nplane, which may be rotated and moved wherever you like afterwards.\nTo make things even simpler, we can assume [xcent ycent] == [0 0] and\nuse:\n\nvoid metal2 brushed_around\n4 Px Py 0 .\n0\n6 .5 .5 .5 .9 .03 .12\n\nbrushed_around ring shiny_face\n0\n0\n8\n0\t0\t0\n0\t0\t1\n0\t2\n\nUsing xform, you can then move the surface into position.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Anisotropic Roughness Vector Alignment", "sender": "Gregory J.
