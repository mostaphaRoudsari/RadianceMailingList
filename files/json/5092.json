(Mind you, I haven't\ntested these functions; I only assume they work!)\n\nAlso use phisto on your falsecolor image to see the\nactual values of the black pixels. It looks like there\nis a range of \"dark grey\" instead of black. If you convert\nyour image to tiff or ppm, edit the grey values to black\nin Photoshop and convert it back you might have a\nbetter result already. I'm sure there is also a way to\ndo this with Radiance tools but I don't have one ready.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 12, 2010 at 9:09 AM, Per Haugaard <perhaugaard@yahoo.dk> wrote:\n\n*.pic files are *.hdr images.
