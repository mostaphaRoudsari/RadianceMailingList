{"body": "\nTough questions, Andy.\n\nIf you know the droplet size and density, you should be able to\ncompute the likelihood of striking a particle in one unit's distance\n(e.g., in a world coordinate system of meters: 1 unit == 1 meter).\nTo take a real example, let's say you assume spherical droplets of\n100 microns in diameter at a density of 10^5 drops per cubic meter.\nThat means that one droplet (on average) can be found in every 10^-5\nof a cubic meter.  More importantly, looking through one meter's\ndistance in this volume, your chance of encountering a droplet equals\nthe combined cross-sectional area of all the droplets in the volume\ndivided by the volume.  That is:\n\n10^5 * pi*(50e-6 meter)^2 / 1 meter^3\n\nor a 0.000785 (0.075%) probability. This is safely in the range of a\nsingle-scattering medium for an interior space, since a photon would\nneed to travel nearly a kilometer to have a 50% chance of\nencountering a droplet.\n\nYour extinction coefficient is approximately equal to the above\nprobability, i.e., the average fraction of rays scattered per unit\ndistance.  The value needs to be computed more carefully as the\ndensity*size gets larger, since we really should be computing the\nprobability of a ray *not* encountering a droplet after a unit's\ndistance, and one minus that is the extinction coefficient.  I was\ntrying to work out the exact formula, but it gets into ODE's, which\nwas one of my worst subjects in math, right after complex number\nanalysis...  It's only a problem when you get into the multiple\nscattering regime, where Radiance isn't really well-suited anymore.\n\nThe albedo for water droplets is quite high, somewhere around 0.999,\nand the H-G is about 0.84 (values taken from \"Rendering with\nRadiance,\" p. 595).  These values do not change with drop size or\ndensity.\n\nI am not sure how visibility length relates to extinction.  I did a\nquick Google search and found the following tidbit at\n<www.envirotechsensors.com>:\nSo, a daytime visibility of 0.8 meters corresponds to an extinction\ncoefficient of 3.75 m^-1, which of course is nonsense because\nextinction must be < 1.  I assume this approximation doesn't really\napply below a certain visibility distance, >> 3 in whatever units you\nhave.  Again, this relates to the problem mentioned above with\nmultiple scattering, and you need to make sure your in a single-\nscattering regime for any of this to make sense.\n\nI hope this helps.  It sure got me confused!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Deriving mist parameters", "sender": "Gregory J.
