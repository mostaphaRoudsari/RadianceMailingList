The monte carlo sampling method used by radiance is like rolling\nthe dice several times.  If your sample density is high enough your results\nfor identical simulations will exhibit minor differences.  However with a\nlow sampling density a few lucky hits or misses can skew the simulation\nresults significantly.\n\nThe radiance simulation parameters allow us to adjust the sampling density\nand other parameters to improve the correlation of the results.  Trouble is\nthere is no single set of parameter settings that works for every model.\n\nTo allow the group to best help you refine your simulation parameters you\nshould send the following:\n1 ? The radiance commands you used to run your simulation.\n2 ? The results of your simulations.\n3 ? A description of your model\n4 ? A rendering if you have one (proper etiquette is to upload the image to\na website and include a link in your email to the list).\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn 1/14/10 11:01 AM, \"Hu,Jia\" <hujia06@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100114/55926b5e/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] test fi", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Jan 14 11:37:39 2010"}
