{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nI realize this is confusing, but basically you want to put a \"void\"\npolygon in front of your opening.  Carsten is correct that the\npolygon needs to point into the room, but some other slight\nmodifications are necessary as well to work with rad, as identified\nbelow.  It is probably better just to use a pane of glass instead of\nan illum initially.\n\n\nReplace the above with simple, clear glass type:\n\nvoid glass skylight_glass\n0\n0\n3 0.96 0.96 0.96\n\n\nYou can take the illum out, as we won't need it (and the zeroes\nshouldn't be there, as Carsten mentioned).\n\n\nTake the above and put it into room3.rad, as you won't be making it\ninto an illum with mkillum.  The \"illum=\" line in your rad input file\nis for surfaces to be made into illum's, only.  Orientation doesn't\nmatter in this case.\n\n\nAs Carsten points out, you need to reverse your vertex order:\n\n# light is emitted from this \"surface\" into the room\nvoid polygon face.65\n0\n0\n12\n5.491076\t 5.213552\t 3.00000\n4.201076\t 5.213552\t 3.00000\n4.201076\t 6.503552\t 3.00000\n5.491076\t 6.503552\t 3.00000\n\n---------------\nNotice that I replaced the modifier with \"void.\"  Mkillum will take\nthis file and compute an appropriate output distribution based on the\nlight entering the space and up to 2 indirect bounces.  (This may be\nmodified by setting the \"mkillum=\" variable in rad.)\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Understanding illum correctly?", "sender": "Gregory J.
