{"body": "\nHi!\n\nDoes anybody have a license of Sun Forte C allowing him to build some\nRadiance binaries for Ultrasparc II / III?\n\nI have LOTS of trouble here to compile radiance on Solaris at all (the old\nsys_nerr, sys_errlist thing, I had to change my include files, changing only\nradiance's error.c didn't help), and the binaries produced by gcc 3.2.2\n(32bit, I didn't get it to compile radiance as 64 bit app, and I also don't\nknow if this would improve things) are not really performant. I tried the\n\"radiance-benchmerk2\" by Paul Bourke, and got results for my Ultrasparc III\nCPUs equal to P4s at the same frequencies. I hope that Sun's native compilers\nwould help here a lot.\n\nIs it worth tryiing to use Sun's optimized math libraries with radiance?\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
