Both DRADPATH and RAYPATH are defined and set in the environment variables (Control Panel - System - Advanced - Environment Variables) . It still complains that it cannot find rayinit.cal. Both DRADPATH and RAYPATH are defined under user variables as well as environment variables.\n\nMartin Moeck, ASU\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 2660 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061208/ed09d279/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Martin Moeck", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A4C91D7F128DEB4B954509D5D26FC3C202ED631C@EX03.asurite.ad.asu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Dec  9 01:22:40 2006", "email": "Martin.Moeck at asu.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RAYPATH variable in WindowsReferences: <EB65303B6C7EBA4996382AA5E0806BF47DBDF9@soleil.EEL.local>"}
