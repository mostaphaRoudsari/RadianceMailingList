{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI've been reading some previous posts related to ambient parameters\nsettings and I have some questions.\n\nWhen it is recommendable to use -aa 0 value? If I understand this\nparameter well, 0 value turns off irradiance caching, so we can use it\nwhen caching isn't needed (mkillum calculation for venetian blinds or\nrtcontrib).\nWhen we set -aa 0, does -ar have influence on minimum sampling distance,\nsince: min sampling distance = max scene dimension* aa/ar.\n\nWhen I run a rtrace calculation with -aa 0, calculation time is much\nshorter than with -aa 0.1. Why?\n\n\nHave a nice holidays :)\nMarija.\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Cvetkovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4590EBC6.8060900@bankerinter.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Dec 26 10:32:02 2006", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient accuracy parameter"}
