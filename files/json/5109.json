First off, you should not use .03 for\nspecular transmittance based on the openness factor. You should specify\nthe transmittance. Have a look at the product specs for the shadecloth;\nsomewhere there should be a reporting (however roughly it may have been\nestimated) for the transmittance of the shade.\n\nNext, even though in theory the holes are allowing light to pass straight\nthrough, there will be some scattering at that interface due to the weave\n(especially in the case of your white colored shade), so there will be\nsome diffuse component to this material. And therein lies the rub:\nfiguring out how much of a diffuse component...\n\nI recommend finding out the transmittance of the cloth, and than taking\nsome fraction of that and putting that into the diffuse transmittance\nportion of the material definition. For example, if the shade has a\ntransmittance of 20%, maybe specify Td = .05 and Ts = .15. I'd also\nrecommend getting a sample; even if you can't measure it, you could at\nleast observe it under different lighting conditions and then mix and\nmatch Td and Ts until you achieve L^ar (looks about right). =8-)\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn Thu, January 21, 2010 10:45 am, kkonis@berkeley.edu wrote:\n\n\n\n===================\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<bb2ec83d0b9282a5ace703bb6c0a6411.squirrel@calmail.berkeley.edu>", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Jan 21 10:59:39 2010"}
