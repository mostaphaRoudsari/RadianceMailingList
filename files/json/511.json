The indirect calculation depends on the no of ambient bounces -ab parameter. I have done my calcs using the following parameters...using rad and modifying -ad -as -aa .</DIV>\n<DIV>My opt file reads as below.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>-dp 1024<BR>-ar 165<BR>-ms 4.2<BR>-ds .3<BR>-dt .1<BR>-dc .5<BR>-dr 1<BR>-sj .7<BR>-st .1<BR>-ab 0<BR>-af classLS.amb<BR>-aa .15<BR>-ad 768<BR>-as 196<BR>-av 0.5 0.5 0.5<BR>-lr 6<BR>-lw .002<BR>-st .001<BR>-dj .02<BR>-ad 2048<BR>-as 1024<BR>-av 0 0 0<BR>-aa 0.10<BR>-i<BR></DIV>\n<DIV>To calculate the direct component separately at the points I think i would have to specify the ambient bounces as 0.This would remove the IRC from the total.
