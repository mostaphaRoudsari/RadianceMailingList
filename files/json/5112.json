I picked up a few\ntricks along the way.\n\nI do have one tip for you which you may have already figured out give the\ntime elapsed between your email and my reply.\n\nWhen combining your tregenza patch renderings you should use pcomb's -o\noption to use original pixel values instead of exposure adjusted values.\nThe -o option needs to precede every image, so I'm not sure if it'll work\nwith the wild card character.  Alternatively you could use pfilt -1 -e 1\nwhen resizing the tregenza patch renderings to explicitly set exposure at 1.\n\nI think this might solve the brightness issue you are having with rtcontrib\nrendered images.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn 1/17/10 6:04 AM, \"Axel Jacobs\" <jacobs.axel@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Understanding rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Jan 21 14:01:27 2010"}
