{"body": "\nMark,\n\nAwesome pictures.  What are the limitations of your low -ad and high over sampling approach?  When is appropriate and when is it not appropriate?\n\nProbably not something you are concerned about in your work, but when you use such a low -ad setting and such a high over sampling rate, I'd like to know what effect there is on overall light level accuracy in a typical interior space with daylighting and/or electric lighting?\n\nI guess there is no over sampling on an rtrace calculation, but for an irradiance calculation image, my -ad setting is usually in the thousands and my ambient bounces are at 4 or so (depending on the results of a parameter test)  I'm guessing the -ab and -ad parameters can't be reduced if light level accuracy is important.  Maybe I'm wrong?  Sure would be nice to slash some of those crazy calculation times.\n\nMark\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20061228/983a4aba/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<45939571.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec 28 17:00:25 2006", "email": "MdelaFuente at wmtao.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient accuracy parameter"}
