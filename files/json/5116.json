Maybe\nonly for thin sheet metal with large perforations. Otherwise BRTD is\nrequired. Would you agree?\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nHi,\n\nfabrics will have a certain incident cut-off angle, where specular\ntransmission gets completely eliminated due to geometric constraint. You\ncan observe it with your eyes.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4B59CB34.6020101@gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
