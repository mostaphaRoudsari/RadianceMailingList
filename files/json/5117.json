I clearly out-smarted myself\nwith the image compression.\n\nAlthough there is some new material, I mostly re-wrote what was already\nthere. The document should be much more readable (it has real sentences\nin it now) and consistent.\n\nI am rather pleased with the result so far, but also have to admit that\nI am somewhat shocked about the sheer size of the document. And I am\nless than half-way through the exercises.\n\nAnyhow, I hope that you all enjoy the read, and that it proves to be as\ninformative to you as it has been for myself. Stay tuned.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Understanding rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri Jan 22 16:26:27 2010"}
