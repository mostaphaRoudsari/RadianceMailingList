You can use a RIF-file\nwhen you pass its name to rad as a command line argument, e.g.\n\nbash#rad myRenderings.rif\n\nNow rad would read in the setting, and call the commands necessary to do\nall calculations as defined in the RIF-file.\n\nIf you call rtrace, the rtrace-options apply. rtrace does not know\nanything about the existance of you RIF-file. The file name of the\nRIF-file does not appear on the command line you posted - how should\nrtrace know to use it?\n\nHow did you arrive at the ambient parameters you are using? Especially\nar 32 combined with very high ad amd as? Did you consider scene size and\nlevel of detail / irradiance variance?\n\nCheers Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"INDIRECE\"in .rif fi", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
