{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\n\nYes, that looks about right, except that the threshold between front\nand back reflectance is 0.005 (0.5%), rather than 0.05.\n\n\nDoes sound strange.  You wouldn't happen to have the Optics5 output\non hand you could send me?\n\n\nHmmm.  I see the problem, but there's not much I can do to fix it,\nbecause rcalc uses the underscore character to find the end of the\nname.  I guess you just have to manually edit the Optics5 output to\neliminate the underscores in the middle of names.  I could probably\ncome up with a sed script to do it if it's really a problem.\n\n\nYes, the basic model is only really valid for single-layer glazings.\nThe glaze.csh script sponsored by Visarc is more flexible (and\naccurate).\n\n-Greg\n", "replyTo": "<45951359.7070900@bankerinter.net>", "sender": "Gregory J.
