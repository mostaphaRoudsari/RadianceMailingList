{"body": "\nMarija,\n\nI use -aa 0 for models which contain massive amounts of detail\nand for which computing and storing enough ambient points would\nquickly run me out of memory. The first scene to require this was\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/p36.html\n\nbut I have used it on most of my work since then.\n\nI did a little work with -aa 0 before this and found that\noversampling combined with low -ad could produce good images. I\nmade a page showing the results:\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html\n\nI hope this helps you.\n\nMark\nmstock@umich.edu\n\nOn Wed, 27 Dec 2006, Marija Cvetkovic wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient accuracy parameter", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0612271242010.5654@zaxxon.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": ["<4590EBC6.8060900@bankerinter.net>", "<A4C91D7F128DEB4B954509D5D26FC3C202ED6407@EX03.asurite.ad.asu.edu>", "<459239E9.5040709@bankerinter.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Dec 27 18:45:36 2006", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ambient accuracy parameter"}
