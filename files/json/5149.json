{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nI hoping someone can help me with my understanding of illum sources.\nI've read RwR, done the tutorials, etc., and I think I'm OK with the\nconcept of secondary sources. All of the examples I've seen make illums\naround windows and skylights. My situation is slightly different - I\nhave a skylight that is not flush with the interior of the space (i.e.\nthere is a well, the insides of which are painted white).\n\n\n-----------   <-- skylight glass\n|         |\n|         |   <-- well\n|         |\n|         |\n--\t __    ---------------  <-- ceiling of room\n\\\n\\\n-------------------- illum\n\n<- room ->\n\n\nMy intention is to make an illum at the ceiling of the room, which\nincorporates the bounces that the light takes to get into the room.\nUsing the files below I've been able to simulate the skylight and the\nresults look pretty reasonable. However, when I run the simulation using\nrad, I get the error message 'warning - no light sources found'. From\nreading Axel Jacobs' excellent tutorials I was imagining that this\nmessage would go away with the illums.\n\nAny comments/tips/pointers would be great.\n\nCheers,\n\nMark Shewfelt\nEnermodal Engineering Ltd.\nKitchener Ontario Canada\n\n\nskylight.rif:\n------------------------------\nscene = sky.rad\nscene = material.mat\nscene = room3.rad\nillum = skylight.rad\n# The file in which to store indirect values\nAMB= simple.amb\nINDIRECT = 2\nmkillum= -ab 2\n\n\nmaterial.mat:\n------------------------------\nskyfunc brightfunc window_dist\n2 winxmit winxmit.cal\n0\n0\n\nwindow_dist glass skylight_glass\n0\n0\n3\t0.8\t0.8\t0.8\n\n# light is emitted from this but is invisible.\nvoid illum skylight_illum\n0\n0\n3\t0\t0\t0\n\nskylight.rad\n------------------------------\n# light enters skylight well from here\nskylight_glass polygon skylight_window\n0\n0\n12\n5.491076\t 6.503552\t 3.400000\n\n4.201076\t 6.503552\t 3.400000\n\n4.201076\t 5.213552\t 3.400000\n\n5.491076\t 5.213552\t 3.400000\n\n# light is emitted from this \"surface\" into the room\nskylight_illum polygon face.65\n0\n0\n12\n5.491076\t 6.503552\t 3.00000\n\n4.201076\t 6.503552\t 3.00000\n\n4.201076\t 5.213552\t 3.00000\n\n5.491076\t 5.213552\t 3.00000\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Understanding illum correctly?", "sender": "Mark Shewfelt", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB65303B6C7EBA4996382AA5E0806BF47DBDF4@soleil.EEL.local>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec  7 22:26:16 2006", "email": "MShewfelt at enermodal.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Understanding illum correctly?"}
