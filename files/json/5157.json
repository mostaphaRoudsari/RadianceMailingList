{"body": "\nHi Jacob,\n\nIt's difficult to answer your question without knowing anything about\nIESve or what it permits.  You also didn't specify what you mean by\n\"glass blinds.\"  Is this just a window with some odd coating(s) on\nit, or does it have some structure?  Is there some way to give a\nRadiance material description to IESve directly?  When is your deadline?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling glass lamellas in Radiance.", "sender": "Gregory J.
