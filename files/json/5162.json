{"body": "\nHi all,\nI should simulate a screen material with highly specular reflection\n(0.8) at one side like aluminized matrial  an a totally diffuse\ntransmission of  about 0.1.\nThe parameter of spec for trans material isn't described very well in\n'Rendering with Radiance' so I couldn't understand it. Does a numer of 1\nspec means a totally specularity for diffuse and direct light ? If so\nshould I use somthing like this:\n\nscreen trans spec-diff_80-10\n0 0 7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0\n\ncorrect? Or does anybody know a BRTDfunc material definition for this\nissue?\n\nThanks for help!\n\nFriedemann Kik\nTranssolar Stuttgart\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070126/a11b74ea/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Friedemann Kik", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF092788@webmail.transsolar.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 26 12:38:48 2007", "email": "kik at transsolar.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trans material"}
