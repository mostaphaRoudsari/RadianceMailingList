{"body": "\nHi Friedemann,\n\nThe trans material is indeed a bit confusing (no offense Greg:)). We did\na validation last year for a translucent material along with some\nmeasurements of a real material. Maybe you'll find the paper useful:\nReinhart C F, Andersen M, \"Development and validation of a Radiance\nmodel for a translucent panel\", Energy and Buildings 38:7 pp. 890-904,\n2006.\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/fulltext/nrcc48165/nrcc48165.pdf\n\nAlso, you might want to have a look at\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html to bette undrstand\nthe trans material.\n\nChristoph\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nFriedemann Kik\nSent: Friday, January 26, 2007 6:39 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi all,\nI should simulate a screen material with highly specular reflection\n(0.8) at one side like aluminized matrial  an a totally diffuse\ntransmission of  about 0.1.\nThe parameter of spec for trans material isn't described very well in\n'Rendering with Radiance' so I couldn't understand it. Does a numer of 1\nspec means a totally specularity for diffuse and direct light ? If so\nshould I use somthing like this:\n\nscreen trans spec-diff_80-10\n0 0 7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0\n\ncorrect? Or does anybody know a BRTDfunc material definition for this\nissue?\n\nThanks for help!\n\nFriedemann Kik\nTranssolar Stuttgart\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070126/81ff9c20/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans material", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C3962029D8924@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 26 14:14:21 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trans material"}
