{"body": "\nHi Juan,\n\nThere is a radiance algorithm for modelling the SSLD (new CIE general\nsky model) distributions.  It was developed a few years ago now, and is\na bit clunky, but works fine.\n\nI'll send it to you off the list.\n\nCheers,\nPhil.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Juan\nPosada\nSent: 29 January 2007 16:44\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nHello,\n\nI am just starting to use Radiance and I would like to use it to\nsimulate different luminance sky distributions. I am particularly\ninterested in generating some of the new CIE general sky distributions\n(there are 15; cf Darula and Kittler \"CIE general sky standard defining\nluminance distributions\").\n\nI found that the \"gensky\" program can generate a Radiance description of\nthe sky, but gensky appear to be limited to the three classic CIE\nstandards (clear day, overcast, intermediate).  Is there another program\nthat could be used to generate these new standards?\n\nThank you!\n\nJuan\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6ED05107D715BD48BEA0EFABD1D082D40365B5B1@ldcexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jan 29 18:36:14 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Sky Distribution Simulations"}
