On the other hand, if you change the extension to .txt and force it to open with Excel, it doesn't do the formatting as you'd like it. For correct display of the text files in Excel 2007 try the Data menu tab, Text To Columns function. I forget what it's called in Excel 2003 and older, but I believe still in the data menu.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tuesday, February 16, 2010 5:37 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nfirstly, thank you so much for your help! Iv been working on that for a while now and that really moved me forwards..\n\nJust one more quick question, the .dat file I get outputs just a list of lux levels, how do you export this into a tst file? or at least seperate the values by a comma as then I could import it into excel..as when i just change the file name to txt the list of numbers converts to just a long string of numbers which aren't separated in any way..\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] thank you!", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Tue Feb 16 07:00:46 2010"}
