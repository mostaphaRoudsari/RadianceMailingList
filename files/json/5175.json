{"body": "\nJust a minor correction from what Thomas wrote...\n\n\nActually, the \"glass\" primitive does correctly model reflection and\ntransmittance changes as a function of angle, and it is possible to\nalter the index of refraction.  However, I don't think it's\nreasonable to set an index of refraction high enough to get a\nreflectance of 31% as Jacob specified.\n\n\nCorrect.  But you can apply a pattern such as \"winxmit.cal\" to\nincorporate the influence of incident angle.\n\n-Greg\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling glass lamellas in Radiance.", "sender": "Gregory J.
