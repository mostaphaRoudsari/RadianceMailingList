I think this is another report buried\nin a box somewhere in my basement, but it's probably not worth digging\nout.  Although the work was well-done by Anat, it compares a very old\nversion of Radiance to Superlite, and in it I seem to remember we\ndiscovered the problem of not subdividing large area sources (such as\nwindows) for nearby points.  This led to the creation of the -ds\noption.  Otherwise, the programs were in fair agreement.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Grynberg, part", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Feb 22 09:32:58 2010"}
