You\ncan run the individual programs from the Windows command prompt. The\nexecutables should be located in C:\\Radiance3.9\\bin\\.\n\nIf you installed Radiance the Unix way check where the binaries have\nbeen installed. The should be in \"/usr/local/bin\" (path within cygwin)\nor perhaps somewhere in \"/opt\". Search for a file called \"oconv\" in\nthese directories. Here is a command that will help:\n\nfind /usr/local -name oconv\n\n(replace \"/usr/lcoal\" if you want to search somewhere else). If that\ndoes not return a path to oconv then your installation was probably\nnot successful. Please provide more details about your installation\nprocess.\n\nIf you get a path from that try to use the full path in your command at first:\n\n/usr/local/bin/oconv room.rad > test.oct\n\nIf that works you just have to set your PATH environment variable to\ninclude /usr/local/bin. You probably also have to set RAYPATH to help\nRadiance find commonly used files.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Tue, Feb 23, 2010 at 2:11 PM, Brajesh Lal <brajeshlal@yahoo.com> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] bash : oconv: command not found", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Feb 23 07:00:05 2010"}
