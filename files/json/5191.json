There is a program www.squ1.com called EcoTect that allows you to\nconduct overshadowing studies and select shadow colors for different\nobjects. A demo is available for download at www.squ1.com. Also, EcoTect\nmodels can be exported to Radiance.\n\nEmail me offline if you'd like to discuss further.\n\nBest,\nJohn\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMessage: 1\nMessage-ID:\n\n<mailman.0.1170932402.13296.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nContent-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"us-ascii\"\n\n\nDear All,\n\nI am trying to complete some overshadowing comparisons between an\nexisting and proposed buildings. I would like to generate a single set\nof time based images to show the extent of any additional shading from\nthe proposed compared to the existing situation.\n\nI would like to be able to highlight the shadows from each building in a\ndifferent colour. I could run the simulations twice, for each building\nwith a bias on the rgb of the sun and combine the images, but I am not\nsure whether this would work.\n\nCan anyone provide me with some guidance.\n\nMany thanks\n\nNickd\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 36, Issue 5\n***********************************************\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE:Colouring shadows", "sender": "nick@nickdevlinassociates.co.uk", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C3962029D8979@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 8 Feb 2007 08:15:41 -0000", "email": "\"Nick Devlin\"", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Colouring shadowsTo: <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>"}
