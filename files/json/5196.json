{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nI'm not quite sure how your scene is set up, but I'll try to respond...\n\n\nJust generally, there's not much point in adding dedicated occluders,\nunless your scene contains a lot of octree or mesh instances, which\naren't included in the standard occluder cache.\n\n\nAny sources of type \"glow\" are already blocked by intervening \"illum\"\nsurfaces.  Therefore, additional occluders shouldn't make any\ndifference.\n\n\nVery little -- just the sun left as a light source, and testing\nagainst a single source is generally faster than any shenanigans.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Occluder cache application?", "sender": "Gregory J.
