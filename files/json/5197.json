I usually\nexport the 3ds by layername, so that all objects (triangles then) from\none layer become one object. In Blender, I only have to select one by\none (but the number of objects is limited to the number of layers, so\nthat is fine) and de-triangulate the surfaces of the objects. Finally I\nexport the whole model as OBJ - which is supported in Radiance almost as\nwell as the native scene language ;-)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Preparing an open DXF file for import", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
