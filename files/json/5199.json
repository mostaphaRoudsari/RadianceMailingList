Since the direct horizontal is proportional to the\nsine of the solar altitude, and this goes to zero as the sun nears the\nhorizon, the corresponding radiance of the sun has to increase\ndramatically to compensate.\n\nA more realistic scenario would have the direct horizontal component\ndropping to zero as the sun reaches the horizon.  My guess is that\nyour weather files aren't calibrated properly to the hour, or their\ndirect measurements actually include a significant diffuse component.\n\nDoes anyone else have experience with this?\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Annual illuminance simulation anoma", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Feb 26 16:16:34 2010"}
