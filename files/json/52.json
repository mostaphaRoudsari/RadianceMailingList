E.g. if\nI want to map onto a cylinder, I know that there is a cal-file, but I\ndon't really understand this. Now, maybe I should try, but I just found\na set of tools called panotools (www.panotools.org), which is able to\nconvert bitmap-files from different projections. Would it be possible to\nuse it to create imagefiles that could be mapped onto e.g. a radiance\ncylinder without any further calculations, just like mapping iot onto a\nplane? I would really like to have pic-files that don't need any further\ncalculations.\n\nSo, maybe someone tried something like this before? Or am I completely\nwrong with this?\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Mon, 19 Nov 2001 23:46:39 +0100"}
