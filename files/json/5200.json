If you're following the documentation in \"Weather\nData Information\" on\nhttp://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_format_def.cfm\nthen the columns are counted 1,2,3,4,5,flags,6,7,... so that it easy to\nget confused. It's also likely that the script which you have written\ncounts the fields starting with 0, not 1 like in the documentation.\n\nCan you let us know which date your processing that produces the evening\nspike?\n\nThirdly, have you considered using gendaylit instead of gensky?\ngendaylit works really well with the Abu Dhabi data, and only produces\none error in the entire year (not counting a dozen or so 'zenith\nwarnings'). This probably means that the sky conditions in Abu Dhabi are\nrather Californian (or British ;-)\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Annual illuminance simulation anoma", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Sat Feb 27 12:53:21 2010"}
