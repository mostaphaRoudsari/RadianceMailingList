{"body": "\nHI all,\nI am new to this site, I have a question to whoever might help;\nI have seen that it is possible to visualize contour lines over a set\nreference working plane without it necessarily being an object or surface,\nie a desk. It would be great to be able to visualize analyses over reference\nplanes throughout a room or a space.\nDoes anybody have a clue how could I do this?\n\nThanks a lot,\nSimon\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nPush the button!
