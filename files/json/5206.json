{"body": "\nHi again,\n\nThank you so much. I got the file to be added finally. One question\nis that, after new types were added to supported surface types, then,\nwhen I select the glazing type, it exits as \"Missing -.\"       I\nselected one clear glass layer (1) and another was from the glazing.dat\nwhich was just added.
