{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nhm, genrad, not part of the radiance distribution? Is it genrad from\nthat old CAD-integration project?\n\n\nJust add a line at the beginning of the window's scene description:\n\n#@mkillum s=16 d=8\n\nAs for specifying different av settings for the windows, I guess things\nwill get really complicated when you want to automate the mkillum\nprocesses. You can specify the mkillum settings in the input file, but\nwhat you want to set (av, ar, ...) are the rtrace parameters that\nmkillums uses when starting rtrace processes.\n\nDo you really need different av's? I'd increase the overall ambient\naccuracy, set a high ab (not needed for the outer windows, but it is not\nso important in rendering times if only used for the illum generation).\n\nGood luck! Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum settings - borrowed light", "sender": "Lars O.
