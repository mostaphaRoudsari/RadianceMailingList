If you create the former, you can refer to it as the\nlatter.  It will still show up with the case you created it with, but\nthe system silently ignores case when you refer to it.  You can't have\nboth \"Foo.dat\" and \"fOo.dat\" in the same directory -- creating the\nlatter would overwrite the former.\n\nThis has nothing to do with what goes into a bash script, or how\nrpiece gets its options.  Only on older Windows systems is case\nignored in the command line itself.  I don't know when that stopped\nbeing true, but I don't think that's true any longer.\n\nI am as puzzled by the behavior you're seeing as everyone else.\nWithout having all your files and scripts, though, it's pretty\ndifficult to reproduce.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpiece error", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Mar  5 07:40:49 2010"}
