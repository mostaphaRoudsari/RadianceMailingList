{"body": "\nHi Siritip,\n\nHmm, ok I guess this is another vagary of input for glaze.csh. I got the\nsame error that you did. In order to fix this (without messing with the\nscript), I made sure that all decimal units are expressed in the form\n\"x.x\" as opposed to \".x\", thus I added 0 to the front of decimals units\n\".x\". Now it seems to work.\n\n-Jack\n\nsiritip@umich.edu wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glaze.csh header and input format", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<45D46A79.6000904@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<20070215085318.g2lezrzi9sw00k8o@web.mail.umich.edu>"], "datetime": "Thu Feb 15 15:13:47 2007", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Glaze.csh header and input format"}
