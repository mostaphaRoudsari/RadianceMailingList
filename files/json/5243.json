If it is purely specular, or has a purely specular\ncomponent, it gets a bit more complicated and you'd have to use the\nmirror type, but mkillum would still work so long as the surfaces are\nflat.  The photon mapping method really only applies when your\nsurfaces are both highly specular and curved, which I don't think is\nthe case, here.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] radiance programer in Chicag", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Mar  6 09:24:26 2010"}
