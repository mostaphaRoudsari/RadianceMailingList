The fact is, all of us have day jobs, and\nno one knows how publishing works (other than the publishers).\nCreating a new printing of a book, even a reprinting, somehow requires\nsmall, meaningless (to us) changes in the ISBN and/or Library of\nCongress number, which we don't know how to do.  Rob Shakespeare has\nlined up a new printer, but they need to secure the rights from the\nold printer, and none of us are sure what's going on with that, either.\n\nI'll use this as a reminder to get on it again, and if we can't\nresolve it by Summer, I think we'll just release the PDF to the world\nand solve it that way.  It's my least favorite solution, but at least\nit is a solution.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"Rendering with Radiance\" (non-)availabilit", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun Mar  7 09:40:37 2010"}
