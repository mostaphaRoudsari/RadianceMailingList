{"body": "\n\nDear All,\n\nI am trying to complete some overshadowing comparisons between an existing\nand proposed buildings. I would like to generate a single set of time based\nimages to show the extent of any additional shading from the proposed\ncompared to the existing situation.\n\nI would like to be able to highlight the shadows from each building in a\ndifferent colour. I could run the simulations twice, for each building with\na bias on the rgb of the sun and combine the images, but I am not sure\nwhether this would work.\n\nCan anyone provide me with some guidance.\n\nMany thanks\n\nNickd\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Devlin", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<mailman.0.1170922546.337.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Feb  8 09:15:46 2007", "email": "nick at nickdevlinassociates.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Colouring shadows"}
