{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\n\nBack in the day when memory was not quite so cheap as it is now,\nkeeping an entire floating-point buffer for an image, as would be\nrequired for luminance queries off the standard input, seemed\nunreasonable.  I could copy the standard input to a file and read\nback from that, but it seemed rather too much trouble for a feature\nthat may or may not be used in a particular invocation.\n\nIn other words, ximage tone-maps the floating-point (RGBE) input data\ninto an (at most) 24-bit/pixel buffer to be used for display.\nStoring the original image as well would take more than twice the\nmemory, and as I said, it was not so cheap when ximage was written.\n\nI hope this clarifies matters.  A lot of what is in Radiance is\nshowing its age in terms of the trade-offs made.  On the positive\nside, I did not encode many limits, so cheap memory has meant larger\nand larger models we can render.  Being stingy has its rewards, too.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: pcomb photometrically correct", "sender": "Gregory J.
