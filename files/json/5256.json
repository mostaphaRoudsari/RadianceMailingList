The different users are a pain - but not always easily resolved.\nIt seems that ranimate was designed to handle different users (at\nleast by the provision of the host username parameter) though I\nhave not looked at the source code.\n2. I had the same errors to a different remote workstation with the\nsame user name just a different folder location due to the mount\ncommand!\n3. I suspected there might be a 'environment' error with ssh not\nrunning the .bashrc - will check that out. From the errors, it\nappears that the rpict program was found and run - maybe this is a\nbogus error. Will check tonight after resolving the ssh 'environment'.\n\n--\n\nRegards\n\nTerrance Mc Minn\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100309/c3cd6bd1/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "datetime": "Mon Mar  8 19:19:52 2010"}
