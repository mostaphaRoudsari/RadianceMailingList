Can you advise what is the rmake you used to\nproduce your Mac OS X (10.4 Universal)binaries. The standard makeall\ninstall that I used:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec make \"SPECIAL=ogl\" \\\n\"OPT=-O2\" \\\n\"MACH=-DBSD -DNOSTEREO -Dfreebsd -I/usr/X11R6/include\n-L/usr/X11R6/lib \" \\\nARCH=Intel \"COMPAT=\" \\\nINSTDIR=/Applications/ray/bin \\\nLIBDIR=/Applications/ray/lib \\\nESUFFIX= \\\nCC=cc CONFIGURE_ARCH=i386 \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\nonly works on my Snow Leopard 10.6.2\n\nBy the way I was able to use Xcode to make an intel universal version of\nSimon Crone's genrad program, but can not figure the correct settings\nfor the makeall script.\n\nIf you don't have the information then I will make up a install pkg\nusing the 10.4 tar.gz from radiance-online.\n\nHave you thought about putting a standard install package together for\nMac OSX on the website? I have been playing with the xcode PackageMaker\napp which seems relatively easy to conjure up and is ideal for the\ncomplete novice to install.\n\n--\n\nRegards\n\nTerrance Mc Minn\nSchool of Built Environment\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nPhone: 08 9266 7175\nFax: 08 9266 2711\nE-mail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\n\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J (WA) 02637B (NSW)\n\nThis email, including any attached files, may contain confidential\ninformation for the sole use of the intended recipient(s).
