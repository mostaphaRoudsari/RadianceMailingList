{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm running a simulation with rtrace, where I've set -I to compute\nirradiance rather than radiance values.\n\nThough reading the man pages, I do find the explanations of the flags\nsomewhat confusing:\n\n\n\n-i\n\nBoolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance values. This only\naffects the final result, substituting a Lambertian surface and multiplying\nthe radiance by pi. Glass and other transparent surfaces are ignored during\nthis stage. Light sources still appear with their original radiance values,\nthough the -dv option (below) may be used to override this.
