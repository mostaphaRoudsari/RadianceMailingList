{"body": "\nJelle.\n\nAs Giullio has already explained\n\n-i    will return the value for a 'light meter' at (x,y,z) pointing in\ndirection (dx,dy,dz)\nOnly that one point will be calculated.\n\n-I    will return the value for virtual light meter at (x,y,z) pointing\nin direction (dx,dy,dz)\nbut it will sample the whole hemisphere around the direction\nvector.\nBasically rtrace introduces a virtual plane and turns the 'virtual\nlight meter' around\nto get the value of a point on this plane. You have to increase\n-ab by 1 to get the\nsame number of effective bounces as with '-i'.\n\nTry a simple scene with both options and low -ab values (0,1,2).\n\nIf you print origin and direction of the rtrace ray as well you will see\nthat '-I' changes\nthem. Quite confusing if you're not prepared for it.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Jelle\nFeringa / EZCT Architecture & Design Research\nSent: 02 March 2007 14:38\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHi,\n\n\n\nI'm running a simulation with rtrace, where I've set -I to\ncompute irradiance rather than radiance values.\n\nThough reading the man pages, I do find the explanations of the\nflags somewhat confusing:\n\n\n\n-i\n\nBoolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance\nvalues. This only affects the final result, substituting a Lambertian\nsurface and multiplying the radiance by pi. Glass and other transparent\nsurfaces are ignored during this stage. Light sources still appear with\ntheir original radiance values, though the -dv option (below) may be\nused to override this. This option is especially useful in conjunction\nwith ximage (1) for computing illuminance at scene points.\n\n\n\n-I\n\nBoolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance, with\nthe input origin and direction interpreted instead as measurement point\nand orientation.\n\n\n\nIn what cases should one use the -i flag and in which cases is\n-I the preferred option?\n\nI find it hard to make the distinction from the docs.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n-jelle\n\n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
