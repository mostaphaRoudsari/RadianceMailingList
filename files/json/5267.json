{"body": "\nI guess the man page is pretty confusing.  The '-i' option sends a\nray into the scene, just as rpict would for generating an image or\nrtrace would for generating a radiance value, but then computes the\nincident irradiance at that surface point rather than the radiance.\nIn other words, it makes most surfaces (with the exception of glass\nmaterials) look perfectly diffuse, with a normalization factor that\ncomputes irradiance.\n\nThe '-I' option, which is only supported by rtrace, changes the\nnotion of the input to be interpreted as an illuminance measurement\npoint as Guilio said, rather than a ray origin and direction.  This\nmakes it convenient for placing virtual irradiance meters anywhere in\nyour scene.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -i -I flags", "sender": "Gregory J.
