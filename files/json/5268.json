I don't have it fully working yet, but I do have useful\nradiance geometry exports that i can use with our existing radiance\n(linux) setup. Now I just need to get results back into SketchUp. I see\nthat su2rad can import \"numeric results,\" but what format are these\nsupposed to be? I'm not running radiance from sketchup yet, but I ought\nto be able to reformat the results I do have to view in SketchUp (if\nit's plain text). Can anyone out there tell me what file type/format I\nneed to be using, and maybe send a sample file so I can see the\ncontents? Or do I really need to get the windows-based radiance side of\nthings up and running? I may be trying to put a square peg into a round\nhole...\n\nThanks,\nCmamer\n--\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth@transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth@transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in\nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100312/398da88c/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Cramer Silkworth", "datetime": "Fri Mar 12 14:11:35 2010"}
