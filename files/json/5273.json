However the patches where\nwritten for an old version of PIL (1.3) and do not\nwork for current versions.\n\nDepending on what you want to do with it you could\ntry another HDR toolkit or just call the Radiance\np-binaries (pvalue, phisto etc) in your Python scripts.\n\nRight now I don't know whether ImageMagick does support\nRadiance RGBE format and - if it does - what you could do\nwith it.\n\nThomas\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
