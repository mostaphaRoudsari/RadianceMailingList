Mine was pre-installed, I think.  There is a\nsymbolic link from /usr/lib/X11R6 to X11 (in the same directory) on my\nmachine, but I'm not sure how it got there.  There are only dynamic\nversions of the X11 libraries near as I can tell, so static linking\nfor the purposes of binary distribution isn't supported.\n\nRob G's suggestion to recompile yourself is probably best.  Sorry I'm\nnot more help.  Anyone else have a solution?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 4.0 releas", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Mar 17 21:18:56 2010"}
