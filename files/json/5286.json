I am looking for a way to merge\nthem and to be able to adjust their intensity. I tried to load them into\nPhotoshop, but I am not sure how to overlay (lighten?) them, and the\nPhotoshop layers are not working.\n\n\n\nAre there programs where I can easily do that (The one I know  is\nVivaldi from Zumtobel - is that any good?)? If I can do this in\nPhotoshop, how can I put the images onto different layers to be able to\nmix them? How can I produce a little animation of fading in and out of\ntwo images?\n\n\n\nThanks for your help\n\n\n\nAnselm\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100318/e0537c2e/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Anselm von Held", "datetime": "Thu Mar 18 03:10:08 2010"}
