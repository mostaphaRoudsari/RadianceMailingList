If you add the -s switch in gensurf\nyou can get\n<br>a smooth shaded surface. Is there any way I can insert this smoothing\nto a surface\n<br>that I have imported from AutoCAD? I do not want to increase the polygon\ncount but\n<br>i do want to smooth out the faceted glare on the surface.\n<p>Any ideas about this?</blockquote>\nsurface smooting is done by gensurf with a cal file that manipulates the\nsurface normal across\n<br>a generated polygon.
