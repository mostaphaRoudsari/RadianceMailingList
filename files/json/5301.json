{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI want to define a material with colorpict pattern, and I plan to use\nnon calibrated digital photos of a material sample taken by ordinary\ncamera.\nIf I know the average reflectance of the real material (r ,g ,b) is the\nmaterial defined with next procedure physically correct:\n1)normalize photos average brightness with normpat\n2)use it in a colorpict primitive:\nvoid colorpict pattern1\n7 red green blue picture_norm.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v\n\n1 A1\n\n3)define basic material with the average grey reflectance as a real material:\nvoid plastic mat1\n\n\n5 grey(r,g,b) grey(r,g,b) grey(r,g,b) 0 0\n\n4) define alias:\npattern1 alias mat_with_pat material1\n\nI've read previous posts on similar topics, but most of the images\nmentioned were already calibrated, so I'm not sure if resulting\nmaterial in my example would have appropriate appearance (pattern) and\nstill appropriate reflectance (basic material). Of course I don't\nexpect to obtainr 100% accurate reflectance in each point of the\nmaterial :)\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "cveleglg@bankerinter.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20070326091746.hxvmfvkis04csc4c@webmail.bankerinter.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Mar 26 09:17:53 2007", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Colorpict question"}
