Not sure what you mean by \"it\" was developed in 1994. Are you using pre-compiled binaries, or some kind of rpm distribution? If so, I doubt you have gendaylit installed, as this was included in the Radiance source distribution only recently. Gendaylit has been around a while, but prior to the new Radiance release, you had to go get it and compile it yourself. If you are compiling from source, then you could grab the latest official release (announced very recently) and compile, and you'd have it.\n\nAt any rate, it's worth seeking it out one way or another because you can use it for precisely what you're talking about.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn Mar 25, 2010, at 10:56 PM, Jia Hu wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100325/5b098d57/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gensk", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Mar 25 22:05:48 2010"}
