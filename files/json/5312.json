If just the distribution and intensity, and you are looking at an LED luminaire or lamp that has been tested per IES LM-79 and you have a properly formatted (IES LM-63) .ies file as a result, then yes, the process is the same as for fluorescent. Simply create radiance lights with ies2rad for your two (or more) luminaires, and color balance by defining them all as \"white\" light sources (with the -t option in ies2rad).\n\nOn Mar 27, 2010, at 10:15 AM, ??????? ??????????? wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] LED simulati", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sat Mar 27 09:21:06 2010"}
