{"body": "\nHow does Ecotect deal with mkillum?\n\nMartin\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wed 3/28/2007 1:52 PM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nI'd bet in ECOTECT 5.5 (not ver 5.2) plus the Radiance 3.7 compiled for\nwindows by F. Anselmo! Radiance binaries compiled with Mingw32 for\nwindows, look in:\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=3Dmodload&name=3DDownloads=\n&file=3Dindex&req=3Dgetit&lid=3D12\n\nEcotect 5.5 is very fast and easy to model and run daylighting\nsimulations. Model your atrium, after that call RADIANCE Export Toll\nand voila.\nECOTECT has a very good interface trough RADtool, they run smooth and\nyou'll have very precise images and analyses.\nIf possible, forget Desktop Radiance.\n\nRegards to all, from Brasil\n\n[vangelis]\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Do you think Ecotech 5.5 with Desktop Radiance control panel (the\nnewest version ) is the right tool to do my atrium research? I like using it\nfor its clear GUI, but if it could finish similar work and achieve the same\nresults as its UNIX/LINUX brother?\n\n2.  I think a lot of complex atrium roofs have to be researched and\nconstructed in my project, if UNIX/LINUX Radiance is the most suitable tool?\nIf Linux version is good, could I use the Radiance on Cygwin Environment?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 3508 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070328/bd941a9a/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Evangelo", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A4C91D7F128DEB4B954509D5D26FC3C202ED683D@EX03.asurite.ad.asu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Mar 29 01:05:36 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Evangelos", "subject": "[Radiance-general] simulating an atrium"}
