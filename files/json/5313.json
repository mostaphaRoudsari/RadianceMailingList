{"body": "\nHi,\n\njust to add it to the list of options, take a look at Rayfront\n(www.schorsch.com) which is a great cross platform tool to both organize\nyour project and have a nice GUI for everything you want. There is a\ndemo available on the site, so you can try it out.\n\nSecond, as you mentioned that you have to simulate a lot of atriums.\nThis sounds a bit like a lot of serial and scriptable work. Having a\nLinux machine and learning some bash scripting may be more useful here\nthen clicking in GUIs. If you follow some conventions in you models\n(e.g. material/layer names, units, filenames...) then you could automate\na lot of work and concentrate on modeling and interpreting the results\ninstead of starting simulations from a GUI a hundred times. I personally\nlike to use make for such stuff, but there are lots of options.\n\nA, and of course, scripting on a Mac is the same as on Linux, Solaris\netc., I am working most of the time on an old Powerbook and send the\nbigger processes to some Linux machines (which are faster and better\ncooled big pentium4s in my case). So I can actually share the club of\nthose encouraging you to set up some nice OS X environment for this\nproject ;-)\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance tool and Atrium daylight simulation", "sender": "Lars O.
