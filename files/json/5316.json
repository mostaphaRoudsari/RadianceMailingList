I\nspent more time learning Linux than radiance, and everyone knows, you\nneed lots of time to learn the latter!  When Greg Ward mentioned that\nthe latest version of radiance compiled on his mac (December 2001), I\nshot him an email asking for more info about this new Mac OS that could\ncompile c code!  True to form, Greg obliged with lots of info, pointers,\netc.  A couple weeks later I had a PowerBook and a working Radiance\ninstallation (a fast one, I might add) and was rpicting to my heart's\ncontent.\n\nFive years and one laptop upgrade later, I'm still quite happy.\nEspecially for a one-machine solution, the Mac is a great way to go.  As\nGiulio pointed out, if you have to have AutoCAD (or any other\nWindows-based program) you can run Parallels on the Intel-based\nMacBooks/MacBook Pros; it's really great.  And you'll find all kinds of\ninteresting tips, tools and tricks with Radiance on this mailing list,\nmany of which require compiling code, or running a shell script, or\nwhatever.  This is all so much easier on OSX since a full, compliant\nUNIX subsystem lies underneath the pretty desktop interface of OSX.\n\nOf course you can get more horsepower for your dollar with a homebuilt\nAMD solution running Linux.  If budget is the driving force, then you\nmay want to consider that route, and others on the list here can offer\nsome advice in that arena.  Good luck either way!\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance tool and Atrium daylight", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<46092D1C.4010707@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB502CDEDC9@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar 27 16:41:39 2007", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance tool and Atrium daylight"}
