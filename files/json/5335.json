For getting a daylighting output, I usually prepare a model in Ecotect and? export it to radiance, which gives me? the randered image. I realized that ,If I could?install Desktop Radiance from the website than total process could be shorter and could give me more realistic simulation output.?For installing Desktop Radiance, I require AutoCAD R14 or 2002 version. I have the latar version of AutoCAD , but dont have earlier version. Can anyone?give me a clue?for getting that AutoCAD R14 or how can I install Desktop Radiance .\n?\nThanks for your help.\n\nMah??\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100403/458ea93f/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mahbub Hassa", "datetime": "Sat Apr  3 06:30:26 2010"}
