It is easy to figure out that this means that any of\nthese subscribers get your email twice, which does not add on to the\ninformation in it but to some demotivation to reply.\n\nStill, to give you a start, as far as I know Desktop Radiance is an old\nsoftware that has not been maintained for a while. On this list, you\nwill most probably not find anyone using it. So I would strongly\nrecommend against using Desktop Radiance. If you decide still to do so,\nand if you are aware of the limitations and probably bugs in that old\ncode, please mind that this is not a list supporting Desktop Radiance.\nBasically it means that you are on your own then. If you want to use\nRadiance, get the latest version (which is 4.0, but 3.9 is coming with\nlots of distributions and fine to use), read the documentation and ask\nwhen there are open questions.\n\nRegards\n\nLars O. Grobe.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Desktop Radiance installati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Sat Apr  3 07:00:30 2010"}
