On it's own it can be used as a falsecolor substitute. But\nthe real fun starts when you add a GUI to view images and change the\nparameters interactively.\n\nI have put up a quick web site where you can download the current\nwork-in-progress:\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor\n\nIt doesn't do conversion to TIF yet, but BMP and PPM are supported and\nshould be available on Windows machines. The script needs the ra_XXX\nbinaries to be installed (so far).\n\nIf you need something more mature you could try RadDisplay:\n\nhttp://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Apr 8, 2010 at 11:11 AM,  <db805@doc.ic.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ra_tiff & falsecolor on Windows", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Thu Apr  8 05:12:51 2010"}
