{"body": "\n1) What algorithms or freeware would you suggest to make triangles or polygons out of point cloud data obtained by 3D laser scanning (historic architecture)? I need to minimize the number of triangles and would prefer polygons.\n\n2) Now that PowerMac laptops are on the rise, how can I get the most out of hardware life?
