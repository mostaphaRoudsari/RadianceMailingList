I should do that more often; I found an error.\n\nLast night I said:\n\"Make sure your illum= line includes sufficent -ab, and -ad, and -ar,\nand -as to ensure that the mkillum process is aggressively calculated.\"\n\nWhat I should have said was:\n\"Make sure your .rif file has -- *in addition to the illum= line* -- a\nmkillum= line, which includes sufficent -ab, and -ad, and -ar,\nand -as to ensure that the mkillum process is aggressively calculated.\"\n\nSo, you tell rad which polygons you want to convert to light sources\nwith the illum= line, then tell rad to use specific settings\n(independent of the rif file's Q V D settings) for the mkillum process\nwith a mkillum= line like so:\n\nscene= window_mullions.rad (etc...)\nillum= window_glass.rad\nmkillum= -ab 2 -ad 512 -as 256 -aa .1\n\nSorry for any confusion there...\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Wed, 03 Dec 2003 12:06:11 -0500"}
