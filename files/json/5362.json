This\nonly affects the final result, substituting a Lambertian surface and\nmultiplying the radiance by pi. Glass and other transparent surfaces are\nignored during this stage. Light sources still appear with their\noriginal radiance values, though the -dv option (below) may be used to\noverride this. This option is especially useful in conjunction with\nximage (1) for computing illuminance at scene points.\n\n\n\n-I\n\nBoolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance, with the\ninput origin and direction interpreted instead as measurement point and\norientation.\n\n\n\nIn what cases should one use the -i flag and in which cases is -I the\npreferred option?\n\nI find it hard to make the distinction from the docs.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n-jelle\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070302/0073d9dd/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB50289FD53@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Mar  2 15:43:49 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtrace -i -I flags"}
