I read chapters about calculation methods in the book,\nRendering with radiance, but still a little confused.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nJia\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100420/bc29521f/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient bounces", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Tue Apr 20 01:57:41 2010"}
