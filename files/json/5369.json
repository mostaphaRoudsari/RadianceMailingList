The rays hitting the\nsource will be discarded because the other components have considered them.\n\nThank you,\njia\n\nOn Tue, Apr 20, 2010 at 7:39 AM, Jia Hu <hujia06@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100420/1b36ad65/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient bounces", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Tue Apr 20 04:56:07 2010"}
