{"body": "\nThanks Greg an Jack for your excellent and very  helpfull suggestions.\n\nI now have succesfully converted the .obj file to rad, using obj2rad (\npolytrans did indeed work with Xfrog obj-files, but meshlab did not\naccept these files Lars ).\n\nHowever I can't get the mapping right. I've tried a lot, but with no\nsucces. Would you please share with me an example of the materials you\nuse for the bark and the leaves?\n\nI just don't really understand when and how to use Lu and Lv  or\nfrac(Lu) and frac(Lv) in the colorpict modifier and how these can ever\nbe placed  in a reasonable way on each triangle in the output of\nobj2rad, which in my case is like :\n\nleaf_col_leaf2 polygon leaf22836.60976\n0\n0\n9\n-0.250204           0.195593             13.838\n-1.00383          -0.956752            13.8816\n-1.21881           -0.19178            13.5622\n\nI never really understood the meaning of texture-coordinates, but at\nthis time I feel that is what  is  missing here.\n\nIs there a difference in using obj2rad and obj2mesh for this purpose ? I\ntried both but with the some odd results concerning the coordinate mapping.\n\n-Iebele\n\nJack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<46116EF4.9060604@visarc.com>", "sender": "iebele", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<46127520.7090302@iebele.nl>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB502CDEDC9@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>\t<46112A63.60802@iebele.nl>\t<0A962F3E-9A34-47BF-9B37-5CCC55F55805@gmail.com>", "<46116EF4.9060604@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Apr  3 17:36:21 2007", "email": "info at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Ambient exclude transfomed material ininstances"}
