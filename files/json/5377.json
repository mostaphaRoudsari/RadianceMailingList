{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nYour welcome. It is fortunate that I have also been starting to work\nwith xfrog trees, so this is pretty fresh in my mind.\n\nMy experience with different trees in xfrog is pretty limited. I have\nexperimented with one of the example ones, which is what I used to base\nthe polytrans intermediate translation method on. The other one is from\nan xfrog tree that came with a pre-exported obj that I purchased on\nTurboSquid.\n\nI am not sure how familiar you are with Polytrans. It does have some\ntools for (re)calculating uv tangent vectors. I wonder if this would be\nworth trying on one of the trees that causes problems.\n\n-Jack\n\niebele wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4613534B.1070105@iebele.nl>", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4613A8D8.4050805@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB502CDEDC9@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>\t<46112A63.60802@iebele.nl>\t<0A962F3E-9A34-47BF-9B37-5CCC55F55805@gmail.com>\t<46116EF4.9060604@visarc.com>\t<46127520.7090302@iebele.nl>\t<3A5269C9-5FB1-4650-AB2E-B053E73C6830@gmail.com>\t<46128A7A.20305@visarc.com>", "<4613534B.1070105@iebele.nl>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr  4 15:32:51 2007", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Ambient exclude transfomed materialin\tinstances"}
