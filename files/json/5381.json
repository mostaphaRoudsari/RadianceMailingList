I myself wouldn't advertise the\nscripts as Python packages because the depend so heavily on Radiance.\n\nBTW: Did you try the app already? I just got a report of a\nwarning/error message popping up on Windows XP. I haven't seen it at\nhome but here at work I can reproduce the message. I wonder if you had\nseen it, too.\n\nAbout further development:\n\nI'm happy with what I have now. I only needed an image viewer that\nwouldn't exceed the size of my screen like ximage does. The falsecolor\nfeatures where a nice add on I wanted to use to check my future\nimprovements on the falsecolor2 script.\n\nI thought about restructuring the code to allow multiple images being\npresented at the same time which would then allow us to perform some\nimage manipulations on them via pcomb (difference, relative\ndifference, blend, mask etc). However, when I need to do this now I'm\nhappy to do it on the command line. So it will probably not happen\nsoon unless there is a demand for these features.\n\nI keep a TODO list in the source code tree:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pyrat/source/browse/trunk/wxfalsecolor/TODO\n\nI forgot to add \"support for more image formats via PIL\". I think that\ncovers my ideas for an image viewer.\n\nI started the pyrat project on code.google.com because I have more\nideas for small tools that might be useful for others (especially on\nWindows) and a few older Python scripts which might be resurrected in\nthe context.\n\n\n1) rad2 / wxrad2\n\nA new (graphical) rif file processor. I already had written parts of\nrad in Python for my old Blender exporter. It's basically there to\navoid the need for a command line. You should be able to explore the\ndependency tree, the individual calculation steps and progress of\nrunning jobs. There are a couple of advanced calculation methods out\nthere (like stencil) that could be easily supported by a frontend like\nthis. Similar to trad and Ecotect's Radiance Control Panel.\n\n\n2) render daemon\n\nA small app that sits in your task bar and watches your running and\nincoming *.rif or makefile-type render jobs. Could also have a network\ncomponent which offloads the work to a render server or farm. I need\nsomething like this as a starting point for scenes exported from\nSketchup.\n\n\n3) Python bindings for HDR images\n\nfalsecolor2 uses the subprocess module and pvalue to read image data.\nThat takes a long time and is needlessly complicated. I would like to\ntry to compile the few methods necessary as C Python extensions. After\nthat the functionality of pcompos, pcomb and other p* apps could be\nreimplemented in pure Python (or those could be made Python extensions\nas well).\n\n\n4) couple of scripts to create plots and PDF reports from grids\n\n\nIf your interested in any of this you're most welcome to join the project.\n\n\nCheers,\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<hqlact$mu3$1@dough.gmane.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed Apr 21 01:12:37 2010"}
