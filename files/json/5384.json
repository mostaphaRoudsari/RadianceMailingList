You\ncould try evaluating the surface normal to chose the correct material\nin a custom expression but that would increase your render time\nsignificantly.\n\nAs an alternative you could use the same geometry with a small\nz-offset. If you have all the blinds in a separate *.rad file use the\n-m option of xform to give them a new modifier:\n\n!xform -m grey_mat blinds.rad\n!xform -m chrome -t 0 0 -0.001 blinds.rad\n\nThat will offset the blinds by 0.001 units down and use the material\n'chrome' for this 'side'.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Wed, Apr 21, 2010 at 5:16 PM, Nick Hubof <nhubof@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] two sided surfac", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed Apr 21 14:21:47 2010"}
