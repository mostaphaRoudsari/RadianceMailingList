{"body": "\nLars\n\nI installed radiance through synaptic package manager. However if you are\nimplying that a user defined configs could allow root access, that's an\nexploit I've never heard of. I will revise my .bashrc to side with caution.\n\nIn the meantime searching the installed radiance files I noticed what may be\nexamples I would like to test to make sure everything works as expected. One\nsuch is 'office' and 'cabin' located in the \"/usr/share/radiance/obj\"\nfolder. Before all that is feasible,  some clarifications to files types are\nneeded. Ideally, I would like to locate the example files into a user\nproject directory rather than system folders. And make sure any\nprocedurales, lighting, and materials files are in the share folder.\n\nThe http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Auxiliary flowchart\ndoesn't show the file types in use.\n\n*.lum\n*.vf\n*.norm\n*.vp etc..\n\nany link to a consise descriptions of these files would be of help because\nrunning the *.rif I found in the lib folder generate errors from missing\nfiles or includes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://local.live.com/?mkt=en-ca/?v=2&cid=A6D6BDB4586E357F!399\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Help:Setting up a radiance system", "sender": "steve michel", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY143-F30460B9940EDC9485ED22AE0640@phx.gbl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Apr  6 15:06:30 2007", "email": "smichel_designer at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Help:Setting up a radiance system"}
