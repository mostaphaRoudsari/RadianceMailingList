You will need to correctly define the convex and concave materials for your needs. You will also need to check that's the materials are showing up on the correct sides. One way to do this is to first define the convex and concave materials as red and blue for an easy visual check. If you need to reverse the materials then simply swap the names in the blind material definition.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless Phone\n\n----- Reply message -----\n\nI am modeling a large amount of physical blinds in an office scene. I am\nreplicating a Warema blind that has an opaque surface (grey) on the convex\nside and a chrome surface (93% reflective) on the concave side. To minimize\nthe amount of geometry I was hoping there is an easy way to apply two\nmaterials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than\ndouble the geometry.\n\nI have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking\nfor. I hope there is an easy way to do this.\n\nFor instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side\nis the opaque material.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100421/21405c6a/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "nhubof@gmail.com", "datetime": "Wed, Apr 21, 2010 12:23 PM"}
