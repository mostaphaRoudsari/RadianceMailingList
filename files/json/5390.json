I think a value of 0 means that the glow\nhas an infinite range (or none at all? - the old doc I have is unclear\nabout that). If you set it to something small like 0.1 it might\nlimit its effect.

In that case you could try to render the\nobject _without_ sky which gives you a black background (use\n'-av' to avoid black faces on the object). Then use pcomb to\ncolour all pixels with a value of 0 red. See the 'stencil' thread\nof a few weeks ago for an idea how this might work.\n\n\nReport any success!\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: ambient exclude list -ae", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<411835BE-9B45-428B-8653-00A520D6481A@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<BAY143-F35102BF7DF121D549344E0E0640@phx.gbl>", "<1175967892.7245.10.camel@leviathan>", "<A4C91D7F128DEB4B954509D5D26FC3C202ED68BA@EX03.asurite.ad.asu.edu>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr 12 00:31:53 2007", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: ambient exclude list -ae"}
