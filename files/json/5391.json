You have defined a red sky (and ground, btw) and\nsome sort of directional light. If you render it with only one\nbounce all faces that are not in direct view of the light source\n_only_ get light from the sky. That's what you can see.\n\nYou can try to add a limiting radius to your glow definition\n(forth argument). I think a value of 0 means that the glow\nhas an infinite range (or none at all? - the old doc I have is unclear\nabout that). If you set it to something small like 0.1 it might\nlimit its effect. But I don't know how this works when the glow\nis applied to a source which has no measurable distance to the scene.\n\nI assume all you want is to render the object on top of a red\nbackground, right? In that case you could try to render the\nobject _without_ sky which gives you a black background (use\n'-av' to avoid black faces on the object). Then use pcomb to\ncolour all pixels with a value of 0 red. See the 'stencil' thread\nof a few weeks ago for an idea how this might work.\n\n\nReport any success!\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 3996 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070411/cad2ea2c/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Thomas Bleiche", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A4C91D7F128DEB4B954509D5D26FC3C202ED68BD@EX03.asurite.ad.asu.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Apr 12 01:51:39 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Thomas Bleicher", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] RE: ambient exclude list -ae"}
