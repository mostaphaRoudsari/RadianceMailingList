In this case you would use your measured\nreflectance as a base material and apply some fancy structure-modifiers\nto it.\n\nFor the case where you want to perturbate the color, too, it will be\nmore complicated. As far as I understood, you only have the average\nreflectance, but you do not know the local colors. You may try the same\nas above, ensuring that the average complies with your measured\nreflectance, and use colorpict or colorfunc to perturbate the color. But\nthis may leas to strange effects.\n\nBest would be calibrated photographs.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100422/7ed1b880/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] advice for material modeling", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
