{"body": "\n\nHi Katja ---\n\nThis is very strange.  I have done exactly what you describe countless\ntimes and never seen artifacts.  How many pixels error do you see?  Do\nyou oversample the alpha mask to get anti-aliased edges?  I use the\nsmall rim of fractional values in the  downsampled alpha matte to\ncrossfade between the rendering image and the mask, which always gives\npixel-perfect cropping....\n\n-- Roland\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 19, 2007, at 10:14 PM, Katja Doerschner wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: text/enriched\nSize: 5359 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070420/f262738e/attachment-0001.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] remove light probe image from background", "sender": "Roland William Fleming", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<0e92d5fb4642ea13d95bcc3e244a34b3@tuebingen.mpg.de>", "refs": ["<B8DD8375FCE2C94B9F170D9277C1FA2B0C23A0A4@corvallis>", "<2E27E12E-7B67-42F5-B766-7683535240AA@umn.edu>"], "datetime": "Fri Apr 20 09:26:50 2007", "email": "roland.fleming at tuebingen.mpg.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] remove light probe image from background"}
