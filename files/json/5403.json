{"body": "\nI'm pretty new to Radiance, so please bear with me ;)\n\nI have a commercial forward ray tracing program that I use to model complex\nwindow glazings. I can output the transmitted flux vs outgoing direction for\nlight incident at different angles.\n\nHow would I create a surface in Radiance which would behave in the same way\nas observed using the forward ray tracer. BRTDfunc? Can I specify arbitrary\noutput distributions for a comprehensive sampling of all incoming\ndirections? Is there a \"BRTDdata\" surface type?\n\nAny ideas? Other things I should be aware of?\n\nThanks\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck Out Our List Of Trendy Restaurants.
