Also, thanks for the tips on color variation\nstrategies.\nI will let you know what I come up with for the texture.  I know its\na cross between an art and a science in doing so (e.g. see the \"forest\"\nexample below)-- just thought maybe someone have studied this material\nbefore.  On a related note, have there been discussions on having a\nmaterial database at radiance-online/elsewhere?\nOn a project where I had to quickly model how a forest would impact\nthe lighting on a facade, I hacked perforate.cal instead of trying to\nmodel the actual trees (trunks, branches, needles, yuk).\n\nThis was the real scene:\n\nhttp://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/forest.jpg\n\nand this was what was modeled:\n\nhttp://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/model.jpg\n\nand the script I hacked:\n\nhttp://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/forest.cal\n\nGiven more time I would have tried to increase the density of the dot\npattern near the ground/etc.\n\n- Dan\n\n\n\nOn 4/26/2010 10:05 AM, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n--\nLF logo \tDaniel C.
