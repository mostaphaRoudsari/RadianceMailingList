I would say it's not\nstraightforward, but the procedure is outlined in Charles Ehrlich's\nchapter of Rendering with Radiance. The process is very much streamlined\nwhen you use Georg Mischler's Rayfront interface.  Personally, I am\nusually interested in the calculation result from electric light\nsources, so I tend to just use the simple geometry that ies2rad creates\nfor me.  But the visual result of going the distance and actually\nsetting up the whole illum enclosure can be fantastic.  I have very\nlimited experience with this, but I hope others will chime in here with\nsome tips.\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general]ies photometry+geometry?", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<462FA602.8030703@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<BAY143-F14062B70C315C4E202F298E0490@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 25 21:04:32 2007", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general]ies photometry+geometry?"}
