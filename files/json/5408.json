Jan & I were just discussing this, and trying to settle\non a final set of dates.  Apparently, there is a conflict with the\noriginal dates suggested for September, as the Bausim-Conference is\ntaking place in Vienna from the 22nd to the 24th.  The October dates\nweren't good for me, either, so Jan suggested Sept. 20-22nd --\noverlapping Bausim with an optional third day (Wed.) to cover one or\nmore special topics.\n\nAnyone have any objections to a Sept. 20-22 schedule for the 2010\nworkshop?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 2010 Workshop Dates", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Apr 27 22:26:07 2010"}
