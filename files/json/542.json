Rview is now known as \"rvu\" in the HEAD release.    I included\na symbolic link from rvu to rview in the src/rt/Rmakefile install\nscript, so you won't have to start typing the new name right away\nunless you feel like it.  However, the other commands whose names\nchanged do not have links back to their originals, so be careful to\nclean out your executable directory before the build unless you want to\nhave the old commands hanging around forever.  The new names are the\nones we discussed earlier:\n\ncalc -> icalc\ngencat -> gencatenary\nlam -> rlam\nneat -> neaten\n\nI have also updated the man pages accordingly, and rad now executes rvu\nwhen you give it the -o option.  I'm hoping I didn't forget anything --\na lot of files were affected by the change.  I'm hoping I don't have to\ndo this again for a looong time!\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 1 Jan 2004 11:48:39 -0800"}
