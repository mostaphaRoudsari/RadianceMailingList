{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nIf you use the \"mirror\" material type for the ceiling, it will cast\nappropriate source reflections, but without the surface normal\ninterpolation.  Also, it will incur a lot of calculation overhead,\nproportional to the number of triangles in your ceiling.  I don't\nthink I'd recommend it for that reason.\n\nSurface normals are interpolated for other parts of the calculation,\nsuch as the diffuse indirect, which in your case is not so diffuse.\nThis is no doubt the source of your splotches, and the photon map\naddition may well take care of the problem.  You could try it with\nthe \"mirror\" type first, just to see how long it takes and what it\nlooks like.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Specular convex reflector and surface normals?", "sender": "Gregory J.
