To save myself the hassle I spent a the better part of a saturday creating a dashboard widget for generating trans material descriptions on mac osx!  now I just hit F4 slide the sliders and hit the copy button and I've got it.\n\nIf you use a mac and your trans material generating workflow has got you down, give it a try: http://software.mcneilorama.com/Gen_Trans_Widget.html\n\nComments and suggestions are welcome.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Thu Apr 29 22:28:09 2010"}
