As far as I can tell, Mac OS 10.2.8 does NOT support file\nlocking natively.  When I try to turn on file locking using NFS\nManager, the option is greyed out and it says that this version of the\noperating system does not support locking.  Mac OS 10.3.2 DOES support\nlocking.\n\nAs of now, I have 2 machines that are working together, and 2 that keep\nclobbering the ambient file.\n\nHappy New Year to all!\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John S.
