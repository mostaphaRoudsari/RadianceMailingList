We figured this might be a tricky rendering to pull\noff, luckily we don't absolutely need it at this point. We have the\nequipment and the blind to put together a BTDF file, but not the time or\nbudget. If you come up with a tool that would allow us to model this please\nkeep us in mind.\nThanks a ton for all of the hard work you put into this software.\nNick\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Greg Ward\nSent: Friday, April 30, 2010 9:52 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Nick,\n\nUnfortunately, you've hit upon the one case that Radiance doesn't\nreally handle properly:  curved, specular window coverings.  Your best\nhope at this point is to add some roughness to the specular side of\nyour surface and use mkillum to generate an output distribution.  If\nyou could measure a BTDF for the blinds and give it to mkillum that\nway, you'd be golden, but I don't expect that you have such a thing.\n\nEventually, we hope to create a tool that would allow you to model\nthis (and other types) complex fenestration, but we're a few months\naway from having that ready.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\nhttp://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/genzyme_2010_04_21_c1\n.jpg\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] two sided surfac", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Fri Apr 30 12:15:08 2010"}
