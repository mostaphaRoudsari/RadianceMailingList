I hope to share my experiences and also want to\nknow if anyone knows how to solve the questions bellow.  First of all, sorry\nfor such a long email.\n\n\n\nTo import models to Radiance, there are three basic ways (obj, dxf and\necotect) (There are others, but I just know the following three):\n\n\n\n*(1) **The following uses obj2rad:*\n\n(a) Convert to *.obj* file by other tools,\n\n(b) Then use *obj2rad* to convert the *obj* file to .*rad* file;\n\n(c) Define materials in another .mat file (material names could be found\nin the objfile.data by using command: obj2rad -n objfile > objfile.data)\n\n\n\n*(**2**)** The following uses dxf2ad*\n\n(a) In revit, export .dxf file (save as *autocad 2000* rather than\ncurrent version),\n\n(b) Then use *dxf2rad* to convert the .dxf file to .rad\n\nBut I found all the geometries get the same materials.\n\nSo, does anyone know how to handle this problem?\n\n\n\n*(3)  The following uses Ecotect *\n\n(a) Export .dxf file from Revit (I can not import dwg by Ecotect, is that\nnormal?)\n\n(b) In the diag, define different zones *by item name;*\n\n(c) Export the model into .rad file directly, including .mat file\n\nThe problem is that .mat file seems not correct. One material is assigned to\none zone. For example, in the Door object, there are two types of materials,\nbut they are combined into one material after importing to Ecotect.\n\nSo does anyone know how to deal with the materials problems?\n\n\n\nFor the above methods (1) and (2),  the key is to get .obj and .dxf file. To\nget .obj file, there are 4 ways;\n\n*(1) In revit, use FBX converter to get obj file*\n\n(a) In revit, export fbx file;\n\n(b) Download FBX converter at URL:\nhttp://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=10775855\n\n(c) Convert fbx to .obj\n\nThe problem is that I always get some zero value of  ?vn? in obj file. Even\nif I use ??f? option or delete ?vt? ?vn?, it still does not work because the\n?face? in obj file uses ?v/vt/vn? format.  If I delete them, errors appear\nbecause obj2rad can not find ?vt? and ?vn?. Could anyone know how to solve\nthis problem?\n\n\n\n*(2) Use 3D max to get obj file*\n\n(a) In revit, export fbx file;\n\n(b) Import fbx file to 3ds max\n\n(c) Make some changes in 3ds max to get export obj file.\n\nI have not tried this way, but I think this way is better because I can\nre-assign or change materials in 3ds max easily and can get the correct\nmaterial names. Is this right?\n\n\n\n*(3) Using 3ds max to get obj file*\n\n(a) In revit, export dwg file;\n\n(b)  Import dwg file to 3ds max;\n\n(c) Assign materials in 3ds max\n\nYou can see it at  http://www.becausewecan.org/node/190    Should I assign\nmaterials again in 3ds max?   I have not tried this way, but it seems good\nas (2).\n\n\n\n*(4) using sketchup pro to get obj file. *\n\n**\n\nAs always, thank you all.\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100504/e7deb6d1/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Tue May  4 19:03:27 2010"}
