If Revit uses another convention you\nwill have to export export elements with different materials\nseparately.\n\n\nDXF can only hold information about linetype and linecolor but not\nadvanced properties like 'material'. Ecotect otoh uses a very\nsophisticated material definition to account for all the thermal,\nacoustic and reflective properties. In your step (b) above you assign\nmaterials to the layers (\"item name\") and split them out into zones.\nIf your door has two materials on the same layer you loose that\ninformation. You can still assign a different material to individual\npolygons in one zone, though.\n\nWe usually import geometry as 3DS or obj, assign materials in Ecotect\nand export to Radiance. Typically we only have 4 or 5 materials so the\nproblem of defining different materials for a door does not arise.\nWhen we model the geometry in Ecotect we don't even include doors ...\n\n\nZeros for vt should not cause problems; it's a perfectly acceptable\nvalue for a texture coordinate. The normal vector should always be\nnormalized to 1 so (0,0,0) doesn't work. Perhaps you can find a 3D\nmodeler/converter that can recalculate the normals and produces better\nquality *.obj files.\n\nYou should be able to replace all normals with a (fake) 0,0,1 value.\nIf you use the -f option obj2rad should ignore the actual value.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] import to Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed May  5 02:44:18 2010"}
