{"body": "\nHi ChenGuang,\n\nThis is a nice illustration of the problem.  If you rendered these\nwith rvu, I wouldn't expect the pixels to match exactly, since the\nactual point rendered is randomly chosen from within each region, and\nusing the default parameters of rvu, radiances are only accurate to\nwithin 15% (see the -pt setting from \"rvu -defaults\").  This is to\nincrease rendering speed.  To avoid sampling discrepancies, you\nshould use rpict instead with the following settings:\n\nrpict -ps 1 -pj 0 -dt 0 -sj 0\n\nEven so, your pixels will only match within 1%, due to round-off\nerrors in the pixel encoding itself.  To get better accuracy, you\nwill have to use rtrace.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pixel radiance question detailed", "sender": "Gregory J.
