It has a limitation of 25 times of saving files.\n\nI can import dwg (2007) from revit 2010 and export obj by Layer.Another way\nI tried was to import fbx which was exported from Revit 2010. I intend to\nexport obj file through \"export material definition\". But the command line\nof Rhino says Error importing XXX.fbx.\n\nI asked this question in Autodesk Discussion Group and they say \"FBX from\nRevit 2010 is only compatible with Max 2010. It doesn't work like\nearlier versions of FBX where other programs could open it.\"  So the problem\nis that current Revit uses a new version of fbx while Rhino seems to use an\nold one.\n\nRegards,\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100506/4c00a57a/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] import to Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Thu May  6 00:35:27 2010"}
