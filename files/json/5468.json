I can't build a binary until this evening so if you\nreally need it this afternoon you have to install Python (if you can).\n\nThomas\n\nOn Thu, May 6, 2010 at 4:05 PM, Giovanni Betti\n<gbetti@fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\nreally\nthe\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Thu May  6 08:34:01 2010"}
