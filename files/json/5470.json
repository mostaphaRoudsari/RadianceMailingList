It turns out that I have all my packaging\nrequirements here on my work PC. I have added a \"-s auto\" option and\ntested it a tiny bit. You have to do the rest.\n\nI couldn't send you the file via PM so I have uploaded a zip with the\nbinary here:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor/falsecolor\n2.zip?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nIf the link doesn't work go the attachments at the bottom of the page.\n\nTo the rest of you out there: I really haven't done much testing. Use\nat your own risk. There will be another release of\nwxfalsecolor/falsecolor2 soon which will include this feature (and\nmore).\n\n\nThomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Thu May  6 09:06:09 2010"}
