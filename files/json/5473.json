I almost forgot FBX Converter because I used it to\nconvert the FBX to OBJ and always get \"vn\" 0 0 0.  I try that again, and\nfind if I convert FBX to 3DS and then import 3DS to Rhino, it works at my\nfirst glance! and also contains correct material names  though in one layer.\n\n\nRevit could directly export DXF (2007) and DWG (2007) by layers (the\nmaterials seem missing), which can be imported to Rhino to get OBJ.\nAs Christopher and Jack said, it was required to reorganize layers (e.g, in\nrevit) before DXF/DWG (is any difference for the two?) is exported.  I will\nalso take a look at other ways Lars said.\n\nThe layers for DWG/DXF format in Revit are organized according to its\ncategories and family types. I tried to customize and reorganized\nsome layers based on the default layer organization and it may\nbe acceptable for not complicated geometry.\n\nThank you all.\nJia\n\n\n\nOn Thu, May 6, 2010 at 10:31 AM, Jack de Valpine <jedev@visarc.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100506/95f00204/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] import to Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Thu May  6 11:42:39 2010"}
