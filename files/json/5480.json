{"body": "\nHi folks,\n\nrather than tracing rays, we'll be moving hardware for a change:\n\nThe radiance-online server will be physically shipped from Freiburg, DE\nto Berkeley, CA at some time this week (starting approximately tomorrow)\nand be re-connected there (provided it arrives intact, doesn't get blown\nup at customs, etc, etc.). Rather than bothering with configuring new\nhardware, it seemed easier just to sent the ****** thing in-toto as a\nstart.\nHowever, obviously, there will be a slight technical delay in between.\nEmails sent to the server will be queued at your email provider (and may\ngenerate a delay warning) and web access will be suprisingly slow during\nthe transport phase.\n\nMany thanks to the daylighting group at Fraunhofer ISE for funding this\ntransport and thereby easing the transition, to the ISE IT department\nfor their provider role since 2001 and to Danny Fuller at LBNL for\ncaring for it in the future.\n\nAnd, most important, to all you guys who compiled questions or assembled\nanswers and kept the mailing list active. Keep it up, we'll be back\nonline within sight of the Bay- and GoldenGate bridge.\n\ncheers\nPeter\n\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<mailman.4.1179811863.337.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue May 22 07:31:03 2007", "email": "apian at pab-opto.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] moving hardware"}
