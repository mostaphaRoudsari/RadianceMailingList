You're\nadvised to save a project as a CAB file and copy that if you want to\ntransfer a project between computers. Probably best to ensure also\nthat the various PCs are running the same version of IES.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Tue May 11 01:22:31 2010"}
