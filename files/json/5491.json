Every error in the output is because the\ninstaller is looking in /usr/include/X11 for header files. The\nwarnings are all ignorable. And rtrace is still running the old\nversion, which doesn't have the \"-n\" option.\n\nDo an \"ls /usr/include/X11\" and see if that directory contains\nfiles like \"Xutil.h\" and \"Xlib.h\". If not, see if\n/usr/include/X11R6, or some other directory like that contains\nthem. Once you've found them, when you run the makeall script,\nchoose to edit the makefile. Change the \"-I/usr/include/X11\" to\nreflect the header files actual location.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nMark\n\nPS. I use Fedora (10 now) and things work.\n\n\nOn Tue, 11 May 2010, Cramer Silkworth wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Upgrading to R4: \"There were some errors.\"", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Tue May 11 07:58:17 2010"}
