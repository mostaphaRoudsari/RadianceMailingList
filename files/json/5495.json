I tried adding the libx11-dev and csh packages, but\nit still didn't work. So I (gave up and) grabbed Jack's compiled version\nfrom his ftp site, copied the files to the right places, and it now\nreports 4.0 as the version for rtrace and rvu.\n\nI'm hung up a new error though, rtrace reports that it can't find\n\"inglas.cal\". Does that sound familiar to anyone? It could be a file one\nof my german colleagues made that I lost in the process, but\nunfortunately they've all gone home for the day already...\n\nThanks again,\nCramer\n--\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth@transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth@transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in\nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100511/225958c3/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Cramer Silkworth", "datetime": "Tue May 11 09:23:17 2010"}
