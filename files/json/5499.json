I am testing materials and their reflectance and need to use rcalc to help me identify which materials my ray is hitting.\n\nUsing a simple mirror material I have created a blue material with close to 0 red and green.  I have fired a ray in the direction of this material and now I need to determine whether it is a hit.  Using -ab 0 I get the following result:\n\n5.475634e+01\t5.475634e+01\t2.737817e+02\n\nMy material is below:\n\nvoid mirror wall\n0\n0\n3 \t0.2 0.2 1\n\nI'd like to use rcalc to tell me whether I am hitting the material or not.  I was thinking of something like\n\nrcalc -e 'if($1=$3,$1=1,$1=0)' test.dat > test_res.dat  simply to give me a Boolean dat file of either 1 or 0.\n\nBut obviously that doesn't work so can someone help me with a possible solution?  I've trawled the mailing list to no avail so far.\n\nMany Thanks\n\nDan\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Dan Fitzpatrick", "datetime": "Tue May 11 14:20:27 2010"}
