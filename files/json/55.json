So I would not have the calculations in cal-files any more. Of\ncourse this means a loss of flexibility, maybe it's simply better to\nhold the complete object as an oct-file.\n\n\nMappings are usually not the most important feature in radiance at all.\n\n\n;-) this \"piece of software\" is happily running on my laptop now!\nThere's just one reason for my question. I am working on a model of a\nchurch. In fact, mappings are not the most important for our project,\nbut we have documented most important surfaces. So we have photos of the\ndomes, what AFAIK means a planar projection of a spherical surface. I\nwonder how I would map this easily, if it gets important... ooops....\nmight it be that I could simply map it as on a planar surface in this\ncase...?\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
