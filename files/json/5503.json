My problem is, i'm not really a linux\nguy, and googling how to set it returns no fewer than a gazillion\ndifferent places that PATHs are set. Can you tell me where the best\nplace would be, and what exactly the line is (in Ubuntu 9.10)? Sorry, I\nknow it's a newbie question, but there doesn't seem to consensus on the\ninternet (not that there ever really is) on how to do this.\n\nBernd, adding the build-dep packages didn't solve the compiling problem.\nIf the setting raypath doesn't fix it, I'm starting with a fresh install\nof the OS with all packages selected. Radiance is the only thing I use\nthis machine for, so it's not really a big deal.\n\nThanks,\nCramer\n--\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth@transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth@transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in\nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100512/de94b221/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Cramer Silkworth", "datetime": "Wed May 12 14:26:08 2010"}
