I have ran into a slight problem when rendering fish eyes\nwith multiple processors.\nIf you look at the linked image you can see that some of the frames are\nmisplaced, incomplete and/or dropped.

It is frustrating as non-fisheye images render fine\n95% of the time.\n\nhttp://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/caes_2010_05_10_mod3a\n_c1.jpg\n\nThank you,\nNick\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Misplaced Rendering Fram", "tags": [], "sender": "Nick Hubof", "datetime": "Thu May 13 14:39:02 2010"}
