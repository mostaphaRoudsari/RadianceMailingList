The fact that over the\nlast few years, several additions have been added in for the convenience\nof people working with weather data does not even touch the core. I know\nthat people like the brand-alike words a lot, but it is misleading here.\nThe fact that Radiance got the name it carries is one of the brilliant\nthings in it - it reflects the fact that it simply models radiant\ntransfers and at the same time already gives the units. This is clear.\n\"Dynamic\" can be anything - sounds great but is not clear. So - why not\nwrite what we are doing - using e.g. Radiance with models based on\nweather-data?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"Dynamic Radiance\" and Radiance Terminolog", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
