As far as\nI understood, rtcontrib is optimized for operation with weather data.\nEspecially patch-based sky models seam to be a perfect application. The\nphotonmap is currently not all that efficient in these applications. On\nthe other hand, it allows to include a forward-raytracing step without\nmodifications in the scene (well, maybe adding photon-ports to\noptimize). Maybe it is because of I never did it, but modelling a facade\nwith non-planar light shelves sounds scary to me to attempt using\nrtcontrib, while almost trivial using the photon-map. On the other hand,\nI admire the potential of rtcontrib when used with sky patches or a\nbunch of light sources. Maybe it is because there is no such compact\ndocumentation available for using rtcontrib with redirecting structures\nas the photon-map manual. So - from my perspective - it would be perfect\nto have both. Pmap to easily include a very generic forward raytracing\nstep. Rtcontrib as an optimization for those who know what they are doing.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<A8B896C4-7E4A-4E08-8C1E-5143E69A41B7@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
