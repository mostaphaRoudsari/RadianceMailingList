I ran the scene at ar=2056 and had problems with frames dropping\nwith the fisheye cameras and then again with section perspectives (clipping\nplane). I reduced the ar=1028 and all was well. The renderings turned out\nfine and no frames were dropped.\nThanks,\nNick\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Greg Ward\nSent: Thursday, May 13, 2010 5:55 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Nick,\n\nI tried but was unable to reproduce this problem.
