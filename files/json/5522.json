{"body": "\nHi Greg,\nThanks for telling me the options \"-ps 1 -pj 0 -dt 0 -sj 0\", it\nindeed increase the accuracy. But the error is still very large. Again\nthanks for telling me the command \"rtrace\". It's really a useful tool to\nhelp me debug my program and it facilitated me to find out there is\nsomething wrong about conversion from PIC file to TIFF file. I failed to\ndisable the gamma correction!!! After setting the gamma exponent to 1, all\nthe values are correct. Many many thanks!!!\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sun ChenGuang", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<!~!UENERkVCMDkAAQACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAAAAAAAAApAU/sPCvoUWCt0NoeJHG5cKAAAAQAAAAEaC8xelM1UKS7qmEaYeoGgEAAAAA@gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jun  1 04:03:25 2007", "email": "suncg03 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] solution for pixel radiance problem"}
