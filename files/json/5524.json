{"body": "\nRepost from a month ago...\n\n\nHi Tim,\n\nI had to struggle a bit to understand what you were after here.  I\nrecommend the following options:\n\nrtrace -dr 1 -lr 1 -dp 0 -ds 0.02 -dj 0 -dt 0 -lw 0 -ab 0 -I+ -h- -\nw- -oTopn\n\nBy replacing 't' in the output options with 'T', you force inclusion\nof all rays to light sources.  I'm not sure if this is what you want,\nbut you can try it.\n\nAs for the problem of sources being too close in Z, it might be\nbetter to take a different strategy.  Place a vertical surface that's\nset on one of the diagonals between the corners of your room --\nassuming your room has a roughly triangular shape.  Make the surface\na \"trans\" type:\n\nvoid trans diffuse\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 .5 0\n\nThen, trace rays onto the center of the surface from either side and\nfollow the reflections.  That way, you'll get rays going out both sides.\n\nBy the way, why don't you just compute what you're after from\nstraight geometry?  Is the space so complicated?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Gregory J.
