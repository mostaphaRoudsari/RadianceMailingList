You must be using the\n\"mirror\" primitive in order to generate your virtual sources -- is\nthis correct?  How many surfaces do you have using the mirror type?\nIs it a large surface tessellated into many smaller polygons?  The\nfewer surfaces you hand to the virtual source calculation, the better\nit will do.  I've never encountered this error before.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] system - out of memory in makevsrc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed May 19 08:24:41 2010"}
