You have to change from a geometric intersection\ntechnique to a \"proximity\" intersection technique for displaced\nsurfaces.  I have no idea what form this code would take, or how it\nwould work.  It seems to me that it would require major overhauls of\nboth the octree generator and the ray tracing engine.  I don't have\ntime for it, nor have I the need for such a facility.  Radiance is\ndesigned for architectural models, and the more exotic renderings are\nbetter left to Maya and Renderman, in my opinion.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] defining structured (textured) surfaces in radiance?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 3 Feb 2004 12:21:01 -0800"}
