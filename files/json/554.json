{"body": "\n\nWell, the schematic drawings show it that way, but I'm sure it will be\nmore faceted in reality.  At first I didn't care and just modeled it as\na warped plane.  But now I wanna generate some prettier renderings and\nI can see that the mkillum process really helps in that regard.  I\nguess I'll \"straighten it out\".\n\nAbout half the planes in my model need to get fixed, but even with all\nthe aiming failures, the renderings generated with illums on all the\nwindows are much nicer.  But I can see some artifacts that indicate to\nme that the accuracy is being compromised here.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] aiming illums, orthographic projection, and hiding surfaces", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<78D6DD9A-7C2D-11D7-A6B0-000393824274@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 1 May 2003 19:34:37 -0400", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] aiming illums, orthographic projection, and hiding surfaces"}
