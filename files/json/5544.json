{"body": "\nHello everybody,\n\nI Shrikar Bhave, am a graduate student in MS - Building Design (Energy\nPerformance and Climate Responsive Architecture) program at Arizona\nState University. I have taken a 'Radiance' course during my MS\ncurriculum. My thesis deals with daylighting and radiance is primary\nsoftware that I am using for my thesis research.\n\nI will be graduating by mid-september, and have started looking for\njob. I believe that during my MS curriculum, I have acquired a\nskillset appropriate for Building energy analysis and Daylighting\ndesign & analysis.\n\nDaylighting design and analysis is one of my core interests in my\ncareer. I wish to keep working with Radiance during my professional\ncareer to further develop my software knowledge and modelling skills.\n\nCould you please suggest consulting firms (in USA) which use Radiance\n(as one of the tools) for daylighting design and analysis ? (and\nfirms, which might be looking for fresh graduates)\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nShrikar\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Shrikar Bhave", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<c487092b0707180008m35eddd8rd06702caae0e4d9d@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jul 18 01:09:21 2007", "email": "shrikarbhave at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Looking for daylighting design and analysis firms"}
