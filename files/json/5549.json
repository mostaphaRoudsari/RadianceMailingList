A rudimentary description of\nthe method can be downloaded from:\nhttp://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p461v1.pdf\n<http://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p461v1.pdf>\n\nChristoph\n\n\n________________________________\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nChristian Anker Hviid\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2007 11:40 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHello Radiance community\n\nI would like to ask you what is the best way to simulate external blinds\nin Radiance. I have tried both full ray-tracing and the mkillum approach\nbut they do not yield the same illuminance values on the working plane.\nEspecially close to the window (0.5-1m) large differences show up\n(100%).\n\nWhat is the physically most accurate method? And if it is ray-tracing\nhow do I obtain smooth results in a reasonable amount of time?\n\nBest regards\nChristian Hviid\nTechnical University of Denmark\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20070713/a2246885/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ray-trace or mkillum for external blinds", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C3962029D8C83@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jul 13 14:33:15 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ray-trace or mkillum for external blinds"}
