My idea was taking a geometry as a surface modifier. The\nbasic functionality is provided by todays radiance: instances and the\nreplmarks program are doing almost what I want. If I don't replace\nevery triangle (like replmarks does) with an instance, but every face\nof a geometry, using the uv-values to place and rotate the instance,\nthen cutting this instance at the boundaries of the face, I have a\n3d-texture... or am I totally wrong here?\n\nCU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
