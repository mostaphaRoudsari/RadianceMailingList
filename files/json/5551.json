{"body": "\nWhat is \"full raytracing\" here? I think it is best here to replace the glazing by a mkillum pane and, if the shading system masks the window in a way that you expect variying illumination, subdivide that illum face a bit (see mkillum manpage). Without the illum pane, you might \"measure\" the max/min values of an inaccurate raytracing, sometimes light sources found, sometimes not, purely by luck ;-)\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ray-trace or mkillum for external blinds", "sender": "Lars Grobe", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20070713155407.284270@gmx.net>", "refs": ["<OFDD1BD7E3.2635EA5F-ONC1257317.0056134B-C1257317.0056135B@birch-krogboe.dk>"], "datetime": "Fri Jul 13 09:55:32 2007", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ray-trace or mkillum for external blinds"}
