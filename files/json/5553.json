{"body": "\n\nHi ---\n\nI've written a .cal shader for use with colorpict that makes use of Nx,\nNy and Nz.  But now I want to apply it to a mesh, (or object generated\nwith gensurf with the smoothing option on).  Instead of receiving the\nperturbed (interpolated) vertex normals, it just applies to the local\nsurface normal, leading to faceted appearance.\n\nHow do I access the interpolated surface normals in a .cal file?\n\nCheers,\nRoland\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Roland William Fleming", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<e966e49edc9a31497a5d6153e03c7bb6@tuebingen.mpg.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jul 13 07:21:19 2007", "email": "roland.fleming at tuebingen.mpg.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] accessing interpolated normals in a .cal file"}
