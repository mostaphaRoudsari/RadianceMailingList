If you copied this command correctly from\nyour source then you need a better source of information.\n\n\n\nYou can create a file \"points.txt\" with \"0 0 0 0 0 1\" in it (ASCII\ntext file, not a Word doc!). These are basically the coordinates of\nthe point you want to test (0,0,0) and the direction in which you\npoint your virtual sensor (0,0,1 = \"up\"). Now use this command on the\nDOS prompt:\n\nrtrace -w -h -ab 1 sky_uni.oct < points.txt\n\nLater on you will want to test more than just one point. Then you can\njust add a new line for each point to the file and you will get one\nline of output (r,g and b value) for each line/point.\n\nPS: If you can install applications on your system then you should\nreplace the Radiance installation from Desktop Radiance with a more\nrecent version. You can download a Windows installer for the 3.9\nversion here:\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=Downloads&func=prep_hand_out&lid=23\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<AANLkTimX-TYa4WS355opj_64RnzOseGpaE5QMZ-aksax@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Fri May 28 05:55:28 2010"}
