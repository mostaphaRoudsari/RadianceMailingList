{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI am a relative newcomer to Radiance, so please forgive my ignorance.\n\nI am interested in simulating a room with a deep lightwell as the only\nsource. The top of the light well has a double glazed skylight and the\nbottom of the lightwell is an as-yet undefined product that produces\ndiffuse light and has a very high visible light transmittance. My\nquestions are:\n\n1. Will a light frit or white paint coating on glass transmit highly\ndiffused light? If not, any products to recommend that will?\n2. Will Lamberts cosine law be a reasonable estimate for the BTDF and\nBRDF? And what are reasonable peak (zero angle) values to expect?\n3. Am I going to run into problems with Radiance finding the light\nsource? Which inputs will help Radiance find the light?\n\nThanks for any guidance.\n______________________________________________________________\n\nCelebrating Excellence Since 1972.
