{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI have to model the behavior of triple glazing made of 3 clear glass\npanes. Each pane is ordinary 4mm clear glass with transmittance 0.91.\n\nFor double glazing simulation I use glaze.csh script, but I don't have\nan idea how triple glazing can be simulated. I suppose I should use\nsome BRTDfunc material with transmittance angle distribution similar\nto my glazing system.\n\nI didn't manage to find anything on Internet, so hints, ideas and\nexamples are very welcome!\nSince I can see that triple glazings gain the popularity, I suppose\nthis subject is interesting to other members too.\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "cveleglg@bankerinter.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20070711103325.9vj39i6tc00wg00s@webmail.bankerinter.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jul 11 02:34:54 2007", "email": "cveleglg at bankerinter.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Triple glazing simulation"}
