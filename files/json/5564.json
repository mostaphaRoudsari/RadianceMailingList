It would be difficult to use a sky resolution high\nenough that one patch would be the better choice.  I only mentioned\nthe 1-4 range because that's what people have done, not as a\nrecommendation per se.\n\nThe important thing is to distribute energy according to which patches\nare closest, so if the sun really is in the middle of a particular\npatch, very little energy would be given to neighboring patches.  That\n\"very little\" should probably be zero in some cases, but I don't think\nit ever quite is in genskyvec with the weighting function I use.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA320C46211B58@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Jun  2 08:44:14 2010"}
