Your rtcontutor directory that was in Radiance\nfor a while used the four nearest patches. I guess your reasoning to\nreduce this to just three was something like this:\n\n1 - too crude\n2 - still only one-dimensional\n3 - just perfect. The real sun will always be in the triangle formed by\nexactly three patch centres.\n4 - Overkill\n\nSo in theory, if you we remove the patch intensity of the sky, we can\ndetermine the exact position of the sun if the intensity is known, or\nvice versa by triangulation. This is dictated by Greg's Uncertainty\nPrinciple. Think of it as sub-pixel interpolation in image processing.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4c067b62.17188f0a.2375.1365SMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed Jun  2 11:28:39 2010"}
