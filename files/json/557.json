Gurneet\n\nTo configure the mouse with X windows, you need to determine the manner in\nwhich the mouse is connected to the computer. See also pages 53 and 59 of\nthe study guide:\ni) USB mouse, use the /dev/input/mice\nii) The PS/2 mouse has a small round 6- pin DIN connector. Use /dev/psaux\niii) A serial mouse has a 9 or 25 pin connector and can be connected on com\nport 1. Use /dev/ttyS0\niv) A serial mouse has either a 9 or 25 pin connector and can be connected\non com port 2. Use /dev/ttyS1\n\nHint: If the rest of your X configuration is working, you can modify the\nsetup via xreset's 'Complex - text mode' scripts from the console. See from\npage 65 onwards in the study guide.\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987\nPerth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A2B098B4E624D511BED900508BB92A570541747D@exmsb02.curtin.edu.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 2 May 2003 21:20:05 +0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance on bootable CDROM using Linux"}
