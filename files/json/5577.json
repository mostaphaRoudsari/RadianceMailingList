I use a script file to combine these\nobjects and able to render them in different sizes in succession. In this\nscript file I'm using \"xform\" to locate these images. The problem is that I\nhave to re-render these images in different sizes however, when it is\nrendered in different size, the pipe and the box are departing from each\nother. I need to render these images 100 times in different sizes (their\nsize will diminish gradually) thus, I have to assign variables.\n\nHow can I assign variables to \"xform -n column -s $n squares/Box1.rad |\nxform -t 4.32 -10 -9 >> tmp.rad;\" to the right side of the xform? I have\nbeen trying for two days however I cannot get through it.\n\n\n\n\n--\nBegum Erten\nResearch Assistant\n\nNational Research Center for Magnetic Resonance (UMRAM)\nBilkent University\nAnkara 06800, Turkey\n\nPhone: +90 312 2903016\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100609/655347ae/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<AANLkTimuPJvhkI3SLs080zSTJ0FysI7usEtia4gslUWg@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Begum Erten", "datetime": "Wed Jun  9 06:51:40 2010"}
