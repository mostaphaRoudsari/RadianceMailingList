Without having to run\nrpict again, is there a way of dropping down the sky luminance using a\nmultiplier OR to uniformly drop down the light in the scene by combining\nthe pic (using pcomb) with pic file of a screen of a specific\ntransmittance? In other words, can I just filter down the light levels\nuniformly in the scene without having to run rpict again.\nThanks.\nAutif\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100610/19edfcfb/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Can this be done with pcomb?", "tags": [], "sender": "Autif Sayyed", "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 09:24:55 2010"}
