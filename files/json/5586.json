Light is linear, so you can always scale\naccording to window transmittance for light coming through the\nwindow.  There may be some (very) slight inaccuracies due to the\nvarying angular transmittance, but the results should be roughly\ncorrect.\n\nIf the window is the only source of light in the room, and you are\nadjusting the picture exposure rather than looking at the luminance/\nradiance values, then you will see no change at all, because one will\ncompensate for the other.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Can this be done with pcomb?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 09:41:19 2010"}
