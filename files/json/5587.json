I do want to get the\nluminance values from the modified pic file, so it seems adjusting\nexposure will not be the right approach. I was thinking pcomb could be\nused for this, but have not been able to figure out how to do it yet.\nAny suggestions or guidance would be great..\n\n\nAutif\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Greg\nWard\nSent: Thursday, June 10, 2010 11:42 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nThe short answer is 'yes.'  Light is linear, so you can always scale\naccording to window transmittance for light coming through the window.\nThere may be some (very) slight inaccuracies due to the varying angular\ntransmittance, but the results should be roughly correct.\n\nIf the window is the only source of light in the room, and you are\nadjusting the picture exposure rather than looking at the luminance/\nradiance values, then you will see no change at all, because one will\ncompensate for the other.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Can this be done with pcomb?", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 09:52:10 2010"}
