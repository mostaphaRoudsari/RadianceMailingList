Moreover, there's an error message\nshowing in the Terminal:\n\n*fatal - cannot open file \"/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/vchars.mta\", mode \"r\"*\n\nI sense my Radiance has got big problem. What does this error message mean?\n\nShould I reinstall Radiance?\n\nWhat are the correct and detailed procedures to install Radiance on Mac OS X\nSnow Leopard?\n\nThanks!\n\nJi\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 11, 2010 at 11:35 PM, John Mardaljevic <jm@dmu.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n--\nZHANG Ji ??
