{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\nI think that the idea of a collaborative effort to put together the\nRadiance documentation has been now around for quite a while, and\nbriefly discussed during the past workshop.\nI just thought it is about time to start working on it ...\nHave you tried to register your account? ;-)\n\n\nAs your eye has already suggested, it is largely inspired by Mark's\nmagnificent work, but it is only one of my naive attempts, I'm afraid\n:-/\nIt would be nice if each page had some pictures of random Radiance\nartwork, any volunteers?\n\nAmong the others ideas discussed, there was the possibility to formalise\nour community by starting a \"Radiance foundation\" (? la Apache\nhttp://www.apache.org/ for example), that is a non-profit/charity\norganisation that organises and manages Radiance related projects\n(like further development, setting up a wiki, writing documentation,\norganising workshops and so on ...) and can receive donations:\nhttp://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/SustainableOpenSource\n\nBut this is a different story ...\n\nCiao!\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<46C5BEB0.6030403@rumblestrip.org>", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1187391324.5528.23.camel@leviathan>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB503B4FF36@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "<1187306053.11778.17.camel@leviathan>", "<46C5BEB0.6030403@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Fri Aug 17 16:56:56 2007", "email": "pisuke at blueyonder.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Win Users and Radiance & Radiance KnowledgeBase"}
