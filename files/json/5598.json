If you use ACIS solids, you can use 3DSOUT (in\nAutoCAD) to export a polygonal model, then bring it back in with 3DSIN,\nthen back out with DXFOUT, then use dxf2rad to convert the geometry to a\nradiance scene description.  A bit circuitous, but it would work.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Win Users and Radiance", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<46C472DA.2050106@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB503B4FF36@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Aug 16 09:54:22 2007", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Win Users and Radiance"}
