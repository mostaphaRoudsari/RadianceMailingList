Yeah, I guess step zero is: \"get the developer tools installed on your system\". Sorry about that!\n\nThe developer tools (now called XCode) include the compiler and the program \"make\", which you need to compile the source code (and its absence on your system is causing all your error messages there). XCode is a free (but large) download from Apple:\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html\n\nYou have to create a developer account, but its free and amounts to a login/password. Grab XCode and install it, making sure you install all the X11 dev stuff, then go back to that ray directory and try rerunning ./makeall install and we'll go from there.\n\nOn Jun 11, 2010, at 11:30 AM, Ji Zhang ?? wrote:\n\n\nDear Rob, thank you very much for your detailed explanation!!!\n\nHowever, I still couldn't get the radiance installed in the default directories follow the steps suggested by you.\n\nThe following are the messages shown in the Terminal during installation (within the area maked by #):\n\n####################################################################\nJi-ZHANGs-iMac:ray jizhang$ sudo ./makeall install\n\nRADIANCE 4.0a INSTALLATION\n\nThis script rebuilds all of the Radiance programs and installs\nthem on your system.

The error means that the program could not open the file vchars.mta in a read-only capacity. Following a normal installation of Radiance on Mac OS X, that file should indeed live in /usr/local/lib/ray/meta and be read-only accessible to everyone.\n\nSo yeah it's possible that something didn't go right during installation. The correct and not-totally-detailed procedures for installing Radiance on the Mac are:\n\ngo to www.radiance-online.org<http://www.radiance-online.org/>, click the link on the left for \"download radiance\", and follow the procedures found under \"Download official release from this server\". Basically you grab the source code, and compile. Compiling on the Mac is easy, you run ./makeall install from the directory where you unpack the archive, and follow the prompts. You need to run this as an admin, and in Mac OS this is easy:\n\nsudo ./makeall install\n\nThis will prompt you for the administrator password, and then you just follow the prompts.\n\nNOTE: you must have the directory /usr/local/lib/ray already existing so the installer can place all the library files. This is done with\n\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/ray\n\nMaybe this was your problem the first time around? Here's a quick rundown of the steps:\n\n1. download http://www.radiance-online.org/software/rad3R9all.tar.gz\n2. at the command prompt, go to the directory where you saved the rad3R9all.tar.gz file\n3. type: gunzip < rad3R9all.tar.gz | tar xf -\n4. go to the archive directory (cd ray)\n5. create /usr/local/lib/ray directory if it does not exist (sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/ray)\n6. type sudo ./makeall install (supply admin password when asked)\n7. follow the prompts, responding to defaults; definitely answer 'y' when asked if you want to install libraries, accept default location\n8. make the PATH changes recommended after installation.\n\nGive that a go, and retry objline.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn Jun 11, 2010, at 10:37 AM, Ji Zhang ?? wrote:\n\n\nThanks, John!\n\nBut I think the rad file I used should be OK because it only contains five simple boxes and I can use rvu to generate a rendering for it.\n\nJust now I tried to use the table.rad file got from Axel Jacobs' tutorial and the objline still doesn't work. Moreover, there's an error message showing in the Terminal:\nfatal - cannot open file \"/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/vchars.mta\", mode \"r\"\n\nI sense my Radiance has got big problem.
