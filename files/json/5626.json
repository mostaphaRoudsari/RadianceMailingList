It should automatically check the input files every call of the rad command and update the .oct file if required, even without the -t option. The -t option is meant specially for a case that you want to update the .oct file, but not create any renderings from it.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100708/c33f2167/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rad program", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Thu Jul  8 15:03:00 2010"}
