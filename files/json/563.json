Only\ncomputed ambient values live in the ambient cache, and only computed\nambient values can be re-used elsewhere.  Yet another concept that\nseems obvious now, but didn't an hour ago.  OK, so the easy cheat is to\nexclude all the exterior objects from the ambient calculation, and live\nwith dark shadows on the mountain.  But Carsten says that the -ar is\nbased on the scene bounding cube, so even if I exclude the exterior\nvalues I need to crank it up, yes?\n\n\nI just wanna make sure I understand this.  This is the correct way to\nachieve what I asked at the end of my email, yes?  A method for using\nHDR lightmaps to illuminate the scene and have a pleasant (and\nphotometrically accurate) view out the window?  This would be, in a\nword, cool.\n\nAs I have never used colorpict and have limited experience with illum,\nI just wanna make sure I get this:\n1. I take a hemispherical HDR image of the site.\n2. Colorpict and the fisheye.cal file takes the highres picture, and\napplies it to a plane, and is rotated into the proper orientation.  Can\nyou explain the fish_u fish_v parameters?\n3. An illum source is created from the low res version of the pic,\nmapped to the same polygon?  Why do you use a low res image for the\nillum?\n\nThe illum's luminous distribution function is the result of applying\nthe lightmap to the window pane, just the same as if I were to use\ngensky?  The colorpict is purely for the view out, it does not\ncontribute to the illuminance of the interior space?\n\nSeems like a lot of work, 'specially for this brain, but it could be\nworth it.  In the short term, I think I need to try one of the other\ntacks.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3171FA4E-94F8-11D7-B9F1-000393824274@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 2 Jun 2003 08:46:13 -0400", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes"}
