I like Python\nbecause of the computer science attitudes which underly its design: it\nis readable (at least if one grew up with a European language),\nreliable, and *small*--the manual for the basic language can be read in\nan hour, though the libraries are extensive.\n\nRhino 5 is planned to use the .NET implementation of Python as its\nprimary scripting language, though other .NET languages will be\navailable.\n--\nRandolph Fritz ?
