{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nWe are still short on registrations for the upcoming workshop, and\nhave room for additional presentations as well.  If you have been\nthinking about coming, Minneapolis is lovely this time of year, and\nwe hope you can make it -- it's not too late.\n\nTo round out the talks, we've decided to hold a few tutorial\nsessions.  One will be given by Zack Rogers of Architectural Energy\nCorporation on his Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool (SPOT),\nexplaining its design and use.  I plan to give a tutorial on image-\nbased lighting, demonstrating HDR image capture, using mksources and\nusing a captured lighting environment to illuminate synthetic\nobjects.  I may give another tutorial on rtcontrib as well, depending\non time constraints.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DA9728D8-A8A0-440B-83F0-076B03E97F6B@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Sep 17 15:47:46 2007", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Workshop update"}
