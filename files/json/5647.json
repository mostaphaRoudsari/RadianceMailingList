I saw some posts discussing about this\nproblems (e.g.\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/interests/light/rtrace-multiprocessing-option-initial-test-results/\n).\n\n(1) I have some questions about the usage of rtrace. There are two options\n\"i\", \"I\" (one lower i and one upper i). I checked the manual page.\nbut I am still confused with their difference.\n\n(2) What is the option \"-h\" (in rtrace) used for? I run several times but do\nnot see any header information.\n\n(3) There are interior blinds installed. If I first use mkillum to make the\nwindow as a secondary light source, and then run rtrace, in this case the\nprogram runs twice to get the illuminance value. Does this way make running\nfaster than directly using rtrace (only once)?  I input the model from\nRevit and thus the window object is connected in the .rad file and therefore\nIt is not easy to use mkillum (To use mkillum requires either (1) not\nto import window from revit and to generate window in Radiance or (2) cut\nand paste the window .rad to a separate .rad file?)\n\n(4) For mutiprocessing, besides the option \"-n\",  is there any other\noptions I should pay attention to? I use Python script, and should I set\nother\noptions related to Python itself?\n\nAs always, thank you for your help.\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100713/a5f9834a/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Tue Jul 13 19:28:08 2010"}
