So probably one\nshould start with getting some relieable data measured by one of the\nlabs offering such service.\n\n\nI have not done a validation in the meaning of comparing with analytical\nand measurement results. However this is one of the core use cases for\nthe pmap extension. The pmap approach would be by doing an accurate\ngeometrical description and have mkpmap do the forward tracing. As far\nas I understand you are interested in the angular-dependent reflectance\nof the prism sheet in you case, so maybe using a good fit to measurement\ndata would also be an option (in that case with \"classic\" Radiance).\n\n\nYou can do all this, but be aware that using the pmap means quite a lot\nof fine-tuning. I have modeled light ducts with prism sheets, and got\nsome result, but as I said I have not been able to validate it yet\nagainst measured data. In my opinion doing such comparisions is the\ncritical task...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100714/54e10314/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Prismatic glazings", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
