By the way,\nshould I\njust specify a name of ambient file at the beginning ? The program will\ncreate the\nambient with the specified name automatically ?\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100714/77d1d90b/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrac", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Wed Jul 14 10:19:33 2010"}
