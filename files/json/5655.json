However according to what you wrote\nearlier I would rethink the idea to take only one reading. You mentioned\nhaving blinds. If the sensor is hit by the sun, it will give readings\nseveral magnitudes higher then a sensor just some centimeters aside, as\nblinds would typically cast very distinct shadows. You would not find\nthis in you single reading. To detect such cases, it may be useful to\nhave a grid of sensors instead and, beside the illuminance, monitor also\nthe deviation of all the sensors at the same sky condition as an\nindicator of how representive you sensor reading is.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100714/c227ae3d/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrac", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
