{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have a question on gensky. It is stated in the manual that \"If the\ntime is preceded by a plus sign ('+'), then it is interpreted as local\nsolar time instead.\" However, I use the following command:\ngensky 3 21 +10.00EST -a 40.77 -o 73.967\nThe program echoes:\ngensky: bad time format: +10.00EST\n\nI look into gensky.c and find out that\nif ( (tsolar = *cp == '+') ) cp++;\nif (tsolar || !isalpha(*cp)) {\nfprintf(stderr, \"%s: bad time format: %s\\n\", progname, hs);\nexit(1);\n}\nIf tsolar is 1, then the program will exit. Does it mean that the\nlocal solar time is not supported? Thanks.\n\nYu Sheng\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Sheng Yu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<396328780709121351n5d3109d0gdec947bd48962807@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Sep 12 14:52:36 2007", "email": "mintsheng at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gensky"}
