Upgrading from gcc\n4.3.2 to 4.4.4 resulted in a ~7-15% performance boost for the\nRadiance benchmark test on my AMD Phenom system. If you have a\nsimilar software/hardware setup as me, and the ability to upgrade\nyour compiler to gcc 4.4.4, I'd strongly suggest doing so. Also,\nif you have the time to run the benchmark, I'd like to add your\nresults to the database:\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench.html\n\nMy system:\nAMD Phenom 9850 (4 core at 2.5 GHz)\nFedora 12, gcc 4.4.4\nRadiance 4.0 (April) built with\n-O2 -ffast-math -funroll-loops\n\nFun fact: the two benchmarks vary in difficulty by 26.6x, so we\ncan calculate that an 8-core Xeon system from 2008 runs Radiance\nalmost 1000x faster than the oldest computer that I've\nbenchmarked: a 133MHz K-5 in 1999.\n\nMark\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Thu Jul 15 09:39:56 2010"}
