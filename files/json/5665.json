What is your practice of adding or revising geometry in\nRadiance?\n\nThank you for sharing your experience,\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100715/21ecfe2b/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Thu Jul 15 12:47:58 2010"}
