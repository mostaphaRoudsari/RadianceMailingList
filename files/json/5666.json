There is less than a week until the abstract deadline,\nand just three weeks until the workshop is held, and we have many\nslots left to fill.  I am just starting to work on my abstracts, too.\n\nhttp://www.dtc.umn.edu/cgi-bin/seminars/symposia/radiance.php\n\nIt should be an exciting workshop, and Minneapolis is pretty nice\nthis time of year.  I hope to see you there!\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A1380E95-5893-444D-A8E0-224F1A3020FD@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Sep  7 13:17:28 2007", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance workshop"}
