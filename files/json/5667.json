In Radiance, I will add some other geometries (not\ncomplicated), such as lighting, blinds , simple furniture and windows.\nAnother reason I want to know the coordinates is that when I adjust\nsome view parameters such as the view point I also need to know the\ncoordinate.\n\nThank you,\n\nJia\n\nOn Thu, Jul 15, 2010 at 4:07 PM, Jack de Valpine <jedev@visarc.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100715/5ad19070/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] revising geometr", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Thu Jul 15 13:15:56 2010"}
