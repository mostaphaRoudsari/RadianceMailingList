{"body": "\n\nYes, though you could set -ar 0 and you might get around this problem.\nThe disadvantage is that the calculation can go a bit nuts in the\nlittle corners, but it's only a problem on high-resolution renderings.\nRtrace shouldn't be much affected.\n\n\nThe fish_u and fish_v parameters are computed lookups into the image\nthat convert angles looking out the window into pixel positions.  See\nChapter 4 in RwR for details.\n\n\nYou could use mkillum to compute the distribution, but the effect would\nbe to reduce the resolution of the original image, which can be done\nmuch faster with pfilt.\n\n\nNo, it's the same as if you used mkillum.  The only difference is that\nrpict -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 computes the window's light distribution\nfrom a single viewpoint, where mkillum would average it over the entire\nwindow.  If your window is small relative to the closest geometry, the\ndifference is vanishingly small.\n\n\nIt's actually not that difficult -- try it.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C3B0CB9B-95E2-11D7-8C3D-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 3 Jun 2003 09:45:20 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes"}
