{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI am very interested in this topic, but I`m not sure if I understood\ncorrectly, I must admit I`m still starting to understand Radiance.\n\nBasically, as I understand, Carsten`s and Greg`s methods differ in that the\nfirst maps the image in a plane situated outside the window and the second\n(through an 'ad hoc' function) directly on the window plane. My question is\nthis:\n\n- If one maps the image in a plane outside the window there will be some\nparalax error (though minimum) which can be reduced with distance\n- And if the plane is on the window this should be noticeable\n- Or does it work like mkillum? would sun patches appear inside the room?\n- Or else: is there any way to map a HDR image in a source, something in the\nway skies are generated (maybe replacing the skyfunc?) and then use it as\nany other sky and/or ground? Somehow, for me this seems to be the most\nnatural solution.\n\nI hope all this makes any sense. Thank you for your help. Best,\n\nSantiago.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "sender": "Santiago Torres", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ABEIIOCILNBBDDEPEPICEEGLCAAA.tiago@tkh.att.ne.jp>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 4 Jun 2003 03:12:05 +0900", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes"}
