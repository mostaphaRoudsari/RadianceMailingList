The default for rtrace is to\ncalculate all the lines in the input file. But if you have a file with\n1000 points you will not see the results before the last of these\npoints has been calculated. Therefore you may want to split your input\nin smaller files of say 100 lines each or set \"-x\" to 100. Then rtrace\nwill write out the results for every group of 100 lines. Don't set\n\"-x\" too low, however, or you will notice a slow down of the\ncalculation.\n\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rtrac", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue Jul 20 02:31:23 2010"}
