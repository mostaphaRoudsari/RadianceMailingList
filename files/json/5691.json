By itself, the -aa\nparameter AFFECTS the distance between ambient values, but it does not\ndictate them.  The spacing actually depends on how close nearby\ngeometry is.  If there is nothing nearby, then ambient values may be\nspaced very far apart.  You really need to go back to my original\npaper and understand what is going on with the interpolation:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg88/paper.html\n\nThe -ar setting gets used with -aa and the overall scene dimensions to\ndetermine a minimum spacing between values.  This avoids having\ninfinite calculation density at inside corners and other places where\nobjects are right next to and \"see\" each other.  If you set -ar 0,\nthen it guarantees accuracy everywhere, but at a potentially large\nexpense, as you end up computing a new hemispherical sampling at each\npixel for certain parts of the image.  Combined with a -ab setting\ngreater than 1, you can end up with a very long calculation, indeed.\n\nDon't worry about what the exact spacing value is.  It doesn't\nmatter.  All that matters is the scale over which you maintain the\naccuracy set by the -aa parameter.  Once your objects are closer to\neach other than the maximum scene dimension divided by the -ar\nsetting, you will gradually lose accuracy.  There is nothing more to\nsay on the topic.  Read the code in src/rt/ambient.c if you want to\nunderstand exactly what is happening.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ar and aa", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Jul 20 11:53:44 2010"}
