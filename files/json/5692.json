In addition to the radiance value, a maximum radius for shadow\ntesting is given:\nmod glow id\n0\n0\n4 red green blue maxrad\nIf maxrad is zero, then the surface will never be tested for shadow,\nalthough it may participate in an interreflection calculation. If\nmaxrad is negative, then the surface will never contribute to scene\nillumination. Glow sources will never illuminate objects on the other\nside of an illum surface. This provides a convenient way to illuminate\nlocal light fixture geometry without overlighting nearby objects.\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100720/39151e48/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] illum examples", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue Jul 20 11:59:06 2010"}
