I also made some\nexperiment and discover:\n\n(1) the maximum \"influence radius\" is not equal to sceneSize/ar but\ninfluenced by aa and ar.\n(2) the minimum \"influence radius\" is equal to sceneSize * aa /ar and it\nhappens in the complex geometry, e.g, corner.\n(3) If a sample ray falls within the \"influence radius\", it will get ambient\nvalue by interpolation of cached ambient value.\n\nBy the way, I can not search such terms as \"-ar\" or \"ar\" in the mailing list\narchives because the system warns it is not a valid word.\n\nThanks for patience.\nJia\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 20, 2010 at 2:53 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100721/6089f9c1/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ar and aa", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Wed Jul 21 09:52:57 2010"}
