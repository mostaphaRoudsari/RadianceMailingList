Responses\ninline:\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nCentroids are counted down frmo 1.041667 to 0.041667.  The first value\nis greater than 1 to trick linear interpolation at the pole (theta=0)\ninto making all azimuthal values equal there.  The data for the first\ncolumn is synthesized so interpolation at theta=0 gets the average of\nall second column values.  The final value of 0.041667 is the centroid\nof the lowest angle (theta=1.529 radians).  It's not possible to\nmeasure anything at theta=pi/2.\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\nAs defined in illum.cal, the altitude is equal to cos(theta), which is\nconveniently the same as the dot product of an incoming ray with the\nsurface normal.  This is used because an even subdivision of this\nparameter gives a equal-area projection of regions corresponding to\neven energy subdivision on a diffuse planar surface.\n\n\nI hope these hints are helpful.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum-generated distribution files", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Jul 21 11:27:07 2010"}
