Would be great to have the book available again! If\nissues with printers are a problem (issues != legal stuff) I'm willing to help.\nThere are various places which sell PDF documentation and printed books about\nopen source software and I'm sure they would be willing to help. Unfortunately I\nknow nothing about what to do with/against booksurge - as it seems they're owned\nby amazon now: http://www.booksurge.com/ and you should be able to transition\nyour books over to amazon/createspace:\nhttps://www.createspace.com/Special/L/TransitionGuide.jsp?ref=459373&utm_id=4985\n\nMaybe that helps.\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\nOn 03/07/2010 06:40 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                            Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nhttp://bzed.de                                http://www.debian.org\nGPG Fingerprints: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\nECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485 DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"Rendering with Radiance\" (non-)availabilit", "tags": [], "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "datetime": "Sat Jul 24 16:41:05 2010"}
