It's also based\non the CIE overcast sky so it matters which part of the sky you can\nsee. Is that the same concept as your \"Facade Sky View Factor\"?\n\n\nDoes that include the reflected part?\n\n\nFor the direct part simply use \"-I -ab 1\" in your rtrace command (or\n\"-i -ab 1\" if you want to calculate pictures):\n\necho \"0 0 2 0 1 0\" | rtrace -w -h -ab 1 -I scene.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)*179' > facade_direct.lux\n\nThen calculate the total of direct and reflected component by\nincreasing \"-ab\" to an appropriate value:\n\necho \"0 0 2 0 1 0\" | rtrace -w -h -ab 4 -I scene.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)*179' > facade_total.lux\n\nThe reflected light is the difference between total and and direct\ncomponent. You can also render images and subtract the images from\neach other. See the 'pcomb' command for details.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<AANLkTinu4ARdHpmWnL3M1aPFqyyot3ntD42fDPuonGF7@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon Jul 26 01:32:00 2010"}
