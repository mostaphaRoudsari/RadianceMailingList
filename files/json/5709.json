The\ncalculation is pretty simple, though.  Just subtract the \"excluded\"\nfrom the \"included\" Y values and divide by the the \"included\" Y\nmeasurement to get the specular percentage for a metallic material\nwith colored highlights.  For a plastic material, the specular\nfraction is the \"included\" minus the \"excluded\" Y over 100 (assuming a\n0-100% scale for Y).\n\nThe material color is the \"included\" Yxy converted to RGB for metal,\nand the \"excluded\" Yxy converted to RGB for plastic.  The conversions\nare given in ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal.  You can quickly spit out\nthe matrix coefficients for this conversion using:\n\nrcalc -n -f xyz_rgb.cal -o cmat.fmt\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<i2kpfv$nu5$1@dough.gmane.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Jul 26 13:40:51 2010"}
