{"body": "\n\nHi\n\nI am new to Radiance so I hope that you will be forgiving if my question has an obvious answer or if I am writing to the wrong list.\n\nI would like to use Radiance with my own (measured) sky luminance distribution rather than using gensky to create a standard sky luminance distribution.\n\nI have been looking at various manuals and userguides I have found online but seem unable to find any information relating specifically to this subject. Is it possible to do this? And if so how is it done?\n\nThanks for your help\n\nBest Regards\n\nJohannes Utoft Christensen\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nJetzt neu!
