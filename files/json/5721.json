{"body": "\nHi Tom,\n\nOne workflow option, much as I dislike suggesting it, is perhaps to use\nSketchup as an intermediate. It looks like Vectorworks will save out an\nskp. Sketchup (commercial version) can then save out an obj format file,\nwhich can be converted with obj2rad. I have very limited experience with\nSketchup, but in my few experiences, I have found that the models are\nvery very hefty. Another alternative is to save out as 3ds and use\n3ds2rad, however there are limitations to this dealing with data sizing\nfor the file format.\n\n-Jack\n\nTom Young wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<471DEC69.6090706@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<DIIE.00001C26000268F1@192.168.0.81>", "<DC5F0632-A893-4754-943A-DA681EB0B545@mac.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 05:43:42 2007", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dxf2rad"}
