My first guess however would be a change in the default\nparameters. That would mean that you may be running rtrace with\ndifferent settings without even knowing it. Please do a quick check by\nrunning \"rtrace -defaults\" on both platforms and check for differences\nin the output.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n--\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
