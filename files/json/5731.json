I have written a Ruby script to export\nSketchup models\nto Radiance and I'm about to finish and release it soon (I keep\nsaying that\nfor 2 weeks now...). Sketchup has some nice features (like n-sided\npolygons\nand a total lack of complex geometric primitives) that can be translated\nnicely into Radiance. It has not seen much testing (yet) and if Tom\nneeds\na solution today I can only offer a work in progress.\n\nAnyway, Sketchup doesn't make the models 'hefty'; it's the users. If you\nhave a messy model in Sketchup/Vectorworks/Autocad it will end in a\nmessy\nmodel in Radiance.\n\nI remember that there is another script around which was presented at\nthe\nfirst Radiance Workshop in Fribourgh years ago. That might have seen\nsome\nfurther development and be in a more user friendly state.\n\nOther options: does Vectorworks offer a scripting API? A very simple\nRadiance exporter should not be hard to do and can probably be derived\nfrom a sample script (access to the 3D faces is all that's required).\n\nYou could use Blender and Francesco's or my own export scripts. The\nbiggest problem is to find a format of the DXF file that Blender can\nunderstand. But that's the problem of all export-import-export tool\nchains (and ultimately of the DXF file format).\n\nFinally, I have written a partial DXF to Radiance converter in Python\nonce. It was written with one particular DXF file in mind and I don't\nthink I even added support for 3D faces. If you have a small DXF example\nI could see if it works and perhaps add bit to support the most basic\nfiles. I stopped playing around with that because I couldn't work out\nsome problems with transformations. But if Vectorworks exports to a\nplain\n3D space it should be fine.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<59F80A78-BBB8-412C-9F9B-6D8DC4042DA6@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<DIIE.00001C26000268F1@192.168.0.81>", "<DC5F0632-A893-4754-943A-DA681EB0B545@mac.com>", "<471DEC69.6090706@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 11:42:14 2007", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dxf2rad"}
