{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nWell that is interesting about Sketchup models. And to clarify, my\nexperience has really been in trying to take client built sketchup\nmodels and get them into something useful. So my experience biased by\nbig not very well built/organized models provided by others. I guess the\nthing that I am glad to hear is that like any modeling tool, if well\nused and controlled, you can get something useful out of it. I would\ncertainly be interested in trying your translator if and when you feel\nit is ready to share.\n\nBest,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nThomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<471E4582.7050304@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<DIIE.00001C26000268F1@192.168.0.81>\t<DC5F0632-A893-4754-943A-DA681EB0B545@mac.com>\t<471DEC69.6090706@visarc.com>", "<59F80A78-BBB8-412C-9F9B-6D8DC4042DA6@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 12:03:54 2007", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dxf2rad"}
