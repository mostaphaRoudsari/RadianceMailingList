It doesn't even look if you\nhave a modifier in front of the material in the chain (e.g., you\nreference a pattern before the material).\n\nI recently made a change that allows Radiance to find ordinary sources\nwhen the source material is further down the modifier chain or\nalias'ed, but I didn't do this for virtual source materials, whose\nsurfaces must still be modified directly.  Actually, I should make the\nchange so aliases and intervening modifiers work properly with virtual\nsource material types -- there's no reason not to.   This still won't\nwork for mixtures, in any case.\n\nMixtures don't make a lot of sense for sources or virtual source\nmaterials the way Radiance is designed, in my opinion.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mixfunc for dichroic film?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Mar  1 18:53:31 2004"}
