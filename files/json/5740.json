I don't understand what you mean by this. I am assuming that all materials are diffuse, but, as Thomas said, I wish to treat the image as a emitted radiance in an image-based illumination scheme, and I wish to compute the irradiance for every point in the scene under the condition that the backprojected HDR image is the only energy in the scene.\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 4. august 2010 21:47\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nJust an idea... if you assume all materials to be lambertian, you just need the reflectance of any visible surface to be able to calculate the irradiance it receives...?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com\nVersion: 9.0.851 / Virus Database: 271.1.1/3050 - Release Date: 08/04/10 06:45:00\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Computing irradiances for glow materials", "tags": [], "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "datetime": "Thu Aug  5 05:48:11 2010"}
