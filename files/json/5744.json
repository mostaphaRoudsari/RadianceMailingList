You can try\nmultiple exposures to widen the dynamic range, but in any case you need\ncalibration. I would recommend spending some time with an integrating\nsphere to calibrate the response and to validate the results over the\ndynamic range you expect to cover.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100805/19e326f7/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Computing irradiances for glow materials", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
