{"body": "\n\nI know how to model 3D with SKETCHUP ver 5.5 but I prefer to to do it with\nECOTEC 5.5, although it is not so powerful as SKP.\n\nUnless you expect to run SKETCHUP in Linux in the future, ECOTEC ver 5.5 +\nRADTOOLS  (Interface to RADIANCE) + RADIANCE 3.7 (compiled for Windows,\nthanks F. Anselmo) do the job very well and easily.\n\nECOTECT in demo version gives you two hours free to work each time you open\nthe software, RADTOOLS (thanks Marsh) it is not time controlled it is\ntotally free!\n\nIf you need more than 2 hours to model, I think it`s possible break the\nmodel in parts of the building, and then rebuild it in RADIANCE, but usually\nit is not necessary.\n\nIt is also possible to import 3DS files exported from SKETCHUP, if you fell\ncomfortable with it.\n\nI think that`s a very good  solution to model a architectonic space and\nsimulate daylighting in Windows OS domain.\n\n\nregards,\n\nVangelis\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071024/493daa00/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 44, Issue 17", "sender": "Evangelos Christakou", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<dc928a050710241242x14535dd1k7b16e260a0abdda@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<20071024181318.8DA36539BEF@C2B3-POP3.unb.br>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct 24 12:42:52 2007", "email": "vangelis at unb.br", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 44, Issue 17"}
