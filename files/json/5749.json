What Is the best\nmethod for a beginner to start making 3D modeling to use in Daysim?\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Lars O.\nGrobe\nSent: Thursday, August 05, 2010 5:12 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nOne other hint... for anyone who is entering the world of building\nmodels, I can recommend formZ. It combines CAD and modelling features\nand supports a broad range of 2d and 3d formats. We have used it with\nsuccess to create models for Radiance via dxf (and then Schorsch's\ndxf2rad) and obj, and I have also verified that you could even use\nbrlcad as a converter to keep all CAD data in IGES and convert\niges-obj-Radiance (that would mean a neutral CAD standard linked to\nRadiance).\n\nHowever the most important is to learn modeling for simulation is\ndifferent from producing architectural drawings. And... I usually use a\ntext editor for that reason, no CAD.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radout", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Fri Aug  6 07:12:21 2010"}
