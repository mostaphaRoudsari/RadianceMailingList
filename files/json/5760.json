{"body": "\nHi Lucio!\n\nI think it is necessary to give you a hint before you start this. Every simulation tries to approach the reality of a system. That means you must know the system you want to simulate before you can select a simulation technique.\n\nRadiance is a simulation application that was made with architectural / building models in mind. You can simulate lots of effects that are relevant in finding glare, getting the illumination levels (e.g. to decide if lighting is efficient for a given use of a space) etc. On the other hand, Radiance was not developed to e.g. model the effects of reflector or lense systems. It is a question of scale, materials, effects relevent for the application.\n\nSo what I want to explain is - it does not make sense to find out \"how accurate\" Radiance is. If you have a problem to solve (e.g. simulating a given type of facade, or modeling a new material), it will be easy to find out if Radiance is a suiteable tool. And only than, people will be interested in accuracy (qualitive or/and quantitive).\n\nIn other words, I am (and I guess others are, too) curious what system (building, solar system, christmas tree) you want to simulate, and what effects are important and determine accuracy for you...\n\nGood luck, CU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Looking for some pubblications for my thesys.", "sender": "Lars Grobe", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20071030171648.226010@gmx.net>", "refs": ["<JQQ3WP$EB6394470EABEBCCDE05A87FB53C0F6F@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Tue Oct 30 10:17:10 2007", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Looking for some pubblications for my thesys."}
