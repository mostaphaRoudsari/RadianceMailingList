For the Rhino\nscripting this would probably not be a big deal but I am not even aware\nif there is a Radiance 64-bit version. Maybe somebody else on this list\nknows?\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Maria\nMandalaki\nSent: Monday, August 09, 2010 6:32 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nI would like to ask if there is a version of Diva for Rhino for a 64-bit\nPC.

The plug-in, called DIVA-for-Rhino, supports a series of\nperformance evaluations including:\n\n\n\n- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)\n\n- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)\n\n- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)\n\n- Glare analysis (Evalglare)\n\n- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)\n\n\n\nThe plug-in offers a highly optimized simulation workflow within\nRhinoceros and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in\norder to generate animated Radiance/Daysim simulations.\n\nMore information can be found at\nwww.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. You can download the\nplug-in from www.diva-for-rhino.com.\n\n\n\nHappy simulations!\n\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec, Kera Lagios and Jeff Niemasz\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100809/246a0942/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] DIVA-for-Rhi", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Mon Aug  9 06:26:10 2010"}
