Because I don't have a reliable city model, I was\nthinking of creating a 'second sun', i.e. reflection, in the sky and\nlink the intensity of the second sun to the actual sun and reflection\nproperties of a window. I would locate the sun within the view through\nthe window.\n\n\n\nI was thinking of adding another line into my sky file, however am not\ntotally sure how to exactly do this and was hoping that someone here\ncould help me with this.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nChris\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\nChristoph Begert\nAssociate\n\nsbe\n\nsustainable built environments\n\nInnovative ideas, collaborative design, practical solutions\n\n\n\nMelbourne\nLevel 2, 525 Flinders St\nMelbourne Victoria 3000\nAustralia\nT:   +61 3 9923 2345\nF:   +61 3 9923 2346\nE:  christoph.begert@sbe.com.au\nW:  www.sbe.com.au <http://www.sbe.com.au/>\n\n\n\nSydney\nLevel 6, 61 Market Street\nSydney NSW 2000\nAustralia\nT:   +61 2 8289 5720\nF:   +61 2 9286 3745\n\nPerth Agent  Encycle\nLevel 10, 200 St Georges Terrace\nPO Box 7620\nCloisters Square\nPerth WA 6000\nAustralia\nT:   +61 8 9321 8760\nF:   +61 8 9485 0575\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSBE - Winners of:\n\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Architects (Tasmanian Chapter) - 2010\n\nSustainable Architecture Award for the design of University of Tasmania\nSchool of Furniture Design as Architects in collaboration with Six\nDegrees.\n\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Architects (Tasmanian Chapter) - 2010\n\nPublic Architecture Award  for the design of University of Tasmania\nSchool of Furniture Design as Architects in collaboration with Six\nDegrees.\n\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Architects (Victorian Chapter) - 2010\n\nPublic Architecture Award.
