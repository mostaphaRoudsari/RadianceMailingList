{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nThomas you have made an excellent contribution to the radiance community\nwith your SketchUP exporter. I assume this script would also work with\nthe free Google Version of SketchUP as well. That software was of\nlimited use to radiance modelling as it did not have the 3DS converter\navailable in the PRO version.\n\nA point here, for the Google SketchUP (free version) users would be for\nthe user to manually modify the 'sky' file for location and orientation\nas that option works differently from the PRO version of SketchUP.\n\nTo this effect a couple of extra comments in the 'sky' file for the\nnovices would be useful.\n\nWith regards to accuracy of modelling using SketchUP, simply use the\nmouse to indicate direction and then enter the distance with the\nkeyboard. This allows wonderful unit conversions on the fly during data\nentry. For example say your units  are in metres and you want an offset\nof 50mm, type 50mm or 2\" and SketchUP will do the rest! It even\nunderstands entries such as 2\",100mm for a rectangle.\n\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845 Western Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Sketchup exporter script", "sender": "Terrance McMinn", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<092BF7A1BC389E489A69DC764F23CD870D5C7969@exmsp2.perth.ad.curtin.edu.au>", "refs": ["<EXFE1bIv1vDfrwV0JmF0001afab@email.curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct 31 23:05:20 2007", "email": "T.McMinn at curtin.edu.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Sketchup exporter script"}
