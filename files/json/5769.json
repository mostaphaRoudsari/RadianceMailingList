The RAD material of course would\ngive the plane the correct VLT.\n\nHowever, when I model two planes the light is decreased because the first\npane lets in X% (vlt) and then the second pane further reduces it by X%\nagain.\n\nI would like a material that takes into account that there are two planes\nphysically modeled. Reason being I am importing a significant amount of\nwindows from a revit model consuming of many family objects all containing\nwindows with physically two planes of geometry glazing.\n\nI don't know all the tricks to writing material definitions, so I ask is\nthere a material function that will take into account the extra plane of\ngeometry and still give me the correct VLT? Or is it just a simple\nmathematical formula that will equal the VLT I need. (e.g. 85% + 85% =\n72.25%).\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100812/50b0ef56/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Single pane vs Double pane geometr", "tags": [], "sender": "Nick Hubof", "datetime": "Thu Aug 12 15:32:02 2010"}
