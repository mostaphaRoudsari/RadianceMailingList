It doesn't even look if you\nhave a modifier in front of the material in the chain (e.g., you\nreference a pattern before the material).\n\nI recently made a change that allows Radiance to find ordinary sources\nwhen the source material is further down the modifier chain or\nalias'ed, but I didn't do this for virtual source materials, whose\nsurfaces must still be modified directly.  Actually, I should make the\nchange so aliases and intervening modifiers work properly with virtual\nsource material types -- there's no reason not to.   This still won't\nwork for mixtures, in any case.\n\nMixtures don't make a lot of sense for sources or virtual source\nmaterials the way Radiance is designed, in my opinion.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "gward@lmi.net", "datetime": "Tue Mar  2 10:13:51 2004"}
