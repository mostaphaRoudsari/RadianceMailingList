A falsecolor image generated from an irradiance image (-i\noption to rpict: rif file has line 'render= -i') gives an illuminance\nof around 400 lux in the middle of the room. Using rtrace I get an\nilluminance of about 210 lux in the middle of the room. (I'm using an\nirradiance image for the -i option in falsecolor and a radiance image\nfor the -p option).\n\nThe rtrace I'm using is as per Axel Jacobs tutorial: echo \"61.292\n27.490 0 0 0 1' | rtrace -I -h -ov octrees/south.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=179*$1' This should work with the octree- same as what I generated\nthe image from-  should it not?\n\nJohn.\n\n\n\n\nJOHN FORD\n\nBLUEBOTTLE\nFORTY THREE STAWELL STREET\nNORTH MELBOURNE 3051\nPHONE  03 9329 0709\nFAX 03 9329 1780\n\nWWW.BB3.NET.AU\nJOHNFORD@BB3.NET.AU\nMOBILE 0411 519 738\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nSkipped content of type multipart/related\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Ford", "datetime": "Sun Aug 15 19:34:23 2010"}
