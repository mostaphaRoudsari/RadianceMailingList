Isn't that perhaps a little low of 4* 18 watt tube lights ( they're old? )?\nI just read in the HDRI book that your hdr viewer has 5000 cd/m2? Pretty impressive..\n\nCheers,\n\n-jelle\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100818/48880a00/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "jelle feringa", "datetime": "Wed Aug 18 07:44:01 2010"}
