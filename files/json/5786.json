This is because\n99% of the exports to AutoCAD from Revit are meant for drafting\nbackground to send off to other people. So it groups things by what\nthey are based upon the AIA layer standard by default. While you can\nedit that, you can't make it do a 'by material' export to AutoCAD\nlayers. Well, at least not easily.\n\nIf you file link the same DWG into Max or Viz, all the materials come\nalong, and you get a very usable model. You then in turn export that\nto .OBJ, and then use OBJ2RAD to make it into a Radiance file. I've\ndone it several times with good results: http://www.becausewecan.org/\nnode/190\n\nAll in all the Revit models themselves tend to be very clean and\n'watertight' so they work pretty well.\n\nSucks that you have to use Max or Viz as a file converter to get from\nRevit to Radiance. But I beleive that in the near future more file\nexport options will be included in Revit, so that might change soon.\n\nAs for BIM being disruptive, I agree wholeheartedly. As someone who's\ndone a lot with it over the last six years, I see potential there for\nit to change a lot of how our industry works.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nJeffrey McGrew\nwww.becausewecan.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dxf2rad", "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3B6D3239-8FC1-45E4-8F7E-F51A59368898@becausewecan.org>", "refs": ["<DIIE.00001C26000268F1@192.168.0.81>\t<DC5F0632-A893-4754-943A-DA681EB0B545@mac.com>\t<471DEC69.6090706@visarc.com>\t<59F80A78-BBB8-412C-9F9B-6D8DC4042DA6@arcor.de>", "<471E4582.7050304@visarc.com> <471E4DD5.3080106@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Thu Oct 25 10:57:16 2007", "email": "toast at becausewecan.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dxf2rad"}
