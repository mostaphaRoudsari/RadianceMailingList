Having two....? Is it that the\norder the source objects are defined determine their \"diameter\"? The\ntypical example is the sky and sun combination, both of type source.\nUsually I have the gensky-output first including the sun disk, and the\nhemispheres for sky and ground after that (and added by hand). Does this\nmean that, because of their order in the scene description, the sun\nsource is \"inside\" the sky source? And does it make a difference whether\nthe source objects are modified by light or by glow? So if I could\nhandle the sun as glow, would it still \"override\" the sky background\nbecause of the order of its definition?\n\nSorry for not finding this out myself now in the source code, maybe\nsomeone can shed some light on this?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100822/294da879/smime.bin\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
