Hm, of course we have the\nchoice between various sky models and related generators, Mark's work\nbeing the latest addition. What is it that you are missing? Cloud\npatterns? Spectral distribution? Or the uber-gensky creating a\ndistribution from a simulation of athmosphere, sources etc itself so\nthat we could finally do light simulations on Mars' trabants?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100824/7e8ed17d/smime-0001.bin\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Simulating Real Skies", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
