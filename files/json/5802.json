You end up filling the indirect irradiance cache, which takes some time even on 4 processors.  I would recommend either reducing the number of bounces, or taking advantage of a path tracing approach like so:\n\nrtrace -w -h -I -ab 7 -n 4  -ad 2048 -as 0 -aa 0 -lw 1e-5 -lr -10 -u+ office.oct < points.inp\n\nSetting -aa 0 and -lw 1e-4 limits the number of paths to roughly 100,000 per point, which should run pretty quickly while maintaining accuracy.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Reduce rtrace runtim", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Aug 30 18:55:24 2010"}
