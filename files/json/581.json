{"body": "\nIf you photograph or render a fisheye view, you don't have to bother\nwith the spheremap nonsense.  A fisheye view of the sky can replace\ngensky.  Likewise for a fisheye view out the window.  If you want both\nthe sky and the ground for every possible viewpoint (rather than just\nout the window), you'll need one fisheye up and one fisheye down (from\nan bird's eye view).  As I recommended for the window, you should use a\nlower resolution image for the light distribution than you use for the\nview.  You'll learn a lot by trying the example I suggested in my\nearlier e-mail.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D78BA6E2-96C0-11D7-AB3D-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 4 Jun 2003 12:15:02 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes"}
