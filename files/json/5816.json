I initially thought that it was that there\nno values found so no images were created for certain patches, but there are\ndefinitely some \"black\" images being created, so I ruled that out. Good to\nknow about the -bn option. Thank you.\n\nThis new option to dctimestep is awesome!!! Definitely makes quick work of\nwhat I'm currently trying to do in bash and it's giving me a headache. I'll\ncheck it out now. Thanks to you and Greg I assume?\n\n=8-)\n\nDid I say thank you?\n\n- Rob\n\nP.S. Thank you. A beer for you and a root beer for Greg.\n\nOn 8/31/10 4:19 PM, \"Andy McNeil\" <amcneil@lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtcontrib questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Tue Aug 31 15:28:45 2010"}
