{"body": "\nTom,\nif you ar refering to Gerog Mischlers dxf2rad I am afraid you are out of luck. Since the sourcecode is not available and Schorsch has obviously disapered you might want to try a differrent route. But maybe OSX can run Linux ELF binaries? That could be an option.\nWhere are your DXF files coming from? We just implemented a converter for certain types of DXF output (EliteCAD) that for instance produces only triangles with color codes. Workes fine for our purpose.\nFeel free to contact me if you need more info.\nRegards,\nErwin\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nTo:      radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DIIE.00001C26000268F1@192.168.0.81>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Oct 23 04:54:04 2007", "email": "radiance at archvisu.at", "subject": "[Radiance-general] dxf2rad (23-Okt-2007 13:37)From:    Tom Young <thdyoung@mac.com>"}
