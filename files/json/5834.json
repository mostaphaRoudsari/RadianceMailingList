This can be used, but would need to be translated into a brightdata modifier on a trans material.  There is no program to do this for you, but the translation is not particularly difficult if you only care about transmission.  I'm guessing that \"Vtc\" is visible transmittance, which you could put into a Radiance .dat file with an appropriate header:\n\n# Visible transmittance data from Window 5a\n1\n0 90 10\n0.620 0.624 0.615 0.604 0.590 0.560 0.493 0.364 0.175 0.000\n\nYour scene file would then reference this data.  Let's assume you put it into a data file called \"glazing1.dat\":\n\nvoid brightdata glazing1_angT\n4 noop glazing1.dat . acos(Rdot)/DEGREE\n0\n0\n\nglazing1_angT trans glazing1_trans\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\n-------\nThe above material will have zero reflectance, whereas you seem to have quite a bit of reflection from this glazing.  I am confused by the duplicate Rf and Rb lines, so I don't know what to do with them.  You probably need to employ the BRTDfunc material to handle this properly, converting the data into functions using tabfunc.  That would take a little more time and thought, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort given the other unknowns.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Window Data", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Sep  2 12:06:50 2010"}
