{"body": "\nHello Everybody,\n\nIt's my first time to mail to the radiance mailing list.\nI'm using Radiance to calculate near field illuminance (in fact radiation)\nfrom bare fluorescent lamps.\nBefore doing with real mode data, I tested one with a bare fluorescent lamp\nand a plan 20 centimeter away from the long and cylindrical lamp. But the\nresult right under the lamp was strange, that is, the other values were as I\nexpected but only in the area directly under the lamp the illuminance was\nhighest at the center and decreased gradiently as went to the end of the\nlamp. For example, the illuminance was 5000 lux at the center right under\nthe lamp, but it decreased to 15 lux at a quarter point of the lamp,\nthough the two would be almost same.\nMaybe I am not understanding properly the lamp description. Can you anyone\nexplain this to me? Or Radiance is not adequate for near field calculation\nwith long cylindrical lamp?\n\nBest Regards\n\nMinki Sung\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071015/87d38f76/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Minki Sung", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3acd9e4a0710150415u34182188t8479bf8d78f54e51@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Oct 15 04:15:59 2007", "email": "minki.sung at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Questionaire on fluorescent lamp"}
