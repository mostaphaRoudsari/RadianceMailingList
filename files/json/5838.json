When I export this model to radiance, I get the following error:\n\n3020: WARNING: Light object 87 is producing no light - check color and\nlumen output.\n\nIndeed, when I look into the RAD file, I see the following:\n\nFloodlightNoShielding_dist light FloodlightNoShielding\n0\n0\n3 \t0.000 0.000 0.000\n\nWhen I render it this way, there is no artifical lighting. When I convert\nthe \"0.000\" values to \"255\", then I get the desired result. Now, the\nproblem is, there are so many fixtures in the model that I cannot edit the\nRAD file each time before simulation. Why is Ecotect creating the RAD file\nwith these values? Is there a bug or is there something that I am missing?\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "omoltay@mimtarch.com", "datetime": "Sun Sep  5 09:33:03 2010"}
