The funny thing, I am not defining the lights in\nEcotect myself, I am using the default materials. In all cases, those 3\nvalues are 0 (actually sometimes 0.001). And I see no way of modifying\nthose values even though I have played with all the material properties.\n\n?mer Moltay, LEED AP\n\n\nSo and how is your \"FloodlightNoShielding\" defined in Ecotect?\n\n\nYou don't want to use the display RGB values here (range 1-255). The\nthree values define the intensity of the light source in W/m^2. The\nright value for your _flood_light depends on the definition of the\ndistribution and the size of the fitting in the model.\n\n\nBug is always possible with Ecotect but I expect that - as the error\nsuggests - you definition of the light (a type of material in Ecotect)\nis wrong.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "omoltay@mimtarch.com", "datetime": "Wed Sep  8 09:27:39 2010"}
