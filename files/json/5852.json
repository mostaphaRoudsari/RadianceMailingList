{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nWell at least I was on the right track as I had recommended something\nsimilar to Xian (transforms on the noise). (I guess this was offline\nthough as I just hit reply.) I could not figure out how to generate a\nrandom value like this, so I was recommending that something could be\nscripted where random values could be generated with some other\nscripting language. This is much more elegant as it keeps it all\n(relatively) native and in-line to boot.\n\n-Jack\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] perlin noise", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<471102DF.90207@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<41AC3B84-B44C-49F6-A0D4-2CBB092E5CC1@nyu.edu>\t<4710DB9E.3050401@visarc.com>", "<1CB641A5-F09E-44DD-87A0-FCC14155F262@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Sat Oct 13 10:39:52 2007", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] perlin noise"}
