The user manual describes how to use Radiance with BCVTB (it's done via system command actors to call scripts).  TRNSYS is on the list of programs to be connected with BCVTB, but I don't think it has been done yet.\n\nMichael Wetter at LBNL is the person to contact about BCVTB and connecting simulation programs.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Sep 15, 2010, at 12:20 PM, Kerl, Marion (SCR US EXT) wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100915/e89ea6fa/attachment-0001.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance to Trnsys", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Wed Sep 15 13:27:01 2010"}
