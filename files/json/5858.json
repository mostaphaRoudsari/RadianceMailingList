It's a shame you won't be in Freiburg next week, Rob, as we're going to be looking at some of these issues.\n\nIt should be possible to modify rsensor to output a set of ray samples as input to rtcontrib, then use the -c option of the latter to sum together these samples into a set of daylight coefficients for that sensor.  I have looked at this a few times and decided that it's more than an afternoon's work to modify rsensor appropriately, so have left it for \"later.\"  This would be the most efficient method by far.\n\nThe alternative that is possible with the software as it is involves post-multiplying the output of rtcontrib on a standard hemispherical ray distribution to weight the results according to the sensor sensitivity distribution.  It wouldn't be easy, but I think one could accomplish this with the appropriate combination of rcalc, Perl, etc.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rsensor and rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Sep 15 18:29:43 2010"}
