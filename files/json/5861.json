If you want to add wall between,then use previous\nmixture and mixfunc it with wall material.\n\nFor that you'll need some cal file with definition which material should be\n'active' for which position on the polygon surface.\n\nHope this idea helps,\nMarija\n\n\nOn Fri, Sep 17, 2010 at 2:04 AM, Randolph M.
