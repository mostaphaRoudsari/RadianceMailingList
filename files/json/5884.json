However, gensurf, mgf2rad, and obj2rad all support per-vertex\nnormals, which are substantially similar.  It should be possible to\npass the output of one of these programs through rcalc and convert\nthe per-vertex normals to per-vertex colors, but it would be a very\nnasty-looking script that would take me an hour or two to put together.\n\nA C-program that generates a Radiance picture you could use as a\ntexture as Thomas suggests might even be easier to write.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] per-vertex coloring", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<615041F1-8F2F-434A-93F6-4560E077C00F@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<37fac3b90711050200u9367c2eo3fa6c97eb6ab940a@mail.gmail.com>", "<37fac3b90711050208pf575ce6m936ea2f789174ad2@mail.gmail.com>", "<37fac3b90711050209m9dd0999oaea8f6573e670fa5@mail.gmail.com>", "<E2B74F52-0673-44BA-B7ED-247C9DBFCE4D@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Wed Nov  7 16:14:34 2007", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] per-vertex coloring"}
