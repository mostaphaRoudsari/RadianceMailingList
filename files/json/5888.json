{"body": "\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\nI am new to this list .. and not all that experienced in using Radiance.\n\nI have problems determining render parameter settings that will produce\nan (almost) noise free rendering of simple scenes illuminated by a sky\ndome and a sun disk. I want to have soft shadows from both the sky dome\n(180 degree source) and the Sun (0.53 degree source). My .rad file is\nlisted below. I realize that both sources (sky and sun) are \"white\" ...\nthats not the issue ... I am just sending the simplest form of the types\nof scenes I wish to render.\n\nI am rendering with these parameters, but the results are horrobly\nnoisy, and I do not get soft shadows from the Sun:\nrpict -x 640 -y 480 -ab 2 -aw 0 -dr 3 -dp 4096 -ds 0.01 -dj 0.6\n\nI have the Rendering with Radiance book, but cannot really find a clear\n\"how to\" in terms of setting the parameters so that my picture comes out\nright.\n\nHope I am not offending anybody by posting such a simple problem.\n\nSincerely,\nClaus\n\nP.S. I am performing research in Augmented Reality and will be using my\nrenderings in conjunction with techniques I have developed for\nestimating the Sun and the Sky radiances from images of real scenes. I\nwill the render some simple geometry using Radiance and compose into the\nimage with correct shading and shadows\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Materials\n\nvoid plastic white_matte\n0\n0\n5 1.0 1.0 1.0 0 0\n\n\n\n# Objects\n\nwhite_matte sphere ball4\n0\n0\n4 0.0 0.0 2.0 2.0\n\n\n!genbox white_matte groundplane \\\n20 20 0.5 -r 0.08 | xform -t -10 -10 -0.25\n\n\n\n# Illumination environment: a 0.53 degree diameter disk and a\n# 180 degree skydome\n\n# The Sun ... radiance set to provide unity irradiance for\n# normal pointing right into the sun\nvoid light sunradiance\n0\n0\n3 14880 14880 14880\n\n\nsunradiance source TheSun\n0\n0\n4 -1 -1 1 0.53\n\n\n\n# The Sky ... radiance set to provide unity irradiance for\n# normal pointing right into the sky\nvoid light skyradiance\n0\n0\n3 0.159 0.159 0.159\n\nskyradiance source TheSky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: cbm.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 391 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071108/a069934d/cbm.vcf\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Claus B.
