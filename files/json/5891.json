{"body": "\nHi Claus,\n\nI suspect that the noise you are seeing is a results of the -dj\nparameter. There are a couple of things to note here:\n\n1. oversample the image - eg render at higher resolution (3x to 6x\ndesired final resolution) and then downsample with: pfilt -r .6 -x\n/3 -y /3 oversample.pic > final.pic (this would reduce the image\nsize 3x and apply a gaussian filter)\n2. reduce -dj setting - this will produce less sampling jitter, but I\nam not sure what your objective is here\n3. pseudo random monte carlo vs. random monte carlo sampling - when\nrun with normal parameter settings radiance (rpict) uses pseudo\nrandom sampling, with this you may notice directionality or\nstriation effects in the jittered samples, alternatively radiance\ncan be run with uncorrelated sampling by using the -u switch, this\nwill get rid of the directional effects but may require even\ngreater oversampling to reduce sampling noise due to the random\nsampling\n\nHopefully this helps, I expect that you may get other input from the\nlist as well.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nClaus B.
