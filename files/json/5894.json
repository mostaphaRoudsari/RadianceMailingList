{"body": "\nHi Thomas & Greg,\n\nMany thanks for your suggestions here!\n\nThomas, the texture-based appraoch is something that came across my mind as\nwell.\nThe other thing that I was wondering about is whether the colordata\nprimitive might be relavant here?\n\nFor the textures based approach, probably ra_xyz is my friend here, though\nI'm more wondering how I could generate the proper set of uv coordinates to\nget the right mapping.\nI'm not using textures in any sense, the use of per-vertex coloring is\ncloser to scientific data visualization.\nEach vertex has a corresponding scalar value assigned to it, which is mapped\nto a color value by a lookup-table, and the values of the lookup-table are\nthe ones I'm trying to map.\n\nMany thanks for your suggestions!\n\n-jelle\n\nNice to be right at least once but I was thinking of your mail\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071109/1b74087c/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 45, Issue 10", "sender": "jelle feringa", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<37fac3b90711081506ld2baa4bncf954467b8a352ac@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<47336b51.0a528c0a.7016.ffffcaffSMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Nov  8 15:07:41 2007", "email": "jelleferinga at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 45, Issue 10"}
