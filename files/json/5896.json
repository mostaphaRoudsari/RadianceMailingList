On the really long exposures, you can actually see the back end of\nthe lens and I guess some of the internals of the camera body itself. While\nthis is exceedingly cool/interesting, I wonder if this is impacting the\nvalidity of the HDRs. When I create a Radiance HDR image (-vth) I get these\nnice round images with totally black corners. With the camera, I end up with\na rectangular image and as I said some luminous pixels on the long\nexposures. Is this a problem, and how do folks deal with this in practice?\nEven if it's not a problem from an accuracy standpoint, aesthetically it's\nnice to produce photos that look like the Radiance fisheye output.\n\nThanks...\n\n================\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100927/a580a1bf/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon Sep 27 15:04:26 2010"}
