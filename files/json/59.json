HAs anyone heard of changes made to the =\nsystem that might cause compiler errors?  It seems to fail with about =\nhalf of the executable files I expect it to make.  I've made the =\nappropriate changes in the makeall file to point to the X11 directories, =\nso I'm fairly confident thats not the problem.   Does anyone have and =\nsuggestions, or perhaps know where I might find a pre-compiled version =\nfor Linux OS?\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert Graham\n\n------=_NextPart_000_001F_01C139D1.9C437820\nContent-Type: text/html;\ncharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\n<HTML><HEAD>\n<META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D\"text/html; =\ncharset=3Diso-8859-1\">\n<META content=3D\"MSHTML 5.50.4134.100\" name=3DGENERATOR>\n<STYLE></STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY bgColor=3D#d5ccbb>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>I'm trying to install Radiance on my =\nmachine=20\nrunning Redhat 7.1, and I'm not having any success with it.&nbsp; HAs =\nanyone=20\nheard of changes made to the system that might cause compiler =\nerrors?&nbsp; It=20\nseems to fail with about half of the executable files I expect it to =\nmake.&nbsp;=20\nI've made the appropriate changes in the makeall file to point to the =\nX11=20\ndirectories, so I'm fairly confident thats not the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; =\nDoes=20\nanyone have and suggestions, or perhaps know where I might find a =\npre-compiled=20\nversion for Linux OS?</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Thanks,</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Robert =\nGraham</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>\n\n------=_NextPart_000_001F_01C139D1.9C437820--\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Robert Graham", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<002201c139fb$85c158e0$217c389c@rgraham>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 10 Sep 2001 08:21:37 -0500", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RAdiance Compile on Redhat Linux 7.1"}
