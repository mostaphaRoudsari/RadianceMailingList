If you have\nany area of the sky obstructed by other building parts from the\nview of the skylights, that do not also obstruct the sun, then a\nrelation of 400 to 30 sounds perfectly reasonable. Or do you have\nany more specific reasons to assume that the results for the\ncloudy sky should be higher?\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans material with sunless sk", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Mon, 10 Dec 2001 20:30:18 -0500 (EST)"}
