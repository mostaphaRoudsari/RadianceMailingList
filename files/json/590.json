{"body": "\nHi Santiago,\n\n\nWhat is the last real argument (A1=1) for?  I think fisheye.cal just\nignores it.\n\n\nWhat is in sky_orig.pic?  Is it possible that you exposed it with pfilt\nor something -- you need to have the original values in there.  The\ndirect output of rpict should work, but passing it through pfilt would\nnot.\n\n\nGensky creates a separate source for the sun, whereas it gets included\nas a small spot in sky_orig.pic, which the indirect calculation is\nhard-pressed to find.  To get it to work as gensky, you would have to\ntake the solar source from gensky and reapply it in your model.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1F47B328-A00C-11D7-A551-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jun 2003 08:06:35 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: physically-based landscapes"}
