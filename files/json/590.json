Luckily Mark Stock's tip\nworked, from this post:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001422.html\n\nThanks Mark!  Users who get this error will not have any of the binaries\nfrom the /src/px directory built, not just ximage and the others that\nEtienne mentioned in his post.\n\nI thought I'd mention this since Red Hat is dropping support for RHL9 at\nthe end of the month, and I'd expect a few of you out there will be\nmigrating to Fedora. (?)\n\nP.S.\nAfter installing Fedora (http://fedora.redhat.com/) on a test server,\nand liking what I saw, I have installed it on my production Radiance box\nand thanks to Mark I now have Radiance running on it, and it's really\nquite nice.  And the yum package manager is downright yummy!  =8-)\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu Apr  8 17:37:48 2004"}
