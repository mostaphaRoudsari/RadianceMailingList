The total commands should have -of as\nwell, to correspond to the -df of pvalue:\n\nvwrays -vf pool_par.vf -x 1000 -y 1000 -ff \\\n| rtcontrib -V+ -ff -f pool_coords.cal \\\n-b floor_bin -bn 7500 -o '!total -if22500 -of | pvalue\n-r -h +Y 150\n+X 50 -df > floor_caustics.pic' -m floor \\\n-b s_wall_bin -bn 3000 -o '!total -if9000 -of | pvalue\n-r -h +Y 30\n+X 100 -df > s_wall_caustics.pic' -m s_wall \\\n-b n_wall_bin -bn 3000 -o '!total -if9000 -of | pvalue\n-r -h +Y 30\n+X 100 -df > n_wall_caustics.pic' -m n_wall \\\n-b e_wall_bin -bn 5000 -o '!total -if15000 -of | pvalue\n-r -h +Y 50\n+X 100 -df > e_wall_caustics.pic' -m e_wall \\\n-b w_wall_bin -bn 5000 -o '!total -if15000 -of | pvalue\n-r -h +Y 50\n+X 100 -df > w_wall_caustics.pic' -m w_wall \\\npool.oct\n\nI'm sure I made other mistakes as well, which you'll no doubt discover.\n\nAlso, the files I attached after my signature (assuming they made it)\nare from my \"Applying the Radiance rtcontrib program\" talk at last\nyear's Radiance Workshop <http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-\nworkshop5/2006_Radiance_Workshop/>.  These offer an example of\napplying rtcontrib in a similar context, where I've worked out the\nsolid angle factors to get correct irradiance units.\n\n-Greg\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB5046CB795@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Nov 15 00:41:16 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: water - any news???"}
