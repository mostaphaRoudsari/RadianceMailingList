We will change that with the next release, but until\nthen the only supported view-type is -vta. Using -vth will return wrong\nvalues!\nBy the way -usually most of the available fish-eye lenses are angular,\nnot hemispherical.\n\nAnother important issue: If you use programs which might change the view\n(like pcompos) , the view string in the header is obsolete and the\nstandard view (-vtv, vh=45,vv=45) is taken by the radiance\nroutines(which we use in evalglare), which also results in completely\nwrong results!!! The fatal thing is, that you still see the old view\nstring if you look at it when using getinfo, it is just a tab added to\n\"disable\" the view string.\nThis caused a lot of trouble in the past and we will change now also the\ncommand line options of evalglare, so that you have to provide the view\neach time when you call evalglare. This will be also included within the\nnext release. Until then, be sure that image has the correct view\noptions without tab and -vta is used!\n\nJan\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti schrieb:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100928/49017d98/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] fisheye images & evalglar", "tags": [], "sender": "Jan Wienold", "datetime": "Tue Sep 28 05:27:42 2010"}
