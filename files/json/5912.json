{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nYou are correct about this.  There is a limit to the number of\nmaterials that may be included in the ambient exclude list (2047 in\nthis case) or the trace set of rtrace (8192).  I could raise these\nlimits in the distribution, or you could yourself by adding:\n\n-DMAXASET=N -DMAXTSET=M\n\nto the build options in the makeall \"rmake\" script and recompiling.\n\nAll I was saying is that there is no fundamental limit to the number\nof times a material may be redefined.  You can say there is a limit\nwith respect to the include/exclude settings, but this is not the\nsame as a basic limit.  If Jelle wants to exclude his reused material\nname, then he may have a problem.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: limited number of materials?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DB89F788-AAFD-4B66-93C8-9C8CC4B67C46@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<37fac3b90711150223o5d40746lce74f5a8e246d19a@mail.gmail.com>\t<473C35E7.8020309@gmx.net>\t<37fac3b90711150412y1d8d7f05w38f75fc8d0351e6c@mail.gmail.com>\t<8042485E-B0D2-4047-8436-CEA61A2AB8F5@lmi.net>\t<473C6D13.5020405@gmx.net>", "<D519844B-179A-45DF-99DF-31B91A458E32@lmi.net>", "<473C763E.2090205@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Thu Nov 15 08:55:59 2007", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: limited number of materials?"}
