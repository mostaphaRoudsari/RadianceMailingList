Your source code compiled just fine on Fedora Core 1.\n2. How do I specify a .rif file with radz?\n3. Getinfo likes radzilla octrees, but the\nmodel-viewing-utility-formerly-named-rview does not.  I guess that's\nbecause getinfo is simply a header reader, whereas rview is dealing with\nthe octree more intimately.  Any plans to make an rzrvu?  Will you paint\nmy house when you're done re-writing Radiance?\n\nKeep up the good work!  Interesting stuff, Carsten.  This is such a fun\ngroup.\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Announcement: radzilla0.5 !", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon Apr 12 21:29:25 2004"}
