The radmap tool is actually a separate\ntool from the main Radiance distribution, but the creator, Francesco\nAnselmo, is a member of this mailing list so you may get some responses\nbesides mine here. But you should definitely also check out\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ for other possible leads.\n\n\nYour longitude is 73.9, but your standard meridian is a slightly\nnon-standard 57 degrees. I'd assume \"-m 75\" with \"-o 73.9\" will give a\nbetter result. Looks like you just accidentally transposed the numbers\nthere...\n\n\nWhat version of radmap are you using? I have not used option files with\nit before, but I looked at the python code for my copy of radmap (v0.1c)\nand it doesn't seem like there's any confusion between view files and\noptions files. In other words, it should be reading in your option file\ncorrectly despite what's being printed to the command line. You might\nwant to try changing options directly in the python code; you'll see the\noptions towards the top of the file and Francesco has commented\neverything fairly well. Only a few of the options are in there, but it\nserved me well enough. Good luck!\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radmap: to produce irradiation map", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<474F44A9.4040808@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<0JSA00KVVHC39NW1@vms044.mailsrvcs.net>"], "datetime": "Thu Nov 29 15:01:03 2007", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radmap: to produce irradiation map"}
