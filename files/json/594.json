Learning English on the fly... thanx for the\ncorrections!!!\n\n\nradz can be handled like rad (except the mandatory executable name), so type\nradz -x rzpict 'riffilename' with 'riffilename' being a normal RADIANCE\n.rif file\n\nConcerning further stuff (rzrvu): It should be rather straightforward to\nconvert e.g. rvu to deal with\nRADZILLA octrees as well, once the general framework is established. So\nyou can expect more functionality coming soon.\n\nJust a quick note: I'm currently on a one weeks holiday, so this\ncertainly means some delay on my side for answering questions  etc. But\nI'll be back working on the stuff next week...\n\nAnd concering your house: It depends what kind of artwork you want your\nhouse to be after I'm finished with it ..:-)\n\n-Carsten\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Tue Apr 13 14:09:50 2004"}
