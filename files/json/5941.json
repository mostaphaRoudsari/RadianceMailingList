I 'm just new in the list.\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nApiparn\n\n\n\nJan wrote:\n\n\nHi Andrew,\n\n\n\nyes, evalglare needs a 180? fish-eye(-vta)- LUMINANCE image. Internally\n\nit calculates the vertical illuminance as Greg mentioned before.\n\n\n\nA value of 0.4756 is a rather high value (-> 48% are disturbed by glare).\n\n\n\nAt the last building simulation conference, I suggested some \"glare\n\nclasses\" based on user assessments, which may help to interpret the DGP\n\nvalues.\n\n(table 5 in http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0944_951.pdf ).\n\nFurther details can be found also in my dissertation \"Daylight Glare in\n\nOffices\", which will be available in some days as pdf on our web-site.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101011/df074c92/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Borisuit Apiparn", "datetime": "Mon Oct 11 01:52:29 2010"}
