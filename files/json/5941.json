{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nThank you again for your great job.\n\nI'm wrtting to you again about GOOGLE SKETCHUP 6 (free version) site\nlocation.\nIn Windows version, there is no LOCATION option on MODEL INFO Menu.\n\nBut, I have found a way to overcome this difficult, and it's very nice!\n\nAt first open GOOGLE EARTH before SKP, and find out your building location,\ngo to SKP and click on  \"Get current view\" icon, once you have imported the\nimage from G. Earth to G. SKETCHUP it assumes the full coordinates from\nbuilding location and VOIL?..... Now only you have to do is align\nNORTH/SOUTH direction, rotating the model.\n\nNice to hear from you,\n\nVangelis\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071128/747b9c82/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Evangelos Christakou", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<dc928a050711271850n3e8118a6x12e59a801d05661a@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Nov 27 18:50:19 2007", "email": "vangelis at unb.br", "subject": "[Radiance-general] tip for GOOGLE Sketchup location"}
