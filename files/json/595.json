{"body": "\nUnless people feel strongly otherwise, I'm going to suggest we move\nthis discussion to the radiance-dev list.\n\nThe error you get from oconv suggests that its getting confused about\nbasic types, as the \"bad # arguments\" should not show up at all unless\nit thinks the light is a sphere or a face or something.\n\nMy first suggestion is that you try building from CVS head, which may\nbe found on the radiance-online.org site under the \"download Radiance\"\nlink.  Download the current experimental bug-fix version, called\nradiance-HEAD.tgz, and compile from that.  If you still get compile\nerrors with the latest random.h, please forward them directly to me and\nI'll see what I can do.  It's probably best to send me the entire\noutput of makeall.\n\n-Greg\ngward@lmi.net\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Building Radiance 3.5 on Tru64", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<90719E68-ACA8-11D7-A2F8-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jul 2003 09:16:40 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Building Radiance 3.5 on Tru64"}
