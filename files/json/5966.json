The lack of thickness to your walls means that the occasional ray can \"escape\" out the corners of your box, permitting light to leak in during your calculation.  Using a sphere rather than a box, you'll find your value goes to zero.  Or, adding a second box to enclose your first one also fixes the problem.\n\nThese kinds of errors are inherent to floating point calculations, and people have written entire Ph.D. theses addressing the problem.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<AANLkTi=zeYGNK=qeVhZzZb9epYe-x99szbZdER9G-yit@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed Oct 20 09:42:31 2010"}
