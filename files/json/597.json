As the inside\nis dark, and so is the glass, I was expecting the glass not to reflect\nmuch light? What properties do I need to play with to get what I was\nexpecting, ie darker looking glass from the outside, not reflecting\nmuch? You must know what I mean, like stainglass on churches, its very\nmurky from outside, definetly cant see much reflection in it.\n\nCheers guys!\nJohn\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040414/24c213fe/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Sutherland", "datetime": "Wed Apr 14 11:03:33 2004"}
