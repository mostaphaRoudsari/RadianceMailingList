{"body": "\nHello All,\n\nMy name is Annica Nilsson and I am new to this mailing list. I have just\nstarted my PhD studies at Uppsala University, Sweden, where my project\nwill be related to optical characterization, daylighting simulations,\nand energy aspects. I am currently not a Mac user and I?ve therefore\nchosen to work with Daysim. I understand that this is a radiance mailing\nlist, but I believe that Daysim is well-known to at least some of you,\nand I?m hoping that you will be able to help me.\n\nMy problem is that when I import my SketchUp files to Daysim the\nresulting material file references the ImportFrom3ds.geo.ra file rather\nthan the C:/DAYSIM/materials/ catalogue, which from my understanding is\nthe preferred reference.\n\nThis occurs for all materials in the SketchUp file that I have created\nand for the glazing materials in the example file (PrivateOffices.3ds)\nincluded with the Daysim program.\n\nI?m using the DaysimMaterialsForSketchUp in my sketch and I have the\nstyle set to ?Monochrom? before I export the 3ds file. What else do I\nneed to think of when creating/exporting/importing my drawings?\n\nI am new to the daylighting simulation world, but I?m hoping to learn,\nand I appreciate any hints, ideas, comments and help I can get.\n\nBest regards,\nAnnica\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Annica Nilsson", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4732FDAA.6020604@Angstrom.uu.se>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Nov  8 04:16:04 2007", "email": "Annica.Nilsson at Angstrom.uu.se", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 3ds import to Daysim"}
