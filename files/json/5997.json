I've put up my little Rhino\nscript for you to try:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/ExportRadianceView.rvb.gz\n\nI find myself hardly ever using it, but maybe it works for you, or at\nleast, you can use it as a starting point for your own Rhino hacking.\n\nThere are three obvious bugs (or missing features) which I should\nmention, so you won't be disappointed:\n\na) The view angle you get in Radiance doesn't quite match the Rhino one.\nMaybe Alstan's formulae will get you closer match;\n\nb) I have not found a way of getting the view extends for parallel views\nin world coordinates. Rhino seems to insist of returning them in pixels;\n\nc) Rhino's view up vector is at 90 degrees to the view direction. This\nis not incorrect as such, but when you load the Radiance view file in\nrvu, you'll find that rotating around the z-axis (pivot or rotate\ncommands) yields unexpected results. The fix would be to always define\nthe view vector as 0 0 1, and ignore Rhino's values.\n\nHope you find the script useful. Please share any improvements you make.\n\nHappy hacking\n\nAxel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Rhino cameras", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed Oct 27 13:01:21 2010"}
