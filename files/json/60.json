But\nother radiance people want to know what a person will SEE.\n\ncheers\n-George\n\ne\ning.\n--\nGeorge Michaelson       |  APNIC\nEmail: ggm@apnic.net    |  PO Box 2131 Milton QLD 4064\nPhone: +61 7 3367 0490  |  Australia\nFax: +61 7 3367 0482  |  http://www.apnic.net\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] trans material with sunless sk", "tags": [], "sender": "George Michaelson", "datetime": "Tue, 11 Dec 2001 17:28:09 +1000"}
