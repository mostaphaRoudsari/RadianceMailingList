As I\nunderstand from Greg who developed this for us originally, the math\nstarts to get a lot more complicated with a 3rd glass layer. This does\nnot mean that it cannot be done but it would need to be implemented. I\nguess there are a few things to understand with the glaze script. What\nyou want to get out of Optics 5 is Radiance material exports NOT for the\nfull IGU makeup but instead for each layer of the makeup. Then you can\nuse the transmittance and reflectance data for the exported materials to\nbuild material definitions for 2 layer glazing makeups where a coating\ncan be allocated to one surface and a frit to another (note you cannot\nhave both frit and coating applied to the same surface because we do not\nknow how to characterized that). Regarding the interlayer, I think what\nI would suggest is that (assuming a clear interlayer) is to make up the\ncomposite in Optics 5 (eg 2 glass materials with an interlayer) and then\nexport this as a glass layer.\n\nRegarding Ming-w, I am sorry that I am not really familiar with\ncompiling or running Radiance in this way, so I do not really know why\nthings might not be found. Note that glaze is a shell script like\nfalsecolor for example, so if you have falsecolor then glaze \"should\" be\navailable and work...\n\n-Jack\n\nPS: you could also take a look at my talk at the 2009(?) Radiance\nWorkshop at Harvard, which talks a bit about glaze and some other tools.\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 10/28/2010 9:44 AM, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Diffusive laminated material and fritting", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Thu Oct 28 09:09:37 2010"}
