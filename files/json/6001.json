{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFor a project I'm currently working on, I'd like to convert a mesh, which is\ncolored on a per-vertex basis to Radiance.\nPolygon seems the most likely primitive to do so, but I'm curious to know\nhow I can achieve per-vertex coloring in Radiance effectively. Of course,\nwriting a face with its colors wouldn't really work out here, since I would\nneed some form of interpolation of the color values between the different\nfaces, or things would get pretty ugly. Has anyone run into this kind of\nconversion? Any pointers much appreciated!\n\nCheers,\n\n-jelle\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071105/b4e48df9/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] per-vertex coloring", "sender": "jelle feringa", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<37fac3b90711050209m9dd0999oaea8f6573e670fa5@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<37fac3b90711050200u9367c2eo3fa6c97eb6ab940a@mail.gmail.com>", "<37fac3b90711050208pf575ce6m936ea2f789174ad2@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov  5 02:09:18 2007", "email": "jelleferinga at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] per-vertex coloring"}
