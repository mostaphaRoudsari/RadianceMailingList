{"body": "\nTerrance McMinn wrote\n\nYes, of course. There would be no motivation for me to write a script\nthat doesn't work on the free version. But from the Ruby point of view\nboth versions are identical.\n\n\nI am not aware of different settings between the two versions. The script\nuses information stored in the 'location' and 'shadow' settings. You can\nmodify the sky appearance in SketchUp but I do not use this information\nand don't even know if it's accessible via scripting.\n\n\nI can certainly add a few comments ...\n\nAbout the interface 'design':\n\nSketchup has a very limited but simple dialog toolbox which is what I'm using\nright now. It looks odd but it does the trick. More soffisticated dialogs are\npossible with DHTML (JavaScript - the 'tip of the day' is an example for that)\nbut I won't start working on that before I have a good idea about which options\nto present. And I have to be sure someone out there needs it because it would\nbe useless for me.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nViel oder wenig? Schnell oder langsam?
