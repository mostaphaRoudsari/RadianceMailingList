I suggest that interested parties/developers organize a host site for this effort and someone (Dave?) take charge of the project.  It's not something I can personally help with, and there aren't enough spare resources or Python experts at LBNL to manage such a project as far as I know.  Ongoing maintenance is something to think about as well, as new Radiance releases will likely continue to have some minor changes and some major additions.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Python Radiance Packag", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Nov  8 08:36:06 2010"}
