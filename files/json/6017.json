Otherwise, we create a dependency loop where everything has to be synchronized between separate sources for anything to work.  Such a move would require that LBNL maintain all the Python code internally, and I don't see that happening.\n\nIn general, adding functionality to Radiance through new scripts and programs is much less trouble than replacing functionality, which creates a whole host of backwards- and forwards-compatibility issues.\n\n-Greg\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Python Radiance Packag", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Nov  8 09:29:35 2010"}
