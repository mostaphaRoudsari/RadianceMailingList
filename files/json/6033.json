{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI need to analyze the amount of ultraviolet radiation that gets into a space\nthrough the windows (natural light). Is it possible to do it with RADIANCE\nsomehow? I've been looking into the archive, and I know that some people\nhave been working with blue light as an alternative. However, is it possible\nto go beyond the spectrum towards the ultraviolet by applying some\nmathematical method (for example)? Does anyone have any suggestion?\n\nMany thanks in advance!\nAdriana Lira\n\n--\nDr. Adriana Lira-Oliver\nDDes I MDes I Barch\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20071217/ca4782db/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Adriana Lira", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<e5da07760712171053u5913ac6aw82756de00026eb78@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Dec 17 10:54:13 2007", "email": "adrianalira at post.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Analysis of ultraviolet radiation with RADIANCE"}
