{"body": "\nHi Claus,\n\nIf HDRshop is built on MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) then it will need\nat least one DLL to run (MFC42.dll), which is perhaps missing from Vista?\nOther MFC DLLs my also be required.\nYou should be able to download these from Mircosoft.\n\nThanks,\nGlen Harding\nDivision of Optometry\nUniversity of Bradford\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Claus B.\nMadsen\nSent: 21 December 2007 07:45\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nDear Radiance users,\n\nis there by any chance somebody on the list who has experiences with\nusing HDRShop under Windows Vista. I have an HDRShop 2.0 license for\nacademic purposes and I havetried to install it on my new Windows Vista\nmachine. No luck. I get an error message from Microsoft Foundation Class\n... I have tried to contact the USC people behind HDRShop, but so far no\nresponse. Then I thought \"hey, maybe some of the Radiance users know\nsomething ...\"\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDRShop and Vista", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<007d01c843b6$32024ea0$0202fea9@UNIVERSI047A23>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Dec 21 01:48:25 2007", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDRShop and Vista"}
