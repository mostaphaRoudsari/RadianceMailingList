{"body": "\nHi Adriana,\n\nYou need some measure of the quantity of ultraviolet light in\ndaylight and the UV transmission of the windows, but in principle\nthere is nothing to stop you from simulating shorter wavelengths than\nvisible in Radiance.  I don't know where you would find the\nappropriate quantities to use, however.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Ultraviolet analysis with RADIANCE", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<00705AAF-7E46-43BF-AA84-F0AF5B2B500C@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<e5da07760712210836j67e9c6d3xf938c6be883d7eb3@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Dec 22 10:58:50 2007", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Ultraviolet analysis with RADIANCE"}
