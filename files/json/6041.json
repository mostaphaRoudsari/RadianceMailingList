Please go to:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/limesurvey/index.php?sid=61285\n\nand adjust the sliders.  Rather than a preference rating, we are looking for an honest assessment of your own probability of attendance for each possible venue.  You have the next two weeks, until the end of November, to cast your vote.  Please, just one response per person.\n\nOur thanks to Danny Fuller for putting this together for us.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Gregory J.
