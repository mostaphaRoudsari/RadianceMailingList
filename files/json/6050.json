We have a windows 7 and the linux version of\nradiance is accessed virtually. I am getting stuck with using the software,\nand operating with the command lines, and would greatly appreciate if anyone\ncould suggest a workshop or online training sessions or some basics. Sorry\nfor such beginner questions but can I also know what language and supporting\nsoftware should I work with to be able to write the commands.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nKind regards,\n\nVidya Gowda,\nvidyacg@vt.edu\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101119/d6e63bc4/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "vidya gowda", "datetime": "Fri Nov 19 12:15:59 2010"}
