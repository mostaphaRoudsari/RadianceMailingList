{"body": "\nHello Lucio,\n\nIt is normal for rtrace (and other Monte Carlo ray-tracing programs)\nto return slightly different results for the same ray, due to\nrandomness in the sampling process.  The goal is to produce the\ncorrect result on average in a reasonably unbiased estimation\nprocess, rather than producing the same systematically inaccurate\nresult each time, as would be produced by a completely deterministic\nalgorithm.\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] REALLY STRANGE", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D0A5199B-6451-4B52-9FAE-129941DE87D3@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<JTS9JA$4228F19FAEB31D71BE29A57554C3734F@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Fri Dec 28 15:55:12 2007", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] REALLY STRANGE"}
