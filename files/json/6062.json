In Ecotect 2011, the path for the material folder is good but the link in radiance didn't work. I'll try to fix or will use Ecotect v5.\n\nSo I'll continue to work on my project and be aware of my results!\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nAlexis\n\n\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nDear Alexis,\nI would ask how tall the windows are? If the depth or your room is 30 meters and typically the depth side lighting will come into the space is 2-2.5 times the window height then you will have your answer as far as which one was more accurate. I will say it depends on the time of day/year but I am assuming you are using 12pm on the equinox for your time 3.2 DF seems high 30 meters into the space.\n\nTim Metcalfe\nKalwall Corporation\nDaylight Modeling Group\n1111 Candia Road\nManchester, N.H. 03105\n1(800)258-9777 X4483\n???
