{"body": "\nI was working on my thesys and I did have a very strange response form rtrace.. Am I missing something or is it a dangerous bug?\n\nI did cast two times the same call and I did have sistematically two different results.. WHY ?\n\nSo I did calculate the same thing from different files:\n\nprova.dat containing :\n\n2.5 -60 1.5 -1.667 61.1 -1.5\n2.5 -60 1.5 0 61.1 -1.5\n\nand prova1.dat containing just the second line :\n\n2.5 -60 1.5 0 61.1 -1.5\n\n\nI did cast the command :\n\ncat prova.dat | rtrace -h- tmp/U0.oct\n\nobtaining :\n\n5.804947e-03    5.804947e-03    5.804947e-03\n5.987884e-03    5.987884e-03    5.987884e-03\n\nand\n\ncat prova1.dat | rtrace -h- tmp/U0.oct\n\nobtaining :\n\n5.996149e-03    5.996149e-03    5.996149e-03\n\nsecond line of first result, if I'm not wrong, should be identical to second result... Why is it not ?\n\nLucio Boscolo\n\n\n..
