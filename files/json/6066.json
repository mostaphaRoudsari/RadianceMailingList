{"body": "\nHi Claus,\n\nAnother thing to try is running HDRShop under a selected compatibility\nmode in Vista. I was able to get my ancient windows 95 version of the\nLego Mindstorm software running on Vista this way. It was a bit\nlaborious, I had to go find all the relevant executables and then set\nthe compatibility mode to windows 95 (via properties on the selected exe\nfile). I think there is also something called the compatibility wizard,\nyou can search the help for this, not sure how it works though.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nClaus B.
