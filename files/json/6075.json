{"body": "\nDear Francesco & Rob,\n\nThanks for all your help.\n\nYes, Rob's suggestions really helped. I downloaded the latest version of\nthe radmap, and the shadows on the rendering now are coming in a correct\norientation. Although my original problems (of orientation & using rpict\noptions) were solved by using the newer version of radmap, I have some\nmore issues.\n\nThe rendering I am getting are not smooth and I am seeing horizontal\nbands on these renderings. I am not sure what exactly the problem is. I\nhave tried to run simulation several times, in different computers, but\neach time I get similar results.\n\nI am providing you all following links which has false color images of\nexisting and proposed conditions, and a file which has all rendering\ncommands and the background process that is carried out during\nsimulation, (hoping this would help).\n\nRadmap falsecolor image links:\nhttp://esc.freeshell.org/Radiance/rend_process.htm   (background\nprocess)\nhttp://esc.freeshell.org/Radiance/exist_test_0000_irrmap_fc_kWh.jpg\n(existing condition simulation)\nhttp://esc.freeshell.org/Radiance/proposed_test_0000_irrmap_fc_kWh.jpg\n(proposed condition simulation)\n\nI would really appreciate if someone could help me figure out what's\ngoing on with this simulation.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPrasanta\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Monday, December 03, 2007 5:02 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear Prasanta,\n\nSorry for the late reply, and thanks to Rob for helping out.\n\n\nYes this is correct.\n\nJudging from your previous command line option you are using\nthe default cumulative sky method, and you can relax the sky resolution\nto a lower value, for example 128, saving a lot of time without\ncompromising results.\n\nAs Rob pointed out, you should download a more recent version of\nradmap, and on unix systems it runs without need to compile it,\nprovided that you have python installed.\n\nLet me know how it works.\n\nCiao,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE:  Radmap: to produce irradiation map", "sender": "pisuke@blueyonder.co.uk", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A3B29F823861B34BB3868348164689490B7C64@server2.escny.local>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Dec 10 13:09:44 2007", "email": "Francesco Anselmo", "subject": "RE: [Radiance-general] Radmap: to produce irradiation map"}
