It works after I add \".\\\" in front of the\nfile name.\n\n\nMay I ask a couple of follow-up questions?\n\nQ1. I tried to generate cumulative skies for direct radiation?(binned) for\ndifferent periods of time in a year.? They all give the same results.? Is it not\npossible to specify the time and day period for direct radiation?\n\nQ2. I created angular fisheye views of the sky dome (180-deg spread with the\ncentre at the zenith)?and found some?anomaly that I can't explain:\n\nDirect -\n\na. All sun paths are found within approx. 45 degrees from the?zenith.? It\nlooks?like a?normal?sunpath diagram being \"cropped\", leaving a circular area in\nthe middle.? I changed the view direct (-vd) and it's still the case (i.e. not a\nview setting problem)\n\nb.?The sun paths are almost continuous rather than in form 5-degree \"bins\"\n\nDiffuse -\n\na. The lowest row of the 145-patch sky dome is particularly?bright on the left\nand right sides (i.e. west and east sides, respectively)?.? It appears under\nboth Singaporean and San Francisco skies.? Would it be related to the limitation\non <6 degrees sun angle??\n\n\nThanks?in advance for bearing with this long list of question.? It would be\ngreat if there is a \"manual\" that can be made available - it's?a useful tool!\n\nCheers,\nKam?\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101130/fc2b1acf/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: GenCumulativeSky - follow-up questions", "tags": [], "sender": "Kam Shing Leung", "datetime": "Tue Nov 30 05:30:03 2010"}
