Of course, modelling pre-\ndetermined light output distributions for luminaires is another\nmatter and Radiance has no problem with that.\n\nSee \"Development and validation of a Radiance model for a translucent\npanel\" by Reinhart and Andersen for a very thorough description of\nhow to go about modelling translucent panels -- not the same as a\n'prismatic diffuser' but should prove informative.\nDirect link to paper here:\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/fulltext/nrcc48165/nrcc48165.pdf\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<115A7A4C-2FC3-4B66-BB54-2C01E9C0FC43@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Dec  5 06:47:15 2007", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Simulating Prismatic Diffuser"}
