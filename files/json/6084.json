{"body": "\nDear Prasanta,\n\nSorry for the late reply, and thanks to Rob for helping out.\n\n\nYes this is correct.\n\nJudging from your previous command line option you are using\nthe default cumulative sky method, and you can relax the sky resolution\nto a lower value, for example 128, saving a lot of time without\ncompromising results.\n\nAs Rob pointed out, you should download a more recent version of\nradmap, and on unix systems it runs without need to compile it,\nprovided that you have python installed.\n\nLet me know how it works.\n\nCiao,\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radmap: to produce irradiation map", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1196719348.28184.31.camel@leviathan>", "refs": ["<0JSH00HYQOI1U1C5@vms173001.mailsrvcs.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Dec  3 14:02:34 2007", "email": "pisuke at blueyonder.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radmap: to produce irradiation map"}
