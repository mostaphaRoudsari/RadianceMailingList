If this information is really \"proprietary,\" the last thing you\nshould be doing is posting it to a public discussion list.  I assume\nyou meant another word, here.\n\n\nIndeed, ranimate's support of changing illumination and geometry is\nminimal.  You are responsible for any frame updates yourself within\nyour \"genoctree_a.script\" file.  You are free to use rad to help you\nwith this.  Your script file currently changes the sky and expects\nranimate to figure out what that means, but how could it?  What you\nneed to do is make the octree created by rad depend on some file that\nis altered in your script, like so:\n\nframe=$1\ntime=`ev \"5.25+($frame/4)\"`\ngensky 3 21 $time +s -a 38.7 -o 90.5 -m 90 > sun.rad\nrad -v 0\ncat ./octree/lobby_a.oct\n\nThen, to \"lobby_a.rif\" you should add:\n\nscene= sun.rad sky.rad\n\nYour current rad input file is broken in the sense that it doesn't have\nthe information it needs to generate correct illum's.  This is where\nyour problems began.\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Ranimate / Mkillum issu", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Apr 19 01:26:33 2004"}
