{"body": "\nHi all,\n\n\n\nI have a question regarding extracting values from a pic file (pvalue\nprogram?).\n\n\n\n-           Is there a way to extract the values just for a portion of\npicture (rather than getting it for a single pixel or the whole picture)?\n\n-           Also, are we able to get values just for an irregular polygon\nportion of the picture?\n\n\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrasanta\n\n_________________________________________\n\nPrasanta Bhattarai\n\n(Junior Research Associate)\n\nEnvironmental Simulation Center\n261 W. 35th St\nNew York, NY 10001\nEmail: bhattarai@simcenter.org\nOffice: 212-279-1851\nFax: 212-279-5350\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080103/7865c380/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Prasanta Bhattarai", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<200801031611.m03GBFO8031053@omr5.networksolutionsemail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jan  3 08:11:30 2008", "email": "bhattarai at simcenter.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] extracting brightness values from picture"}
