If I try to set it to what seems a sensible next quantum leap up\nit dies the death of a gigabyte memory model on a megabyte machine.\n\nIs there some wierd cube law here? Is it actually not possible to do\nbetter than 512x512 images? 1024x1024 don't work for me.\n\n(the sizes are notional. Its been a while)\n\nAlso, some of the *wonderful* textures such as the finer woodgrains\nhave very odd effects on time to compute. Is there a FAQ like known\nset of textures to avoid for fast render?\n\nAlso Also wik: I did a kitchen with a mix of off-white and brushed steel\naluminimum surfaces. I found that the amount of colour picked up by\n'gloss' surfaces was increadibly high, but if I didn't select off-whites\nfor detailed surfaces like tongue-and-groove wood, I got huge brightspots\nwhich wiped out the image unless I wound back the lightbulbs to 5 watt\nrailway specials. I know that the chrome tap is reflecting part of a\nperfectly rendered image of the lightbulb onto every shiny surface within\na 40 foot radius, but now I'm over 40 I can't see those little images\nunless I stand real close. Does radiance have to render them? isn't\nthere some middle ground where it does high definition for some things\nbut not others?\n\n(I am not a professional. I do not depend on this software. If you do,\nand need it to remain pure, I don't disagree. I love this package and think\nits one of the neatest bits of s/w I have ever seen, its more critique\nthan real comment/feature request)\n\ncheers\n-George\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "George Michaelson", "datetime": "Tue, 11 Dec 2001 17:37:22 +1000"}
