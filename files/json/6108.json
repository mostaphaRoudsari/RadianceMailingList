Why do you think that there is a problem with memory in\nyour case? How much memory does the rpict process occupy?\n\nIf you have a lot of detail geometry that does not contribute\nsignificantly to the diffuse-indirect illumination of your scene, you\ncan use the ambient exclude parameters of rpict/rtrace (-ae and -aE).\n\nIf you use too many instances, or if you create them in a wrong way,\nthey will slow down the rendering. Each time a ray hits an instance\n(passes the bounding cube it fits into), it has to check for collisions\nwith any surface inside that instance. So if you have a lot of\noverlapping instances with little geometry contained in each, or\ninstances with a bad ration of width/length/height, a lot of unnecessary\nintersection checks will happen. Instances improve memory efficiency at\nthe cost of rendering time. It is important to balance the two. So only\npack compact, high-res geometry into instances.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n13.12.2010 10:49, Lucio Boscolo wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20101213/0a11f105/attachment-0001.bin>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Instances", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
