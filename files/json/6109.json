{"body": "\nHi Minki,\n\nIt is not clear to me what your geometry is supposed to represent.\n\ncase 1 - If you have 2 polygons representing \"walls\" and 1 cylinder\nrepresenting your source, where the cylinder passes through the\nwalls, you are going to have problems due to how the light source\nsampling occurs along the linear source.\n\ncase 2 - if the geometry is supposed to represent a cylindrical\nsource that passes through a hole cut in each wall, then you\nprobably need to make sure that your \"wall\" geometry has a holes cut\nout as needed for the cylinder to pass through.\n\nNote also if what you are trying to do is model an actual fixture with\nreflector elements of some sort and simulate the output distribution, then\nRadiance is probably not the right tool, you will need to look into a\nforward raytracer of some sort. I am sure that others on the list can\nadvise on what might be an appropriate tool.\n\n-Jack\n\nMinki Sung wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080110/de122c09/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Shadow nearby a fluorescent lamp", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<47863416.1040406@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<3acd9e4a0801100614h69ca8718hb64104c897171242@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 10 07:05:18 2008", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Shadow nearby a fluorescent lamp"}
