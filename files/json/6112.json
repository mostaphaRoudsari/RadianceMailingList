{"body": "\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI have a question regarding the luminaire output multiplier and I would really appreciate your help.\n\nI am doing an experiment in a testbed, however, the inside natural lighting is very low, because of the sorrounding neightbouring walls so we decided to use an artificial uniform light (160x 160 cm) in the window as the light source, -looking at the values for different blind positions and based on a controller, some decisions are made regarding the blind position and the lighting inside the space.\n\nMy question is how to continuously change the lumen multiplier output (-m) , so without  entering the -m value every time manually. I am an researcher in architecture, and I do not have good knowledge in programming.\n\nies2rad -dm -t default -m 1.0   TPH710_8xTL5-28W_827_865_HFR.ies\n\nxform -rx 90 -t 4.52 -0.05  1.455 TPH710_8xTL5-28W_827_865_HFR.rad > artificial light.rad\n\nand here is my script\n\n\"oconv env.rad lab_surfaces_corrected_moved.rad lab_windows_and_doors.rad artificial light.rad> lab.oct\", # gendaylit.rad is generated by this script\n\"echo '4.52    0.85 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"3.74    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"4.52    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\"5.30    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n\n\n\"' | rtrace -w -af /tmp/bpi.amb -as 512 -ar 64 -aa 0.15 -ab 3 -I+ -h lab.oct | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179'\"\n\n]\n\nThank you very much,\n\nBest regards,\n\nSokol Dervishi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
