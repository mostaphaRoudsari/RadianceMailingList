However, despite using a clean output from Optics, I can't get a complete output from Optics2glazedb (all I get is an header with no value):\n\nSurface Tr Tg Tb Rcr Rcg Rcb Rgr Rgg Rgb Part\n\n\nOn the other hand, when I pass a LowE on clear from Viracon (The other glass taken from your example - NFRC ID= 6046) the script return a good output.\n\nDo you have any idea of what is going on ? (In fact, I should probably ask: what am I doing wrong ?)\nI'm working on Cygwin, this may be the cause of the problem...\n\n\nAlso, you mentioned that the first glass material description must be for an uncoated ''clear'' glass. Can you give more explanation about that ? Is this a limitation of the Glaze script ?\n\n\nOnce again, thanks for your help, I very appreciate it !\n\n\n\nFran?ois\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, December 07, 2010 12:29 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Francois,\n\nGreat, let me know if you have any questions.\n\n-Jack\n\n\n--\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n\n# president\n\n#\n\n# visarc incorporated\n\n# http://www.visarc.com\n\n#\n\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 12/7/2010 11:56 AM, Fran?ois Cantin wrote:\nHi Jack,\n\nThanks for your fast reply.
