{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\n\nActually, you want your rectangles to be the four sides plus another\none _below_ the coffer, sealing it off from the world, so to speak.\nThe idea is that the mkillum replaces these surfaces with illum light\nsources (imposters), whose output distributions mimics the\ncoffer/ceiling combination.  You need to make sure that source rays\ncan't sneak past this geometry, which is why you want it to make a\ntight seal around your luminaire system.\n\n-G\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: -ar, -ad, -as, ahh $#*@!", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CB43DA84-E2E7-11D7-9D6C-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 9 Sep 2003 10:05:20 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: -ar, -ad, -as, ahh $#*@!"}
