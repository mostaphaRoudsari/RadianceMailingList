{"body": "\n\nHi,\n\nif you installed the compiled binaries, there is no need to run the\nmakeall script. This one is needed to build and install from sources.\n\nI do not know where the binaries got installed (I guess something like\nin /opt or /usr/local), but you should set RAYPATH, maybe PATH, and go\nusing radiance.\n\nIf you download the sources, you will need a compiler, make, maybe some\nother tools found on most systems, and run makeinstall. The contributer\nwho created the binary package already did this for you!\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re:  Radiance-general Digest, Vol 47, Issue 11", "sender": "Lars O.
