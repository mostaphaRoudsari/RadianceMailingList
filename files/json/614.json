For example 4 polygons that\nform the perimeter around the coffer and are \"extruded\" (for lack of a\nbetter term) down from the ceiling/coffer surface, these polygons should\nbe capped with a 5th that in essence encloses the coffer. Note that the\nnormals for these polygons must all point out into the the room. The\nfunction of this box is to \"catch\" the light from the true sources in\nthe coffer  in the mkillum calculation and then subsequently serve as\nthe light emitting surfaces (hidden because they are illums) for the\ncoffer based on the data that is generated by the mkillum calc. The\nappearance of the light in the coffer itself can be controlled by using\nglow surfaces in place of the light sources in the coffer with a radius\napplied for each glow to enable the glow some minimal calculation\nability within the coffer and behind the illum.\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3F5E06E3.9000702@visarc.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 09 Sep 2003 12:59:15 -0400", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] -ar, -ad, -as, ahh $#*@!References: <A8C55E4A-E2DD-11D7-96A6-000A956D40C8@lmi.net> <3F5E036F.2060405@rumblestrip.org>"}
