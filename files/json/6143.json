{"body": "\n\nMark this almost solved..\nWell I am using Sketchup export with SU2RAD. Initially, I was trying to view the sunpatchs on the far wall and floorplan with viewer's back to the window. When I rendered with the view towards the window opening (and gensky with +s sunny sky) I couldn't 'see' the sun patch. But when I checked with sketchup, I could see where a sunpatch should be, but it didn't appear in the render. To make sure ,I used sketchup shadow with time and location that shows a sunpatch clearly. Time is set 07:49am EST in sketchup; after export the generated sky file shows:\n\n!gensky 10 31 +02:49 -a 45.52 -o 73.57 -m 75.0 +s -g 0.2 -t 1.7| xform -rz -0.0\n\nobviously not what I wanted..So it renders correctlafter I manualy set the time to 07:49....could it be the exporter causing the 5hr difference???\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general]radiance daylight study", "sender": "steve michel", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY143-W3673DA0F7C143CE8B1D1AAE03C0@phx.gbl>", "refs": ["<200801170940239.SM01672@[207.241.74.99]>", "<478FA6ED.10803@gmx.net>\t<BAY143-W24D07C946A280DA14982DBE0430@phx.gbl>", "<30A095DE-FA77-410B-BD63-56BE07B18DB7@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Sat Jan 19 20:54:15 2008", "email": "smichel_designer at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general]radiance daylight study"}
