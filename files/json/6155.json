This is useful.\n\n\nFormula:  tn=1.09*Tn (Axel's RADIANCE Cookbook, p. 21) is simplification of\nformula on p.20.\n\n\nI agree with that.\n\n\nOk. Idea with scaling is obviously out.\n\n\nI know that I have to use mkillum surface at my glass pane, I just forgot to\nwrite it. Thank you anyway. But, how can I use mkillum surface on the inner side\nof the blinds? I checked, when the blinds is down (angle=-90) the surface normal\nof slats points into the office.\nTo create the distribution for the window:\nmkillum -ab 0 < objects/window.rad scene.oct > tmp/iwindow.rad\nCan I use this to create the distribution for the blinds:\nmkillum -ab 0 < blinds.rad scene.oct > tmp/iblinds.rad\n\n\n:-)\n\n\nI plan to use a single surface in place of the window glass.\n\n\nPlease, can you explain me this: \"render illuminance on a work plane (maybe you\nput a desk surface into your model) using rpict -i\".\n\nCheers, Milan\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Milan Cakanovic", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 02:55:26 +0000 (UTC)"}
