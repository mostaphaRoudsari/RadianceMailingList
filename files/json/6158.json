{"body": "\nHi Lucio,\n\nYes, it is true that pinterp needs to fill in missing pixel values,\nwhich is why you need a very high resolution image.  (In fact, it\nwould make sense to set the vertical resolution higher than the\nhorizontal resolution, with the -pa 0 option to allow non-square\npixels.)  However, the results should still be valid.\n\nIf you are concerned about calculation efficiency, then you could\nwrite a script as you suggest.  First, you would use vwrays to feed\nrtrace and get it to generate intersection points for all the\npositions on the orthogonal view.  Second, you would apply a script\nto convert these positions to directions from the observer for a\nsecond rtrace run that would compute your radiance values.  This\nwould be output to an image.  I guess it would go something like:\n\n% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \\\n| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct \\\n| rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ' \\\n| rtrace -ffc -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \\\n| falsecolor -cl -s auto \\\n| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif\n\nwhere XRES and YRES are the desired map resolution and OX, OY, and OZ\nare the observer coordinates.  (E.g., add -e 'OX:10.5;OY:-3.9;OZ=2'\nto the rcalc line.)\n\nI hope this makes sense.  It may require some adjustments -- I didn't\ntest it out!\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: falsecolor's isolux on observer's luminance.", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EA25E4A2-3A1E-40AE-BCB5-87E0EBFAF6DF@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<JVQ6D2$148B6C2D7564DA3F4F30121DC8064FAC@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb  4 09:56:19 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: falsecolor's isolux on observer's luminance."}
