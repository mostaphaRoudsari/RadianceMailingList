I have done some preliminary calculations, and when I\nuse rtrace with -ab 8 (for more accuracy), calculation takes a long time (4 - 5\nmin). If I want to calculate illumination for few more points, I will increase\nthe calculation time for few times. For now, I will just avoid situations when\ndirect sunlight passing between the slats.\n\n\nWith this statement, you're opened my eyes. I did not know that, how you say,\nsome of the angular dependence is accounted for in the material primitive\n\"glass\". I can live with \"It's not very accurate\".\n\n\nI know that, but thank you anyway.\n\n\nAgain, you're opened my eyes with this statement.\n\n\nNow, when I know all this, I have no need to split my calculation.\n\"...because the problem you see does not really exist.\" Well, because I have\nbugs (or worms) in my head, the problem existed. :-) If I had known that some of\nthe angular dependence is accounted for in the material primitive \"glass\", I\nwould not have written a bunch of nonsense.\n\nThank you for all.\n\nRegards and Happy New Year!  Milan\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Milan Cakanovic", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 13:24:21 +0000 (UTC)"}
