I'm not sure that's logical.\n\n2) The density is much better at the top than at the bottom.\nTherefore the lower you get the more zero contributions you\nget.\n\n\nWhen I look at your render options below I see that you have an\n'-ab' of 0 which limits your (final) rtrace calculation to the direct\ncomponent only. However, glow surfaces are considered direct\ncontributors in Radiance. If you want to use this setting you should\nchange all the definitions of 'glow' in your materials to 'light'. And\nthen you probably have to subdivide large polygons like the ground.\n\n\nInstead of sed you can just add \"-h\" to rtrace to suppress the\nheader information. No sed required. You should also add a \"-w\"\nto avoid any warning messages.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DE75D43@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 17:43:44 -0500"}
