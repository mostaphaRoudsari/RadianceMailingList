Then\nrtrace will calculate the luminance values at the rays intersections with\nyour desk plane which is what you expect I think...\n\nHope this will help you.\nRapha?l Compagnon\n\nit seems you are tracing rays\nAt 01.05.2004 01:40, you wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040503/75ffd6f8/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: rtrace for luminance values", "tags": [], "sender": "Raphael Compagnon", "datetime": "Mon May  3 08:57:41 2004"}
