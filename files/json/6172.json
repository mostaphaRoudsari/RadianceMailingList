Direct\nsampling (subdivision of the source) occurs relative to the \"center\" of\nthe ground plane geometry, which is why you may not be seeing what you\nexpect. Additionally if the center of a ground plane object is \"under\"\none of the buildings this will contribute to some of the effects that\nyou are seeing. As a test I would consider constructing the ground plane\nof multiple polygons (probably should be quads) where the edge of a\ngiven polygon meets the edge of a building side at the \"ground.\"\n\nI think that another thing to add into your command line is to set\ndirect jitter (-dj). I think you could start out with with -dj .7 and\nsee what happens.\n\nI would try reconstructing your ground plane first and then run as is\nwith your original command line, then you can try setting -dj to further\nadjust things.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 1/3/2011 8:37 AM, Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110103/4e01eda2/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DE75F6D@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon, 03 Jan 2011 10:23:09 -0500"}
