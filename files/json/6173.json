The direct calculation really doesn't work very well for abutting surfaces, so you are better off using zero radii on your glow materials.  How are you even seeing a pattern, though?  Glow materials don't reflect light.  I thought you had some glow materials and some regular ones.  Are you using a mixture between a glow material and a diffuse material?  I could then understand your results.\n\nIf you use -ab 1 and zero radii for your glow materials, then your results should be much improved.  You don't need to break up your ground plane.  I don't think you will ever be satisfied with the output, otherwise.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110103/4a0e2fe7/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C091DE75F6D@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 3 Jan 2011 09:31:59 -0800"}
