The falsecolor C-shell script was replaced with a Perl script written by Axel Jacobs, and I guess this particular option wasn't tested.  There was a set of single-quotes that needed to be double-quotes, which I have fixed and checked in this morning.  It should appear in tomorrow's HEAD.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<6025C928C785944983BD457EB996C1360CC9F0F904@SG-EXCHMB1>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 4 Jan 2011 09:02:00 -0800"}
