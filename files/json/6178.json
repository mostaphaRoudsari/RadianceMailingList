Yes, I submitted a Perl replacement of the\nfalsecolor.csh script a couple of months ago. I wrote the Perl script\nsome time ago, needing to run fc on a server that didn't have CSH\ninstalled. Well, it seems I did not test all options thoroughly.\nApologies for that.\n\nI have since looked at some of the other CSH scripts, and started\nre-writing some of them. In the long run (Radiance 5.0???), I was hoping\nto get rid of all of them and replace them with Perl. If there are any\n'Perlistas' out there willing to adopt a CSH script and turn it into a\nPerl one, please get in touch with me. I would not like to burden Greg\nwith this for now. Maybe amongst us, we can come up with a 'coding\nstandard' to have some consistency here. I've got a few ideas and\nexperice with Perl coding (WebHDR is all done in Perl), but it's all a\nbit rusty...\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<mailman.1.1294171200.45403.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed, 05 Jan 2011 00:47:43 +0000"}
