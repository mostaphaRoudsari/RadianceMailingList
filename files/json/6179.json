{"body": "\nLucio, If you add \"-t [time in seconds]\" to your rpict command line it\nwill periodically report the progress as the calculation runs.  The same\nresult can be had by adding the line \"REPORT= [time in minutes]\" to your\nrif file.  Alternatively, if you prefer not to clutter your terminal,\nyou can pause the process \"<ctrl-z>\" and bring it back to the foreground\n\"fg <enter>\" and it should report the progress once.\n\n-Chris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, 08 February, 2008 9:24 AM\nTo: radiance-general\nHey, it looks like I'm quite monopolizing this mailing list.. I'm\nsorry.. !!\n\nSome time ago, if I didn't just dream it, I run into some explanation on\nhow to monitor rpict progress status. If I remember well, it was\nachieved with a light kill message to rpict process. In fact when\nkilling it, it returns the rpict progress. It was a way to achieve same\ninformation without actually killing it. I thought I found this\ninformation in Axel Jacobs' tutorials, but I'm not able to find it any\nmore.\n\nCan someone help me ?\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n.. Caminante no hay camino, solo se hace camino al andar ..\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict progress status", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7025DCCB8@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<JVXBZE$6D5CF5C4E9D46AA13C64A08A0B184F1D@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Fri Feb  8 06:50:51 2008", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict progress status"}
