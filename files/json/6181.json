{"body": "\nHi Lucio,\n\nI'm glad that the basic idea works.  The command I sent you does\nliterally what you asked, which is to show the luminance in the\ndirection of the desired point.  As you noticed, the ray does not\nnecessarily get there.  To ensure that it does, you could simply\nstart the ray closer to the target point by replacing the rcalc\ncommand with:\n\nrcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=$1-nrm*Dx;$2=$2-nrm*Dy;$3=$3-nrm*Dz;$4=Dx;\n$5=Dy;$6=Dz' \\\n-e 'Dx=$1-OX;Dy=$2-OY;Dz=$3-OZ;nrm=0.001/sqrt(Dx*Dx+Dy*Dy+Dz*Dz)'\n\nWhat this does is start each ray a short distance (0.001 in world\nunits) from the target point, ensuring that no intervening geometry\nobstructs the view.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<JVX9CE$D691D5EF85608EA8B435A9513D861A9E@libero.it>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8FC8F4C4-A837-4CCA-95B1-3FD799E7D681@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<JVX9CE$D691D5EF85608EA8B435A9513D861A9E@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Fri Feb  8 07:32:30 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: falsecolor's isolux on observer'sluminance."}
