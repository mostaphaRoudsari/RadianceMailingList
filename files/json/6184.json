If you use genBSDF to create this file, the geometry is inserted into the final model using mkillum.  If you don't care so much about the direct component (sunlight passing between the slats onto interior surfaces), then rtcontrib will be much faster if you are computing many time points.  My feeling is that this should work well enough for glare evaluations.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Simulating rooms with blinds: performanc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 5 Jan 2011 12:50:05 -0800"}
