{"body": "\nHi Lucio,\n\nI just wanted to follow-up. I went through the steps of compiling\nradiance on a machine with a relatively stock install of Ubuntu 7.10\n(gutsy) (a workstation install). In order to get Radiance to compile I\nhad to add the following using the Synaptics package manager:\n\n* Libraries (these are needed for compiling stock Radiance)\no libc6-dev\no libx11-dev\n* Development (these are needed for compiling libtiff and trad)\no g++-4.1 - pick a version that matches the level of your\ncurrent gcc\no tcl 8.4\n\nNote that in using the Synaptics package manger, the system will also\ninstall any needed dependencies for the above packages, so this is the\nway to go. Note if you do not have csh installed you will also need to\ninstall csh.\n\nWhile working through this I also encountered a couple of minor issues\nin the Radiance Head from last week. I passed some fixes along to Greg\nand I believe that an updated Head is available.\n\nWith all of this Radiance compiles with no problems. As an additional\nthough, if there is enough interest (although learning to compile is a\ngood thing to know), I can tar up the binaries I made and make them\navailable for download. Let me know.\n\n-Jack\n\nloscotec@libero.it wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080212/85c402b1/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HEAD - Radiance on Ubuntu - 7.10", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<47B1BB22.9010807@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<JVVRMM$14D72541F5C5785D27F993F14DBB20B3@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Tue Feb 12 07:28:48 2008", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HEAD - Radiance on Ubuntu - 7.10"}
