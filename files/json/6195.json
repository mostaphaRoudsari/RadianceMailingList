The rpiece program takes care of dividing a single image into pieces if that is your desire.\n\n\nRegrettably no, you need a separate syncfile for rpict and rtrace, as they are different executables.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Instances", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Jan 2011 15:22:24 -0800"}
