The rpiece program takes care of dividing a single image into pieces if that is your desire.\n\n\nRegrettably no, you need a separate syncfile for rpict and rtrace, as they are different executables.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Instances", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "datetime": "Mon, 10 Jan 2011 15:06:48 +0000"}
