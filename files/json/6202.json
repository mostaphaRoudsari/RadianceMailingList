The -x and -y parameters allow to set a\ntarget resolution. Many use them like -x /2 -y /2 to downsample, but you\ncan also do the opposite by setting -x /.5 -y /.5 and achieve upsampling.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110112/d705f537/attachment.bin>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Up-sampling a radiance picture?", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
