In an attempt to help our students to\nstart thinking about the problem, we are teaching them HDR photography\nand computer-based analysis methods via Radiance/Daysim/Evalglare. We\nare now interested in how far you are currently dealing with glare in\nyour practice (or teaching) and invite you to participate in a survey on\n'Glare Analysis and HDR Photography in Contemporary Architectural\nPractice'. The survey is conducted as part of a Master's thesis by\nRashida Mogri at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. It\ntakes literally five minutes to complete and you may 'reward ' yourself\nafterwards by reviewing some of the glare-related material on our web\nsite at\nwww.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/GlareRecommendationsForPractice.h\ntml.\n\n\n\nTo participate in the survey please go to\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s/hdrphotography.
