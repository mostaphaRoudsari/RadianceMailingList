You can send me the *.skp file with the imported geometry and I'll poke around a bit.\n\n2011/1/17 Claus Br?ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk>:\n\nThe basic SketchUp unit is 1 inch. So if you import something with 1x1 units size it turns into roughly 0.025 meters.\n\n\n[...]\n\n\nMost directories are empty at this stage because they are used for the rendering process. However, you are missing a *.rif file and an \"objects\" directory, which tells me that there must have been a problem during the export.\n\nYou can open the Ruby console window before you start the export. This will show any script errors in the console and helps to see if the export finishes successfully.\n\nI am very surprised that the \"luminaires\" directory is created and that there is an *.ies file that's supposed to be converted.\nI thought I had disabled this feature in the official versions so far.\n\nThomas\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: 3dstoskpimport.skp\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 64713 bytes\nDesc: 3dstoskpimport.skp\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110117/c6ca5975/attachment-0001.obj>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?", "tags": [], "sender": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "datetime": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 22:47:50 +0100"}
