The only top level entity in your scene is the component \"skp2c40\".\nThis component is created via export to a file \"skp2C40.tmp\" and then\nloaded into your current file. su2rad tries to find an *.ies file by\nsubstituting a \".ies\" extension for a \".skp\" extension. However, since\nthe file doesn't end with \".skp\" nothing is substituted and the path to\n\"skp2C40.tmp\" is returned as IES path. Therefore no geometry is created\nand the whole export is replaced with an ies2rad command.\n\nTemporary fix for now: delete the file\n'C:/Users/cbm/AppData/Local/Temp/skp2C40.tmp' and any other skp*.tmp\nfiles you might find there.\n\nI can send you a file with a fix for su2rad later.\n\n\nHere is the real problem of the export: Because there is no geometry\nthere is also no \"objects\" directory. The script tries to list it's contents\nand crashes. Another thing I need to change.\n\nIf you can get rid of the wrong IES replacement above this should not\nbe an issue any more.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3ds Max -> sketchup -> su2rad ?", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 18:16:03 -0500"}
