{"body": "\nHello Stefan,\n\nThis is simply the round-off error associated with the Radiance RGBE\nformat.  Since the picture format uses three mantissas with a common\nexponent, it is not possible to represent a non-zero value in one\nchannel and a zero value in another channel.  Even though the actual\nbyte stored for green and blue may be zero in your calculation, the\ndecoder will interpret this as half a count out of 255 and give a\ncorresponding value.\n\nSince the main purpose of Radiance is lighting calculations for\nvisual simulation, and the eye's color channels have a (more or less)\nlinear response, this is an appropriate/adequate representations for\nthe design application.  If you need the original floating point\nvalues, and don't mind files than are about 5 times bigger, you can\nuse vwrays with rtrace and output floating point images directly.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict: color channel separation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<87BFA202-3280-466F-BDD8-45F8C146BC34@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<mailman.0.1203331125.3371.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>", "<20080218105605.240720@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb 18 05:43:14 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict: color channel separation"}
