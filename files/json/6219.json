The math is a little bit complicated, and I admit that I do not fully understand its relationship to the geometry of the CIE horseshoe diagram, so I'm not sure I can resolve your conundrum.  I know you have to account for the white point, which in the case of the Radiance color space is set to neutral gray (x,y)=(1/3,1/3).  It looks like the CIE formulas, which I copied out of a text somewhere, apply ratios of cross products, but I really have no idea why.\n\nI'm sorry I can't be of more help.  If I knew of a text that explained this intuitively, I would refer you (and myself) to it....\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] primaries, horseshoes and v(lambda)", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 18 Jan 2011 07:50:56 -0800"}
