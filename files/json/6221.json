How do i declare the variable for light vectors and update the light vectors\nin the scene file ?\n2. What are the steps to do it ?\n\n( I am still using 3.9 version)\nBest Regards,\nBrajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110120/6e5050f3/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Brajesh Lal", "datetime": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 00:35:01 -0800 (PST)"}
