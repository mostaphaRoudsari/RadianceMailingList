{"body": "\nYou're welcome, I'm glad my guess was correct. Btw, I often get geometry - esp. from landscape or road planning departments - and they always use the local coordinate system. That means you would have X/Y/Z like 82045.5708,235594.1030,587.4538.\n\nWhen your model ist that far away from 0,0,0 you have to expect problems. For instance running an interactive 'rview/rvu' session it will be hard to fine tune your view-point/direction settings because (from memory) if you have a 6 digit number like the y coord above rview will cut off everything after the 6 digits. Am I making sense?\n\nAnyway, I dont have time (nor experience) to analyze the radiance code but somewhere in the source tree you would find certain #define statements that determine the limitations of all geometry coordinates.\nMy workaround is to 'move' the whole model (close) to 0,0,0 either in the CAD program proir to export or with the xform -t $x $y $z tool within Radiance.\n\nHTH,\nErwin\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nTo:      radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DIIE.00001A870002C6E8@192.168.0.81>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb 20 03:51:46 2008", "email": "radiance at rendigo.com", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] ecotect export - missing surfaces (19-Feb-2008 17:05)From:    Nick Doylend <radiance@ndoylend.fastmail.fm>"}
