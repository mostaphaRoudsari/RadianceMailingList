Depending on your scene you should increase the \"-ab\n2\" to \"-ab 5\" or \"-ab 6\" to capture the ambient light more accurately.\nHowever, I assume that you also need to set other parameters to\nimprove the quality of your rendering/calculation.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering without shadow", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 10:00:00 -0500"}
