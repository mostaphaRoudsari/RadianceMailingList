{"body": "\nHello -\n\nI have been trying to get Radiance loaded to my OS X system (v. 10.4.11).  I am new to UNIX, so the process has been a bit rocky - but - makeall install and makeall library worked out (mostly) fine, and I changed the /etc/profile file to include RAYPATH, and everything seemed to be working fine.  Commands like genprism work and the .oct file built OK.  However, when I went to run rview I get this error:\n\nrview: cannot open X-windows; DISPLAY variable set?\nrview: fatal - cannot initialize x11\n\nI have tried setting DISPLAY=0 and no effect.  I even went so far as to write this little ditty into  /etc/profile on  the advice of a radiance-general user:\n\nif [ -z \"${DISPLAY}\" ];then echo -n\nexport DISPLAY=':0'\nfi\n\nalso, no luck.  So, now I am begging the wisdom of more advanced users.\n\nany advice?\n\nthanks a million\n\nDave\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Dave Bosworth", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<24697398.1203554462358.JavaMail.root@elwamui-chisos.atl.sa.earthlink.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Feb 20 16:41:07 2008", "email": "dboz66 at earthlink.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] X 11 trouble with OS X"}
