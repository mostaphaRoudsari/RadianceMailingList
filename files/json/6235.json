{"body": "\nHi Adityia.\n\nWhat is the problem with the tutorial you found online? I could try helping you since I recently followed and have been helped about it.\n\nIf you prefer not to follow that way at this address:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad3R8_linux.tar.gz\n\nthere are the binaries for linux.\n\nYou just have to place them in your favourite directory, say ~/radiance/bin for binaries and ~/radiance/lib for libraries and put these lines in ,bashrc :\n\nexport PATH=.:~/radiance/bin:$PATH\nexport RAYPATH=.:~/radiance/lib\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n.Hi All,\n.\n.can any one please guide me in installing radiance on Ubuntu 7.10 . I have\n.tried to install using the online help at this website\n.ttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/standard_unix_distribution<http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/standard_unix_distribution>)\n.but it doesn't seem to work . is there any specific tutorial or web link\n.where i can download both the binaries and installation instruction.\n.\n.my basic reason for installing radiance on ubuntu or Linux based platform is\n.to ultimately use the radmap program with in radiance,which is not compiled\n.for windows based systems as of now.\n.\n.thank you,\n.\n.--\n.Aditya Potipireddi\n.MS Building Design ( Energy & Climate)\n.Arizona State University\n.tel. 480.544.4936\n.\n\n..
