If you're really that desperate, it will\nprobably only require minor changes.\nBtw. Rob: Torad is most likely the \"nifty LISP routine\" doing\nthe nested block unrolling. It's more than 10 years old.\nRadout is basically a rewrite of that functionality in C/C++.\n\nThe current Radout binaries won't work. The binary API has\nchanged between 2002 and 2004, which means that ObjectARX\napplications need to be recompiled against the new libraries.\nAlthough Autodesk recently forced me to upgrade (which brought my\nbudget into serious danger), I haven't yet found the time to do\nthat. Actually, after I had to replace my computer last month,\nI still need to get Vmware running again. Besides that, I'm not\nsure if I also need to get a current version of VC++, and there\nmay be a few other dependencies. In short, anyone buying a copy\nor Rayfront will help accelerate the process... ;)\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] radiance error messag", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Tue May  4 19:38:52 2004"}
