What's striking is the way some of the rtrace\nprocesses seem to \"get ahead\" of the others.  It was actually worse\nbefore I took that ps snapshot, with the last two processes having\naccumulated run times of 30 minutes or so, while the first six had only\nrun about 10 minutes.  The same sensparm.opt file (modulo a change of a\n-sj) continues to work as expected on dino.  The main things I changed\nseems to have been installing os updates and bringing Radiance to its\nhead version, but I am actually suspecting an os glitch.\n\nRandolph\n\nsensparm.opt:\n-dp 2048\n-ar 49\n-ms 1.9\n-ds .2\n-dt .05\n-dc .75\n-dr 3\n-sj 1\n-st .01\n-ab 5\n-aa .075\n-ad 4096\n-as 2048\n-av 0.01 0.01 0.01\n-lr 12\n-lw .0005\n\n\nOn 2011-02-02 22:14:52 -0800, Greg Ward said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph M.
