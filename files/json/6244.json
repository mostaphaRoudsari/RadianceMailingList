Do you have a\ncandela distribution (either as a print-out or as an IES or Eulumdat\nfile)?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\nBTW I changed the subject line, I guess this thread is not about trans\nmaterial questions.\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\n<AANLkTinzABtdyfBCfxrobicBttxdrTxg7uDgQmvCYnRd at mail.gmail.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nOn Mon, Jan 31, 2011 at 6:41 AM, Tim Metcalfe <tmetcalfe at kalwall.com> wrote:\n\nTim. I hope you are looking just for a way to import distribution data\ninto Ecotect.\n\nIn that case, IES is your friend. IIRC you define it as a type of\nmaterial in Ecotect. If you go through the materials you should find\nsome examples for \"light materials\" which should get you going.\n\nIf you want to roll your own IES file ...\n\nAre you sure about this? If you have a fitting that's safety-tested\nenough to go in a stadium you should be able to get an IES file. If\nnot I would still look for a distribution file of a similar fitting\nbefore I start to hack together my own IES file.\n\nIf you really want to dive into it I recommend \"Thinking\nPhotometrically (II)\" by Ian Ashdown as first start:\n\nhttp://www.dial.de/CMS/German/Articles/Licht/Service/Downloads/Thinking_Photometrically_II.pdf\n\nGood luck,\nThomas\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nMessage-ID: <C96C35E7.30AB%robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nI don't think it's all that difficult to create an IES file from scratch\n(assuming one has a proper test report and either IES LM-63 or Ian's great\npaper that Thomas cites below). Lighting Analysts has a nice piece of\nsoftware called \"Photometric Toolbox\" that guides you through the process\nof generating your own IES file as well. But again, this assumes you have\na photometric test report with all the candela values in hand. If you\ndon't have that, Thomas' suggestion of trying to find a similar product\nthat has been tested is the way to go.\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 1/31/11 6:31 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at googlemail.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 83, Issue 23\n************************************************\n\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.
