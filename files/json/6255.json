{"body": "\nHi Dave,\n\nLike Mark suggests, you may not have X11 installed (or running).  It\nis still an optional install on many versions of Mac OS X, but it's\nthere under the Optional Installs of your system disk.  If you can't\nfind it there, you can also download it from Apple's website.  There\nshould be no need to compile it, but you will have to run it before\nstarting rvu.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] X 11 trouble with OS X", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<212782CF-07D6-4604-A8F5-08751C209E5E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<24697398.1203554462358.JavaMail.root@elwamui-chisos.atl.sa.earthlink.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Feb 20 17:29:23 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] X 11 trouble with OS X"}
