I have\ncollected hourly global horiz. illum. on roof and vertical illum. on\nfacade (using a LI-COR sensor) and have been making hourly comparisons\nbetween measured and simulated data. The building is surrounded by\nseveral buildings which block much of the direct sun reaching the\nfacade - I've included the obstructions in the computer model.\n\nWhile the simulated  global vertical illuminance levels on the facade\nare within +/-10% of those measured on site under diffuse light\nconditions (much of the light reaching the facade is diffuse due to\nheavy exterior obstructions), I am getting a high error when for\nsimulated vs actual illuminance under direct sun. Under direct sun,\nilluminance levels are underpredicted by 30% in the computer model.\n\nThe site is Berkeley, CA, and I used the Oakland weather file, so the\nlocation should be very close in terms of latitude/longitude and I\ndouble-checked the facade orientation (8 deg east of South). I\nexcluded all of the exterior obstructions and compared to illuminance\nlevels one might expect  under direct sun for that orientation using\ndaylight availability tables for San Francisco and the levels once\nagain seem low.\n\nHere is a bit more info on the model:\nCIE clear sky\n-ab 5 -ad 1024 -as 256 -ar 1064 -aa 0.1\nMax. dimension of the site/model modeled is 4,200 ft\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why illuminance levels under direct sun\nmight be underpredicted?\n\nThank you,\n\nKrystyna\n\nM.S. in Architecture student\nDepartment of Architecture\nUniversity of California - Berkeley\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "datetime": "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 15:16:58 -0800"}
