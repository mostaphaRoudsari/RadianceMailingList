Is there a way of forcing radiance\nto return only a yes/no type of value?\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\n\nBest,\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Sunlight hours calculation in radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Giovanni Betti", "datetime": "Tue, 15 Feb 2011 10:50:40 -0000"}
