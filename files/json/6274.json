Here are the commands you want:\n\necho \"VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 0 -vd 1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1\" > corrected.hdr\nra_xyze -r -o -u orig.hdr | pcompos -x 1200 - -200 0 >> corrected.hdr\n\nThe first one puts the view information you want in the header.  The ra_xyze command undoes the exposure on the image before passing it to pcompos, which does the cropping and appends it to the view header.\n\nHope this works.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] image formatting for input to evalglar", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 1 Mar 2011 08:14:47 -0800"}
