Your application\nhowever seems to require fairly precise values.  I think the\nonly way to achieve them with any certainty is to carry\nout a full blown time-varying daylight illuminance calculation\nusing a full year of 1hr met. data.  If you're not convinced,\nsee Figures 6.36 and 6.37 (Chapter 6) here:\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/zxcv-thesis/\n\nfor an illustration of the difference between static daylight\nfactors and time-varying daylight factors.\n\nTo generate time-varying daylight illuminances, try Christoph\nReinhart's DAYSIM package:\n\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/daysim.html\n\n-John Mardaljevic\n\nPS. I would have suggested also the DLS (IESD's own Radiance-based\ntool to predict time-varying daylight illuminance).  But\nit is currently broken becuase changes in Java have not yet been\nincorporated into the tool. :(\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Thu May  6 10:16:04 2004"}
