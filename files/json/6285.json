I have collected global horizontal exterior\nilluminance data, but no diffuse illum. or irradiance data, so I would\nthus like to use TMY3 data. I am using DIVA-for-Rhino which requires\nan input in W/m2 for gendaylit, so I have two options:\n\na) use the direct and diffuse horizontal irradiance values from the TMY3 file\nb) divide the direct and diffuse horizontal illuminances by 179 lm/W\nto obtain the irradiances\n\nWhich of these is the correct input for gendaylit?\n\nWhat is the significance of the luminous efficacy used in Radiance\n(179 lm/W)? The book \"Rendering with Radiance\" states that luminous\nefficacy can vary from 50 to 150 lm/W depending on the type of sky or\nlight considered (p357). And indeed when I divide for example, diffuse\nhorizontal illum. data by 179, the irradiances I get are quite\ndifferent from those in the TMY3 file.\n\nDoes this mean that I should use the irradiance data from the TMY3 file?\n\nThanks,\n\nKrystyna Zelenay\n\n\n\n\nfrom the site (but not irradiance data).The default DIVA input is in terms of\ndirect horizontal irradiance (W/m^2) and\ndiffuse horizontalirradiance (W/m^2)\n\nIs there a way to change the default input to\n\nNORMAL horizontal ILLUMINANCE (lm/m^2) and\ndiffuse horizontal ILLUMINANCE (lm/m^2)\n(i.e. similar to the -L option in the gendaylit command)\n\nAlternatively, does anyone know how to go about converting illuminance\nto irradiance data?\n\nThank you,\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "datetime": "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 00:11:41 -0700"}
