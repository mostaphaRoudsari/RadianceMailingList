I would probably avoid using the\n.hdr-extension for a depth-map, as its content are not hdr (in rgbe) but\nonly floats.\n\nBesides rpict, you could also use rtrace if you do not need the\nradiance/irradiance map but only the depth map. Probably I'd do that, as\nI could directly access the data then transparently without worrying\nabout scanline ordering and reading binary files :-)\n\nLook at the possible output values of rtrace (from 'man rtrace'):\n--\n(..)\n-ospec    Produce output fields  according  to  spec.   Characters\nare interpreted as follows:\n\no    origin (input)\n\nd    direction (normalized)\n\n(..)\n\nL    first intersection distance\n\n(..)\np    point of intersection\n(..)\n--\nSo lots of data you can get for finding the first point of intersection\nseen from a point of view. vwrays gives you ray directions to shoot at\nyour scene.\n\nMaybe this is helpful, maybe someone has a working example using rpict's -z?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 3d Depth of a pix", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
