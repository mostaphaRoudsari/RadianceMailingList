I could find missing\nfile GL/gl.h in Mesa 3-D graphics package and copy it to the /usr/include\nwhere it should probably be, but by this only first part of error was solved\n(above the line).\nThank you very much for any advices.\nDavid\n\n\nDavid:evalglare Dave$ make\ngcc -c -g -DMSDOS  -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3  -Wall  -o pictool.o\npictool.c -I. -Igeometry\nIn file included from pictool.h:12,\nfrom pictool.c:1:\ngeometry/g3affine.h:14:19: error: GL/gl.h: No such file or directory\nIn file included from pictool.h:12,\nfrom pictool.c:1:\ngeometry/g3affine.h:26: error: syntax error before 'GLdouble'\ngeometry/g3affine.h:27: error: syntax error before 'GLdouble'\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\npictool.c: In function 'read_exposure':\npictool.c:89: error: nested functions are disabled, use -fnested-functions\nto re-enable\npictool.c: In function 'pict_read_fp':\npictool.c:228: warning: unused variable 'ex'\npictool.c: In function 'pict_write_fp':\npictool.c:519: warning: unused variable 'argv'\npictool.c:518: warning: unused variable 'argc'\nmake: *** [pictool.o] Error 1\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110324/135d527e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Appelfeld", "datetime": "Thu, 24 Mar 2011 20:59:03 -0700"}
