I tried to use Grag's compiled\nversion and it is working. My problem was that I was not aware that I did\nnot copied the compiled version to the /usr/local/bin.\n\nI guess I also get it compiled by self, so I can share it with the list.\nThe probelem was that makefile can not locate GL/gl.h directory which is\nprobably called OpenGL on OSX after searching google. However I could get\nthe GL/gl.h and just copied it either to /usr/include or to unpacked\nevalglare into geometry directory.\n\nThen in \"makefile\" I changed\nCFLAGS     = -g -DMSDOS  -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3 $(DEBOPT) -Wall\n\nto\n\nCFLAGS     = -g -fnested-functions -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3 $(DEBOPT)\n-Wall\n\nand it seems that it got program compiled. I did not tested because I think\nit is better to use Grag's compiled version.\n\nProbably there will be more correct and elegant way to do it but I guess\nthis is working to.\n\nThank you\nDavid\n\nOn 25 March 2011 12:00, <radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL:\n<http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110\n325/f33e9977/attachment-0001.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 85, Issue 13\n************************************************\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 85, Issue 13", "tags": [], "sender": "d.appelfeld at gmail.com", "datetime": "Fri, 25 Mar 2011 12:22:02 -0700"}
