Understanding material appearance\ndraws on methods from diverse fields including the physics of light\ninteraction with material (including models of BRDF, bidirectional\nreflectance distribution functions, and BSSRDF, bidirectional\nsubsurface scattering reflection distribution functions), human\nperception of materials, and efficient data structures and algorithms.\n\nThis special issue will cover all aspects of material appearance in\ngraphics, ranging from theory to application. Possible topics include\n(but are not limited to)\n\n* first-principle models for BRDF and BSSRDF;\n* procedural models of materials;\n* modeling of mesoscale material features including bumps, ridges, and\nso on;\n* measurement of material appearance including BRDF, BSSRDF, and\nBTF (bidirectional texture functions);\n* numerical simulation of material appearance;\n* new instruments for measuring appearance;\n* material-appearance models from photo collections;\n* new data structures for representing material appearance;\n* efficient rendering of BTF and BSSRDF;\n* new interfaces for designing material appearance;\n* methods for printing hard copies of material appearance;\n* puter modeling;\n* material-appearance applications in industry such as the design\nof paints and coatings; and\n* nonphotorealistic rendering of material appearance.\n\nQuestions?\n\nContact Holly Rushmeier (holly at acm.org) or  Pierre Poulin\n(poulin at iro.umontreal.ca)\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nArticles should be no more than 8,000 words, with each figure counting\nas 200 words.
