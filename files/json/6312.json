{"body": "\nHello Ji-hyun,\n\nI was very embarrassed to find the following message sitting in my\n\"InBox,\" apparently unanswered.  Did anyone else write to you about\nthis?  It must have come at a busy moment and was forgotten in my\npile, so I apologize.  Let me know if you are still struggling with\nthis, and I'll compose a proper response.\n\nBasically, you should have a look at the \"glaze\" script included with\nRadiance.  Jack de Valpine of Visarc requested and sponsored its\ndevelopment, and the script is specifically targeted at multi-pane\nwindow systems.  It generates a BRTDfunc, which you may use as a\nguide in your process.\n\nAgain, I am very sorry for the delayed response.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Question regarding the BRTDFunc...", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A3F5566F-FFFB-43C1-BE53-BFE4230C7DC6@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<200710221516.l9MFGDsJ000644@aesl.hanyang.ac.kr>"], "datetime": "Wed Feb  6 16:38:30 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Question regarding the BRTDFunc..."}
