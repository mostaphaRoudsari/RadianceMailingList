{"body": "\nloscotec@libero.it wrote:\n\nWe're talking about lamp lumen depreciation (LLD) here, i.e. the gradual\ndecrease in lamp output over the life of the lamp--which can be\nsignificant in certain lamps.  This is the reason why you will see two\ncolumns for lumen output in any respectable lamp manufacturer's catalog,\nfor sources where this is an issue. Often called \"initial\" and \"design\"\nlumens, the design lumens are adjusted for a particular lamp's lumen\ndepreciation over its rated life.  Design lumens will always be lower\nthan initial, unless if you're looking at a first edition Philips lamp\ncatalog from 2005 (or 2004, can't remember) which, very embarrassingly,\ninverted the labels on the two values!  (I still have my copy somewhere,\nbut I doubt it will become a collector's item (except among a bunch of\nlighting geeks.))\n\nAnyway, back to LLDs... The LLD is but one of the elements that comprise\nthe overall light loss factor (LLF) that is commonly used in lighting\ncalculations to account for these and other losses inherent to a\nlighting design (room surface dirt, ballast factors, etc).  In Radiance,\nthis is accounted for with the multiplier (-m) in ies2rad (though you\ncan also use it to simulate higher or lower wattage lamps, or dimming, etc).\n\n***Which brings up a good point: if you are using colored lights in\nRadiance by referencing lamp.tab it's not a bad idea to check what\nlamp.tab thinks the LLD is and make sure it jives with your actual lamp,\nAND make sure that factor is REMOVED from the LLF that you are\n(hopefully) using in your multiplier.***\n\nHopefully the above paragraphs shed light on the answers to these\nquestions, which are \"no\", and \"yes\", respectively.  =8-)\n\n\nSee above...\n\nThe ies2rad man page does explain the lamp color and the lamp.tab\nlookups.  There is more info in lamp.tab itself.  General info about\nlight loss factors can be found in any decent lighting design\ncalculation text.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance and coloured lights", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<47AA49D1.40000@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<JVU893$A40F9CB35E5819555355940B693077CB@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Wed Feb  6 15:59:18 2008", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminance and coloured lights"}
