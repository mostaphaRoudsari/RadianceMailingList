{"body": "\nMmm.. I see.. Thank you very much.. but...\n\nwhat actually is depreciation?\n\nShould I run the command \"ies2rad -m 1.1764706 -t fluorescent lamp.ies\" to have right illumination ? If this is right, is there a reason why ies2rad does not do it automatically?\n\nIf it isn't right, are Calculux and Dialux using badly lights ? 15 % illuminance less is really something.. !!\n\nAnd, there is some documentation about all this stuff ? It would be an interesting chapter for my thesys I guess..\n\n\nSorry for the many question and for my ignorance.\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n.Greg Ward wrote:\n.> Hi Lucio,\n.>\n.> The lamp color data also includes depreciation factors, which probably\n.> account for the 10% difference.
