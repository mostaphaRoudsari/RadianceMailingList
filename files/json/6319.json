CP open a new\ncontrol panel, be sure that the options selected in Eco are the same\nin CP Radiance, and the click render. This data is very usefull to Daysim.\n\nThe other options is called Final Render, this options give the possibility\nto export Rad data to Eco analysis grid.\nTo export the data is very simple because Eco show an alarm of new data to\nexport when radiance had finished.\n\nYou can download powerfull information from the page of Harvard University,\nDiego Ibarra from Chile shows on PDF importants tips.\nBest Regards\n\n\n\n2011/4/10 dharam <dharmesh.124 at gmail.com>\n\n\n\n--\nJorge Ignacio Fajardo F-A\nArquitecto *MDCS*\n\niBSA - Ingenier?a Blanda S.A\nUSGBC Member\nJean Mermoz 12, of.
