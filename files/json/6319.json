I assume the \"white\" value\nis larger.\n\nA long-standing bug has been recently pointed out by Zack Rogers\nrelated to the orientation of full photometric distributions, and has\nbeen included in the latest HEAD available from radiance-online.org.\nA statement has also been added to clarify the assignment of the\nwidth (along y) and length (along x) axes.\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance and coloured lights", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<5B39DECB-C12D-4123-A7FC-94396CF6FD39@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<JVTMW1$F691248DD0A59D8384E7A31689E92284@libero.it>"], "datetime": "Wed Feb  6 07:41:18 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminance and coloured lights"}
