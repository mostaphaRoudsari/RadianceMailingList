It's better to convert the units to meters\nduring the export. There is a conversion factor that should be set to\n\"0.001\".\n\nThe only relevant material information is the reflectance value. To simplify\nyour life you can use only grey colours where the r,g,b values are identical\nto the reflectance.\n\nFor a sky you probably want to chose a \"CIE overcast sky\". However, that\ndepends on your evaluations. Again, we need to know what you want to do.\n\nJust add a camera object. It can be exported as a view specification in\nRadiance. Once it is exported you can modify the specification in the\nscene.rif file.\n\nWhat do you want? Images or grid data? When you set up a grid it will be\nexported to a \"*.pts\" file which can be used in Radiance. Ecotect will also\nproduce a \"*.bat\" file with the required Radiance commands.\n\nIf you want illuminance images you have to set the right option during the\nexport. After that you can use falsecolor.exe or wxfalsecolor (\nhttp://pyrat.googlecode.com/files/wxfalsecolor.exe) to convert the images to\nfalsecolor images for comparison.\n\n\n\nOh man! Your screwed ...\n\n\n\nStart here:\n\nhttp://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/wiki/Radiance_Daylighting_Tutorial\n\nI think, most of the steps to export to Radiance are explained there. You\nstill need to have the model \"built\" correctly, though.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110413/67530ce8/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HELP", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 13:14:03 -0500"}
