See\nhttp://www.new-learn.info/learn/about/doc/jacobs_hdr_varna2007.pdf\nfor a paper on this, and\nhttp://www.new-learn.info/learn/about/doc/pres_jacobs_hdr_varna2007.pdf\nfor the presentation to go with it.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\nPS: WebHDR will be down for the next couple of days.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR image absolute calibration cmd li", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Thu, 14 Apr 2011 20:39:26 +0100"}
