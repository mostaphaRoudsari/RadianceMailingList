X11 on Leopard is a little clunky.  If you start it from an X11\nicon in the dock, you may end up with two X11 icons.  Which doesn't\nhurt, but it is annoying nonetheless.  The workaround I stumbled upon\nwas to drag the X11 application icon to the lower-left pane of the\nFinder (i.e. making a  shortcut X11 icon), and then starting X11 from\nthat.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<46C4F50B-2759-4E88-BBE4-7BDCB7F5D24F@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Mar 10 02:43:00 2008", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Problem installing radiance onto Mac OSX-Leopard:running trad"}
