Both options of course available in gensky.  I'm\nnot too familiar with the procedures used to estimate sky type and\nmagnitude since I invariably use climate data as the basis for\ndefining skies.  For what it's worth, I've long believed that there\nwas a 'disconnect' between what the sky model researchers were doing\nand what end-users might actually want, i.e. a means of selecting sky\ntype from basic quantities in the standardised climate files.\n\nEven if one could claim that a particular clear sky output was\nplausible, it still seems wacky to predict for a clear sky without\nsun. I've updated my commentary on this with a graphic to show just\nhow much might be missing if you don't include the sun:\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:daylight-compliance#daylight_leed\n\n\nPerhaps, half-listening.  Averages for daylighting quantities can be a\nconfounding notion, and often lead to contortions best left to people\nwho enjoy doing this:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)\n\nDo you have actual wording from the LEED draft?\n\nBest\nJohn\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Fri, 15 Apr 2011 10:29:10 +0100"}
