{"body": "\n\nI know this is supposed to be fairly basic but needs clarification: I want to get lux readings from my pic files\nWhen generating *.pic files (with -i option for irradiance) , viewing them with ximage and\nselecting a point with the ximage 'l' command gives me values that are clearly NOT lux values (values appear to be 1/10th of my expected lux measurement).\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't the value in W/m2 at an efficacy of 179lm/watt? For daylight only or all irradiances? If so, what conversion to get lux values?\n\n\nregards\nSteve\n_________________________________________________________________\nCreate a handy button so your friends can add U to their buddy list.
