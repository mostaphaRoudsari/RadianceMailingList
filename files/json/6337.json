{"body": "\nHi Steve,\n\nA direct/indirect fixture needs an interreflection calculation for\nany level of accuracy.  I recommend setting -ab 1 on the rtrace\ncommand line, maybe even -ab 2.  This will take considerably longer\nto produce a result, but should be closer to what you expect if there\nis nothing amiss with your model.  The command you are using\notherwise looks OK.\n\nI'm a little surprised by the factor of 10, unless the fixture throws\nover 90% of its light towards the ceiling.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Ximage illuminance readings", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D6A47D6C-A26A-4D23-8F07-C1C1332250B4@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<000601c88274$e308a170$0d01a8c0@nest1>", "<B1D8FEC3-81DF-4DA8-BD35-CD3CFD1D07AD@arcor.de>", "<BAY143-W38D905C1E472A4144BCBC8E00E0@phx.gbl>", "<036605D5-446C-45FB-B3C9-45FD3EB1E8ED@lmi.net>", "<BAY143-W295F7D8092F5578EB0BE3CE00F0@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 10 19:57:53 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Ximage illuminance readings"}
