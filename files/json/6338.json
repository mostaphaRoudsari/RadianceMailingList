{"body": "\nDear Radiance Community,\nI'm more a faithful reader (than writer) of this newsgroup due to more\ncommon problems I had to deal with in the past.\nBut in my current project the architect wants a horizontally fully\nglazed roof for his atria. The roof height\nis 35m and due to sun protection reasons the roof should be fritted.\n\nThe main design criteria is, that the fritting should be realized in a\nway, that you can distinguish between shaded\nand alight areas on the floor.\n\nWe did some very rough experiments and saw very weak edges between\nshaded\nand alight areas. For the distance of 35 meters a shading element has be\nat least 40cm wide to produce a distinguishable\nshadow on the floor.\n\nIf I model this with Radiance the results show always very strong\nshadows with very sharp edges and I can't see any expected diffraction\neffects.\n\nSorry for the long introduction but my question is very short: Is it\npossible to model this effect with Radiance?\n\nBest regards,\nKai\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080311/24d66e38/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kai Babetzki", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF02C8C885@webmail.transsolar.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Mar 11 08:33:30 2008", "email": "babetzki at transsolar.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] soft edged shadows"}
