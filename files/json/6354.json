{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nGreg was kind enough to leave this announcement to me, since it was me\nwho has been giving him a hard time over it. Thanks for implementing\nthis, Greg!\n\nSo here we go:\n\nI have the honor to announce a new fisheye view type for Radiance. It\nis called the 'stereographic' or 'planispheric' projection. It is\nparticularly useful for sun path diagrams, as commonly used in\ndaylighting and overshadowing studies. Yes, it's true: no more messin'\nabout with .cal files--it's a native implementation. The option to\nrvu/rpict/trace is -vts.\n\nI've put together a little comparison of the three fisheye views:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/projections.pdf\nThis will eventually be merged into the Advanced Tutorial, but I don't\nhave the time for this right now.\n\nIf you feel like doing a little exercise with pen and paper (like our\nstudents do), get a sun path diagram from here:\nhttp://luxal.eu/resources/daylighting/sunpath.shtml,\n\nand follow Andrew's the instructions on the SquareOne web site:\nhttp://squ1.org/wiki/Sun-Path/Overshadowing\n\nGood projections to you all\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<100441490803161533r25c1f9d5o56744b255cfa18bc@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Mar 16 15:33:30 2008", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New stereographic fisheye view"}
