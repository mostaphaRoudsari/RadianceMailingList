{"body": "\nDear fellow polygon benders and ray wranglers.\n\nI have updated the download version of my su2rad Sketchup to Radiance\nexporter. All those who have downloaded it in the past are advised to\nget the new version because of the bug fixes it contains. Many thanks\nto those who have tested the script and reported success and failure.\n\nDownload link: http://su2rad.googlecode.com/files/su2rad_v00d.zip\n\nSome noteworthy new features\n\n* export by group, by color or by layer\n* import of rtrace results into Sketchup (as 3D fields)\n* experimental material library feature\n* experimental luminaire/geometry replacement feature\n\nPlease be aware of the experimental state of this script. The exported\nscenes still contain the occasional error and you should always verify\nthe created geometry.\n\nI have also bundled a small script that replaces the 'locations' dialog\n(Sketchup Pro feature) on Google Sketchup. It has no database of country\nand city coordinates but it allows the simple setting of longitude and\nlatitude values for the model. If you're only interested in this script\nyou can get the Ruby file here:\n\nlocation.rb: http://su2rad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/location/location.rb\n\nI haven't updated the online documentation yet but the features should\nbe easy enough to understand without it.\n\nHave fun!\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<15AEE4FA-1FAC-4B15-8F7A-CF28AB013F73@arcor.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Mar 16 16:33:23 2008", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad.rb - update of the Sketchup to Radianceconverter"}
