{"body": "\nHello all,\n\nI'm trying to simulate the occurrence of direct beam convergence; where\nsun hitting a concave, east facing, glass facade is redirected to form a\n\"hot-spot\" on the ground plane.  I have a photograph, and the time\ntaken, of the building in question forming a hot spot as well as a 3D\nmodel. Using the \"mirror\" material type I can get an approximate\nfacsimile, but not with the \"glass\" material. I've tried the glass using\n\"mkillum\" and setting -ar 0 but I still can't \"fry\" those ants.\n\nI'm under the impression that Radiance only considers the glass'\nreflected diffuse component, and not the direct (although I can see the\nsun's reflection in the glass)?  While close, I don't believe the\n\"mirror\" material will give the accuracy we're looking for due to the\ndifference in effect the angle of incidence has on the amount of light\nredirected off the two materials.  Any thoughts, advice or observations\nwould be greatly appreciated. Thanks.and regards.\n\nChris Humann\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: chumann.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 315 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080317/86871cd9/chumann.vcf\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general]Directional reflectance of glass", "sender": "Christian Humann", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<47DF200D.2010607@broadviewnet.net>", "refs": ["<FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF02C8C885@webmail.transsolar.com>", "<9FCE51DE-AD23-42FB-98D6-473D96A03DB1@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 17 17:54:08 2008", "email": "chumann at broadviewnet.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general]Directional reflectance of glass"}
