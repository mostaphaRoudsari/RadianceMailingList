{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nRadiance doesn't find the illumination of the sun off the glass\nmaterial because the sun is too small to locate with random (Monte\nCarlo) sampling.  The \"mirror\" type is the one to use, and you can\naccount for the effect of angle on reflection by including an\nappropriate brightfunc pattern.  Assuming standard 88% transmittance\nglass, this would be:\n\nvoid glass glass_alt_mat\n0\n0\n3 0.96 0.96 0.96\n\nvoid brightfunc glass_angular_effect\n2 A1+(1-A1)*(exp(-5.85*Rdot)-0.00287989916) .\n0\n1 0.08\n\nglass_angular_effect mirror glass_mat\n1 glass_alt_mat\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\nThe Fresnel approximation for unpolarized light was lifted out of src/\nrt/normal.c.  To change the reflectance of your glazing, you have to\nchange both the glass_alt_mat definition and the 0.08 normal\nreflectance value in glass_angular_effect.\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Directional reflectance of glass", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7A6BF059-282C-4899-9C8C-5AE7C3FC3BDE@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF02C8C885@webmail.transsolar.com>", "<9FCE51DE-AD23-42FB-98D6-473D96A03DB1@lmi.net>", "<47DF200D.2010607@broadviewnet.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 17 18:31:41 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Directional reflectance of glass"}
