I guess there must be\ntoo much ambient light so the highlights on the objects are invisible. I\nwant to turn off the ambient light in the scene and only keep a few area\nlight sources. How shall I set up the parameters? Also, how do I include these parametesr in the .rad file?\nthanks.\n\n\nBei\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Bei Xiao", "datetime": "Mon May 10 02:38:27 2004"}
