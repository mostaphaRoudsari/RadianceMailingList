The window is\nplaced in y=0.82, and the sensor is located in y=0.84, just behind the\nwindow. Due to the sensor location this close to the window I?m thinking I\nhave to subdivide the window to get a correct sensor reading, especially\nwhen solar shading is included in my simulations.\n\n\n\nI have run simulations for 4 different cases with different subdivisions of\nthe window. The transmission matrix is an .xml file generated with window6\nfor a clear window. Nothing special here, yet! In further simulations I?ll\nintroduce solar shading.\nMy simulation results show that the sensor signal differs with the different\nsubdivisions.\n\nYou can see the results and subdivision of window in this link:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/ThreePhaseMethod_Subdivision.pdf\n\nAnd my script if necessary, in this link:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/threephasemethod.bash\n\nThanks in advance,\nAnne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110428/85030efe/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Anne Iversen", "datetime": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 17:48:40 +0200"}
