{"body": "\nAxel,\n\nJust out of curiosity, in your projections.pdf document, the fish eye views show a scene that is mirrored on the top and bottom of the image.  Why is this?  If the view is looking straight up, I would think there would only be one building, one arch, one fountain, etc..  Also, the bottom of the image is darker than the top.  Can you explain?\n\nThanks\n\nMark\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080318/6bc48d7e/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<47DFD12A.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Mar 18 12:54:48 2008", "email": "MdelaFuente at wmtao.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New stereographic fisheye view"}
