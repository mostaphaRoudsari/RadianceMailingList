Course participants will acquire a range of\ndaylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to\nstate-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography\nfor glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be Rhino\ncombined with our DIVA plug-in <http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/>  that\nexports Rhino scenes into Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare and - starting\nthis summer-  EnergyPlus. Simulation outputs include:\n\n-          Daylight factor and indoor illuminance distributions for LEED\nIEQ Credit 8.1 Compliance (Radiance)\n\n-          Annual radiation maps for urban studies\n\n-          Climate-based metrics including daylight autonomy and useful\ndaylight illuminance (Radiance/Daysim)\n\n-          Physically based scene visualizations (Radiance)\n\n-          Glare analysis under selected sky\nconditions(Radiance/Evalglare)\n\n-          Annual glare maps (Daysim/Evalglare)\n\n-          Thermal loads calculations (EnergyPlus and Radiance/Daysim)\n\n\n\nThe physical assumptions underlying these simulation programs and\nperformance metrics will be discussed in detail. The first two days will\nconsist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software\ntutorials, and exercises. Day two will start with a lecture on circadian\neffects of light by Professor Stephen Lockley form the Harvard Medical\nSchool. Participants will be given the opportunity to calibrate their\npersonal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways of\nhow to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day,\nparticipants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired\nanalysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own and to go over\nspecific problems or simulation challenges with the instructor.\n\n\n\nYou can sign up for the program at\nhttp://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10\n2042. Please direct any content-related questions to me.\nAdministrational/logistics questions can be answered by Ms. Margaret\nMoore De Chicojay (margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu).\n\n\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming some of you to Cambridge this July.\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing.\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\nGund Hall 331, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu>\n\nResearch <http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/>  | Executive\nEducation (July 6-8 2011\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n02042> ) | DIVA <http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/>  | Daysim\n<http://www.daysim.com/>  | Tutorials\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/tutorials.html>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110429/7aae83a0/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "datetime": "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 09:09:24 -0400"}
