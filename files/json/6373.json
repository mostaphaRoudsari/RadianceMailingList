{"body": "\nThe PDF does a good job of explaining how it works.\nI was looking for the equation relating angular position to distance from the center of the projection.\n\n-Chas\n\n=======\n\nHi Chas,\n\n\nHmm, I thought I'd done that in the PDF. Typically, all fisheye\nprojections are used with a -vh and -vv of 180. The difference is the\nprojection of the hemisphere onto a flat surface.
