{"body": "\nJack, Rob,\n\nI did a short talk about building the piece at SIG06, and again\n(with a little more detail, and more production images) to an art\ngroup here in Boston last year. Here are both PDFs:\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/sketches_0621_Mark_Stock.pdf\n(start at page 10)\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/talk_collusion/collision_talk_5.pdf\n(start at page 35)\n\nIn summary:\n\nMy fluid PhD code made the underlying mesh, a simple custom\nprogram created an open-topped box above every triangle.\n\nI wanted an alien sky, so I used my skycolor.cal file with a pink\nzenith and colder (bluish) horizon. Actually, there must have\nbeen an error in the .cal file, because the horizon is pretty\nnoisy. I didn't fix it because it added some nice, odd colors to\nthe polygons that were facing down.\n\n602 hours. I think I spread the job across two single-core\nmachines that I have here at home.\n\nMark\n\nOn Tue, 18 Mar 2008, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Big Radiance rendering on HiPerWall", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0803191016410.12756@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": ["<C039131C-7B97-49C8-8764-6BFB59AF3962@dmu.ac.uk>", "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0803182058460.21472@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "<47E06BD0.2050706@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Mar 19 07:31:21 2008", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Big Radiance rendering on HiPerWall"}
