But for gensky it seems the horizontal value is used for both diffuse and direct components, so take advantage of the additive nature of light.\n\n\nSent: Thursday, May 05, 2011 8:25 PM\n\n\nI was not sure if I can use -R option, because I have available only global horizontal irradiation and illuminance and it seems from gensky manual that I need to have direct irradiance measured horizontally without the diffuse contribution.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110506/d522e488/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] using turbidity in gensk", "tags": [], "sender": "d.appelfeld at gmail.com", "datetime": "Fri, 6 May 2011 09:24:32 -0400"}
