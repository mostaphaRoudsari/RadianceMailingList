You're right, the -I does not belong. Thanks for noticing the\nmistake and explain the reason why :-) :-). This is no excuse, but I did\nfind it myself when comparing rsensor 'cosine distribution' (from SPOT\ndistribution) to a simulation with a standard sensor point, and have been\nwondering why??\n\nAnd yep - Andy, I'll run it all again. Both three phase method and standard\nRadiance technique. I'll let you know how it works out.\n\nTHANKS :-)\nBest,\nAnne\n\nOn Mon, May 2, 2011 at 9:00 PM, <\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110507/dfedd98c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Anne Iversen", "datetime": "Sat, 7 May 2011 20:04:14 +0200"}
