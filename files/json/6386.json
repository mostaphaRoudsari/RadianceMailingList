That too was mentioned in the post I pointed you to.\n\nI have now download the source code from the site but when I copy the file\n\nCan you be more specific, please. I assume you are neither familiar with a\nUnix/Linux system nor the command line. I also assume that you have unpacked\nthe source package and copied the two files \"coeff_perez.dat\" and\n\"defangle.dat\" to /usr/share/radiance.\n\nNow, if you still get errors it might be related to the permissions of those\ntwo files (which might be indicated by the \"X\" you are referring to). Open a\nconsole window and type the commands\n\nsudo chmod 644 /usr/share/radiance/coeff_perez.dat\n/usr/share/radiance/defangle.dat\nsudo chown root:root /usr/share/radiance/coeff_perez.dat\n/usr/share/radiance/defangle.dat\n\nAfter the first command you will have to provide your password to get the\nrequired privileges.\n\nWith this your Radiance installation should be complete.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110511/ea5b31fe/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4dcacd1f.5003cc0a.34c8.1b7b@mx.google.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed, 11 May 2011 13:21:33 -0500"}
