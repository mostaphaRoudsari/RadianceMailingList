{"body": "\nDear Radiance Community,\nfirst I want to thank Greg and Mark for their helpful hints concerning\nmy soft shadow problem. Both ways worked very well (using jitter = 0.7\nor sligthly disslocated suns).\nNow I'm facing a new problem. I want to simulatate a window with a\npattern for sun protection. In the archive I found something like the\nfollowing:\n\nvoid plastic-10 pattern_10\n0\n0\n5 .1 . 1 .1 .03 .02\n\nvoid mixfunc pattern_round\n4 pattern_10 void result r_hole.cal\n0\n2 .003 .002\n\n\nThis is the r_hole.cal file:\n\n{\nsquare holes\nA1 = length\nA2 = distance\n\n}\n\na=A1+A2;\nresult=if(zhole,0,1);\nnext_dotx= a /2-mod(U,a);\nnext_doty= a /2-mod(V,a);\nzhole=if(sq(arg(1)/2)-sq(next_dotx)-sq(next_doty),1,0);\n\n\npattern_round polygon window_with_pattern\n0\n0\n12\n......\n\n\nThis functions works properly for vertical and horizontal surfaces. For\ntilted surfaces the pattern is getting smaller all the more you tilt a\nvertical to a horizontal surface. I tried to play around the r_hole.cal\nfile but I was not  able to figure out, what screw I had to rotate.\nHopefully, there is someone out there who can give me a hand.\n\nThanks and best regards,\nKai\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080327/4e379309/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Kai Babetzki", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF029952D8@webmail.transsolar.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Mar 27 04:06:03 2008", "email": "babetzki at transsolar.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Pattern on tilted surfaces"}
