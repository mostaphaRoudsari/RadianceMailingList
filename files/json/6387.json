Currently, I'm testing a simple box (genbox wall room 10 10 10 -i) with south wall removed and the floor's material set to a \"mirror\" or variations of \"metal\". My gensky definition is: gensky 03 21 9 +s -a 39.7 -o 105.2 -m 105, which places direct sun on both the floor and west wall.\nWhen viewing the octree in rvu, there is no specular reflection from the floor with either mirror or metal (with 0 roughness). However, a metal with small roughness has some scattered reflection. I've tried changing parameters on many of the rpict options to try to solve the issue, but have had no luck.\nI'm currently running a HEAD distro from early January this year. About 15 months ago, I was able to get specular reflections from a mirror (similar study) from the 4R0.\n\nAny help/advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nChris M.
