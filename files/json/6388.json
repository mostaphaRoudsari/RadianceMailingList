{"body": "\nDear Radiance Users,\n\nIn order to double check the DF which I calculated in Radiance I also calculated these for the exact same room with all the same settings (reflectance, transmittance, dimensions, areas of the pane, reference plance, reductions factor = 1 in Relux and city (Oslo)) in Relux .\n\nSurprisingly since Relux is based on Radiance the DF which I calculated in Radiance are about 1.7 higher than the ones calculated in Relux (DF calculated in Radiance = 17 and the ones calculated in Relux = 15,3 0.6m from the facade).\n\nI have used the folowing gensky and rtrace command in Radiance:\n\ngensky\n6 21 12 -c -a 59.9 -o -10.8 -m -15.00 -B 55.866\n\nrtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 20 -aa 0.1 -ad 512 -as 64 -ar 128 DF_OfficeLL.oct\n< DFcoordinates.inp | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179/10000*100' > OfficeLL.log\n\nThe same issue arrise when I include external shading (trans) to my model?\n\nDoes anybody has any insight of the calculation settings in Relux or have I made a beginners mistake of my input in Radiance?\n\nI appreciate any help and comments on this :)\n\n\nBest regards\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n______________________\n\nPer Haugaard,\nGriffenfeldsgade 33, 2.tv\n2200 K?benhavn N\nDenmark\n\n\nmobil:  +45 26 39 06 40\nE-mail: perhaugaard@yahoo.dk\n\n\n\n\n\nFind din nye laptop p? kelkoo.dk.
