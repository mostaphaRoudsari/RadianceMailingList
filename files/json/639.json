The coffering detail doesn't look complicated enough to have\nreally caused Radiance probs - and there are enough apertures in the space\nthat it seems like they should have been picked up by a reasonable setting\nfor -ad & -as and provide a well behaved indirect lighting distribution.\n\nUsually this is a bloody robust approach, if not working well then there\nis almost always a justified suspicion that something else going on - such\nas a piece of geometry stuck out in space and messing up -ar and -aa.\n\nAnd i'd agree with Martin again in that it's good to move away from\nrelying on RAD - far better to get to grips directly with specifying rpict\nparameters. I find that once settled on generally appropriate params for\nbuildings (accounting for model size in -ar and -aa) - usually switching\nbetween high/low quality, slow/fast rendering can be controlled enough\njust via -ab and image size and then -ad -as.\n\ncheers\nalex\n\n*******************************************************\nA.
