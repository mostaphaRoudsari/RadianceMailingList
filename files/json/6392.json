If your windows are\nthe only openings\nyou should see a reduction in the DF. It's also possible that your\nwindow polygons are\nnot where you expect them to be. If you're on a Unix system you can\nuse rvu to get\na visual impression of the room and with the 't' keystroke you can\ntrace a ray to it's\nintersection with the geometry. It tells you which polygon and\nmaterial you've hit.\nYou can use it to verify your material changes are now part of the\nnew octree.\n\nUnder Windows you can render a picture to control that the windows\nare in place.\nTo get an equivalent of the 't' you could use rtrace with a carefully\nselected origin and\ndirection and a modified output option.\nThese options will only have an effect if your geometry is very\ndetailed and you\nmight miss a window with the initial '-ad' setting. Given the window\npolygons\nbelow I'd say you have a few very large windows, so you don't have to\nchange\nthese values.\n\n\nHth,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080331/559c96b3/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: DF calculated in Radiance and Relux", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E14F589B-200B-4AF4-B6B6-5055C569ECA9@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<84792.63408.qm@web26614.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 31 12:36:35 2008", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: DF calculated in Radiance and Relux"}
