When I export, it\ncreates a bunch of materials but names them all \"default_material\".\nPerhaps the new material library function is causing this?  Is there a\nway to get the previous version back?  On the google site, you have a\nver_c but you also made a ver_d prior to the current one, which worked\ngreat for me.  I hope you still have that earlier ver_d, because I\noverwrote mine and this one doesn't work for me yet and I was hoping to\nuse your script this week!\n\nLet me know, and thanks for updating it.  Maybe I'm just not using the\nmaterial library function properly?\n\n- Rob\n\n", "replyTo": "<15AEE4FA-1FAC-4B15-8F7A-CF28AB013F73@arcor.de>", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<47E2D28C.7080908@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<15AEE4FA-1FAC-4B15-8F7A-CF28AB013F73@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Thu Mar 20 14:09:40 2008", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad.rb - update of the Sketchup to Radianceconverter"}
