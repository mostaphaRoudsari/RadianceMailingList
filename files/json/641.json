However, the idea is to reuse geometry\nwhen possible (and I have hundreds of objects which are placed by\nreplmarks) and stay as close as possible to the cad packages. I wanted\nto ask as replmarks seams to be just for that goal ;). The integration\nof CAD and radiance without the need of writing radiance scene files\nmanually is sometimes important... That's why I wonder if it would make\nsense to use surface normals of the triangles in replmarks - and add\nmirroring functionality that way.\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
