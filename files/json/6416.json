{"body": "\nYes!! Really thank you Greg and Axel !!!\n\nThen, I would like to ask a question.\n\nI'm in need of representing in Radiance a shiny peinture. And I've no idea on how to measure or where to collect appropriate values for specularity and roughness.\n\nDoes exist any library? The libraries I know have only lambertian peintures.\n\nHow could those values be calculated? Or, better: how could them be estimated? What I need to do is to choose reasonable values and justify them in my thesis.. Any suggestion?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n.. Caminante no hay\ncamino, solo se hace\ncamino al andar ..\n\n\n---   o\nmeglio   ---\n\n.. Caminante el\ndestino no es al\nfinal de el viaje,\npero en todo el\nandar ..\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "loscotec@libero.it", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<JXY3ZV$D0056D040BA856285DC1024B81DD52AA@libero.it>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Mar 18 14:36:00 2008", "email": "loscotec at libero.it", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Thanks and materials.."}
