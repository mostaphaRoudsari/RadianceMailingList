In Ecotect, I placed camera to get\nilluminance image, but it seems that the output image shows lux levels on\nground level. It doesn't give lux contours on a task plane (at any level).\nCan anyone help me out in getting lux levels on a certain height.\n\nThanks!\nDharam\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/26bd2a26/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "dharam", "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 00:17:10 +0530"}
