{"body": "\nHi Valeria,\n\nThis is probably one for the FAQ (if only there was a FAQ)...\nRadiance has a preferred color space, but it does not require that\nyou use it.  You can assign the three (RGB) channels to be anything\nyou like, including total solar transmission/reflectance/whatever.\nBear in mind that solar heat gain is also affected by thermal\nconductance and convection, which are not considered in an optical\nray-tracing calculation such as Radiance.  To the extent that IR\nbehaves as visible light, however, Radiance may be trusted.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<527f2f7a0803170757r374473efud3aa26cfefaa5c9b@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A40F5D61-6AB7-4C14-84EA-9CDB5A6C7AC8@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<527f2f7a0803170757r374473efud3aa26cfefaa5c9b@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 17 22:36:30 2008", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] calculation of shading coefficient withRadiance?"}
