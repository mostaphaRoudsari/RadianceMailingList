The rtcontrib command is as\nfollowing. I have run this several times because I split the grid and run\nmore simulations, and it was without problems even running several parallel\nsimulations in same time using same octree. I am submitting calculations on\nour cluster which operating on Sun machines and using GridEngine.\n\nrtcontrib @parameters/vmx_illum.opt -f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -fo -o\nresults/vmx_test_grid_illum/%s.vmx \\\n-b kbinW @parameters/west.modifier -b kbinS @parameters/south.modifier -I+\noct/model_vmx.oct < sensors/grid/vmx_grid_test_illum.pts\n\nThank you for any suggestions\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/98fe1cbc/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Appelfeld", "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 15:27:04 -0700"}
