It sounds like your rtrace process might be dying, but it would normally report an error message if that were the case.  The only case when rtrace doesn't report an error is when the system kills it with signal 9.  Does the calculation proceed for some time before the error occurs, or does it bail right away?\n\nYou say you ran the command successfully before.  What, exactly, did you do differently when you got this error?  Are you running it on a different machine, which might have data or file size limits in place?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<BANLkTinV=7tVgV061N_9WPdNNNOqWxM+Ew@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 16:17:49 -0700"}
