Because I have exceeded\nnumber of opened files before and there could be maybe some other limit\nwhich I am exceeding. Unfortunately I can not change the limits, I have\ncontacted the servers support but they cannot change it.\n\nThe parameters are quite high. I may reduce some but then I have to run\nwhole simulation again, also for the sensors which I have got results for.\n\n\n-ab 5\n-ad 2048\n-as 0\n-aa 0\n-lw 1.00E-12\n-ds 0.1\n-dj 0.9\n-dt 0\n-dc 0.75\n-n 4\n\nI have started to run the simulation again and I will see how it goes. My\nfurther step will be probably reduce the parameters.\n\nThank you for your advices.\nDavid\n\nOn 19 May 2011 17:15, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110519/1f04e302/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<7B80B5E8-C780-4A48-8894-7F9455CC705C@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "David Appelfeld", "datetime": "Thu, 19 May 2011 17:44:25 -0700"}
