As Guigi says, obj2rad is your friend.  If you are\nprimarily an architectural designer and already have a preferred\nmodeling tool, I would say stick with it if at all possible.  If your\ninterest is simulation design and you have a budget I'd pick up\nAutodesk Ecotect, which has some nice tools for setting up simulations\nand processing the results, but is a rather difficult modeling tool.\n\nIf you're starting out and have a modest budget, try Rhino.  If you're\nstarting out and have no budget, try SketchUp.\n\nOther tools: Free - Blender, but the UI is 20 years old and it takes a\nlong time to learn.  AutoCAD is widely used in architectural practice,\nbut the full version is expensive, the 3D modeling capabilities are\ncranky, and the student versions are limited in ways that may interfere\nwith simulation work.  Still, if you have it, you might give it a try.\n\nAnyone used Revit, Microstation, or Bentley with Radiance?\n\n--\nRandolph M. Fritz ?
