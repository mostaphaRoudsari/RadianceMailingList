I recall having this issue as well on a windows\nmachine. Some distributions seem to miss this specific file.\nregards, Casper\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\n\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\n\n\nHello,\nI have been reading all the posts concerning problems with the function file\n\"rayinit.cal\"\nSo Accordingly to that I did some of the stuff i read. I went to the control\npanel/advance/ environmental settings, and in the path and raypath i did the\nchanges needed in order for the system to find the rayinit file. Even though\ni did all this when i run radiance from ecotect the same fatal error is\nappearing: cannot find function file \"rayinit.cal\".\n\n\nthis is how i have it\npath:\n%SystemRoot%\\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem;C:\\hp\\bin\\Python;C:\\Program\nFiles (x86)\\Autodesk\\Backburner\\;C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Autodesk\nShared\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Autodesk\nShared\\;%SYSTEMROOT%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\;C:\\Radiance\\lib\n\nraypath:    .;C:\\Radiance\\lib\n\nI cannot see which is the problem since I think the right direction is shown\nin both path and raypath, what should I do? I have windows vista.\n\n\nI apreciate any help I can have since I am doing my thesis and i want to set\nilluminance values for several spaces in a project.
