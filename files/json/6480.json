{"body": "\nHi Chris,\n\nI'll respond inline, below...\n\n\nYour current value is best, as it corresponds to the amount of\nspecular reflection from the alternate material, and the mirror type\ndoes not scatter light at all.\n\n\nYes, the alternate material will be used during the diffuse\ninterreflection calculation, with care not to over-count light source\ncontributions.\n\n\nRoughness affects the scattering of light (and therefore the\nsharpness of shadow boundaries) but not the total amount of light\ntransferred.  Therefore, it's not a good idea to adjust the mirror\nvalue in an attempt to consider roughness.\n\n\nBest of luck,\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mirror and virtual sources", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1FED12A5-7F39-4DD9-95E2-A1DA91834F38@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7025DCDF1@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Apr  8 17:51:43 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mirror and virtual sources"}
