(So rpiece will NOT work).*\n*Maybe one has been written for Cygwin, but I doubt it.\n\nIf you want to use Radiance on multiple core's your best option is MAC OS or\nUnix/Linux (Ubuntu seems to be user friendly).\n\nAnother option would be to install Interix/SUA/SFU (Windows services for\nUnix) on Windows 7 (or Vista or XP). And compile Radiance from source.\nI don't think anyone has tried to compile Radiance using SFU, so no\nguarantees here.*\n*\nI hope this helps,\n\nGuy*\n*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110616/65f03268/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Guy Vaessen", "datetime": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 15:42:09 +0200"}
