The only advantage I see to OSX over linux is that it's more popular, so you'll see more frequent pre-compiled binaries floating around - for Radiance itself and any tools that users develop. On the other hand, linux has a strong advantage in terms of lower barrier to entry - it is cheaper to buy/inherit any old desktop box and install Ubuntu on it than to get a hold of a top notch Mac machine. It is even quite possible to set up an existing Windows machine to dual-boot into Ubuntu as necessary. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\nWindows implementation has the lowest barrier to entry in most cases, but shortfalls such as no file locking, X11 support, friendliness for programming/scripting, etc. On the other hand some common modeling tools such as Autodesk products are Windows native - so could avoid additional machines.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rad -n and -N parameters / switches", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 15:07:33 -0400"}
