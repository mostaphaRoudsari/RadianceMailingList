I mean, really. No comparison, if we're talking barriers to\nentry for Radiance. Today, I would say Ubuntu is pretty close to MacOS,\nbut still not quite as polished as MacOS. I use Snow Leopard, and then I\nhave WinXP, Win7, Ubuntu 11.04 VMs available on VMWare Fusion. So far I'm\nstill willing to pay the Apple tax on my hardware every few years or so.\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 6/16/11 1:07 PM, \"Christopher Rush\" <Christopher.Rush at arup.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B04A7A49B126@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 13:21:06 -0600"}
