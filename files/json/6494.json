I would like to crop the .pic file so that it corresponds to\nimages with a 60 and 120 degree cone of vision to in order to\ncalculate luminance ratios for the task and surround area,\nrespectively. In other words, I was just thinking of cropping the 180\ndegree fisheye view to two smaller circles.\n\nThanks,\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Krystyna Zelenay", "datetime": "Fri, 17 Jun 2011 15:02:45 -0700"}
