Seems I need to bear in mind\nthat Radiance is developed in UNIX environment initially and a lot of UNIX\nconventions can be utilized.\n\nAs to Thomas comments on Python wrapper library for Radiance, I think my\ncolleague Dr Patrick Janssen is exploring on that direction by testing it on\na procedure modeling software platform called Houdini (www.sidefx.com).\n\nActually, most of the questions I post here were derived in the learning\nprocess of connecting Houdini and Radiance (as well as other building\nperformance simulation software) via the Python interface built into\nHoudini.\n\nSome of the work-in-progress can be found in Dr Janssen's teaching website:\nhttp://patrickjanssenstudio.blogspot.com/\n\n- Cheers, Ji\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 21, 2011 at 1:14 AM, Thomas Bleicher\n<tbleicher at googlemail.com>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110621/577a611f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Use Python to execute Radiance command", "tags": [], "sender": "Ji Zhang", "datetime": "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 01:47:01 +0800"}
