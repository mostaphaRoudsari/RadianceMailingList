It is the base of\nwhat can be done on any Linux/BSD/Solaris/Mac OS system these days, and\nhas been for the last 30 years, which is due to its rather generic\nconceptual nature. Working with processes, inputs and outputs,\nredirection, filters, is all very useful here and works on all\nunix-based platforms.\n\n\nCool, thank you for sharing the link. Are you also going to use\nsimulation results as input for modeling, such as design optimization?\nMaybe there will be some work shared on a coming Radiance workshop? Say\nhello to SDE folks, Shinya is references on the blog, too :-)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Use Python to execute Radiance command", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
