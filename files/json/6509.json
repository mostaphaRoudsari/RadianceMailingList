{"body": "\nHi list,\n\nthis is the first time I am using colored light sources, and I am sure\nthat I make some mistakes. So for your amusement and in the hope someone\nenjoys to show me the worst of my misunderstandings, I post how I try to\nmodel a light source, which is to represent an oil lamp.\n\nI estimate a flame with 2cm diameter, 10 lumen,1900 K black body\ntemperature.\n\nI derive rgb 1.00 0.23 0.00 from the color temperature. This is only for\nthe chromacity, and to be honest I did not do the CIE transformations\nbut looked up in a table for 1900K.\n\nI add a line to lamp.tab reading\n\n/oil lamp/\t.54 .41 .95\n\nso that I can use lampcolor and reuse my guesses later.\n\nNo I run lampcolor, for the lamp type I enter my freshly defined oild\nlamp, I use meters as length unit, to model the flame I use a sphere\ngeometry, and I give my estimated 0.01m radius for the flame (resulting\nin a luminaire sphere of 2cm diameter). My guessed total luminous flux\nis 10 lumens, leading to:\n\nLamp color (RGB) 28.93 8.62 0.0\n\nDoes this make sense? Am I totally wrong? I would apply a light modifier\ncreated with these values to a 1cm radius sphere now.\n\nThanks, CU, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080423/cad5c741/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
