Would love to see the Houdini2Radiance\npipeline in the workshop, but i don't think i'll be in Liege.\nSome time ago i had a strong wish of having a Python wrapper for\nRadiance, but i could not find any, and i found the project to\noverwhelming to just start myself. Besides that i use Python\nmerely for everyday scripting with 3d, so skillfully designing\nmodules is a different cup of tea. Is there any fragment of a\nproject like that around that i might have missed?\n\nAksel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Aksel Gross", "datetime": "Thu, 23 Jun 2011 18:37:36 +0000 (UTC)"}
