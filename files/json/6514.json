We are building up an initial unit test suite for the core applications and hope to have something to show Greg soon. Ideally it would be integrated with the Radiance source tree, but it can stand alone as well, doing nightly HEAD pulls from the Radiance CVS server.\n\nThis is coming RSN (real soon now), I hope.\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn Jun 23, 2011, at 5:05 PM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110623/8fd8b806/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<BANLkTime6gwW4aEbmuFbXyETbCbisWzXow@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu, 23 Jun 2011 18:46:57 -0600"}
