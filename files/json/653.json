{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nIllum's, like all light sources in Radiance, are preferred as\nrectangles or (at least) 4 or more sided convex shapes.  Since Radiance\nsamples a rectangle with equivalent area to the source shape, triangles\nare a particularly poor choice.  I recommend replacing any windows you\nplan to use as illum's with rectangles for that reason.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Aiming Failures and Geometry", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E1722BBE-F35F-11D7-820F-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 30 Sep 2003 09:05:16 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Aiming Failures and Geometry"}
