Color Checker and Digital Camera - using the techniques that are\noutlined in Rendering with Radiance, you can use the Color Checker\nChart from Gretag Macbeth and a digital camera to sample color and\nreflectance. The color checker is an accurate set of color samples\nwith known measured reflectances and chromaticity coordinates. It\ncan be used to calibrate color/reflectance information that is\nacquired through a device such as a scanner, digital camera, or\neven a regular old film camera. I think used correctly the results\ncan be within +or- 10%. We have used this method with reasonable\nsuccess on a variety of materials. This is a very economically\nmethod (~$100 for color checker plus cost of sampling device)\n2. Handheld Spectrophotometer - there are a variety of options out\nthere for hand held spectrophotometers. I believe that Gretag\nMacbeth has several. These will likely be more accurate than the\nabove and cost a lot more. I think when I last looked into this (5\nor more years ago) such a device cost ~$5,000 and did not include\nthe software necessary for operation. I have not had the\nopportunity to use one yet.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\ngenevieve lucet wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040512/3af7e98f/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] measuring color", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed May 12 07:24:08 2004"}
