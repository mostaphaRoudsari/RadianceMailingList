Luminance is not a\n\"material property\" (except for light sources), but the result of a\ncertrain amount of light leaving a surface of given\nreflectance/transmittance at a certain direction. The approach with grey\ncharts relies on the assumption that both the patch of known reflectance\nand the sample are lid by the same source under very similar directions,\nand that both samples are also seen under almost identical directions.\nSo if you know luminance for a patch of 0.4 reflectance and luminance\nfor a patch of 0.2 reflectance, you can make an estimate on the\nreflectance of a patch that appears with a luminance between the two.\nBoth the camera and your eye just record that luminance, so you must\n\"see\" a known reference at the same time to make guesses on the reflectance.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminance to RGB", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
