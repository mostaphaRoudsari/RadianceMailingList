The \"Three-Phase Daylight\nCoefficient\" method works. But for simple windows, can I directly calculate\nthe contribution using rtcontrib or others?   Any suggestion is greatly\nappreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110713/5528903a/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Wed, 13 Jul 2011 17:22:41 -0400"}
