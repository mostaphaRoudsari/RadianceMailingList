I have other questions related to this program.\n\n(1) Question 1:\n\nIn the case that both of \"-f\", \"-b\" and \"-m\" are used, the .cal algorithm\nand \"-b\" option are applied to objects with \"-m\" materials, for example,\n\nvwrays -ff $vw |rtcontrib @image.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d $vw) -f tregenza.cal\n-b tbin -o images/patches/p%03d%s.hdr \\\n-m sky_glow -m ground_glow -w testroom_whitesky.oct\n\nIf I replace \"ground_glow\" with \"ceiling_mat\", the .cal will applied to\n\"ceiling\" geometry and divide ceiling into many patches according to the ray\ndirection and intersection with ceiling?\n\n(2) Question 2:\n\nAssume my model has two windows in the south wall and one sensor in the\ninterior building, and I wish to calculate the daylighting coefficient of\neach patch of sky and each window to the illuminance at the sensor point.\nThe result is like a matrix as follows:\n\nSkyPatch001,       SkyPatch001,\nWindow01     coefficient (RGB)   coefficient (RGB)\nWindow02     coefficient (RGB)   coefficient (RGB)\n\nEach coefficient shows the contribution of each sky patch and each window to\nthe sensor illuminance. Can I achieve this in one rtcontrib command?\nIs the following expression right?\n\n[input ray] | rtcontrib -f tregenza.cal -o window_%s.data -b tbin -m\nwindow01_mat -b -b tbin -m window02_mat  [other necessary options]\n\nThank you,\n\nJia\n\nOn Wed, Jul 13, 2011 at 7:05 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110714/a72d6c3b/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Thu, 14 Jul 2011 12:12:12 -0400"}
