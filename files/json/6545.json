The intersection position on the ceiling will not affect \"tbin\" since it doesn't use this information, so the same direction at one corner of the ceiling will go to the same bin as a ray hitting the opposite corner in that direction.\n\n\nYou don't need to give the \"-b tbin\" option twice, and the \"-b\" option by itself will generate an error, but otherwise it is OK.  Note that this command neglects any exterior obstructions that might interfere with the travel of a sample ray from the exterior of the window to the sky.  If your building has external shades or obstructions outside, the above technique will not produce accurate results.\n\nThe general ability to choose combined interactions in rtcontrib is lacking.  E.g., you can't ask for all rays that pass through \"window1\" then go on to intersect \"building2\" and reflect to \"skypatch17\".  It would be a useful feature to add, but such accounting is problematic.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 14 Jul 2011 09:52:31 -0700"}
