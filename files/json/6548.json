But the illuminance /\nluminance values calculated by Radiance should be accurate in theory (also\nassuming Perez's model is accurate).\n\nPS, my school library does not have permission to access the full text of\nthe Perez's paper (1993) referred to by Gendaylit program (url:\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038092X9390017I).  If\nallowable, could someone send me this paper?\n\nThank you,\n\nJia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110716/585fe889/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Sat, 16 Jul 2011 00:16:17 -0400"}
