{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nAs it turns out, the bug you discovered is related to the number of\nmodifiers in your files rather than the number of polygons.  You have\nover 114,000 uniquely named colorpict primitives in your input files.\nIf you had named them all the same, this error would not have occured.\nThere was a place in my hash table function where I was overflowing a\nsigned integer on the secondary hashing scheme.  This was quite easy to\nfix, and now oconv runs and produces a 63 Mbyte octree on your files\nwith no trouble.  I have included the fix on the HEAD distribution if\nyou wish to download it (src/common/modobject.c).\n\nThanks for discovering this bug!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: OCONV Error", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F8B502C2-F2DB-11D7-827A-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon, 29 Sep 2003 17:21:01 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: OCONV Error"}
