IR needs to be calculated separately.\n\n(2) Radiance calculates radiance within visible range, not full spectrum.\nBut Gendaylit could output full range spectrum (more precisely, UV, visible,\nand near-IR) and then you can convert the radiance back to total\nirradiance.\n\nBut some issues exist and should be considered if accurate results are\nrequired: (a) calculation of energy needs considering absorbed gain,\ncurrently, as far as I know it is difficult to calculate absorbed energy in\nRadiance. (b) visible transmittance and solar transmittance is generally\ndifferent.  Some glazing, for example, may be spectrally selective. (c)\nSunlight entering into the building may be reflected back. (d) For window,\ndivider, frame and reveal needs to be considered in energy calculation (e)\nCenter-of-glazing and edge glazing have different energy performance, This\nshould also be considered.\n\n(3) For calculation of solar gain, sky needs to be simulated, building\nsimulation software such as E+ and Radiance uses different algorithms. (a)\ngendaylit uses Sky Luminous Model which is developed by Perez (1990); (b) E+\nalso uses Perez's model in the same paper, but this model is specifically\nfor calculating irradiance on tilted surface. Since the original purpose of\ndeveloping sky luminous model by Perez is to calculate luminance/illuminance\nto deal with the daylighting (visible) issue, so it may be better to\nconsider using Perez's another model to calculate irradiance.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nJia\n\n\nOn Sun, Jul 17, 2011 at 11:41 PM, Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110718/f4eef600/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD83LVKsL0OQfBDdkpifgm2y=cjcamZQurtBDskY1aNf0wdrJQ@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 00:17:39 -0400"}
