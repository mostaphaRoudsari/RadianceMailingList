As long as you use the three channels for the same\nwavelength ranges when defining materials, sources, and interpreting\nresults, that is fine for radiative transfer of energy.\n\nHowever I would advice not to make use of the possibility of rendering\nall these wavelength ranges at once by making use of the three channels.\nIt would be better to set all three channels to the same wavelength\nrange, so work with \"neutral grey\" lights and surfaces. The reason is\nthat there are some (few) parts of Radiance's code where the channels\nare weighted according to human perceiption assuming RGB-like wavelengths.\n\nAnother question is how to find how much of the absorped short-wave\nsolar irradiation may get emitted as long-wave radiation by a surface.\nRadiance does not consider such \"shift\" effects. So IR radiation by\nsurfaces heating up in the sun would not be reflected.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD83LVKsL0OQfBDdkpifgm2y=cjcamZQurtBDskY1aNf0wdrJQ@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
