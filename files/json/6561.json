{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nI also have quite a few instances in my scene, so I don't think\nthat's it.  I don't know why meshes would be any different, unless\nloading all the meshes and colorpicts takes a long time by itself.\nI'm not sure what you mean when you say the light sources are grouped\ninto spheres.  Do you have many light sources per each of your 1850\nillum's?  If so, these should be defined with a glow material with a\nrestricted radius.  Otherwise, there is no point to using mkillum.\nCan you send me the description of one of your light sources in a\nseparate e-mail (off-list)?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<4807C69F.5030308@gmx.net>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<30B4FB4C-E11D-4CBF-8BD5-7A8432933770@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<48064373.2010508@gmx.net>\t<07D95AE8-8FEA-4A9E-8FE6-10BD6ABF628B@lmi.net>\t<4807B3DD.1010502@gmx.net>", "<0CE11AA1-0AA0-4261-B6C2-0EC02E4D8C7B@lmi.net>", "<4807C69F.5030308@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr 17 15:19:59 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general]  rpict,rtrace start up time and number of sources"}
