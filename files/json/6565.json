{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nLooking at this problem some more, I tried my own scene with 1800\nsources, and the start-up time with the default compile option for\nSHADCACHE (20) took about 11 seconds additional time to get going on\na 1.5 GHz G4 processor (i.e., not that swift by today's standards).\nIf your start-up time is three hours, I would have to have close to 2\nmillion sources to get into that kind of range, unless your scene is\nsomehow strangely different.  Is there anything else special about it?\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "<480669F3.9080509@gmx.net>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DE3A4190-5F22-4FCC-92E7-4BBFA48BBE11@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<48064373.2010508@gmx.net>", "<07D95AE8-8FEA-4A9E-8FE6-10BD6ABF628B@lmi.net>", "<480669F3.9080509@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 16 19:58:48 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: rpict,rtrace start up time and number of sources"}
