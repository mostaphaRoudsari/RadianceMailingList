That\nassumes that it is actually in one of the directories in your path\nvariable. In your case, that seams not to be the case, as the\nwhich-command did not give any output.\n\nCan you verify that your Radiance-binaries (the bin-subdirectory of the\nRadiance installation) is included in your Path variable?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] First Timer: HELP ON RADIANCE INSTALLATION", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
