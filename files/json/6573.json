{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nDo you have any redirecting surfaces (mirror or prism materials) in\nyour scene?  This could be the expense of precalculating the direct\nreflections.  In this case, setting -dr 0 will eliminate the problem,\nbut at the expense of reflected sources.  The alternate is to reduce\nthe setting of -dp, though reducing it to 0 will make the overall\ncalculation take considerably longer.\n\nIf you don't have any mirrors or prisms in your scene, then the most\nlikely culprit is the source obstruction routine.  Since there are no\noptions controlling this calculation, the only option is to recompile\nthe rendering tools setting -DSHADCACHE=0 in your rmake script.\nAgain, the overall calculation might end up taking longer, but you\nwill avoid the start-up time.\n\nIf your scene is not changing from one rendering to the next, I\nrecommend using either the -P or -PP option, which will avoid all\nstart-up costs from one rendering to the next, regardless of the\nabove settings.\n\nDoes this help?\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<48064373.2010508@gmx.net>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<07D95AE8-8FEA-4A9E-8FE6-10BD6ABF628B@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<48064373.2010508@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 16 12:45:02 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general]  rpict,rtrace start up time and number of sources"}
