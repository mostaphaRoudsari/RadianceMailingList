{"body": "\nDear radiance community,\n\nI have been trying to get the su2rad plugin from Thomas Bleicher working on OS X. However, at\nstartup it displays these error messages in a UI.messagebox in sketchup 6:\nundefined method `file_loaded?' for main:Object\n/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp\n6/SketchUp/Plugins/location.rb:163\n\nAfter I hit the 'ok' button the next messagebox appears:\nundefined method `file_loaded?' for main:Object\n/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp\n6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2rad.rb:167\n\nAfter that I get a load errors overview from sketchup displaying that it won't load these two files\ndue to the file_loaded error.\n\nA little disappointed I try to load su2rad through the ruby console (load 'su2rad.rb') and to my\nsurprise it returns:\n++ found preferences file '/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp\n6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2radlib/config.rb'\n++ applied preferences from '/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp\n6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2radlib/config.rb'\ntrue\n\nSo I try my luck and enter load 'location.rb' and this one also returns \"true\". In the \"plugins\"\nmenu a Radiance item is added as well as a location-item.\n\nEven though it is working after all (my compliments to Thomas Bleicher), I wonder why I get\nthese error messages in the first place. Someone out there who knows?\n\nRegards,\nCasper Esmeijer\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Casper Esmeijer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<WorldClient-F200804152228.AA28060027@mook.peutz.nl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr 15 13:28:15 2008", "email": "C.Esmeijer at mook.peutz.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad.rb - update of the Sketchup to Radianceconverter"}
