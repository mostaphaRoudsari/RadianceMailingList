Since we know that \"/usr/local/bin\" is in already in your $PATH\n(previous post) let's just move all the binaries there to give you a quick\nsolution. I downloaded the same file and checked the folder names. According\nto this you should have a folder called \"rad4R0_macosx\" in your\n\"Applications\" folder. With this setup use the following command in\nTerminal:\n\nopen /usr/local\n\nA Finder window should pop up. Make sure that there is a \"bin\" folder. If\nthere isn't create one. Then move or copy all the files\nfrom /Applications/rad4R0_macosx/  to this /usr/local/bin folder. Don't copy\nthe \"rad4R0_macosx\" itself. Now if you use the command\n\nwhich rtrace\n\nit should print out the path. Now download the \"rad3R9supp.tar.gz\" and\nextract it. It creates a \"ray\" directory and within it a \"lib\" directory\n(and some others). Create the folder \"/usr/local/lib/ray\" - yes, this is the\nother way around than in the archive. The files in the archive's \"ray/lib\"\ndirectory need to be moved to \"/usr/local/lib/ray\". With this setup you\nshould not need to fiddle with the RAYPATH environment variable because this\nis the built-in default.\n\nFor now this should get you going.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110719/923cde2b/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 89, Issue 14", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue, 19 Jul 2011 21:35:52 -0500"}
