I have no doubt that the using a more\nsophisticated measuring device will yield more accurate results.\nHowever, I believe the method of using the machbethcolor checker card as\ndescribed in Rendering with Radiance is designed to calibrate to the\ncurrent lighting conditions, that is, assuming the use of a digital\ncamera, if we want to sample a particular material in a give lighting\ncondition, then we also sample the color checker chart under the same\nconditions with the same sampling device (digital camera) and then\nperform the calibration with macbethcal and pcomb. I do not know the\nunderlying method that Greg put together to do the calibration, so I am\nnot sure how he has accounted for varying light conditions vis a vis the\ninternal dataset that Radiance uses as part of the calibration mechanism.\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nAlexa I.
