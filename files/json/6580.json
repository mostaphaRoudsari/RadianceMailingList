I do not have\na Mac available right now.\n\nAlso, do you type commands into the window opening when you start the\nX11 application, or do you type in the Terminal application window? I\nthink Thomas posted a great Mac-specific tutorial, which may vary from\nmy more generic unix-like experiences. So these details may be of\nimportance here.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] First Timer: help on Radiance installati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
