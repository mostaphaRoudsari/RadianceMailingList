{"body": "\nHello to the list, I am a new user of Radiance, analyzing buildings made in\nEcotect. My problem has to do with the installation of fluoroscent lamps in\nEcotect. I know it is not a major concern of this list, but i would really\nappreciate any kind of help, because I must finish my diploma thesis soon.\nLet me analyze the problem:\n\nI have a building with many offices. Every office has 6 squares on the roof,\nwith 4 fluoroscent lamps in each square. Drawing in Ecotect I have to enter\na first point and a last point.\nThis points represents the last and the first of the lamp or something else?\n\n\nHow can a fluoroscent have a cut-off angle or a hot-spot since this lamp\nworks in 180 angles?\n\nLast but not least: The first and the last point should be on x,y axis\nrepresenting the length of the lamp, or on z axis representing the height of\nthe lamp.\n\nThank you in advance for you time.\n\nSotiris Papantoniou\nSenior Student\nEnvironmental Engineering Department\nTechnical University of Crete, Greece\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080411/fe5970c0/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?ISO-8859-7?B?0/n03vHn8iDQ4fDh7fT57d/v9Q==?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<92f99fb40804110353n4726215dkf3bdacb434f684f5@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Apr 11 03:53:24 2008", "email": "sotos.enveng at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modelling fluoroscent lamps in Ecotect"}
