When you use sudo you are essentially creating a shell with root permissions to execute the command.  When the command is finished the shell is terminated.  You are effectively changing the properties for a temporary shell, not the one you are trying to use.\n\nDoes your user account have admin priveliges?  You can give admin privileges in the system preferences.  If you have admin privileges than you should be able to use ulimit.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Jul 20, 2011, at 12:01 PM, Michael Martinez wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110720/c4d8d9c2/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<66BA0299-F9AE-45C0-8CF6-11C5429EC6D4@coolshadow.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 12:31:06 -0700"}
