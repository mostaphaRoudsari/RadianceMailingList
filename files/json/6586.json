I do have admin privileges, but for some reason I still can't get ulimit to change the limit over 1024.\n\nOddly enough, I can get ulimit to lower the maximum number of open files, something like ulimit -n 512 works fine and changes the setting. What I can't do is then increase back to 1024 - I get the 'operation not permitted' message. When I restart my machine, the limit returns to 1024. I can use ulimit and lower it to 1023, but even when I try ulimit -n 1025, I still get the message:\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jul 20, 2011, at 12:31 PM, Andy McNeil wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110720/8a2749dc/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<389033F8-52F4-416C-AF62-B57DB00E149C@lbl.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Michael Martinez", "datetime": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 13:14:56 -0700"}
