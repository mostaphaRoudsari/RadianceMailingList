If  the\nnumber of bins is known in advance, it should be specified with the -bn\noption, and this is critical for output files containing multiple  val-\nues  per  record.   A  variable  or constant name may be given for this\nparameter if it has been defined via a previous -f or -e option.  Since\nbin numbers start from 0, the bin count is always equal to the last bin\nplus 1.  Set the this value to 0 if  the  bin  count  is  unknown  (the\ndefault).\n\nNot having the -bn option causes trouble in a lot of cases where there isn't always a ray striking the last bin.\n\nHope this fixes it!\n\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib - funky error when using", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 14:41:44 -0700"}
