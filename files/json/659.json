Also, nobody could\nexplain to me what magic things 'pcond' does, so I rather do not use it\n(the word 'mimick' appears rather often in the man pages). Human visual\nperception cannot be accounted for by a magic RADIANCE function. If it\nwould, then why are several hundred scientists world-wide still studying\nit? I agree, that the results of RADIANCE are visually appealing and\nthat the physics are simulated quite well, but only if you input\naccurate data your results will be accurate.\n\nCheers,\nAlexa\n\n\nJack de Valpine wrote:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDr. Alexa I.
