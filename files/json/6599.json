{"body": "\n\nIf you have a file server in you environment, that should be no problem\nat all. On almost any Linux distribution (and I guess this is true for\nthe two mentioned) it is easily possible to mount (connect) volumes on\nnfs and cifs servers. That means 90% of what is used out there. It is\nalso possible to mount Appleshare, but I am not sure if this is\nsupported in the boot cd's.\n\nAnyway, if you are sure that you cygwin radiance does everything you\nwant, and that you won't need a tool not available under windows later,\nI think is it fine to go on. I am actually sitting on a windows pc at\nwork (I have no influence on that ;-), and still kept more or less my\nlinux environment with Openoffice, Scribus, Gimp, Inkscape, even\nBlender, ESP+ and Radiance more or less intact. So switching between OSs\nmay be more a question on very specialized tasks (I have no cluster on\nwindows and do not care about stability here so much) - I have the same\nenvironment on my OS X laptop and the ssh cli'able cluster running\nLinux. So I would not worry so much any more about these.\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Bash error message", "sender": "Lars O.
