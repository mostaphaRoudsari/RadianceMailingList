Somehow ther is a median range of view eyes see, but I can't model\n(my fault I suspect: I don't have the theoretical grounding or math)\n\n\nI'll play with that. Many thanks.\n\n\nThats confusing. face on, short distance you can see very high quality\nreflected images in tupak finished MDF for instance. Ok, 6 months later\nthe grease stains and dust make that more diffuse, but it 'seems' shiney\nto me. Again, does the eye do a better job of ignoring that?\n\nI suspect I just need a better mental table of recommended glossyness for stuff\n\n\nPerhaps I did something wrong in my design. I found setting a minor colour\nchange on the metal of fixtures had a huge effect on the tones of the\nsurfaces that I presumed were reflecting it.\n\n\noh my. radiance lens-grease?\n\n-George\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] increase resolution: BAM! fall off the end of the univers", "tags": [], "sender": "George Michaelson", "datetime": "Wed, 12 Dec 2001 03:28:18 +1000"}
