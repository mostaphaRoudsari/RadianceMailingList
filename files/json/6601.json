{"body": "\nHello Thomas\n\n\n\nThank you for your pointing me in the right direction...especially the\n/cydrive/ . The PATH  had to include  /cygdrive/c/cygwinX... I did not\nimagine that one could get so happy at seeing a red ball!\n\nSeriously though, I have followed tutorials/FAQs, including the one you\nlinked for me, which are great in showing one the basics. CygwinX is\nreally ok now; it just throws in the /cygdrive/ to add to the\nI'm-a-confused-Windows-person state of mind. Now, I need to work out all\nthe various locations of the command files as they are not all in\nrad/bin\n\n\n\nI did consider the LEARNiX CD, especially after reading Axel Jacobs'\ntutorials. The issue for me was how to save files on my PC and server.\nThis is from their site ...\n\nIf your Windows data partition (you do have a separate one, don't you?)\nis formatted as FAT or FAT32, you can mount it and save your files. The\nNTFS file system (Window 2000 and XP) is not supported yet.\n\nI suppose I could buy an external hard disk but then what about backup..\n\n\n\n\nThanks again and regards\n\n\n\nAngela\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080404/62105b81/attachment-0001.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Angela Giladi", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<94D15743AD28084CB9A3C763698895CB0177CC@server.Giladi.local>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Apr  3 23:08:07 2008", "email": "angela at giladi-associates.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Bash error message"}
