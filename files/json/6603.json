{"body": "\n\nThis is indeed a path error. Essentially the shell (bash) was unable to\nlocate the program (rvu) in any of the folders listed in the path.\n\nCheck that the path you believe does indeed point to the appropriate\ndirectories using\necho $PATH\n\nTips:\n1) Be aware of any additional 'spaces' in the folder names. They will\nneed to be escaped e.g. \"Program Folder\" is written as \"Program\\\nFolder\".\n2) Be aware that UNIX (in this case Cygwin and bash are case sensitive)\nwhile Microsoft windows is not.\n\nPersonally, I have found that Cygwin is not for the 'newbie' more those\nthat know UNIX and need to bring some of its power to the Microsoft\nwindows environment. 'Newbie's' to UNIX are more often better to jump\ndirectly into UNIX/Linux/OSX (command line).\n\nAn alternative to installing Linux on your PC/or buying a MAC, is to use\none of the live cd projects available, where everything is pre installed\nsuch as can be found at Axel Jacobs website -\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/ In particular Curtin Radiance images\nor Axels' Learnix image.\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845 Western Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Bash error message", "sender": "Terrance McMinn", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<092BF7A1BC389E489A69DC764F23CD870E8A4415@exmsp2.perth.ad.curtin.edu.au>", "refs": ["<EXFE2qR77bieLYCT4aJ0000054c@email.curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr  3 17:17:26 2008", "email": "T.McMinn at curtin.edu.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Bash error message"}
