There is only one or two errors per day\nso I assume the errors happen for early morning or late evening (altitude <\n6 degree). To solve this error properly we need a better gendaylit program.\n\n\n\n\nI would expect that these entries in your climate file are simply not\nrepresented in the the cumulative sky model. A way to work around this might\nbe to hack gencumulativesky to provide gendaylit with explicit sun positions\nand artificially increase the altitude to be above 6 degree.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110724/1f460525/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD83LVKUqk57dh97++=MkJkaHJ3Bcq4YHqoTYPd-04nekeEA2Q@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sun, 24 Jul 2011 14:42:14 -0500"}
