The celestial hemisphere's sky glow is indeed just that, it's\nmodeled as a \"glow\" source in Radiance. Glows are only picked up in the\nambient calculation, so you need to have -ab set to at least 1. You have\n-ab 5, so you should be good. As the message states, it's not an error,\nmerely a warning. You're good.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/27/11 6:32 AM, \"P George Lovell\" <p.g.lovell at st-andrews.ac.uk> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Can't get gensky to work without sun...", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 08:05:47 -0600"}
