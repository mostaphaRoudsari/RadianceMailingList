I think I would prefer to have the\nwarning removed, as it may be more irritating then helpful these days.\nIf there was a simple way to check whether a scene contains neither\nlight nor glow object, that would be useful - but probably not that easy\nto detect.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Can't get gensky to work without sun...", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
