{"body": "\nDear Radiance Users:\n\nI have just put together a long overdue release of Radiance, vers.\n3.9.  I only heard one \"nay\" vote about including the CSAIL library\nobjects, but all the same I made a smaller distribution available for\nlike-minded disk curmudgeons.  The download from the original LBNL site:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\n\nby default is missing the CSAIL objects.  These can easily be added\nvia the \"objects\" link lower on the same page.  On the other site,\nradiance-online includes the CSAIL objects in its distribution files:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/\n\nBoth sites link to compiled binaries for Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,\nand MINGW (thanks to Francesco Anselmo and James Lee).  I need to\nwork with Peter Apian-Bennewitz to update the scripts so the patches\nbeing provided are relative to the new release, since he's the\nmastermind for those.\n\nPlease inform me of any broken links, compile problems, or masspillings.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D9EDCE72-1A3B-41C1-A23A-279140BA2052@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May  1 11:41:50 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Official Radiance 3.9 Release"}
