{"body": "\nOn behalf of all friends of Radiance, I want to really thank you Greg, not only for shaping another robust and responsive release*, but particularly for your commitment to each one of us as we continue to engage, explore,  stumble(!), and possibly push this brilliant resource.\nI just realized that Radiance must be a  few decades old.. I am not sure of its first shared release date, but I recall exploring it's potential, with a gaping smile, in either 1989 0r 1990. Have we missed its 21st birthday?\n\n-Rob Shakespeare\n\n* assumed, based on past releases!\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Official Radiance 3.9 Release", "sender": "Shakespeare, Robert A.", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C43FC436.4290%shakespe@indiana.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May  1 16:02:27 2008", "email": "shakespe at indiana.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Official Radiance 3.9 Release"}
