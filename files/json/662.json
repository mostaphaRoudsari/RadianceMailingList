I want to display an image on a screen\n(eventually) and people should not be able to tell it apart from the\nreal world scene. Of course, I can only simulate colours and luminances\nthat my daft 8-bit monitor can actually render.\n\nTalking about the limitations of CRT's. Has somebody seen\nDLP-technology displays in action and maybe even made some colour\nmeasurements? Apparently, the colour resolution can be cranked up to 15\nbits per channel and the luminance range is also much bigger. I only\nwonder, if the 15-bit resolution per channel is actually really an\nimprovement in terms of colour resolution for a given luminance level\n(in comparison to a traditional 8 bit resolution)  or is basically\nnecessary to cover the increased luminance range?\n\nIs that the same technology used in last year's emerging technology\nSIGGRAPH session:\nSeetzen, H., Stuerzlinger, W., Vorozcovs, A., Wilson, H.R., Ashdown, I.,\nWard, W. and Whitehead, L., 2003, High Dynamic Range Display System.\nSIGGRAPH 2003, Emerging Technologies Program.\nhttp://www.siggraph.org/s2003/conference/etech/hdr.html\n\nCheers,\nAlexa\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: measuring color", "tags": [], "sender": "Alexa I.
