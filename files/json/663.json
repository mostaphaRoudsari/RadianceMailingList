{"body": "\nHello,\n\nfor speeding up different renderings of a sunshading device it's very easy to switch the material of the device and see what is the impact (like changing color, trancemittance and so on). but...\n\ni also want to make one rendering without this sunshading device and i don't want to make changes in the drawing. so i want to make it invisible!\n\ni've tried the following materialsettings:\n\n# invisible: invisible : test\n# 0\nvoid interface invisible\n0\n0\n8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nand\n\n# invisible2: invisible2: test2\n# 0\nvoid trans invisible2\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nbut if i'm comparing the results (with findglare and glarndx) after removing the sunshading device the results are all slightly different. what is a good way to simulate an invisible material, without interfering the sun and light?\n\nthanx in advance\nwith regards,\nWaldo Bont\n\nStudent at the University of Technology Delft, Civil Engineering, Building Physics.\nEmployee at engineeringcompany moBius consult\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "WA Bont", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1064579297.cb5ed860W.A.Bont@student.TUDelft.NL>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri, 26 Sep 2003 14:28:17 +0200", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Making a material invisible"}
