Pcond attempts to\nadapt the original scene levels to the current viewing environment --\nsomething not even an HDR display can do.  You need something like the\nwide-field HDR viewer I built to test out tone operators for that.\n\n\nIf the 15 bits is in a linear range, and a DLP is a linear device, then\nyou don't actually gain much in terms of dynamic range over an\n8-bit/primary encoding using a standard 2.2 gamma.  Beware of\nmanufacturer's claims regarding contrast ratios and bit depths.  There\nare no standards, and the marketing people have a field day with these\nspecs.  Bottom line:  don't trust it unless you've measured it\nyourself.\n\n\nWe actually have a full-blown paper in this year's Siggraph, which is\nnow online as well at Wolfgang Heidrich's website if you're interested:\n\nhttp://www.cs.ubc.ca/~heidrich/Papers/index.html#siggraph\n\nThis is a very cool device, but is only available in limited quantities\nas a prototype to select companies and individuals.  Sunnybrook\nTechnologies (http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/ Vancouver, BC) hopes to be\nmanufacturing the real deal by next year.  As I said, even an HDR\nmonitor doesn't deal with surround issues, so it's really quite\ndifficult to reproduce the visual appearance of the real world in all\nit's glory.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: measuring color", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed May 12 20:38:35 2004"}
