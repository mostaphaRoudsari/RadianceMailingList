You want\na refined ambient cache for areas which are actually of importance for\nyour final renderings, so it does not make sense to first create\ndetailes ambient data for the whole scene, if you want to render only\none image later. If you are targeting at creating an animation, just\nskip frames and render a low-res of every 10th or so.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Overture calculati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
