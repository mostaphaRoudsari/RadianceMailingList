Longitude east of Greenwich* is specified as *NEGATIVE *value: e.g\nSingapore's longtitude of 104E should be specified as -104.\n*2. A positive azimuth angle *denotes an angle starting from *due SOUTH *and\nrotating clockwise.\n*3. Standard meridian* of a city equals to the Greenwich Mean Time of the\ncity multiplied by 15, and a *NEGATIVE *value indicates a timezone *EAST *of\nGreenwich (e.g. Singapore belongs to the EAST8 timezone, so it's meridian is\n-120=(8*15)*(-1) )\n\nTake London as an example, to know the solar altitude and azimuth at 9:00am\n1st Jan at London (altitude 51.15N and longitude 0.18W), the gensky command\nis: \"gensky 1 1 9:00GMT -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m 0\" or \"gensky 1 1 9:00 -a 51.15\n-o 0.18 -m 0\"\n\nand you'll get:\n\n# gensky 1 1 9:00GMT -a 51.1500015259 -o 0.180000007153 -m 0\n# Local solar time: 8.93\n# Solar altitude and azimuth: 5.5 -41.8\n# Ground ambient level: 6.0\n......\n\nand in this case the solar azimuth thus obtained indicates an angle starting\nfrom *due South* and rotating *clockwise *for 41.8 degree.\n\nThanks!\n\nJi\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110812/77d3ea22/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ji Zhang", "datetime": "Fri, 12 Aug 2011 00:14:49 +0800"}
