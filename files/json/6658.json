In other words, the user or script must manually determine for the date in question, if the time should be given on the command line as 9:00GMT or 9:00 BST.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD83LV+N8GTmL1WMou111b7FYtZGYhS1kyV5QSdRjgKArWPL8A@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Thu, 11 Aug 2011 15:11:45 -0400"}
