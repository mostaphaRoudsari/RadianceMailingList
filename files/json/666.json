The photon map tool was part\nof Roland's PhD, and AFAIK it's sort-of \"stalled\" right now, he's doing\nsome validations and the like.  Also, I believe it *is* stable.  You\nmight also wanna check out Francesco Anselmo's compiled source\npackages; you have the option of downloading the Radiance release with\nthe photon map module, precompiled, in a variety of formats (.rpm,\netc...)  As far as future development, you'll have to talk to Roland...\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Photon Map?", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CC3DD34F-EF1B-11D7-8877-000393824274@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 24 Sep 2003 22:47:50 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Photon Map?"}
