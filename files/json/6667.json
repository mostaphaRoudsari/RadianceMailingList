That means it can be used\nto display GUI-windows, most probably also those by Radiance. However,\nyou still need to provide a rudimentary unix environment, unless you run\nthe Radiance binary on a remote system and use the Xserver only for the\nGui (e.g. by tunnelling the X-protocol through a X-session. That works\nfine with Radiance as any X-based program.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Unix emulator", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
