The method that is described in\nRendering with Radiance requires some installation (I think it was\ndeveloped to measure material values in some kind of \"studio\"). I did\nit a bit simpler: one person holds the chart next to the material, I\ntake a photo of the surface with the chart. As long as there is no\nvariation of lighting over the area (no highlights etc) this seams to\nbe a rather comfortable way, and I think for me it was accurate enough.\nOf course the chart should not cover the 5% of the area at the border -\nthe chances that it is in a different lighting situation is to high\nthan.\n\nHowever, any expensive hardware is fun - and maybe you can even compare\nthe results of the color chart way and the hardware way. I would be\ninterested in that ;-)\n\nCU Lars.\n--\nLars O. Grobe\ngrobe@gmx.net\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] measuring color", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
