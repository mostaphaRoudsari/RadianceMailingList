{"body": "\nHy everybody!\n\nI'm Lucio, finally graduated with a thesis about tunnel lighting.\n\nNow I'm keeping on it. And my present task is to try to obtain the best representation possible of asphalts.\n\nUntil now I used r-tables converted in Radiance's BRDF definitions the Antonutto's way (with a slightly modified calculation file), for direct contribution and using lambertian material (as requested by BRDF's definitions) for indirect light.\n\nNow I'm going to measure asphalt photometry, with the hope of being able to individuate a Radiance specular material very close to asphalt behaviour. If it will be possible, I would then like to combine BRDF from r-table with specular materials instead of lambertian ones.\n\nI know that I could run two simulations and then combine the results, but it would be much cleaner to be able to use a new kind of primitive able to use BRDF for direct light and a specular material for indirect light. Is it possible to develop such primitive? I'm not very skilled about programming , but I can always learn and help in developing such primitive, if you like. I guess that such kind of primitives could be handy even for other applications. What do you think about it?\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n..
