Yesterday there was a limit of listeners that\nblocked people trying to connect. Today, I get the stream, but there\nseams to be no audio signal on it... By the way, probably you should try\n\nhttp://131.243.160.26:3389/listen\n\n(no extension) which connects you directly to the audio stream, the m3u\nis a playlist pointing to the stream.\n\nFolks be aware that the ip address is not the same anymore as it was\nyesterday, so all those having added a book-mark - get rid of it.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110825/fd353d27/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Fitzsimmons, Rob", "datetime": "Thu, 25 Aug 2011 13:12:01 -0500"}
