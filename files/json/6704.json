So I can imagine for the '11 \"remote attendees\", having the webcast experience along with the slides is much closer to \"being there\". THanks to Andy and LBNL for hosting a great Workshop, and for all the tech support involved in getting the webcast going.\n\nI am so glad I was able to attend this year and I enjoyed seeing old and new faces; I always wish there was more time. Sorry I had to exit stage right before the whole show was over but I barely made my plane as it was!\n\nI hope Chris R. and Joe D. and anyone else trying to head toward that beast Irene makes out as well as they can.\n\nUntil next time, happy rendering!\n\n- Rob G.\n\nOn Aug 26, 2011, at 5:59 PM, Fitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110827/1ddc832f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Workshop Liv", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sat, 27 Aug 2011 10:23:21 -0600"}
