You could e.g.\nstart with vwrays -vta (...), which would give you for each pixel of your required -vta-projection the corresponding vectors. Using rcalc, you could calculate backwards at which pixel-coordinates in a vth-projected image of given dimensions the pixel-value for this direction is found. The problem is that there will be some interpolation needed in the process. I am not sure whether this will be faster then re-rendering the images. Did you keep all the files for the renderings, especially the ambient data? Depending on how you did the renderings, doing a second run with only changed view-parameters, but existing ambient cache data could be very quick.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare analysis", "tags": [], "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "datetime": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:18:51 +0000"}
