{"body": "\nFirst thanks for the replies and suggestions. What I actually want to\ndo, is to sample pixel values over an area and get the average. This is\ndone for a HDR image assembled of photographs, so I cannot use vwrays.\nPfilt also does not work, as I need the samples to hit a light source in\na black (dark) surrounding. What I did now is writing a script in perl\nwhich filters the output of pvalue, but still, as these files are large\nand I am working on batches of such images, it is not that comfortable\nto do so (it takes time). I am taking these values into my script\nanyway, so writing this was not the problem, it is more about the\nunnecessary lookups of all those pixels that are just not that interesting.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] getting pixel value at x,y", "sender": "Lars O.
