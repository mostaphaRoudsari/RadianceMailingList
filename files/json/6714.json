I wanted to put frames around some objects\nin the image, but as I could not find a way to say AND in the\ncal-expression pcomb expects, I do not know e.g. how to cut away the\ninner part of a box.\n\nTIA&CU Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] getting pixel value at x,y", "sender": "Lars O.
