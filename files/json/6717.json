The -x and -y resolution options are needed because pinterp otherwise defaults to 512x512, and you may not want that.  The default filling option ('-fa') should work fine in your case, which is why I didn't specify anything for -f.  Using '-ff' may result in some black pixels, which you don't want to send to evalglare as it would skew your results.\n\nA little experimentation should resolve any outstanding issues.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare analysis", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 08:44:20 -0700"}
