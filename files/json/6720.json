{"body": "\nJust adding my two cents to this...\n\nThe pfilt option (1) Jack suggests is a good one, and may be combined\nwith the others as well.  The pcompos option (2) is a little more\nrisky, as this program ignores/removes whatever exposure changes were\nmade to the picture, so if it isn't straight out of rpict, you may\nget different values than you expect.  The scripting option (3) is\nvery well-done, but I don't think you need to include the rayinit.cal\nfile on the command line, as Jack has transcribed and modified the\nrelevant functions into the -e arguments.\n\nOne other comment is if you only want a few pixels out of an image,\nvwrays connected to rtrace is much simpler and faster.  Rather than\ngenerating a whole picture, just use:\n\nvwrays -i -vf view.vf -x ${xres} -y ${yres} | rtrace [options] octree\n\nThen, on the input to vwrays, type (or redirect) the desired x and y\npixel coordinates; vwrays will produce the corresponding ray sample,\nwhich rtrace will compute for you.\n\nFinally, no one mentioned that ximage (and Photosphere and others)\ncan query individual values interactively.  I don't know if this will\nwork in your application.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] getting pixel value at x,y", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<12800B97-EF9F-4022-AA0A-EEC79B6DF8F7@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1212063852.14951.8.camel@Optiplex755>", "<483EBCF6.2070207@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Thu May 29 07:49:13 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] getting pixel value at x,y"}
