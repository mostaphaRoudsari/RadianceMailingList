Currently our office uses Vectorworks  (we are a MAC based office), and we would like to convert 3D models to use for daylighting studies with Radiance software. I am unsure how to convert to a file that Radiance can use. Are you aware of how I can explore the file? Have others ran into this issue before? I have heard people have used sketchup models to be used with Radiance.\n\nAny information you could provide me with would be VERY VERY helpful.\n\nRachelle Lemieux\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rachelle Lemieux", "datetime": "Fri, 2 Sep 2011 14:31:28 -0500"}
