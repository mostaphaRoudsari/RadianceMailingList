Vectorworks supports a\nbunch of 3d formats, so this used to be no problem. As far as I know,\nunfortunately, there is no support for wavefront obj. So you should try\neither to export\n\n1) 3ds, which can be converted to mgf (using 3ds2mgf) and then to rad\n(mgf2rad)\n\n2) dxf, which can be converted to rad using Georg Mischler's dxf2rad\n(available at http://www.schorsch.com/en/download/dxf2rad/ )\n\nThere is also IGES-support in Vectorworks, so it may be an option to\nstore all model data in IGES (which is a full 3d CAD standard, so the\nmodels are not a mess of triangles but keep all the information) and\ndevelop a toolchain to integrate IGES into your Radiance environment.\nThere is IGES-support in a wide range of open-source, scripteable tools now.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 6246 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110903/344b0766/attachment-0001.bin>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Converting files", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
