Yes, I've looked at it and will do more looking.\n\nI am suspecting that no-one has done general convergence studies on the\nalgorithms used in Radiance, alas.  It would be really useful\ninformation to have in hand for us practitioners.  Sounds like it could\nbe a PhD dissertation in applied mathematics, though.\n\nRandolph\n\nOn 2011-09-02 12:16:06 -0700, Guglielmetti, Robert said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Randolph M.
