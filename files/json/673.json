If you say that a downward pointing normal means the object\ngets mirrored, how do you know which axis to mirror?  There are three\nchoices, and all of them result in a mirrored object, but with very\ndifferent positions.  The logical choice if we're talking about the\nz-axis would be to mirror z, but that will result in an object\nprojecting into the ground in most cases.  How do you justify choosing\none axis to mirror over another?  It seems rather confusing from a\nuser's standpoint, or am I missing something obvious?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: replmarks and mirroring", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri May 14 22:31:41 2004"}
