It is not\nsurprising to get different results using different methods - if the\nresults were identical, Jan would have done the work for nothing. One of\nthe keys is whether you have a large transmissive glazing/facade (high\nvertical illuminance) or more some small windows (high ratios max/min\nluminances). But again, it is best to read it from Jan's work, he spent\nsome time on it. One more nice introduction by Jan is available here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop8/Presentations/wienhold_rad_ws_2009_evalglare_intro.pdf\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 6246 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20110911/cc841177/attachment.bin>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glare evaluati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
