I did temporarily change the code to where if direct or global was zero, I reset it to one, but I'd like to pass in the actual values, if possible, ya know? Maybe I'll try (if 0.0 then 0.0000000001) like you tried, and see how the results come out. What platform are you on? I'm not seeing the \"Illegal instruction: 4\" error ever...\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\nOn Oct 7, 2011, at 5:13 PM, David Appelfeld wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111007/ae531363/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange gendaylit behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Oct 2011 18:58:22 -0600"}
