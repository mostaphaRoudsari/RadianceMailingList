Gendaylit is a little fragile when the sun's near the horizon anyway; Axel Jacobs pointed this out in his \"learning rtcontrib\" tutorial as well.\n\nAndy McNeil has a good idea that he illustrated in one of his talks at the Radiance Workshop, he looks for gendaylit errors and if thrown, he uses gensky instead. I'm trying to implement something similar here, but as I said the gendaylit STDERR is behaving unreliably, it seems. Maybe it's best to test for zero values in the weather input data and just default to gensky for those timesteps, or something.\n\nI dunno, I have a headache. Happy weekend y'all.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn Oct 7, 2011, at 7:00 PM, Jia Hu wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111007/84aeb9d5/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange gendaylit behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Oct 2011 19:41:59 -0600"}
