However, as you\nincrease the number of zeroes out to -L 0.000000000000 the results\nchange to issue the warnings reported by David.\n\nfile ~/Documents/ray/bin/gendaylit reports on my Mac box:\n\ngendaylit: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\nLooking at the source version of gendaylit I have, it uses atof to\nconvert a string to double. I would expect this to be where the odd\nbehaviour is coming from with the precision of the -L parameter.\n\n*Terrance Mc Minn\n**Lecturer, Department of Architecture\nBuilt Environment\n*\n*Curtin**University*\n*Email |*t.mcminn at curtin.edu.au <a.joske at curtin.edu.au>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111008/7932c564/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange gendaylit behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "datetime": "Sat, 08 Oct 2011 15:55:22 +0800"}
