{"body": "\nThank you, both of you. But I was referring to the IES files from lighting\nmanufacturers as Greg said. Sorry for not being clear... ies2rad seems to be\nexactly what I'm looking for.\n\nShould the following be a new topic?\n\nFor something like the following (which is part of a converted IES file, I\nthink). But regardless, \"glow\" requires you to specify \"red\" \"green\" and\n\"blue\" values. In the following they are equal: 9477... for each.\n\nlamp_glow glow lamp\n0\n0\n4 9477.696528 9477.697093 9477.697093    0\nSo what units are these values in? This ratio of R to G to B shows up in\nother parameters too (light, illum). Is there a max value to these RGB\nvalues or for their total? That's one basic thing I've always been confused\nabout.\nThank you,\nNick\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080522/94a4953d/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Calcagni", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<d5d7d3120805221138i78805534n72952a14563d8765@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May 22 11:39:51 2008", "email": "nac342 at drexel.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Desktop Radiance and IES plus new questionon RGB"}
