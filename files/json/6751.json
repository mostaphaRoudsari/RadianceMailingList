I have good news; in classic Radiance Community fashion, some cool shit has happened.\n\nGreg told Ian Ashdown about my plight, Ian emailed me directly to tell me he completely re-wrote gendaylit and validated it a couple years ago for one of his clients, and just today decided to open source it! I will try and test it out this weekend, and Ian will get a link to it soon on his website (www.helios32.com).\n\nAnother fine example of the greatness of the people in this community, a fine bunch indeed.\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn Oct 8, 2011, at 8:39 AM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111008/d0fd1876/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange gendaylit behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Sat, 8 Oct 2011 13:08:28 -0600"}
