The proposed dates fall into two August possibilities:\n\na)  August 20-24\nb)  August 27-31\n\nAs usual, we appreciate any input as to conflicts or synergy these dates may have with other conferences distant or nearby.  Please respond to the list so we can have a discussion.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111011/f4fd0196/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 2012 worksh", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com>", "datetime": "Tue, 11 Oct 2011 20:38:54 +0000"}
