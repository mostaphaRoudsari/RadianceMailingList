Luminaires are typically measured for output only in visible spectrum, and skies in either visible or full solar spectrum. If you have a known source definition in the visible range, and you know how much UV the same source generates per W of visible or total solar, maybe you can scale your results according to UV. Or if you know the source UV output of your source directly, you might treat it the same as if it's the Watts in the visible range for your input and output through Radiance (but do a sanity check on your results and careful that you're not off by a factor of 179 for the de facto lumens per Watt Radiance conversion). You also have to consider that surfaces might reflect or transmit UV in different proportions than for the visible or solar spectrum.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4EA13229.40309@gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Fri, 21 Oct 2011 09:50:24 -0400"}
