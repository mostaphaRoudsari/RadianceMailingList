It doesn't look like the error comes from apply_tregsamp.bash but instead something around it on the command line.\n\nAlso, dctimestep can replace the pcomb and apply_tregsamp step in Axel's tutorial.  It's much faster and simpler.  The command would look something like this:\ndctimestep images/patches/p%03d.hdr tmp/skydist.dat > images/combined_skyvec.hdr\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Oct 20, 2011, at 6:21 PM, John Ford wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111021/2523ac7d/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] error combining rtcontrib patches", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Fri, 21 Oct 2011 09:11:08 -0700"}
