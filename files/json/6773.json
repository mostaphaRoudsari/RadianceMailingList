{"body": "\nHi Casper et al.,\n\nI need a little more information about the material on the inside of\nthe light pipes.  Is it diffuse?  If not, then you probably don't\nneed all the ambient bounces.  Even if it is, Jack's idea for using\nmkillum is a good one.  I'd try putting the illum surface on the\ninterior portal first, and set mkillum -aa 0 so there's no ambient\nstorage, decreasing other parameters to mkillum accordingly, e.g.:\n\nmkillum -ab 0 -ad 256 -as 0 -ab 4\n\nThis will perform a pure Monte Carlo calculation in mkillum, which\nwill avoid the storage problem and still give you reasonable results.\n\nAs Jack points out, light pipes are not really Radiance's forte, and\ndown the line there will be better options, like using rtcontrib in a\nmore general ray-tracing precalculation.  Right now, you're sort of\nstuck with mkillum.  If your interior surfaces are mirror-like, then\nyou may also avail yourself of the \"mirror\" type to handle redirected\nsunlight, but only if you expect that.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] out of memory in avstore", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<10ABEB0B-AED2-4596-827F-E644DF8ACB17@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<LAEELIFELGJCEOKFMDAAMEHPCEAA.C.Esmeijer@mook.peutz.nl>", "<4829B557.3050107@visarc.com> <4829B946.70000@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Tue May 13 11:22:09 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] out of memory in avstore"}
