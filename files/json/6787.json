DIVA supports a series of performance evaluations including:\n\n\n\n- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)\n\n- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)\n\n- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)\n\n- Glare analysis (Evalglare)\n\n- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)\n\n- Hourly load calculations (EnergyPlus)\n\n\n\nThe plug-in offers highly optimized simulation workflows within Rhino and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in order to generate animated simulation movies (see for example http://vimeo.com/31269386). More information can be found at www.diva-for-rhino.com<http://www.diva-for-rhino.com> and http://wiki.diva-for-rhino.com/HomePage. DIVA is currently available free of charge from http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/download.html.\n\n\n\nAlstan Jakubiec and I will be attending Building Simulation 2011 next week in Sydney and - if there is sufficient interest - we will be offering a 3 hour hands-on DIVA workshop on Thursday, November 17, from 9AM to noon at the University of Sydney, Faculty of Architecture, Design and Planning. The workshop fee would be $US250 per participant. (We do not have a student rate at this point.) If you are interested in participating, please send me a brief email by November 8, 10AM EST. Based on the number of responses we will announce the workshop tomorrow.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nChristoph Reinhart\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111107/4843e61b/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "datetime": "Mon, 7 Nov 2011 18:05:35 +0000"}
