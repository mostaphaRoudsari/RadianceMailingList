This may simplify things a bit and give\nyou more control over the number of surfaces. You could introduce an object\nin Sketchup and substitute is afterwards manually or by using instances.\ngood luck,\nCasper\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\n\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for answers,\n\nAfter detailed analysis of lamellas' SKetchUp geometry, I decided to\nsimplify it a little bit - so I replaced curved parts with really small\nradius with 2 polygons.\nWhen exported number of surfaces per lamella is much smaller, and I still\nget correct reflectances and overall blind transmittance, so I think this\nsimplified lamella geometry will work.\n\n\n\nSince I need in building lots of blinds, so I'll surely use instances and\nxform to put it all in building.\n\nCU,\nMarija.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111111/42c11e8f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to generate surface with gensurf\tprogram?", "tags": [], "sender": "maricanis at gmail.com", "datetime": "Fri, 11 Nov 2011 10:25:40 +0100"}
