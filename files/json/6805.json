A windows user has to install one of the windows ports of Perl (Active Perl, Strawberry Perl, etc) or we could provide packaged executables for windows systems using par-packer (http://search.cpan.org/~rschupp/PAR-Packer-1.010/lib/pp.pm).  We've gone the par-packer route for the Radiance Perl programs needed by COMFEN and Window6 - we can't really tell those users to install a windows port of a unix utility, the user support requests would be a nightmare.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn Nov 17, 2011, at 8:06 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] OpenStudio-Radiance Demo Videos", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Thu, 17 Nov 2011 09:01:01 -0800"}
