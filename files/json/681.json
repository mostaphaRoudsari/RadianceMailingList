However I would like some more background info on the\nfile formats. I can't seem to be able to dig up much on what the \"raw\"\nformat actually contains, I imagine it isn't necessarily the same from\ncamera to camera? Are there parameters to be passed on to the hdr\ngenerating software based on the raw format?\n\nI have no support for macosx, so it's between windows and linux, although\nthe hdrgen program looks interesting as it's command line based and easier\nto enter into batch processing. But I couldn't find any documentation about\nit and the executable doesn't have any built in help whatsoever. :)\n\nCould I possibly ask you to roughly describe the process of generating hdr\nimages from those taken with the Rebel? Any calibration involved?\n\n\nBarbara\n\n\nAt 10:38 28.05.2004 -0400, you wrote:\n\nassociate professor Barbara Matusiak                            Tel.: +47\n73 59 50 77\nFaculty of Arcitecture and Fine Art                             Fax: +47 73\n59 53 88\nNorwegian Univ. of Science and Technology\n(NTNU)                barbara.matusiak@ark.ntnu.no\nN-7491 Trondheim,\nNorway\nhttp://www.ab.ntnu.no/byggekunst/ansatte/ansattesider/bam.html\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<40B74EC9.4010809@rumblestrip.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Barbara Matusiak", "datetime": "Tue Jun  1 15:37:10 2004"}
