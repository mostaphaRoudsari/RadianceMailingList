{"body": "\nHi Tom,\n\nThank for taking the time to write a thoughtful and thought-provoking\nletter to the group.  Indeed, material models are hard to come by in\nRadiance, and most users end up spending a significant amount of time\ncreating the materials they need for a convincing and accurate result.\n\nSadly, there are so many architectural materials out there, that\ncreating a library that is comprehensive or even representative is a\ndaunting challenge, and it has proven difficult to get public funding\nagencies behind such an effort.  The best hope is for a consortium,\nsimilar to the one set up by Mike Rubin & company at LBNL with the\nglazing manufacturers to establish a protocol for characterizing\ntheir products in a consistent and unbiased way.  Getting the kind of\ncohesion and groundswell needed for such a consortium of the many\ncompanies involved in producing masonry, floor coverings, paints,\nwallpaper, etc., etc...  Well, let's just say it would take a big\npush from somewhere.\n\nSo, I don't really have a satisfying answer to your request, but\nmaybe there are others on the list who can volunteer their\nexperiences with material modeling.  Perhaps someone can even suggest\na route for gathering a reasonable library together.  Certainly, it\nwould get some use.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] non-technical", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<02EF7A66-B894-4443-B6BA-8B5D712391DF@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<5C0C38B7-91BC-4BCB-8165-89666AF26997@mac.com>"], "datetime": "Thu May  1 08:37:51 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] non-technical"}
