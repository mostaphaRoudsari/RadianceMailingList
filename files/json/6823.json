Acceptable,temperatures,radiation levels and wind speeds outdoors are an interest of mine. I have a colleague who has coined the term 'warm shade' to describe the concept many public spaces in New Zealand seek of staying in the warming rays of the sun while avoiding the worst of the UV from the same sun is a major focus especially in schools.\n\nHowever, I am guessing from your explanation, confessing i do not understand it entirely, that you are trying to determine an outdoor illuminance that will provide a reasonable indoor illuminance? If that is the case, then is suspect there are so many variables other than VLT that you should be concerned with,that the approach needs to be re-thought. Size of window? Reflectivity of the other surfaces in the space? how much direct as opposed to bounced or diffuse light makes up your 100 Lux....\n\nCan you draw a diagram (ASCII crude will do) that shows the light path you are tracing?\n\nM\n\nMichael Donn\n\nMichael.Donn at gmail.com\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn 30/11/2011, at 9:03, \"radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\" <radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org> wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 93, Issue 18", "tags": [], "sender": "Michael Donn", "datetime": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 06:09:58 +0000"}
