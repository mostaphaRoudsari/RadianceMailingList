You could also look at just the hours of occupancy.  Some examples here:\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:urban-solar\n\nThe image for London clearly shows the effect of tall buildings reducing the ground level cumulative illuminance (actually, irradiance in the legend but just x 100 to estimate klux-hrs / yr).\n\nBest\nJohn\n\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, UK\nTel: +44 (0) 116 257 7972\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\nhttp://dmu.academia.edu/JohnMardaljevic\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 16:26:40 +0000"}
