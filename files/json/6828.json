It would avoid the issues raised by Andy in relation to the UK 'Right to Light'/mildewed courtyard issue.\n\nI do want to return to your calculation though. You state you have a mental picture of tracing the light from the sensor to the ceiling etc... If the metric is for houses, this seems quite an odd approach. You might do well to read about overall / average DF - perhaps starting with Joe Lynes 1979 paper: DOI: 10.1177/1477153579011002010 : A sequence for daylighting design : Lighting Research and Technology 1979 11: 10\n\nIMHO the likely general cheerfulness (brightness) of a home, however imprecisely tested, is of more interest than the illuminance on a desk or table?\n\nm\n\n------------------------------------\nVictoria University of Wellington School of Architecture\nMichael Donn\nmichael.donn at vuw.ac.nz\nPO Box 600\n139 Vivian St\nWellington\nNew Zealand\ntel: +64 4 463 6221\nfax: +64 4 463 6204\nmobile: +64 21 611 280\nSkype ID:the_donn\n------------------------------------\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, December 02, 2011 9:00 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

It was so informative.\n\nI agree that using hours of sunshine (sunlight hours) in this way totally\nmake sense however in the code I mentioned it was a metric for building\nenvelopes (e.g. two hours of sunlight hours in 21st December is needed for\nresidential buildings).\n\nAs you said the weakness of metrics like VSC or Daylight Factor\n(SC+ERC+IRC) is not being climate-based and orientation sensitive but maybe\nthis is the best possible way for now.\n\nThanks,\nMostapha\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 30, 2011 at 12:18 PM, Andy McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111130/b266acc8/attachment-0001.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 94, Issue 1\n***********************************************\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 94, Issue 1", "tags": [], "sender": "sadeghipour at gmail.com", "datetime": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 19:27:27 -0600"}
