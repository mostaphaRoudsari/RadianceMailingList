I would like to model them transmitting about 20% of light and make the canopy 40% reflective.\n* Can I do this by using a translucent material??\n* If so, can you point me to a tutorial?\n* Will this be compatible with the 3-phase method of daylighting analysis? (I.e., daylight coefficient method with the 3-phase method and a BSDF for the window).\n\nThanks for any help,\nTim\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111205/4d636177/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Trees", "tags": [], "sender": "Tim Perry", "datetime": "Mon, 5 Dec 2011 17:34:27 -0800 (PST)"}
