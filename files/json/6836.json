{"body": "\nGreg,\n\nThat was it. I took me a minute to figure out how to find and edit the\ninitialization file (editing /home/[username]/.bashrc as root), but it\nworks now. Thanks!\n\n-Cramer\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Greg\nWard\nSent: Thursday, June 05, 2008 1:10 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Cramer,\n\nThere doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your file, and oconv\nlikes it just fine.\n\nI just noticed in your typescript file that the problem is you have a\ndifferent program also called \"genbox\" that is being called (from\nGromacs) instead of the Radiance tool.  The easiest fix is to run\n\"which genbox\" to find the path to the other one, then change your\nPATH order for your shell initialization file to point to the\nRadiance executable directory before the other one.\n\nI hope this sorts out your problem.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF02EF06CF@webmail.transsolar.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun  5 10:59:40 2008", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] scene 0 tutorial error"}
