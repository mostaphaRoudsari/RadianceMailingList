If it's not a flat surface use a reasonable geometric\napproximation. It will look different but probably will still give you the\nright idea about the effect. If you are only interested in the direct\nreflection of the sun (single virtual light source per mirror polygon) you\nshould be able to render the scene even if you have a lot of mirror\nsurfaces.\n\nTo eliminate the sky (direct or indirect) remove the sky and ground\ndefinition from the sky file (you are already doing that).\n\nIf you are not set on a \"black and white\" footprint of the reflection you\ncould also use a coloured mirror (say red) and use only white/grey\nmaterials. Your reflection will show as a red patch while direct sunlight\nwill still be white.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111214/36a37cfb/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum -ab 0 questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 18:48:46 -0500"}
