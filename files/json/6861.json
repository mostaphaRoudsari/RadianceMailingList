It gave me nice light patch,\nbut also some other bright pixels on the edges of the area where direct sun\npatch was - because of randomness of Radiance calculation (I suppose) .\n\n\nSurface is flat so I've put mirror, and I removed sky/ground.\nProblem is how to get rid of the direct sun and keep reflected one.\n\nI tried rtcontrib but all contribution go to the sun. Thats why I'm using\nmkillum to make my mirror deflector separate light source (with l+ option).\nAfter that I get nice light patch from deflector, but also some light\naround (which shouldn't be the case since I use -ab 0 -av 0 0 0).\n\n\nYes good idea, I've tried it also and it works - so If I don't find some\nway to do it nicely in black-white, I'll go to solution.\n\nThanks again,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20111215/f01e9c52/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum -ab 0 questi", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Thu, 15 Dec 2011 09:27:10 +0100"}
