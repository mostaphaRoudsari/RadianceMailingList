Identifiers can not\ncontain\nspaces so it should be 'translucent_panel' or something like that.\n\nThe '1 1 1' looks odd to me. I don't think that's actually a physical\nmaterial.\nI'd go for something like 0.8 for white.\n\n\nThe second issue which I have not been able to figure out is how\nto show this trans material inside the space in the final rendering in\nRadiance as it is essentially invisible.\n\nThink about it:\nif it's 50% translucent it has to be visible (even glass with 50%\ntransmission would\nshow as a darker shade of the room behind it.) You're talking about\n'white' so I assume\nthat you do want some amount of scattering of the light. In fact, the\nmaterial above\nscatters 80% of the light that passes, so it would definitely be\nvisible.\n\nJust try a simple scene with a test cube and a bit of ground below and\nuse\nthe command 'objview' (Unix only) to see how the material works out.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080612/bbba88be/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling Question for Translucent Glass", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7025DCF01@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<485153d6.21c07e0a.50ab.ffffff55@mx.google.com>", "<198CB930-5245-4D69-BA41-2210FBE61864@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun 12 15:16:39 2008", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Modeling Question for Translucent Glass"}
