All installations (home/work & Cygwin/Mandrake)\nwere from pre-complied binaries.\n\nIf PFILT is run by RAD automatically (to turn\nan unfinished render into a .pic) then there\naren't any problems. But if you run PFILT\nindependently, it just starts to spit garbage\nto the term, and continues until it's killed\noff. It does this no matter what options are\npassed to it.\n\nDo I need to have PFILT not be pre-complied\nfor these systems? Is there some fundamental\nthing I'm missing about PFILT? can I only\nuse PFILT as part of RAD? I haven't tried\nto pass options via my .rif file to PFILT\nyet, that's my next step, to see if it\nbehaves then.\n\nThanks,\n\nJeffrey\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "JMcGrew@huntsmanag.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F90302DDD@l-gnts05>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 10 Sep 2003 17:45:58 +0100", "email": "Jeffrey McGrew", "subject": "[Radiance-general] PFILT is crashing constantly..."}
