{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI realize you received several replies on this. But just a note for\neveryone.The error that you received when trying to run makeall install,\neg \"command not found,\" indicates that you do not have cshell (csh)\ninstalled. This is the shell that makeall requires. If you type \"csh\" at\nthe command line, you should get a message that explains how to get csh\nusing apt-get.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nqiuzhongzhu@shiep.edu.cn wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: jedev.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 263 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080616/f6e917bd/jedev.vcf\n", "replyTo": "<4073.144.214.86.109.1213452956.post4u@144.214.86.109>", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<485669FD.60201@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<4073.144.214.86.109.1213452956.post4u@144.214.86.109>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 16 06:26:44 2008", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trouble in installing radiance on ubuntu 8.03-anew user"}
