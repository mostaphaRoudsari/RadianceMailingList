You are only passing the first channel ($1 in\nthe rcalc expression).\n\nIf you use only the first channel (\"R\") in your simulations to record\nresults of the -ab 0 calculation, you can ignore the other two channels\n(\"B\", \"G\") and zero them in the output:\n\npvalue ?d ?h ?H input.hdr | rcalc ?e ?$1=if(179*$1-100,1,0); $2=0; $3=0?\n| pvalue ?r ?H ?h ?d ?y 693 +x 1200 > output.hdr\n\nSorry, I could not resist but change the file extensions from pic to hdr\n:-) So while I am not sure whether this solves the problem, it may hint\nyou to the error.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating number of daylight hours", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
