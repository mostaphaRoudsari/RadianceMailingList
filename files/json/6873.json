{"body": "\nHi Kam,\n\n\nWhat I believe you are seeing is the gradual transition at the horizon\nbetween the sky and ground radiance produced by a (steep) power-law\nblending function in skybright.cal.  This introduces a slight\ndeviation from the mathematically 'perfect' distribution which might\nbe noticed in certain situations.  You can prevent this happening by\nusing a slightly modified version of cal file available here:\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/pickup/skybright_nomix.cal\n\nSimply place where it will be found by RAYPATH and rename\n'skybright.cal' in the gensky output to 'skybright_nomix.cal'.  This\nwill work for all sky luminance distributions.  If uniform is the only\n'perfect' sky that you need, then the easiest way is create it manually:\n\n# uniform brightness sky (B=1)\nvoid glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\nRe: Q2 - Have a look at the \"ambient accuracy parameter\" thread in\nDecember 2006 (especially Greg's comment).\n\nRegards,\n\n-John\n\nPS. The current skybright.cal (2.7) is a later version than the one I\nmodified (2.6), but I didn't note any difference in the code other\nthan the RCS header.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<220CBB4D-64B5-41DA-9841-161358063C29@dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jun 17 02:16:30 2008", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance value of uniform sky"}
