I thought I had tried that in another test (which I had). Just tinkering around and looking at the original data, I realized that I had at some point switched on the -u option of pvalue to list only the unique values. Once I realized that, my full command line works! I'm sure that switching from a pic extension to hdr helped as well ;)\nI also realized that I would need to divide my 1's by 179 again to get back to the desired units in my images.\n\nThanks for the help! Hopefully I don't make any more mistakes when I wrap this into my script to generate the data.\n\nChris\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating number of daylight hours", "tags": [], "sender": "Chris Coulter", "datetime": "Wed, 28 Dec 2011 14:57:50 -0500"}
