You can increase the ?r option in oconv which helps, but increases compilation time and octree size. Two better solutions are 1) build the cleanest models you can, and 2) use a newer version of oconv.exe. You can grab a semi-recent version here:\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started/getting-started-windows\n\nScroll down to the \"Radiance Binaries\" section and there's a link there.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\nOn 1/9/12 3:46 PM, \"Jill Dalglish\" <jill at jilldalglish.com<mailto:jill at jilldalglish.com>> wrote:\n\nHello,\n\nI am getting an error message from oconv \"internal - set overflow in addobject <zone02.rad00680>\" This results in a error generating the octree.\n\nCan anyone please tell me where to start debugging?\n\nI am running desktop radiance through Ecotect export on WinXP.\n\nThank you,\n--\nJill Dalglish, LEED AP\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] error message: overflow in addobject", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Mon, 9 Jan 2012 15:54:34 -0700"}
