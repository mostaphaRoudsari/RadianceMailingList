Geometry that comes to a point with many polygons sharing the same vertex is the usual source of this error.  I think the limit is 510 elements sharing a vertex or an infinitesimal volume of space.  Things like Rob's doorknob example can often be represented more simply in Radiance's native surface primitives than they can using triangles if that's an option.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] error message: overflow in addobject", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 9 Jan 2012 15:10:42 -0800"}
