I am using a version of esp-r compiled from the source code and I can open a radiance desktop from there, however that does not seem to work properly at the moment. Does any of you know what the problem may be? I am thinking of installing a window version of radiance, do you know how to make it work with esp-r? Let me know, I look forward to hearing from you,\n\nRegards,\nArianna\n\nArianna Sdei\nArchitect, MPhil (Cantab)\nUniversity of Brighton\nResearch Fellow, IFORE Project\nPhD Fellow\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120119/9cbfa83d/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "A.Sdei at brighton.ac.uk", "datetime": "Thu, 19 Jan 2012 17:37:29 +0000"}
