Applications an data are uploaded for jobruns and the output is downloaded from a GUI java web-based interface. Signing up is straightforward and Sun provides a free introductory 200cpu-hours to new registrations. 1cpu-hour normally cost $1USD with no other costs or pre-purchaseed cpu-hours.\n\nI've used the cluster for other applications and it works very well (and needless to say, fast)\n\nhttps://www.network.com/GridPortal/GridPortal/StartAction.do?aceActionName=AceSpecificInitializeOnly\n\n\nregards\nSteve Michel\n_________________________________________________________________\nIf you like crossword puzzles, then you'll love Flexicon, a game which combines four overlapping crossword puzzles into one!\nhttp://g.msn.ca/ca55/208\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance now Sun Microsystems clusters", "sender": "steve michel", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BAY143-W4324AA1DBE2BA8793C6A4EE0A40@phx.gbl>", "refs": ["<C41886BD-4B0E-42D5-88E7-CE81E7774777@umn.edu>", "<485BD5B1.9060008@rumblestrip.org>", "<81235DD9-31BC-4E48-AF3B-2A539AAE564F@umn.edu>", "<485BE734.7030800@rumblestrip.org>", "<BAY143-W20A3EE5805A1E4CFAB0299E0A40@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Sat Jun 21 03:22:02 2008", "email": "smichel_designer at hotmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance now Sun Microsystems clusters"}
