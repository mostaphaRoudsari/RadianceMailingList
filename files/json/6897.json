{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI have a question concerning dielectric and how to model correctly\nprinted stripe (fritted glass) on a surface of dielectric material.\n\nAccording to the reference manual, \" Ordinary dielectrics are\nsurrounded by a vacuum\". But in my case, the transition between the\ndielectric and the print color is different to the transition from\ndielectric to vacuum. And since I'll have the printed stripes on\ndifferent layers, the difference is significant.\n\nMy purpose is to simulate with Radiance a laminated glass with fritted\nstripes on the surface in-between the two laminated glass sheets. I\nwant to check the view to the outside and the transmission of such\nfritted glass.\n\nI already modeled the stripe as a plastic surface with a very small\ngap between the two panes of glass. But I obtained wrong result\nbecause of the air gap between the stripe and the dielectric (glass)\npanes.\n\nAny idea how to model this correctly?\n\nWhat happens, if the dielectric is not completely \"boxed\", but parts\nof the \"box\" replaced by plastic material?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\nFrancesco Frontini\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "francesco.frontini@polimi.it", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20080623203508.iv4sohszeock0c4g@webmail.polimi.it>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun 23 11:35:14 2008", "email": "francesco.frontini at polimi.it", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling printed glass with dielectric material"}
