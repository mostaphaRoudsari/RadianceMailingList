If Giovanni's\nassumption is correct and your surfaces get a plastic modifier (probably\nwith high specular reflection), you cannot expect accurate \"sharp\"\nshadows/highlights on diffuse reflective surfaces (such as a ceiling) as\nall the light transport is handled by the ambient calculation. You would\nneed a mirror modifier applied to your surface. Unfortunately, with a\nmeshed curved surface, you would end up with a practically infinite\nnumber of such mirrors, thus with an infinite number of secondary light\nsources. There is some define in the code setting the maximum number of\nsecondary light sources, and one could set it higher (this has been used\nfor reflector modeling), but don't expect this to be efficient with an\narchitectural model.\n\nI quote this from time to time (Rendering with Radiance, p. 580, chapter\n13 \"Secondary light sources\"):\n\n[...] \"Other cases involving curved, specular reflectors pose similar\ndifficulties for mkillum, and the only long-term solution seams to be\nthe creation of a forward raytracing module for computing these kinds of\nillums.\" [...]\n\nWhat are you trying to model? Specular, curved blinds? Some kind of a\ncollector?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/pkcs7-signature\nSize: 4438 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Kryptografische Unterschrift\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120201/ed4c405b/attachment.bin>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Curved mirror surfaces", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
