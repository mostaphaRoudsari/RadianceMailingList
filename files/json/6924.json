{"body": "\nHi Francesco,\n\nYour posting arrived twice -- were you not sure that it was posted\nthe first time?  You can always double-check at radiance-online,\nsince the archives are always current.\n\nThe \"interface\" type is what you are looking for, I believe, since it\nallows you to specify the dielectric constant on either side of a\nboundary.  Modeling materials at this level of detail requires that\nyou know very precise things about the geometry and physical properties.\n\nIt is OK to have some sides of a dielectric capped by an opaque\nmaterial, such as plastic.  If you have no cap, just an opening, then\nthe results will not be correct.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling printed glass with dielectric material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<214B495B-45FF-40BE-9EC4-2563D29E1695@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4955.144.214.86.109.1213961455.post4u@144.214.86.109>", "<20080623152924.bb3wofim800c4wsk@webmail.polimi.it>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 23 12:11:26 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling printed glass with dielectric material"}
