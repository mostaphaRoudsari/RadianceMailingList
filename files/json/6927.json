You can of course specify a different horizontal and vertical size with the -vh and -vv options, but both must be less than 180.\n\nWhat is the view in your original fish.hdr file?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pinterp on a rectangle imag", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat, 11 Feb 2012 20:48:06 -0800"}
