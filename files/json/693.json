As far as I\nunderstood, it is possible to interact with the virtual environment using a\nmouse while running this command. Unfortunately I haven't managed yet to see\nanything while running rtrace even for 2 hours. The octree-file I am using\nis not that huge (5,2 MB), so I thing I am not using the right options of\nrtrace (or I misunderstood the whole thing completely). Which options I am\nsupposed to use to run the program interactively? What would be an example\ncommand line?\n\nThanks!\n\nOlga Graf\n--\n\n<http://adserver.freenet.de/click.ng/site=fn&prod=chetools&kat=rub&tbl=webma\nil&ppos=1&TransactionID=1086796997271858&rgtg=256>\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040609/bd2fc334/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "graf-o@freenet.de", "datetime": "Wed Jun  9 18:26:22 2004"}
