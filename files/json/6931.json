In fact, what you have given me here with -vtv is not a fisheye view at all, but a perspective projection.  In this case, the aspect ratio is even greater.\n\nUnless you go all the way to 180 degrees in each direction, you cannot compute an exact value for the illuminance.  You can come reasonably close if there aren't any really bright areas just out of view.  The cosine correction on most illuminance meters is not much better.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pinterp on a rectangle imag", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 12 Feb 2012 08:57:00 -0800"}
