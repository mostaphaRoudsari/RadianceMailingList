There should be at least some small variations due to random sampling in every case, unless you specify the -u- option.\n\nDo you mean that your runs are \"mostly similar\" with the exception of noise, or \"identical\" as you say?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib stdout", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 17 Feb 2012 08:42:08 -0800"}
