{"body": "\nHi.\n\n\nrunning\n\ndpkg -L radiance\n\nwill list the files.\nYou should also install the following packages:\nradiance-doc\nradiance-materials\n- especially if you want to have a look at the examples. They're split\ninto packages on their own as they're architecture independent. Listing\nthe files works in the same way, just use the different package name.\n\n\ngenrbox\n\n\nThe manpages have been patched, so they'll show genrbox.\n\n\nThe commands are available under the old name if you add\n/usr/lib/radiance/ to your PATH. Adding something like\nexport PATH=/usr/lib/radiance:$PATH\nto your .bashrc or /etc/profile or to the rc file of your favourite\nshell will help. Then you'll also be able to use rview.\n\n\nThe example scenes don't need it, you need to install the\nradiance-materials\npackage, though. If RAYPATH is not in the environment,\n/usr/share/radiance will be used automatically.\n\n\nThere's a README which explains these details in\n/usr/share/doc/radiance, in case you'd like to have additional details\nadded, please send me a patch or an updated file.\n\n\nHope that helps,\n\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nGPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n\n", "replyTo": "<AC688E64-76F3-4432-9629-42D376B56ECA@arcor.de>", "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<48583785.2030602@bzed.de>", "refs": ["<4073.144.214.86.109.1213452956.post4u@144.214.86.109>\t<4853EB9E.2050306@audice.com>\t<1567.144.214.86.109.1213506060.post4u@144.214.86.109>", "<AC688E64-76F3-4432-9629-42D376B56ECA@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Jun 17 15:15:41 2008", "email": "bernd at bzed.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] trouble in installing radiance on ubuntu\t8.03-anew user"}
