If the group is not too large, maybe you can add some\n'experience' in it. For example let the group do some measurements, walk\nthrough the building or outside, and let them collect data from lights and\nobjects etc. Thereafter you show how one can use such data in lighting\nsimulation. Beside the theory and technology, let them experience the\npractice. Just a thought,\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n2012/2/18 Randolph M.
