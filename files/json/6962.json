Also\nif project has big number of windows, calculation of mkillum would take\nadditional time - so no real time saving in this approach.\n\nAs a conclusion: For illuminance calculations better use high ambient\nparameters and avoid mkillum.\n\nThanks again,\nMarija.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120224/07fbe11a/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum usag", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 16:45:46 +0100"}
