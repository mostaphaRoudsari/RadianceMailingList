Much more polygons in the scene but no warnings.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<cdf76d820806111324x5edda96fpae108bf176ccb2fa@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<67B52FAF-F5FB-49E4-A8AD-BD88BADF4AC5@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<cdf76d820806111324x5edda96fpae108bf176ccb2fa@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun 12 12:18:48 2008", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] oconv and rtrace_dc warnings for non-planarvertices"}
