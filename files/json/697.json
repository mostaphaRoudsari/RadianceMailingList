The other day it\nseemed to be working fine but now I'm getting errors like\n\"Poor covergence of order 1 fit\"\n\"Cannot solve for response function\"\n\nUltimately it won't generate the image. Perhaps you could tell me what they\nmean and what I'm doing wrong? I've attached the five images that gave this\nerror. I've also attached another set of 3 that gave no error or warning at\nall, even though the resulting hdr is quite blurry.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nMartin\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "alex@juventuz.net", "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 14:20:27 2004"}
