If the BSDF is serving as a proxy for actual blinds geometry, then the illum will be bypassed as well during source sampling.\n\nThe only thing that would \"sort of\" work is to run mkillum in \"l+\" mode so the window gets replaced by a light source, then use the BSDF as a proxy.  You still wouldn't end up seeing what's outside through the blinds or get striped patterns during solar penetration, but at least the direct and indirect calculations would be reasonable.\n\nI don't see the advantage over a three-phase calculation if you are using BSDFs, which would be a thousand times faster.  The shortcomings are similar, but the costs are very different.\n\nThe highest quality results are still going to come from handing the blinds geometry to mkillum and letting it figure out the light distribution on its own.  You can refer to my \"first class citizen\" talk from the last workshop, where I tried to explain this reasoning.  Unfortunately, I don't know of a good shortcut in the case where you want to look at many blinds positions for the same time step.  Do you have any ideas?\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120227/6f2e1b82/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Plotting a large number of simulations", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 17:51:07 -0800"}
