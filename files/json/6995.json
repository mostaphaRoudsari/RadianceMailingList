In your case I probably would use DIVA-for-Rhino in combination with some Python scripting.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\n\nSent: Tuesday, February 28, 2012 7:12 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nHi,\n\nI'm a Master student in Mechanical Engineering, and I'm working in California at UC Davis CLTC to complete my Master Thesis on lighting energy efficiency and daylighting.\nI'm interested in daylighting simulation, and I found the following pages online giving some insights about the topic:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004577.html\n\nI was particularly interested by the latter article, since it refers to something quite similar to what I would like to do: I want to simulate the behavior of controlled louvered skylights to get the luminance maps of the a space, possibly reproducing their motion (or, otherwise, manually setting the behavior at different angles).\nI've no experience with lighting simulations environments.. could you give me a couple of suggestions? My questions are:\n\n\n-          Is Radiance the best simulation tool available for the object I want to simulate?\n\n-          How would you conceptually implement a louvered skylights with motion?\n\nThanks for your attention,\nand Best Regards\n\n--\n\nStefano Moret\nCalifornia Lighting Technology Center<http://cltc.ucdavis.edu/>\nUniversity of California, Davis\n633 Pena Drive\nDavis, CA 95618\n\n510-520-7923\nsmoret at ucdavis.edu<mailto:smoret at ad3.ucdavis.edu>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120229/a24b0f48/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Louvered skylights simulati", "tags": [], "sender": "smoret at ucdavis.edu", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 01:09:15 +0000"}
