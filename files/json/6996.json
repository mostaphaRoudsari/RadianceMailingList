For the second, I used environment\nvariable in my scene files for similar applications. That allows you to\nuse any tool you could imagine (I used perl scripts in most cases) to\ncalculate the transformation (if you want to use xform) and other\nparameters, assign these to environment variables and have these\nexpanded in the scene file. You may build your own tools on the output\nof other Radiance programs, e.g. I used gensky to get the sun vector\nwhen I scripted a tracking mirror and only had to filter out the\nrelevant information using regular expressions.\n\nOne step further would be to write a tool that writes not only these\nparameters, but the geometry description to stdout, so that it could be\nembedded in the scene file. Radiance is very flexible when it comes to\nintegration with other, external tools.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Louvered skylights simulati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
