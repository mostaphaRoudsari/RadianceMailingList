Assuming\n$SIMTIME is set to the date and time that you want to simulate, your\nscript could generate the geometry for the skylight and write it to\nstdout. If you also have a line \"!gensky $SIMTIME\" (plus the other\ngensky options) somewhere in your scene, you would make sure that the\nsky model matches the skylight's configuration. In the end, you would\nsimply export the environment variable $SIMTIME and call rad scene.rif\nto run the simulation. This could e.g. happen in a loop to go through a\nfull day.\n\nOf course there is a bunch of specialized programs out there, some with\na nice GUI, using Radiance as a back-end. I still wanted to draw your\nattention to the fact that it is very easy to add this kind of \"dynamic\nobjects\" to your scene using command expansion.\n\nI do not know about Daysim+Python, maybe others on the list can comment.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Louvered skylights simulati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
