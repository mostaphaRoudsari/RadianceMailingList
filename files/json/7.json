I had an error in my rif-file. The zone was wrong,\nas during the import, units changed from meters to centimeters.\nSo, I have a model of 1500 x 1500 x 1500, and the zone was\n15 x 15 x 15... maybe this caused errors. I just corrected it.\nI hope it works now...\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Tue, 24 Jul 2001 17:18:11 +0200"}
