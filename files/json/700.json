Try running \"make clean\"\nfirst, then \"make sholo\".  If you still have troubles, type \"which\ngetinfo\" to make sure you don't have some other executable taking\nRadiance's place.\n\n-Greg\n\nThanks for the hint, Greg! It works much better with rholo!\n\nUnfortunately, when I was trying to run one of the examples provided\nin ray/obj/cabin by typing make sholo I got the following error:\n\n[domna]s0343631: make sholo\nrholo -n 1 -o ogl summer.hdk\nrad: error reading bounding cube from getinfo\nrholo: system - cannot start rtrace process: No such file or directory\nsummer.hdk: 6.0 Mbyte holodeck file, 0.0% fragmentation\nmake: *** [sholo] Error 2\n\nActually, if I run only rholo in the same directory, it works, which\nmeans that the PATH-variable is ok. But with 'make sholo' apparently\nsomething goes wrong. Is it possible that this command is not working\nbecause I use the tmp-directory, i.e. I copied the cabin-directory into\ntmp? Unfortunately, I am run out of space on my home directory, so I\nhave no other choice at the moment.\n\nIf somebody has an idea what could be wrong, I would be glatt to hear\nfrom him or her! Thanks!\n\nOlga Graf\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace-command", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 16:55:30 2004"}
