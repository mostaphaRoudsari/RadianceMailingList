Even if you could program it to take multiple shots, it would be a challenge to align and stitch them.  You would likely have to do the stitching first and alignment later, and motion blur might be a problem as well as parallax, depending on the time between shots taken near the apex of its flight.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120304/465e7fcc/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] camera ball taking 360 degree panoramic phot", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 4 Mar 2012 09:45:03 -0800"}
