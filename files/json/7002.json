The device is using\nsmall CCD cameras (\"mobile phone cameras\"). So the whole setup is\noptimized for speed (capturing panoramic scenes with moving objects,\nthus one-shot panoramas), not dynamic range.\n\nOne might translate the idea into something similar, allowing to shoot a\nfull panorama HDR image by combining cameras mounted e.g. on a tripod.\nThese either would need a very high dynamic range - or again shoot a\nsequence at varying exposure times. Typically not that much of a problem\nin daylighting (clouds are _usually_ not moving that fast). Question is\nwhether 32 mini-cameras are that much better in doing so then 3 proper\ncompact cameras with fisheye lenses, covering the same field (sphere) of\nview.\n\nMaybe to be discussed on the HDRI list? Cheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] camera ball taking 360 degree panoramic phot", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
