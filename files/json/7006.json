{"body": "\nThis may be simple... because it seems like it should be, but I'm quite hung\nup on how to do this. How would I go about modeling an upside-down bowl? (Or\nan upper hemisphere, or a rounded lampshade, whatever helps you picture it\nbest). It seems like \"genrev\" would be the way to do this, but I don't quite\nunderstand what z(t) and r(t) do. If the input for a 2 foot wide hemisphere\n(surface normals inward) isn't too complicated, perhaps someone could paste\nit here and I could backwards-determine what the functions represent.\n\nHere's another question: can we simply make a \"bubble\" and cut it in half?\n(discarding half of it, of course)\n\nThanks!\nNick Calcagni\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080604/1772d656/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Calcagni", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<d5d7d3120806032247n641a70a3j28b0c4d8fa55061f@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jun  3 22:48:04 2008", "email": "nac342 at drexel.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modeling... a bowl?"}
