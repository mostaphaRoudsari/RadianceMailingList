{"body": "\nHi Jack!\n\n\nYes, I had just misunderstood the -x -y parameters of pcompos. The\npvalue-part was clear to me.\n\n\nI guess that this is what I will do. While I still think that it could\nbe done using only pcompos, imagemagick is easier here. I wanted to draw\nmarkers such as rectangular frames around known areas, e.g. mark the\narea in an image that has been read out by pvalue.\n\nThank you! Lars.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] getting pixel value at x,y", "sender": "Lars O.
