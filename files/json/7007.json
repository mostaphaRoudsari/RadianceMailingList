The idea is there will be a place to go to search for\nenergy model bits -- everything from HVAC, windows, materials, lights,\nweather files -- and these can be downloaded, or pulled directly into an\nOpenStudio model. I definitely envision us adding Radiance-ready data to\nthese database members.\n\nWe've got it mocked up here: https://bcl.nrel.gov/\n\nSo, another place to link to.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/6/12 10:22 AM, \"Andy McNeil\" <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New Radiance Websit", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 10:32:54 -0700"}
