Or better yet, anyone out there with greater math skills than I know how to derive disk luminance from direct normal radiation found in a weather file?\n\nThanks!\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] the disk of the su", "tags": [], "sender": "Michael Martinez", "datetime": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 13:00:36 -0800"}
