{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nSeems that no one answered this query, either...\n\nThe -ar parameter is a bit tricky, as it's proper setting requires\nknowing the ratio between the scene octree size (which you can get from\nthe octree with getinfo -d) and the smallest important details, which\nonly the scene author knows.  Divide the former by the latter, and this\nwill give you a reasonable value for -ar.  For example, if \"getinfo -d\nscene.oct\" gives you:\n\nscene.oct: -123.8831 -.00315 -202.67102 431.0032\n\nthen the last number (431.0032) is your scene cube size.  Dividing this\nnumber by the thickness of one of your cushions, say 3.75, you get\nabout 115, which is what you should set for -ar.\n\nSetting -ar 0 sometimes helps but usually does not.  In your scene, I\nthink increasing -ad would also help, and this is almost always a good\nidea when you are seeing artifacts in the indirect calculation.\nIncrease -ad first, then -as, then try increasing -ar, finally decrease\n-aa.  This is the order I do things in, and you can usually find a good\nplace for these settings with a little experimentation.  If you don't\nlike waiting for each run to finish, try rendering a lower resolution\nimage of just the problem area in your scene, like the seat cushions in\nyours.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: -ar parameters", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<03129A59-E1B7-11D7-951D-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun, 7 Sep 2003 21:43:37 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: -ar parameters"}
