You will get the better performance\nout of the CPU that's supported better by your virtualisation\nsoftware. In the case of Virtual PC I'd guess it makes no\ndifference at all.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance and Photosynthesis", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8577CB2E-74A0-49B3-90C0-0AF1757AA1EE@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<58E15A7AECA742499E0D566C95B03BD2061BB5F6@ex-be01.burohappold.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jul  1 14:12:33 2008", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance and Photosynthesis"}
