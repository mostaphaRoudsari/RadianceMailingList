Actually, if you have the\nRendering with Radiance book and tutorials, you can simply follow those\nand you will see how it all comes together.  Once you get used to the\nlack of menus, you will actually find it quite liberating, since you\nwill discover that Radiance is a box of tools waiting to be told what to\ndo for you.  You can use scripts to create various rendering and\ncalculation engines that can produce a lot of useful data.\n\nGood luck, and be sure and use this list (and the archives) as a\nresource for your explorations with Radiance.  I've been using the\nsoftware regularly for seven years now and still haven't scratched the\nsurface.  Have fun!\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance in Ubuntu", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<48729DF2.7010900@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<d5d7d3120807071510h46862434m6f1b220a339b6662@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Jul  7 15:51:37 2008", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Installing Radiance in Ubuntu"}
