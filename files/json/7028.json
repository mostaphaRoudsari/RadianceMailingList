If it does, then it breaks it into triangles.  Once it looks at the triangles, it then sees if the normals actually require interpolation or not.  If they don't, then it doesn't specify a texture, but they still get output as triangles.\n\nIs it a problem?  Just take off the normals if it is.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2rad splitting planar surfaces?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 12:12:49 -0700"}
