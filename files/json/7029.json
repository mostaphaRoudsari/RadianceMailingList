It does matter--these surfaces are going to be\nused by mkillum.  Using -f fixes the problem, and here I am embarassed\nthat I didn't figure it out in the first place.\n\nOh, well.  At least I learned a bit more about debugging Radiance.\n\nRandolph\n\nOn 2012-03-22 19:12:49 +0000, Greg Ward said:\n\n\n\n--\nRandolph M.
