To measure glare, one needs to establish\nthe projection of the lens that is used. I've measured this for the\nSigma 4.5mm that I'm using. While googling around for 'fisheye\nprojections', I've come across this rather interesting paper:\n\nAlmost a Century of \"Imaging\" Clouds Over the Whole-Sky Dome.\nMcGuffe, K.; Henderson-Sellers, A.\nBulletin of the American Meteorological Society, vol. 70, Issue 10,\npp.1243-1253\n\nPDF at:\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0477(1989)070%3C1243%3AAACOCO%3E2.0.CO%3B2\n\nIt has a pretty good list of references, too.\n\nBefore digital photography and computer-based image processing, cloud\ndetection was done by human observers. In order to obtain the best\npossible contrast, black and white photographs were enhanced with red\nfilters. This is something that you might want to look at with you\nRadiance approach. It looks as if some of the references in that paper\nmight give some insight into auto-detecting clouds, but I have not\nfollowed them up.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed, 04 Apr 2012 00:08:16 +0100"}
