{"body": "\n\nI do not know the parameters you used, but 0,0,0 means that most\nprobably you have no ambient calculation. As most parts of your room\nwill receive only indirect illumination, this will result in zero. Try\nsetting -ab to 2. To understand the effect of -ab for your scene, render\nimages of your room using -ab 0, -ab 1, -ab 2, -ab 3 with -av set to 0 0\n0 for all renderings. You should see only a bright splotch of (direct)\nsunlight for -ab 0, and increasing luminances for the areas receiving\nreflected light with higher -ab bounces. Try it!\n\nAlso make sure to measure illuminance slighty OVER the plane - if you\nare INSIDE geometry we all do not know what you will get for illuminance...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] the reference illuminance?", "sender": "Lars O.
