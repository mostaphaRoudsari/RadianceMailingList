{"body": "\nhappy to see other italian using radiance\n\nsome things:\n\n1) the circular shape that you can see is an artefact due to low settings\n(try with aa .25, ad 128, as 64 and increase ar to 32... not so good but\nbetter? try again with aa=0, ad=8 as=0 and ab= 2.... some noise but no white\nspot!... and many other combinations)\n\n2) if you are interested in simulating ray bouncing from metal surface to\nthe wall as specular reflections... you should try pmap (look for photon\nmapping radiance and you will see).\n\n3) if you want to try pmap, probably you will need radiance 3.4 or 3.5 or\n3.2 but these are for linux (or Apple!)... or cygwin....\n\n4) oops... you can also use -dr parameter to enable virtual sources\ncalculation.... but with mirror and not with metal. watch out the normal of\nthe surface.\n\n\ngood luck!\ng.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 04 September 2003 14:25\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHi, I'm an Italian student and I'm using Desktop Radiance in order to\nsimulate an external wall enlighted by sun reflection upon a rectangular\nsteel surface.\nI can't understand why the reflection on the wall has a shape similar to a\ncircumference instead of a rectangle.\nI enclose what I did and I hope some of you could give me a suggestion.\nThanks.\n\nAlessandro Bizzarri.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFiltri antispamming e antivirus per la tua casella di posta\nhttp://www.msn.it/msn/hotmail\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "ginonetto@hotmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F90302D9D@l-gnts05>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 4 Sep 2003 16:14:22 +0100", "email": "Alessandro Bizzarri", "subject": "[Radiance-general] sun reflection upon a rectangular steelsurface"}
