This allows time for the sync file to be updated without contention between processes.  This is what I do in rad with the -N option.  I actually wait 10 seconds between each new rpiece process.\n\nThis isn't to say that I understand the source of your error, which still puzzles me.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120409/0e769763/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4F834A8B.7020704@visarc.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 9 Apr 2012 14:52:47 -0700"}
