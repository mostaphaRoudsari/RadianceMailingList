Perhaps a different topic at this point not\nsure as this is more about clusters, radiance and rpiece. Another\nproblem that I encountered with using rpiece on my cluster was sometimes\nthe time tiles/pieces would get written into the image in the wrong\nplace when using stock rpiece. My solution if I remember correctly was\nto customize rpiece so that each running instance of rpiece would write\nout its pieces each to their image file. These would all then get\nassembled as a post process. I think my idea behind this was to take\nadvantage of the functionality that rpiece does offer.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 4/11/2012 1:04 PM, Andy McNeil wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120411/51f92c91/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<995E2963-96E2-48C4-BC7E-C89FD5EF32B7@lbl.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed, 11 Apr 2012 13:22:52 -0400"}
