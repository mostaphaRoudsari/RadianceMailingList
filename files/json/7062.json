You may or may not see a difference by adding\n\"-fomit-frame-pointer\". You may also see a difference by using\nthe gcc 4.6 compilers instead of any earlier versions. 4.6 seems\nto impart a 5% advantage over even gcc 4.4.\n\nBut like Jack mentioned, these compiler options can, at best,\ngive you incremental performance improvements. Whenever I have\nreal work to do, I always use rpiece and a script similar to the\n\"runsmp\" that is in the bench4.tar.gz.\n\nIf you have the results from some of your tests, I'd like to put\nthem on the Radiance benchmark page.\n\nMark\n\nOn Sat, 7 Apr 2012, Iebele wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Optimizing Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 11:58:17 -0400 (EDT)"}
