So let the script end as\n\n(...)\n| total -if3 -m\n\nAnd remove the backslash and the last line. I am assuming that you have\nset equal values in all channels (R=G=B in all source, material\ndefinitions).\n\nUnfortunately, especially for small light sources of high intensity, you\nmust set a rather high sampling density N not to miss out important\nsources. The script sends out rays to random directions, other then\nRadiance's integrated direct calculation which keeps a list of sources\nwith known locations to check.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Spherical sensor", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
