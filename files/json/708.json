Again 13 images (same room, scene was a bit different as I\neliminated the sky in the framing) and I was able to compute a hdr. But the\nalignment problem still persists, I use the -a switch to turn it off.\n\nLater I took a couple more images and used the calibration data to compute a\nhdr and read the luminance values off it. It turns out that those are\nsomewhat accurate so that's a good sign!\n\nHowever, I'm still not quite satisfied. Obviously, the calibration procedure\nis meant to give a most accurate static description of the camera, but I used\nthe camera's automatic whitebalance correction, so that's a variable. My\nquestion is a complete novice one: how does the whitebalance affect the\nluminance? What can I do to eliminate this variable (if it is significant).\n\n\nMartin\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrg", "tags": [], "sender": "Martin Matusiak", "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 14:18:26 2004"}
