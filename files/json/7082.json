They could cause completely wrong results, especially with its\nuse together with gen_dgp_profile (within Daysim and DIVA). So I\nstrongly recommend to use the v1.04 version (or the old 0.9f) -\n\nIt should compile now also under MAC - those users should add the\n-fnested-functions to the flags.\n\n\nBest,\n\nJan\n\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
