{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nDoes any of you wants to share an example of rpiece, using multiple (say 4) processes on a single machine, sharing 1 ambient file, resulting in 1 single image?\n\nThe manpage gives this example:\n\ngoober% echo 1 8 > syncfile\ngoober% echo -F syncfile -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf view -o picture octree > args\ngoo1ber% rpiece @args &\n\nHow do I let rpiece run 4 processes simultaneous? Just run 4 processes in the background?\nHow does an ambient file works using rpiece? Do I just need one, or as many as there are \"pieces\"?\nWhere are temporary files stored, so I can check their progress?\n\n-Iebele\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080723/2ca029b5/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpiece question", "sender": "iebele", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BFFB9B66BE704397B98ABEBAF87615EB@PC4Core>", "refs": ["<001a01c8ebb7$808065e0$3b00a8c0@Jiten>", "<A9423696-E14C-475F-9FE2-FB95B5DCB205@arcor.de>"], "datetime": "Wed Jul 23 14:37:42 2008", "email": "info at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpiece question"}
