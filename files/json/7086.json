So treat trans results with some degree of caution.\n\nIf you want to include fresnell effects and diffusion, you might consider use a glass surface and a trans surface one in front of the other.  Or you could generate a BSDF and use the new BSDF material.\n\nHope this helps,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 27, 2012, at 1:34 PM, Valeria De Giuli wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<FF64C124-E5C3-40CF-9B99-C15140D5E9D5@gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 14:31:14 -0700"}
