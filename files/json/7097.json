This\nwill benefit users of the OpenStudio SDK and applications, as well as\nanyone interested in using the powerful raytracing software but reluctant\nto learn how to compile code.\n\nWorking with Greg Ward and Kitware, we have modified the Radiance source\ntree to allow us to build Radiance easily for Windows, Mac, and Linux. We\nOffer installers of the latest (HEAD) release, and we will update these\nevery\ntwo weeks. These installers also include a GUI version of rvu (that also\nruns on Windows!). Instructions for downloading and installing these\npackages\ncan be found at the following page:\n\nopenstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\nWe hope these prove useful for many in the Radiance and general building\nsimulation communities.\n\nWe will add instructions for using the CMake build system on your own\nsystems soon.\n\nHappy raytracing!\n\n- Rob\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Tue, 1 May 2012 10:23:43 -0600"}
