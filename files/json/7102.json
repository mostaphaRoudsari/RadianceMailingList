Please see the application event log or use the command-line\nsxstrace.exe tool for more detail.*\n\nI also tried to remove all paths related to other Radiance installations\nfrom PATH and RAYPATH varialbes, but still getting the same error message.\n\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120503/e099fd77/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<jnp53l$m32$1@dough.gmane.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Thu, 3 May 2012 09:53:26 +0200"}
