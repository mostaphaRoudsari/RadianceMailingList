I checked both the zip archive & the NSIS installer. I can't even run them myself as I have VS 2010 not VS 2008.\n\nYou'll either need to build from source or wait for a release build to be made available.\n\n[Description: IES]<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\nPalbinder Sandher\nSoftware Platform Engineer\n\nT:\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8500\n\nF:\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8501\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\n\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.

Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.\n\nI also tried to remove all paths related to other Radiance installations from PATH and RAYPATH varialbes, but still getting the same error message.\n\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120503/22c17650/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 2684 bytes\nDesc: image001.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120503/22c17650/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAAZQWqihTvVBeFSBnE85RQdAGB_kPh6hf4PK6Fa2Ngn1ZmAujA@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "maricanis at gmail.com", "datetime": "Thu, 3 May 2012 09:30:44 +0000"}
