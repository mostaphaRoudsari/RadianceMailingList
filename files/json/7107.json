I have created a release Windows package this morning; I just need the website admin to post it and I'll let y'all know when it's up. Following that announcement, we should definitely move all discussion about this project to the dev list.\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\nOn 5/3/12 3:30 AM, \"Pally Sandher\" <pally.sandher at iesve.com<mailto:pally.sandher at iesve.com>> wrote:\n\nThe 4.2.a release appears to contain debug binaries which will only work on a system with Visual Studio 2008 installed (has a dependency on MSVCR90D.DLL which is the debug version of the VC++ 9.0 runtimes). I checked both the zip archive & the NSIS installer. I can?t even run them myself as I have VS 2010 not VS 2008.\n\nYou?ll either need to build from source or wait for a release build to be made available.\n\n[cid:image001.jpg at 01CD2915.EDB72FF0]<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\nPalbinder Sandher\nSoftware Platform Engineer\n\nT:\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8500\n\nF:\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8501\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\n\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.

Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.\n\nI also tried to remove all paths related to other Radiance installations from PATH and RAYPATH varialbes, but still getting the same error message.\n\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 2684 bytes\nDesc: image001.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120503/52892c66/attachment.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<A7E25FADF831E94DBBD5904D7E5848650DF741@GL-EXC-01.iesve.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "maricanis at gmail.com", "datetime": "Thu, 3 May 2012 09:49:15 -0600"}
