Since hdrgen (and Photosphere) compute the responses for\neach of the RGB channels, using a lot of colorful patch samples can\nskew the result.  I've never seen such an extreme example before,\nthough -- most walls are off-white so this hadn't come up.  Come to\nthink of it, the tendency of cameras to super-saturate their colors\ncould spell trouble in such cases, and I probably should modify my\nalgorithm to avoid colorful patch samples.\n\nThanks for the image set -- I'll run some experiments on my end to see\nif I can improve on this.  It is important to fix the white balance\nwhenever you take an HDR sequence, as the camera in auto white mode\nwill alter the coefficients between exposures otherwise, making it\nimpossible to get a consistent result.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrg", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 17:09:24 2004"}
