I would like to use a brightfunc with a cal-file that returns a value depending on an environment variable set by a script. I want the evaluation based on that variable to happen at render time, so I cannot use sed to modify my files directly. I tried to use command expansion (third line of my brightdata as ! echo \"1 $ALPHA\"), but that does not work. I could generate the whole modifier definition by an echo command (!echo \"void brightdata myBDModifier ? 1 $ALPHA), but that would become an ugly scene file?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
