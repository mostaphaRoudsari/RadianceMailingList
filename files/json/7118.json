Martin refers to) is better called cubical illuminance; the\nscript Greg shared with Minki (thanks as always, Greg!) allows to sample\na full sphere in one go.\n\n\n\nI think I have my ideas a lot clearer now, I'll just need to implement\neither one of the approaches.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: 08 May 2012 12:52\nTo: 'Radiance general discussion'\n\n\n\nHi Giovanni,\n\n\n\nthat is called spherical illuminance. As an approximation, you could\ncalculate 6 illuminance values (up, down, East, West, North, South) and\naverage them. Christopher Cuttle wrote a few papers on spherical\nilluminance.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nMartin Moeck\n\nOSRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2012 1:42 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nDear list,\n\n\n\nI have question that I hope you'll help get my head around.\n\nI want to calculate the overall illuminance on a point in space that is,\nregardless of directionality.\n\nI have made some simplified 2d sketches for clarity.\n\nAs I understand a radiance sensor point in rtrace will have cosine\nrelated sensitivity (image01)\n\nIf I am to place two coincident with opposing normals (image2) I'll miss\non contributions from the sides.\n\nRotating the normals by 90 degrees at a time (figure 3) and summing\ncontributions might not work either because will overestimate diagonal\ncontributions (figure 4 ).\n\nSo I'm not getting too much closer to the solution...\n\n\n\nIs there something that I am missing here?\n\nAny light on this will be appreciated,\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nGiovanni Betti\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120508/239877b5/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<F26DB3928A041843B352BA7F4307A46141B555CDA5@EXC-MCHVS12.mch.osram.de>", "tags": [], "sender": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "datetime": "Tue, 8 May 2012 14:16:33 +0100"}
