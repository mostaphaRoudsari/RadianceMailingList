{"body": "\n\n\nThe problem is that while adding such modifiers should be rather easy,\nthey would break consistency in a couple of places. E.g. imagine a scene\nusing a colorpict_xz modifier. Everything would be fine - until you run\nxform to rotate the scene. Xform would have to replace the optimized\nmodifier now. And having two ways to do the same is always a mess to\nsupport. So I guess the rather few cases where this is needed do not\nrectify the trouble one would introduce in that case.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures", "sender": "Lars O.
