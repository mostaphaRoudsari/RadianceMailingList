I think it's\nbecause you don't have enough unsaturated pixels in your scene for it\nto work, but I'll have to perform some more experiments to determine\nthat for certain.  For now, you'll just have to find a more \"neutral\"\nscene to perform your calibration on, then save the response function\nand reuse it for other scenes, which is what I've been doing.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Fwd: errors from hdrg", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Jun 11 18:18:58 2004"}
