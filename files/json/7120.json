You could write a little script with rcalc, python or octave.\n\nI guess Andy or Greg would do all in one line with sed / awk :-)\n\n\n\nOnce done you could have polar maps of your illuminance component, directionality of lighting in the space, etc etc.\n\n\n\nTo start playing with the idea you could do as Mark is suggesting, 6 illuminance values are  good as you could easily plot the vector illumiannce to visualise the directionality of lighting.\n\nThis is an useful metrics for museums.\n\n\n\nEither way, have fun!\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 8 May 2012, at 14:16, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Martin, Minki,\n\n\n\nThanks for the replies, I guess what I was trying to calculate (and to whom dr. Martin refers to) is better called cubical illuminance; the script Greg shared with Minki (thanks as always, Greg!) allows to sample a full sphere in one go.\n\n\n\nI think I have my ideas a lot clearer now, I'll just need to implement either one of the approaches.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: 08 May 2012 12:52\nTo: 'Radiance general discussion'\n\n\nHi Giovanni,\n\n\n\nthat is called spherical illuminance. As an approximation, you could calculate 6 illuminance values (up, down, East, West, North, South) and average them. Christopher Cuttle wrote a few papers on spherical illuminance.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nMartin Moeck\n\nOSRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2012 1:42 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nDear list,\n\n\n\nI have question that I hope you'll help get my head around.\n\nI want to calculate the overall illuminance on a point in space that is, regardless of directionality.\n\nI have made some simplified 2d sketches for clarity.\n\nAs I understand a radiance sensor point in rtrace will have cosine related sensitivity (image01)\n\nIf I am to place two coincident with opposing normals (image2) I'll miss on contributions from the sides.\n\nRotating the normals by 90 degrees at a time (figure 3) and summing contributions might not work either because will overestimate diagonal contributions (figure 4 ).\n\nSo I'm not getting too much closer to the solution...\n\n\n\nIs there something that I am missing here?\n\nAny light on this will be appreciated,\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nGiovanni Betti\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120509/d44d9e50/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<03A34276-0F18-4CF4-8BE6-30D0B11F9BB3@yahoo.it>", "tags": [], "sender": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "datetime": "Wed, 9 May 2012 09:57:38 +0100"}
