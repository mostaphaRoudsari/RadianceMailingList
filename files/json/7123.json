A light signature of a space/point couple.\nBut there is a lot to fiddle around for probably just a cool visualisation.\nAh those were the times?.\nIf I just had the time now :-)\nG\n\n\nOn 9 May 2012, at 09:57, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120509/bbeab790/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C308CFCF1D@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "tags": [], "sender": "giulio antonutto", "datetime": "Wed, 9 May 2012 21:32:03 +0100"}
