When I visualize an octree with rvu I usually set -av and -ab as first parameters.\nAs far as I understand, the \"ambient value\" should set the brightness of the scene, but I don't see any change by setting it to different values, and to get a nice image I usually use the -pe option to set the exposure.\nCould you please enlighten me on the usage of \"ambient vale\" option to get a good exposure in my images?\n\nThanks,\nStefano\n\n--\n\nStefano Moret\nCalifornia Lighting Technology Center<http://cltc.ucdavis.edu/>\nUniversity of California, Davis\n633 Pena Drive\nDavis, CA 95618\n\n530-747-3846\nsmoret at ucdavis.edu<mailto:smoret at ad3.ucdavis.edu>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120515/ecc9ca76/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Stefano Moret", "datetime": "Tue, 15 May 2012 00:47:04 +0000"}
