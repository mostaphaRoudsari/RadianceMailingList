{"body": "\n\nGreg hi,\n\nI got curious now when I hear about eliminating such calculations. As\nfar as I know, I alsways have to at least rotate anything mapped that I\nwant to appear on a non-horizontal surface. I can avoid scaling,\nmirroring etc by applying these tranforms to the images using image\nprocessing tools such as those coming with radiance. But for avoiding\nthe rotation, I do not see a way (besides rotating the whole model with\nlight sources and views instead of the images if e.g. I want to map most\nonto a vertical plane). So did you mean something like that when saying\n\"eliminating such calls\", or were you thinking about structuring them\nmore efficient?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures", "sender": "Lars O.
