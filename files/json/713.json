{"body": "\nAdding my 2 cents to what Rob said...\n\nPfilt is an important part of the rendering process, performing\nanti-aliasing necessary to reduce the appearance of sampling noise and\nartifacts.  The output from pfilt is generally the one you want to save\nor archive.  Exposure adjustment is really a very minor function to\npfilt, and is completely reversible.\n\nPcond is specifically for preparing the output for display or printing,\nand the resulting file should probably not be saved, or if it is, the\ninput given to pcond should not be deleted.  This is because, unlike\npfilt, the exposure adjustment pcond does is not reversible.  Often, I\nsend the output of pcond directly to ra_tiff or another image\nconverter, since pcond brings the entire dynamic range of the original\ninto the 0-1 limits of most formats and displays.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Sequence for using pfilt and pcond", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<82681B7E-F447-11D7-BAC3-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 1 Oct 2003 12:43:19 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Sequence for using pfilt and pcond"}
