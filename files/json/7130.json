{"body": "\nHi Iebele,\n\nOne of the slowest things in Radiance is the .cal file evaluations,\nso minimizing expression evaluations is the key to faster renderings\nin this case.  Having many surfaces for each ray, all having function\nevaluations, is bound to be slow.  Combining or eliminating such\ncalls would help a lot.  I don't know enough about your situation to\nrecommend \"how.\"\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<29549F7B-CA89-4677-9D3A-CD22C652DAE3@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<d5d7d3120807261524n5522585dp218c832d7078ec67@mail.gmail.com>", "<756BE29B-A4B1-4BA5-91DF-990D0184E698@lmi.net>", "<9C75DB7C51A54E9DAC5A99A13B174083@PC4Core>"], "datetime": "Sun Jul 27 15:35:08 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures"}
