You could just run your images through one of those tools and they would select a good exposure for each image.\n\nrpict -ab ... mymodel.oct > image.hdr\npfilt image.hdr > exposureadjusted_image.hdr\nor\npcond image.hdr > humanvision_image.hdr\n\nIf you want all your images to use the same exposure, you can use pfilt with a single pass (-1) and set exposure with \"-e\".  In this case, I'd suggest having separate render and post process scripts so you can easily change the exposure - it might require a bit of fiddling to find a single exposure that gives decent results for all images.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn May 15, 2012, at 4:07 PM, Stefano Moret wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120515/4437c841/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rvu exposure setting", "tags": [], "sender": "Andy McNeil", "datetime": "Tue, 15 May 2012 16:32:06 -0700"}
