{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI have a model with about 40.000 polygons, each textured with a mostly\ntransparant image (only about 1% of the texture is visable). Seen from the\nrendering viewpoint the polygons in the model overlap quite a lot, so one\nray might have to \"look\" through about 50 \"transparant\" polygons or even\nmore before actually \"see\" something. I think this is why this particular\nmodel renders amazingly slow, even with -ab set to 0, -st 0 and -lr 1. Is\nthere another parameter in control that might speed up the rendering in such\ncase?\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\nvoid plastic material_17999\n0 0 5\n0.757813 0.773438 0.753906\n0.01 0.01\n\nmaterial_17999 colorpict colormap_17999\n7 noneg noneg noneg ./D2P_0595.pic tmesh.cal u v\n0\n7\n2\n-0.01410693     0.02148561   -19.61004639\n-0.00179046    -0.00117557     3.75267568\n\nvoid mixpict transmap_17999\n7 colormap_17999 void green\n./a_D2P_0595.pic tmesh.cal u v\n0\n7\n2\n-0.01410693     0.02148561   -19.61004639\n-0.00179046    -0.00117557     3.75267568\n\ntransmap_17999 polygon polygon_17999\n0 0 9\n634.194214 1375.645264 90.465210\n655.547729 1343.122681 90.465210\n1045.819336 1599.365479 90.465210\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures", "sender": "iebele", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<9C75DB7C51A54E9DAC5A99A13B174083@PC4Core>", "refs": ["<d5d7d3120807261524n5522585dp218c832d7078ec67@mail.gmail.com>", "<756BE29B-A4B1-4BA5-91DF-990D0184E698@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Sun Jul 27 15:29:50 2008", "email": "info at iebele.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Slow rendering with transparant textures"}
