A user\npointed out to us that the essential files in ray/src/cal/cal were not\nmaking it into the installation directory -- apologies all around. Greg\nWard also made a recent change to one of the MGF converters, so that code\nchange is reflected in all of the packages as well. You can find all of\nNREL's Radiance package offerings at:\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia\nnce\n\nTrace on, people.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nCommercial Buildings Research Group - Tools Section\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Wed, 16 May 2012 14:19:53 -0600"}
