Even with -n 1, it can fail if you only give it an image that's a couple of hundred pixels in size.  I don't think the other converters are so constrained.  You could use ra_bmp which does tone-mapping also, or ra_t8 if you really want an 8-bit image.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120517/367f0761/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ra_gif: out of memory error", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 17 May 2012 08:24:56 -0700"}
