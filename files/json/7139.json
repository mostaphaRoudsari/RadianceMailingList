The 4.1 version of pflip needs the input file on the command line, so it can seek on it for the -v option.  While technically not necessary for the -h option by itself, this is how I wrote it figuring it was not worth the effort for the corner case of someone wanting on pflip -h to read from stdin.\n\nI have modified the code and uploaded a new version that works in your scenario.  I will e-mail you the C file separately.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD83LVJ1id5WafNoGzw1p+LhjkYLqHhem84U9mpOBeyfoFF8fw@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 17 May 2012 11:03:29 -0700"}
