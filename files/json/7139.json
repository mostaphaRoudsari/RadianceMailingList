{"body": "\nHi Jack,\n\nYes, it would be helpfull to have acces to the individual pieces.\nIf you want to share your hack, I would be very pleased with that.\n\n-Iebele\n\n----- Original Message -----\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nCc: iebele\nSent: Thursday, July 24, 2008 3:22 PM\n\nHi Iebele,\n\nAll the \"pieces\" get written out into the file specified by the -o option. So there are no individual image pieces if that makes sense.\n\nTo avoid some issues relating to speed of file locking for rpiece jobs shared over multiple compute nodes (such as in a cluster with a shared nfs server), I have actually hacked rpiece so that it will in fact write out the individual pieces as image files. These can then be assembled into the final image after the fact. I am willing to make this available if there is interest.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\niebele wrote:\nThanks Jack,\nA brief question in line in return...\n\nI underestand that the -o option sets the final image.\nBut where can I find the temporary files , i.e. the \"pieces\" ?\n\n-Iebele\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nSent: Thursday, July 24, 2008 12:17 AM\n\nThanks Jack,\nA brief question in line in return...\n\nLastly you can do a pfilt on the unfinished image and view the results to visually see things. Files will be stored as you desire, so it is up to you to organize things the way you want.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080724/d32185bb/attachment-0001.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rpiece question", "sender": "iebel", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1D5EE6B2B65C4B81954410D1CBB9156A@PC4Core>", "refs": ["<395F54E5A1BE4C57963B6EEDC833CE92@PC4Core>", "<48888209.3060503@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jul 24 07:07:06 2008", "email": "iebele", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] rpiece question"}
