{"body": "\nThanks for the info Rob and Greg\n\nOne thing that I have questioned though is whether it would be better to use\npfilt only for anti-aliasing and filtering and leave exposure adjustment\nonly to pcond if I am dealing with a high dynamic range scene. The way I\nunderstand it* is that pfilt uses a 2 pass method (by default) to properly\nexpose the image. The way I am reading into this is that pfilt in a way\ncorrects the exposure of the picture output by rpict. To use pcond after\npfilt essentially rexposes the exposed picture. Would it be better to use a\nfiltered but unexposed picture as an imput to pcond?\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n* I am only a layman (higher than a newbie but not an expert) so take this\nstatement with a grain of salt :>)\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet MSN 8 Dial-up Internet Service FREE for one month.
