{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nI generally don't use the -2 option of pfilt for computing the\nexposure, even though it's the default.  I generally know the exposure\ncorrection for my scene by the time I reach the filtering stage, so I\njust set it explicitly with the -1 and -e options.  This is what rad\ndoes as well when you specify an EXPOSURE= value (as you should).\n\nIn either case, the exposure that's set by pfilt is completely\nreversible and doesn't affect the time taken or output produced by\npcond.  As a side note, using pcond without the -h option is pretty\nmuch the same as displaying the image with ximage -e auto.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Sequence for using pfilt and pcond", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8F675CCC-F452-11D7-8896-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed, 1 Oct 2003 14:02:26 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Sequence for using pfilt and pcond"}
