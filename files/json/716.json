{"body": "\nVote YES!!!! for ISO image for 2003 Radiance Workshop CDROM to be available\nonline.\n\nMany of the readers of the valuable Radiance On-line forum were\nunfortunately not able to attend the workshop. I for one would like to keep\na copy of the CDROM so that I can view/read the material whilst\noff-line/remote from the internet.\n\nOn another issue, I see new prints of the Rendering with Radiance book were\nbeing distributed to the participants of the workshop. Are there any plans\nfor a reprint being made for wider distribution?\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987\nPerth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<A2B098B4E624D511BED900508BB92A57078CDF44@exmsb02.curtin.edu.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2003 10:01:03 +0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Online availability of conference CD-ROM?"}
