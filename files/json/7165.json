{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\nThis sounds good, thanks a lot! Although I'd suggest for your own safety\n(please note that I'm not a lawyer...) to\n- require that the copyright information is kept in the files\n- require that the *license* is not removed from the source. At the\nmoment you're alloweing me to share the files without any license\ninformation...\n- add a disclaimer which tells people that they can't sue you if your\nsoftware fucked up their system.. or so. Although I'm not a lawyer and\ndon't know if you need that or now, in my optinion it's better to have it.\n\nWhile I appreciate free licenses, I'd still suggest to stick with a\nlicense like the one radiance uses (which is the older BSD license) or,\nif you're looking for a really free one, use the ISC license.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license\n\n\nAnd the other question is: Does Greg want to include gendaylit into\nRadiance, or would it make sense? With such a license this would be\npossible.\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nGPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaylit license", "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<48806624.80607@bzed.de>", "refs": ["<3773.144.214.86.109.1213939934.post4u@144.214.86.109>\t<48626531.3040601@bzed.de>", "<48805BEB.8000302@ise.fraunhofer.de>"], "datetime": "Fri Jul 18 02:45:21 2008", "email": "bernd at bzed.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gendaylit license"}
