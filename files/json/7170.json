The side-effect is that every pixel gets rendered, and of\ncourse you will want to run pfilt on the output in most cases.  (You can\nof course add it to the command with \"| pfilt -1 -x /3 -y /3 -r .6\"\nafter rtrace.)\n\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I suspect you are correct...\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE DROID\n\n\n\n-----Original message-----\n\n\n\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\n\nOn 2012-05-23 16:15:36 +0000, Greg Ward said:\n\ntiles using\nproblem.\n\nThe problem seems--I say cautiously--to occur on Linux systems\nand not\nBSD systems.
