It's interesting results. Last\ntime, I relied on the LCD manufacturer brightness specs or nit number to\nmodel and I was not sure whether it was a correct method.\nAdditionally, in your first image, may i know how you set the brightness\nsetting in your computer? was it in maximum/100% brightness setting?\n\nThank you,\n\n\nEddy Santosa\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 25, 2012 at 3:22 PM, Randolph M.
