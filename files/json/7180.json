Might be worth posting a link to this on the HDRI list as well.\n________________________________________\nSent: Friday, May 25, 2012 4:56 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nRandolph,\n\nThank you very much for sharing nice study. It's interesting results. Last time, I relied on the LCD manufacturer brightness specs or nit number to model and I was not sure whether it was a correct method.\nAdditionally, in your first image, may i know how you set the brightness setting in your computer? was it in maximum/100% brightness setting?\n\nThank you,\n\n\nEddy Santosa\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 25, 2012 at 3:22 PM, Randolph M.

So I did an HDR photographic study of mine.  I thought some of you might be interested, so I've put it up online.
