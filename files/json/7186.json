{"body": "\nHi, all,\n\nI'm trying to use ESP-r coupling Radiance to perform thermal integrating\ndaylight use simulation.\n\nAnd I have performed 7 days simulation with 1 hour timestep, which means I\ngot 168 illuminance numbers of one indoor test point. I find calculated\nilluminances of 6 days is basically close to the measured data. But1 day is\nexceptional, there is a big difference between calculated illuminances and\nmeaured ones. That1 day is a very clear sky because that day has a highest\ndirect and diffuse radiation of those 7days, but the measured illuminance is\nmuch lower than other six days. Anybody can tell why? and how to modifiy?\n\nThank you for your time.\nZZ\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "ZZ", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1952.144.214.86.109.1216108650.post4u@144.214.86.109>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jul 15 00:58:32 2008", "email": "qiuzhongzhu at shiep.edu.cn", "subject": "[Radiance-general] clear sky-calculated indoor illuminance is toolower than that of cloudy sky???"}
