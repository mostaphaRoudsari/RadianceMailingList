{"body": "\nThanks for the help so far everyone. But I also did get a chuckle from the\n\"double click the Radiance icon\" comment from Rob G. :)\n\nSo I think I successfully installed Radiance, because the tools seem to be\nresponding, however I can't get very far into the tutorial\n\n<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/tutorial.html>\n\nI created a text file with the exact parameters from the tutorial, but named\nroom2.rad (room.rad I messed up by opening it twice and editing while it was\nstill open elsewhere)\n\nThis is what I typed, and received from within Terminal:\n\nnick@nick-desktop:~$ oconv room2.rad > test2.oct\nnick@nick-desktop:~$ getinfo test2.oct\ntest2.oct:\n#?RADIANCE\noconv room2.rad\nFORMAT=Radiance_octree\n\nnick@nick-desktop:~$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5\ntest2.oct\nVIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan 31 2008 11:53:56)\nUnknown option argument: \"-.125\"\nMore info with: \"vim -h\"\nnick@nick-desktop:~$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -av .5 .5 .5\ntest2.oct\nVIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan 31 2008 11:53:56)\nUnknown option argument: \"-av\"\nMore info with: \"vim -h\"\nnick@nick-desktop:~$\n\nIt seems as though when I use rview, the 8th parameter (-.125 the first time\nI tried it, then for experiment's sake I took -.125 out, and then it said\n\"-av\" was unknown) produces an error.\n\nAt your suggestion, I tried \"rpict\" with the same parameters as the \"rview\"\nabove from the tutorial, and Terminal spits back hundreds of lines of\nunrecognizable characters to me. For example, this was the first line:\n\n? ? ? ? ?\u007f??\u0001\u007f? ? \u0002\u0002\u0002 ? ?\n4??????????????????'?????\n???(c)??(R)????????????????????????\u0019??????????????????(c)???????\n? ? ?\n4??????????????????'?????\n???(c)??(R)????????????????????????\u0019??????????????????(c)???????\n? ? ?\n\nAnd still, no image of a ball, \"You should start to see an image of a red\nball forming on your screen.\"\n\nWhat step am I missing or not doing, that's not in the tutorial?\n\nThanks (again) in advance for the help.\n\n-Nick Calcagni\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080713/9c48ef93/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Calcagni", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<d5d7d3120807131810w79aeb645ne98b8d58b6f81160@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Jul 13 18:10:34 2008", "email": "nac342 at drexel.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Tutorial problems (formerly \"InstallingRadiance in Ubuntu Problems\")"}
