{"body": "\nI suppose we should appeal to Peter A-B to make the ISO image of the CD\navailable online.  I don't know if there are bandwidth issues -- Peter?\n\nFor my part, I have put some snapshots from the workshop up on my\nwebsite, for those who are interested.  The URL is:\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/workshops/radiance03.html\n\nAlso, for those who downloaded Photosphere recently and are\nexperiencing crashes, there is a new version that fixes this problem\nalso on my website:\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/photosphere.tar.gz\n\nThe command-line tool for building HDR images is also available, but I\nhave only compiled it on the Mac for the moment.  I should get around\nto compiling it under Linux \"real soon now\".  (Photosphere won't be\navailable on other platforms until someone volunteers to rewrite the\nGUI.)\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/hdrgen.tar.gz\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Online availability of conference CD-ROM?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E02E7533-F4FA-11D7-8FEC-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2003 10:07:17 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Online availability of conference CD-ROM?"}
