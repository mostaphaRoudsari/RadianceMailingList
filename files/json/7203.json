It's been a few years since I've used the software, and as I recall previously it was done through a CygWin interface. Right now we are building geometry in DesignBuilder which installs Radiance on the machine, but I'm wanting to edit my rad files, materials, and create new views that DesignBuilder doesn't allow.\n\nWhat are people on Windows machines using? What problems have been encountered? Any upcoming releases that I should be aware of when choosing a software path? Including links to specific builds would also be much appreciated.\n\nApologies if this has been asked and answered - I had a look through the archives and didn't find a clear answer. Thanks in advance - I'm looking forward to hearing thoughts/comments.\n\nKind regards,\nAlex Krickx\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n________________________________\nI N T E G R A L\nGROUP\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247\nakrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>\nwww.integralgroup.com<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n_______________________________\n\n[cid:image001.png at 01CD47B5.00983480] <http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=3830399>  [cid:image002.png at 01CD47B5.00983480] <http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Integral-Group-Inc/213422145352140>  [cid:image003.png at 01CD47B5.00983480] <http://twitter.com/#!/IntegralGroupCA>  [cid:image004.png at 01CD47B5.00983480] <http://www.youtube.com/user/IntegralGroupOakland>  [cid:image006.jpg at 01CD47BE.C5F5EFC0] <http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d2733ca6/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2553 bytes\nDesc: image001.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d2733ca6/attachment-0004.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image002.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2552 bytes\nDesc: image002.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d2733ca6/attachment-0005.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image003.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2588 bytes\nDesc: image003.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d2733ca6/attachment-0006.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image004.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2893 bytes\nDesc: image004.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d2733ca6/attachment-0007.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image006.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 967 bytes\nDesc: image006.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d2733ca6/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Alex Krickx", "datetime": "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 10:41:35 -0700"}
