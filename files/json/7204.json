If any Unix users are interested in trying it out, I've checked a working version into the HEAD.  The program is (temporarily) named rcontrib, to segregate it from its predecessor, but the options and operation should be identical.  Once it's fully tested, I plan to replace the existing rtcontrib with this new version, which has been substantially redesigned.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/d3d849d0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 11:11:54 -0700"}
