Which is a big improvement.\nI am sure Robert can explain a lot better/more than me. Good luck!\n\nIn Reply to:\nsince I've used the software, and as I recall previously it was done\nthrough a CygWin interface. Right now we are building geometry in\nDesignBuilder which installs Radiance on >> the machine, but I'm wanting to\nedit my rad files, materials, and create new views that DesignBuilder\ndoesn't allow.\n\nencountered? Any upcoming releases that I should be aware of when choosing\na software path? Including links to specific builds would also be much\nappreciated.\n\nBest Guy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120611/691b57cd/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Guy Vaessen", "datetime": "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 22:51:15 +0200"}
