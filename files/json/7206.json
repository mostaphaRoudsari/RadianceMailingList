While this may not be entirely efficient use of available\nresources (Windows is still running), it is convenient enough to run\nRadiance with access to multiple cores and the ability to recompile from\nsource as updates are made. Nice to be able to flip back and forth\nbetween Linux and Windows programs for an efficient (enough) workflow,\nwithout requiring rebooting.\n\n\n\nI haven't tested Rob's OpenStudio, but it certainly seems promising\nbased on the talks from the 2011 Radiance Workshop. Compiling in Linux\ncan be difficult if you're not entirely sure what packages/dependencies\nare needed for your build. You can also download OpenStudio precompiled\nversions of Radiance if that suits your needs better.\n\n\n\nChris\n\n\n\nChris Coulter\n\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\n\nNew York, NY 10005\n\nTel: 212.334.2025\n\nDirect: 212.616.0254\n\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com\n\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n\n\n\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2012 1:42 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nHello,\n\n\n\nI'm wondering how Windows users access Radiance. It's been a few years\nsince I've used the software, and as I recall previously it was done\nthrough a CygWin interface. Right now we are building geometry in\nDesignBuilder which installs Radiance on the machine, but I'm wanting to\nedit my rad files, materials, and create new views that DesignBuilder\ndoesn't allow.\n\n\n\nWhat are people on Windows machines using? What problems have been\nencountered? Any upcoming releases that I should be aware of when\nchoosing a software path? Including links to specific builds would also\nbe much appreciated.\n\n\n\nApologies if this has been asked and answered - I had a look through the\narchives and didn't find a clear answer. Thanks in advance - I'm looking\nforward to hearing thoughts/comments.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nAlex Krickx\n\n\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n\n________________________________\n\nI N T E G R A L\n\nGROUP\n\n\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com\nwww.integralgroup.com <http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n\n_______________________________\n\n\n\n<http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=3830399>\n<http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Integral-Group-Inc/213422145352140>\n<http://twitter.com/#!/IntegralGroupCA>\n<http://www.youtube.com/user/IntegralGroupOakland>\n<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/315e5a04/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2553 bytes\nDesc: image001.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/315e5a04/attachment-0004.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image002.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2552 bytes\nDesc: image002.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/315e5a04/attachment-0005.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image003.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2588 bytes\nDesc: image003.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/315e5a04/attachment-0006.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image004.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2893 bytes\nDesc: image004.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/315e5a04/attachment-0007.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image005.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 967 bytes\nDesc: image005.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/315e5a04/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Running Radiance on Windows", "tags": [], "sender": "akrickx at integralgroup.com", "datetime": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 00:10:29 +0100"}
