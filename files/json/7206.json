{"body": "\nThere is a tool called ies2rad included in radiance, which will\ntranslate a ies-formatted distribution to a light source in Radiance.\nThe process is also described well in RwR, or in the various tutorials.\nStill, you must be careful - the orientation of some ies-distributions\nseams to be a cause for errors frequently, and you also have to make\nsure that the units in the ies-file fit those in the scene (or the\ntranslation corrects this). It is good practice to place the light\nsource, after the translation, using !xform-statements - that way you\ncan easily change them.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Plug-in ies FILE", "sender": "Lars O.
