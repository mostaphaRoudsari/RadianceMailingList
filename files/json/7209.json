I was but a middle man, really, though. But yeah, there are installers for Radiance binaries for all the major platforms available at the NREL location Guy mentioned. There are also build targets for SunOS (Thank you James) and test routines for some of the core components of Radiance. I am hoping to get a HOWTO written up here soon on using the CMake build system that is now enmeshed in the Radiance source code tree (Thank you Greg), and on adding your own systems to the Radiance dashboard, which would provide valuable feedback on how nicely Radiance plays with various systems. NREL will also be posting updated installers shortly, so look for an announcement about that here.\n\n- Rob\n________________________________________\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2012 2:51 PM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHi,\n\nTo run Radiance on Windows, Robert Guglielmetti, has developed a new package.\nYou can find it here: http://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\nThe original announcement is here:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008534.html\nThis new package has rvu for Windows.
