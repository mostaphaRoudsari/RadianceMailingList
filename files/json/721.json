At least the phrasing\nleft me with no doubt about the intended goal (I'm not at the\noffice, so I can't cite the original right now). nevertheless,\nI consider this requirement a conceptual defect in the\nspecification.\n\nThe practical result is that with asymmetric linear fixtures, the\nC0 plane will show the least interesting curve of the complete\ndataset. For this reason, many manufacturers \"cheat\". They create\ntheir files so that the width is given a larger value than the\nlength. That way, they can place the most interesting\n(asymmetric) curve in the C0 plane, without violating the letter\nof the standard (of course, they still violate its intention).\n\nMost software reading IES files knows about those tricks, and\nwill apply the necessary corrections. I do the same in Rayfront,\nbut I didn't check if ies2rad does. In either case, I don't know\nif this is the reason for the troubles described here, but it\nmight...\n\nFWIW, the Eulumdat format specifies the orientation of the C0\nplane in the sensible way, so that it will contain the most\ninteresting curve for asymmetric distributions.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file fu", "tags": [], "sender": "Georg Mischler", "datetime": "Sat Jun 12 12:49:23 2004"}
