{"body": "\nDear Group\n\nI am having an issue with OCONV and Radiance 3.5 (I think that I had the\nsame issue with V. 3.4 too). Although I am currently using binaries compiled\nfor Cygwin, I have experienced the same issue with binaries that I have\ncompiled for Linux. Usually, I use the I use binaries compiled for Desktop\nRadiance but in this situation, I would like to use the new OBJ2MESH\nutility.\n\n\nIt was my understanding that as a method of combining a scene containing\nmany individual *.rad files, we could use one single file that calls xform\nin a manner such as this:\n\n\n!xform -n (name1) file1.rad\n!xform -n (name2) file2.rad\n!xform -n (name3) file3.rad\n\n\nI have not encountered any issues with the Desktop Radiance binaries with\nthis approach but when using Radiance 3.5 (compiled for Windows or Linux), I\ncontantly get error messages that usually look like this:\n\n\nxform: cannot find file \"file1.rad\"\noconv: warning - (!xform -n name1 file1.rad): empty file\n\nCan anyone tell me what's going wrong here?\n\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus D. Jacobs\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nShare your photos without swamping your Inbox.
