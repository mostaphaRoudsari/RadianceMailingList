Usually the results of Radiance\nsimulation of illuminance levels gives a spread of lines and values\nby using colors or colored contours lines graphic representations.\nI want to ask if there is\nanyway to transform the results from a color based presentations, to\nBlack and White presentations? Transforming the usual color result\ninto greyscale presentation do not give the responding scale of grey\nvalues - for example ? red is usually the color used for high\nvalues, where once greyscaled, it gets a grey which is a middle hue\nin relation to the others.\n\nI will be very happy for an\nadvice for how to make a fit in between a color scale of values and a\ngrey scale of values for a pic result ?\n\nThank you very much!!\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/0c7d6fcc/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "david behar", "datetime": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 16:35:07 +0100 (BST)"}
