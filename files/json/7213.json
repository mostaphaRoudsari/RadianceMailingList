{"body": "\nFrancesco,\n\nThank you, I typed \"sudo apt-get install radiance\" in Terminal and it seems\nthat worked.\n\nHowever, I have no idea what to do next.\n\nI tried following the instructions on the Wiki you suggested, but it seems\nlike there are many different commands to do the same thing, and I'm not\nsure which applies to me. (However I tried all of them).\n\nBasically, after typing in \"sudo apt-get install radiance\" what do I type\nnext in order to open Radiance? (so I can start inputting the scenes from\nthe \"Rendering With Radiance\"\ntutorial).\n\nThanks,\nNick\n\nOn Mon, Jul 7, 2008 at 3:00 PM, <\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080707/0cc7e8fb/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Calcagni", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<d5d7d3120807071510h46862434m6f1b220a339b6662@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jul  7 15:10:31 2008", "email": "nac342 at drexel.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Installing Radiance in Ubuntu"}
