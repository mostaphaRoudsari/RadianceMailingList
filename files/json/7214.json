{"body": "\nHi Nick,\n\nI would suggest to start experiencing with the linux/unix terminal:\nyou'll see that you will use it quite a lot with Radiance! ;-)\n\nJust open a terminal window (Application/Terminal or Alt-F2 and type\n\"gnome-terminal\")\nand write\n\nsudo apt-get install radiance\n\nThe apt package manager downloads a precompiled radiance package, so\nthat\nyou don't have to compile or extract the Radiance binaries yourself.\n\nAlternatively you can use the Synaptic package manager, accessible\nfrom the System/Administration menu.\n\nLook for the radiance packages, and install them.\n\nThat's all! Oh well, that's just the beginning.\nThere should be some radiance examples in the /usr/share/radiance\nfolder,\nor something similar. Try to familiarise with them and buy yourself\nthe Radiance bible:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/\nhttp://tinyurl.com/67hw9r\n\nHTH.\n\nFrancesco\n\nPS: There is a relatively new Radiance wiki with some minimal\ninformation at the moment,\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php\nI hope that it grows in the future, feel free to add anything to it\nwhile\nyou are experimenting.\nCiao, F.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 53, Issue 5", "sender": "Francesco Anselmo", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BE9194A0-A9E8-4480-8A8A-4431B3C0056D@blueyonder.co.uk>", "refs": ["<20080703190025.496641165C8@smtp.mail.drexel.edu>", "<d5d7d3120807061552o1c4237ak1aaf50d5bf9a9f26@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun Jul  6 16:17:28 2008", "email": "pisuke at blueyonder.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 53, Issue 5"}
