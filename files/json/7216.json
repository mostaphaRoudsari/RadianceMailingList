It's great to get the feedback.  I've run my own (similar) tests and things look OK, but I haven't checked the data thoroughly, and I need to check corner cases, other operation modes, recovery, etc.\n\nI just checked in some more changes that improve efficiency when you have a lot of processes.  I tried it with 24 processes on my Mac Pro, and it went from 85% utilization to about 99% with these new changes.  I don't think I ever got better than 20% utilization with the original code on as many cores.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120612/57a5b966/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 10:23:47 -0700"}
