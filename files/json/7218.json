However, I am\ncurious how people are actually still finding a way to work around.\n\nWhat are you actually using as a sky model for simulations aiming at\nLEED? Just the output of gensky clear without sun? Some available\nirradiance weather data for the given march / september days as an input\nfor gensky? Anything else?\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O. Grobe", "datetime": "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 11:20:07 +0200"}
