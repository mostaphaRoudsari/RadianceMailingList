{"body": "\nHi Marcus,\n\nI had similar problems when i created models in desktop radiance, combined the scene files together manually in the method you describe, and tried to investigate the resulting scene files in DAYSIM on Linux.  Two options:\n\n1. Replace the '!xform' with '!cat', without the '-n' option.  this seems to work most of the time, but not always\n2. if all else fails, combine all the scene files into one big scene file using 'xform .... .rad >> combined.rad' on the command line.\n\nAny other advice, from someone who actually understands UNIX, is more than welcome...\nPhil.\n\n_______________________________\nPhillip Greenup\nSpecialist Engineer\nArup Australasia\nLevel 10, 201 Kent St\nSydney NSW 2000\nPh (02) 9320 9426\nFax (02) 9320 9321\n\n\nDear Group\n\nI am having an issue with OCONV and Radiance 3.5 (I think that I had the\nsame issue with V. 3.4 too). Although I am currently using binaries compiled\nfor Cygwin, I have experienced the same issue with binaries that I have\ncompiled for Linux. Usually, I use the I use binaries compiled for Desktop\nRadiance but in this situation, I would like to use the new OBJ2MESH\nutility.\n\n\nIt was my understanding that as a method of combining a scene containing\nmany individual *.rad files, we could use one single file that calls xform\nin a manner such as this:\n\n\n!xform -n (name1) file1.rad\n!xform -n (name2) file2.rad\n!xform -n (name3) file3.rad\n\n\nI have not encountered any issues with the Desktop Radiance binaries with\nthis approach but when using Radiance 3.5 (compiled for Windows or Linux), I\ncontantly get error messages that usually look like this:\n\n\nxform: cannot find file \"file1.rad\"\noconv: warning - (!xform -n name1 file1.rad): empty file\n\nCan anyone tell me what's going wrong here?\n\n\nThanks\n\nMarcus D.
