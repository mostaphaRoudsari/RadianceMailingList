This allows for daylight\nredirecting devices to push light further into a space, and more\nrecently the requirement for glare control above 500fc.\n\nMy take is that the phrase \"clear sky\" does not mean \"clear sky without\nsun\" as might be mistaken in general radiance terms. I've always assumed\nthe sun is included.\n\nNone of our submitted calculations have been questioned to date, so\nassume that this is acceptable.\nHope this helps!\n\nCheers.\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\nTel: 212.334.2025\nDirect: 212.616.0254\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tuesday, June 19, 2012 4:21 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi John,\n\nI am aware of that really nice overview. The critique of using an\nimpossible sky model is hard to question. Excluding the sun also means\nthat any technique  to make use of direct sunlight by e.g. redirecting\nit deeper from the perimeter into the building is not accounted for at\nall. So that is why I was wondering how folks doing their real-life jobs\nfor LEED are handling the problem with the current standards in mind.\n\nAnother question is whether direct sunlight, after it got redirected, is\nstill direct sunlight in LEED terms.... or whether redirected means\nindirect here and I could again include it... leaving me with a more\nmeaningful sky model (clear sky with sun, and only portions directly\nentering the used spaces being locked out assuming users would block\nthem by sunshades) accounting for redirecting facades.\n\nI am not sure wether this is too much LEED-specific for the mailing\nlist, but I was really curious how Radiance folks is working around the\nnot-so-physically-based specifications of current LEED when setting up\nsimulations.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\nhere:\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Current practice for LEED sky modelling?", "tags": [], "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "datetime": "Tue, 19 Jun 2012 14:16:07 +0100"}
