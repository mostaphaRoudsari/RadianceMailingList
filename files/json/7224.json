The Perez sky\nmodel has been shown to have problems with low sun angles but does a nice\njob otherwise, when given weather info (e.g. TMY, EPW).\n\nThe problem of course comes when you want to use these sky models in a\ndaylight coefficient approach, where the sun's luminance is spread around\nthe three nearest patches to the actual solar location. The Tregenza\nsubdivisions are way too big to make for accurate estimations. This is why\nReinhart and Bourgeois proposed the finer resolutions you get when you use\nthe -M:2 or -M:4 options in rtcontrib. -M:4 gives you over 2000 sky\npatches instead of the original 145 proposed by Tregenza. Greg, Andy, Rick\nMistrick and Eleanor Lee covered this nicely in a paper a couple years ago\nat the IES conference.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 6/19/12 9:41 AM, \"Lars O.
