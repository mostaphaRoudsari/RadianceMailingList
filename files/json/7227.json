There was a CIR that requested clarification and questioned about\nthe skymodels (Perez and CIE) and USGBC responded: that \"while this CIR\ncannot provide any specific rules for selection of the sky model to be\nused, both methodologies are acceptable as long as the applicant submits a\nnarrative explaining the methodology in the submittal.\". CIR number for\nthat one is 9/5/2008 ID# 5148.\n\nI use the same approach as Chris and, not like for energy model, I guess\nthere is no specific reviewer for daylight credit in the GBCI reviewer\nteam. I never get any clarification request regarding the simulation\nmethodology.\n\nThanks,\n\n\nEddy Santosa\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120619/fd0ed765/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Current practice for LEED sky modelling?", "tags": [], "sender": "Eddy Santosa", "datetime": "Tue, 19 Jun 2012 10:01:42 -0700"}
