{"body": "\n\n\nOn Linux systems, there already exists a command genbox. So the package\nmaintainers (I guess you use a debian or ubuntu setup?) have to rename\nthese tools (I would guess to rgenbox, rgenprism) to avoid\nunpredicteable behaviour. The source tree at radsite/radiance-online\ndoesn't reflect these changes, the documentation doesn't do it neither.\n\nActually I start to feel that the fact that a lot of radiance\ninstallations are done on Linux those days, but the tools' names do not\nhave a commen prefix or anything that would make it possible to include\nthem unchanged into any distribution, is getting more and more trouble.\nAs a rule, when encountering such problems, try to find out \"which\"\ncommand you actually call, and what it does, by running it seperately,\nnot from inside a scene description.\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080807/c6235ffa/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] !genprism and !genbox errors", "sender": "Lars O.
