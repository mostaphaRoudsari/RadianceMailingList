{"body": "\nHello,\n\nI have some questions regarding the plasdata material. I couldn' t find a documentation about it, thats why i must ask you.\nThe material definition is:\n\nvoid plasdata blue\n6 noop daten2.dat blue.cal sigma phi theta\n0\n4 0.1973 0.35612 0.6353 1\n\nThe unit of the values is (1/sr), I think no further computation is needed in this case, thats why I took the \"noop\"-Argument.\n\nthe cal-file contains only the three angles:\nsigma(x,y,z) = acos(x*Nx+y*Ny+z*Nz)*180/PI;\nphi(x,y,z) = acos( -(x*Dx+y*Dy+ z*Dz));\n\ntheta(x,y,z) = acos(Dx*Nx+Dy*Ny+Dz*Nz)*180/PI;\n\nsigma should define the angle between incoming light and surface normal, theta is the one between leaving light and normal and phi is the one between theta and sigma ... and I'm not sure, wheter the above calculation is right.\n\nThe next thing is, that I'm a little confused about  the meaning of the last argument in the last line of the plasdata material. The materials describtion says, that it is a parameter for defining specularity (?). But when I have a huge amount of reflectance data, why do i need another parameter? In which way does it influence the computation of my reflectance values? In the current material definition it is set to one because, setting it to zero I have a plastic material as it seems. How can I obtain the right value?\n\nPlease take the noob out of the dark :)\n\nCheers,\n\nUta\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080812/886d7cfd/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Uta Poppe", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000a01c8fcb1$673274b0$0200a8c0@MOBILUta>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Aug 12 12:27:21 2008", "email": "uta.poppe at yahoo.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] usage of plasdata material"}
