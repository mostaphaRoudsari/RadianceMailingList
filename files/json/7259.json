Indeed, you are correct, the issue was\nsolved temporarily buy copying coeff_perez.dat (and defangle.dat) into\n/usr/local/ray/lib\n\nNow the question is why where these files not there in the first place?\n\nMost likely user error, as i have just recently installed Radiance\nversion 4.1, and have had some issues with installing Radiance over an\nexisting version (v4.0).\n\nPerhaps in my haste during what ended up being multiple installs, i\nwas not thoroughly following the instructions here:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org:82/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1\n\n###\nMake the library files (dont forget the dot (.) before the /makeall !)\n\ncd /usr/local/ray\n./makeall library\n\nBe sure to specify /usr/local/ray/lib in the next step instead of the\ndefault /usr/local/lib/ray:\n\n\"Where do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]\" <type\n/usr/local/ray/lib - hit return>\n###\n\nShould the . . . .\n\n./makeall library\n\n. . . command place coeff_perez.dat into my /usr/local/ray/lib   ?\n\nI'll give it (the install) a try from scratch tomorrow . . .\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaylit error", "tags": [], "sender": "kyle konis", "datetime": "Thu, 28 Jun 2012 22:39:40 -0700"}
