{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI have 2 questions about the METAL material:\n\n1) What are the maximum values for \"specularity\" and \"roughness\". I would\nlike to confirm if the maximum value for specularity is 1.0 (or maybe more?)\nand if the maximum value for roughness is 0.5 (although I have found in some\nweb links that roughness values greater than 0.2 are not realistic)\n\n2) I need to create 2 metallic materials.\n\na)   The product data for the first metal is the following:\n\n-  Minimum % Total Reflectivity:    95\n-  Image Clarity:                           95\n-  % Diffuse Reflection:                 <12\n-  Specular reflictivity%:                  90\n\nI'm assuming that this material can best described as follows:\n\nvoid metal metal_1\n0\n0\n5  .95  .95  .95  .90 .10\n\nb)   The product data for the second metal is the following:\n\n-  Total Reflection %:                    94\n-  Total Reflection:                        94\n-  % Diffuse Reflection:                 80-90\n-  Specular reflictivity%:                  90\n\nI'm assuming that this material can best described as follows:\n\nvoid metal metal_2\n0\n0\n5  .94  .94  .94  .90 .85\n\n\nCould someone confirm if I'm on the right track?\n\nThank you so much in advance!\n\nBest,\n\nAdriana\n\n\n\n--\nDr. Adriana Lira-Oliver\nDDes I MDes I Barch\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080820/2b3afdb9/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Adriana Lira", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<e5da07760808201757t59ffff69kdaa13d35936dd53b@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Aug 20 17:57:55 2008", "email": "adrianalira at post.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] METAL material values"}
