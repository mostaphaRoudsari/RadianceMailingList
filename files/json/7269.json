Just add that to your MANPATH variable, and you can pull up the latest manpages from the command line. I also just discovered that groff has been ported to Windows (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/groff.htm), so I will start including the manpage subdirectory in our Windows installers as well, and you can use the groff for Windows utility to read them. I highly recommend going this route rather then printing them all out, since you'll always be up to date, and save a few sheets of paper while you're at it.  I will be rebuilding the Radiance installers here soon, because there are some new features and bug fixes that I want to get out there (as well as the manpages for Windows users). I'll post an update here when they are live.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\nOn 6/29/12 12:55 PM, \"Alex Krickx\" <akrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>> wrote:\n\nHi all,\n\nI want to download a list of all the Radiance commands to add to my library. The compiled PDFs are dated 1994 and refer to rview not rvu. Is there a more recent compilation of these commands? If not, is there anything else I should be aware of that has changed for the commands?\n\nI also downloaded the man_pages.tar.gz file with all the HTML pages of commands, but as they?re separate files printing would be much more tedious. (FYI the original link is broken http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/man_html.tar.gz)\n\nHere is the complete PDF:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/manpages.pdf\n\nAnd here is the rvu manual page dated 2004\nhttp://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rvu.pdf\n\nIf I?m going to print out 179 pages as an office reference manual, I want to make sure they?re the right ones!\n\nThanks all for the feedback so far. The knowledge contained in this community is fantastic.\n\nKind regards,\nAlex\n\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n________________________________\nI N T E G R A L\nGROUP\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247\nakrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>\nwww.integralgroup.com<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n_______________________________\n\n[cid:image001.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=3830399> [cid:image002.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Integral-Group-Inc/213422145352140>  [cid:image003.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://twitter.com/#!/IntegralGroupCA>  [cid:image004.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://www.youtube.com/user/IntegralGroupOakland> [cid:image007.jpg at 01CD55EE.0D955400] <http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2553 bytes\nDesc: image001.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120629/97e92fcc/attachment.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image002.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2552 bytes\nDesc: image002.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120629/97e92fcc/attachment-0001.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image003.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2588 bytes\nDesc: image003.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120629/97e92fcc/attachment-0002.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image004.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2893 bytes\nDesc: image004.png\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120629/97e92fcc/attachment-0003.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image007.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 967 bytes\nDesc: image007.jpg\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120629/97e92fcc/attachment.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Manual Pages", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 13:51:55 -0600"}
