{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\n\nAs I said, I used planar geometry so I could compare to the virtual\nsource result.  Rtcontrib will work with any geometry.\n\n\nI don't recall why I left the original definition in there, but the\nlater one is all that matters.  There's not a lot of sense in\nbreaking your cylinder into long polygons, as it would end up\ncreating an insane number of virtual sources.  Better to leave it as\na cylinder and use the metal type, since mirror doesn't do anything\nfor curved geometries.\n\n\nActually, I was trying to come up with a scene that would be very\ndifficult to simulate w/o rtcontrib -- if the light pipe had curved\nsurfaces, for example.  In such case, you wouldn't have been able to\nrender even a single time point if it included the sun without\nrtcontrib.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lightpipes and rtcontrib", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CC37EFB8-D75B-4063-95DD-B5C1B21576D5@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<100441490808220734q53ac87e0r6b27873563684df7@mail.gmail.com>", "<100441490808221735q28487a0cxe1688e6bf33bc223@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Aug 23 09:51:06 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Lightpipes and rtcontrib"}
