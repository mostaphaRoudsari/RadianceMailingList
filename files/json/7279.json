Much better suggestion!\n\nRegards,\nAlex\n\n\nSent: Friday, June 29, 2012 1:59 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Alex,\n\nI've just updated the pdfs of all manpages (including the compilation pdf at the top) to today's HEAD:\nhttps://radiance-online.lbl.gov:447/learning/documentation/manual-pages/manual-pages\n\nBut I recommend Rob's suggestion.  It's much easier to type 'man genskyvec' than it is to get out the binder and flip to the page you need.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 29, 2012 at 11:55 AM, Alex Krickx <akrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>> wrote:\nHi all,\n\nI want to download a list of all the Radiance commands to add to my library. The compiled PDFs are dated 1994 and refer to rview not rvu. Is there a more recent compilation of these commands? If not, is there anything else I should be aware of that has changed for the commands?\n\nI also downloaded the man_pages.tar.gz file with all the HTML pages of commands, but as they're separate files printing would be much more tedious. (FYI the original link is broken http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/man_html.tar.gz)\n\nHere is the complete PDF:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/manpages.pdf\n\nAnd here is the rvu manual page dated 2004\nhttp://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rvu.pdf\n\nIf I'm going to print out 179 pages as an office reference manual, I want to make sure they're the right ones!\n\nThanks all for the feedback so far. The knowledge contained in this community is fantastic.\n\nKind regards,\nAlex\n\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n________________________________\nI N T E G R A L\nGROUP\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247<tel:510%20663%202070%20x%20247>\nakrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>\nwww.integralgroup.com<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n_______________________________\n\n<http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=3830399>\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120702/269f4ac6/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Manual Pages", "tags": [], "sender": "amcneil at lbl.gov", "datetime": "Mon, 2 Jul 2012 08:23:28 -0700"}
