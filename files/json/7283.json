{"body": "\nRadiance whizzes,\n\nI've upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, so, naturally, I found a scene that\nneeds all that space. The rpict is eats up 4.6 GB initially, but\neven with \"-aa 0\" (turns off ambient caching, right?) I am still\nseeing my VIRT and RES memory sizes growing. They are at 5.3 GB\nafter only 10 minutes of rendering. I am worried that I will not\nbe able to render high-resolution images of this scene now. How\ncan I prevent this?\n\nFYI: the scene is composed of a sky and 407 \"instance\"s of\nseparately-compiled octrees, each with 20k-100k primitives.\n\nMark\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809010025380.11715@joust.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Aug 31 21:31:06 2008", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rpict memory usage keeps increasing with -aa 0"}
