You can use rvu or rpict to render surfaces. You might want to check the manual pages of rvu and rpict to learn how to use them.\n\nThe broken X connection might have nothing to to do with your Radiance install. Have you successfully used other X11 programs? If not, you might want to run another X11 program, if that gives you the same error, or not, we're happy to help you solve it. For example, try to run the 'xclock' or 'xeyes' on your mac's X11 terminal (not terminal), and report to us what's happening.\n\nMy best,\n\n- iebele\n\n\n\nOp 4 jul. 2012, om 19:49 heeft Michael Bannert het volgende geschreven:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120705/2316471d/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<889C1F1F-BE59-4EE7-A1D5-6714DD188964@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>", "tags": [], "sender": "Iebele", "datetime": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 01:21:04 +0300"}
