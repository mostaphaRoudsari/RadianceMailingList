I vaguely\nremember simple skylights like in Walmart performing better than roof\nmonitors with louvers or something to that effect.\n\nI don't even know if there is a paper written up on the subject matter. I\ndo not have Prof Moeck's current contact information so I'm hoping to find\nhim or someone else who can help through this email.\n\nThanks,\n\nRAMANA KOTI Assoc. ASHRAE LEED?
