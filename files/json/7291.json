{"body": "\nHi all, I'm doing some glare calculations for the first time and am in\ngeneral new to Radiance. I'm trying to work out how to take account of\nthe ambient lighting level within a room when I'm performing a glare\ncalc for daylighting? Is it using the -av setting, and if so, how do I\nconvert the internal light level of 400lux into a -av setting? Thanks,\nErik\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080825/d6be074f/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Erik Moore", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<F65C1ECF836F09418EBE88D3E33A8D2D013F08D4@eurxmb06.global.arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Aug 25 04:08:37 2008", "email": "Erik.Moore at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glare uplift"}
