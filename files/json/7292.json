He gave a presentation titled\n\"Designer's Radiance\" at the first Radiance workshop. You can find his\nmaterial here:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Bauer/index.html\nThanks, Carsten!\n\nWhat you want is the file desradaux.tar which is linked at the very\nbottom of that page.\n\nI also forgot to mention that there are some very simple examples of\nmaterial cal files in my Radiance tutorial, available from this page:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/index.shtml\n\nThe examples are:\n- a blue horizontal stripe across the wall\n- random carpet tiles\n- dust on the carpet tiles\n\nThose examples are probably a much more accessible starting point than\nCarsten's super complicated granite tiles (which I have never managed to\nfully decipher)\n\nGood luck to you.\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] materials in radiance softwar", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Thu, 05 Jul 2012 20:49:53 +0100"}
