The \"2\" is there to\ndistinguish the Python implementation of the old falsecolor CSH script from\nthe original precisely because there are command line options that are not\navailable in the original program.\n\nThat said, you can use falsecolor2 on any system that provides Python. Mac\nOS X comes with Python preinstalled and I don't think there are any\nproblems with any of the default Python versions. You have to download the\nsource file from the Google Code repository:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pyrat/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fwxfalsecolor\n\nYou only need the \"falsecolor2.py\" file for command line operations. It\nbehaves almost like the CSH original and also provides help if you add a\n\"-h\" to the command line arguments.\n\nThomas\n\nOn Fri, Jul 6, 2012 at 1:01 PM, Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120707/b3040ade/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"-z\" option for falsecolor2.csh is missing?", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sat, 7 Jul 2012 22:37:36 +0200"}
