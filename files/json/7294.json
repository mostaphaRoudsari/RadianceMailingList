You can download a QuickTime movie of the presentation from:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-\nworkshop5/2006_Radiance_Workshop/\n\nIt's the talk entitled, \"Applying the Radiance rtcontrib program,\"\nbut heed the warning and download the QT movie rather than hitting\nthe link on your browser, because most browsers (including Safari)\nbarf on it.  The key part you want to check out is \"Step 2\" in the\nmirrored light pipe example.  I'm using flat surfaces, but only for\ncomparison purposes.  The rtcontrib approach should work for any\ngeometry.\n\n\nAgain, this wouldn't work for the solar component.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Lightpipes and rtcontrib", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D9F57B75-28C6-43BF-A4E0-4B7C51067C6D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<100441490808220734q53ac87e0r6b27873563684df7@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Aug 22 09:42:31 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Lightpipes and rtcontrib"}
