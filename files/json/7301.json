{"body": "\n\nHm, I hope I do not write something wrong now...\n\nThe total reflection is the relation of energy reflected to the energy\nthat is hitting the surface. 100 hit the surface, so, if total\nreflectivity is 95%, 95 leave it.\n\nSpecular reflectivity is the part of what is reflected that is leaving\nthe surface in a directed manner. So to go on with our example, is 95%\nwas the total reflection, and the specular reflectivity is 90%, of the\n100 hitting the surface 0.9*95=85.5 leave the surface as specular\nreflection. That also means that the remaining 0.1*95=9.5 leave it as\ndiffuse.\n\nMy total unitless numbers would all translate into radiance Watt / (sr *\nm2).\n\n\nSpecularity cannot be more then 1, as you cannot have more energy\nreflected as specular then energy reflected in total. If you replace the\nmaximum 1.0 by 100% you will understand.\n\nAs far as I know you are right about roughness, but it is difficult to\nestimate this parameter, and I treat it more as a visual effect...\n\nCU Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3617 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080821/f4b3f46f/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] METAL material values", "sender": "Lars O.
