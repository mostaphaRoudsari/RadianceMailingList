They depend on incident\ndirection for most materials, but that's actually a problem of the model\nrather of the materials and their data.\n\nbest regards\nPeter\n\nHi,\nDo you khow any websites that gives many examples of materials defined by their roughness and specularity fractions and RGB reflectance (examples carpet, mdf, aluminium, marble....) ? how can we choose the RGB colors in radiance when we have multicolor mat?rial like carpet?\nthank you\nim?ne SLAMA\nNational School of architecture of Tunis\n________________________________________________\n\n\n--\npab advanced technologies Ltd, http://www.pab.eu\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Fri, 13 Jul 2012 16:57:57 +0200"}
