The format seems pretty open ended at the moment. I was thinking of spending a few minutes introducing Radiance and perhaps dynamic simulation and advanced materials. From there the guidance seems to be to discussion and identification of issues and topics for future meetings. This being said if there is someone who would be interested in doing a brief demo of Diva this could be good. Or if there are other local Radiance users with possible topics please let me know.\n\nBest,\n\n-Jack\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE DROID\n\nChristoph Reinhart <tito_ at mit.edu> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120715/c3274ac4/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Sun, 15 Jul 2012 16:13:57 -0400"}
