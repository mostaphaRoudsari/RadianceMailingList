I have implemented Dynamic Daylight Simulations in version 0.2,\nwhich is fine on Linux/Mac but it's causing me a problem on windows\nmachines. When python, using Popen, sends out the command piping gendaylit\nto genskyvec.pl I get a bad sky description error, although if I type the\nsame command into the Windows command prompt it works as expected. Has\nanyone here got any experience of running this combination on windows with\nPython. I'm using strawberry Perl to run the genskyvec.pl file, which was\npart of NREL's latest binary release.\nThanks in advance\n\nRyan\n\n--\nDr Ryan Southall\nSenior Research Fellow\nSchool of Architecture & Design\nUniversity of Brighton\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ryan Southall", "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 11:14:15 +0100"}
