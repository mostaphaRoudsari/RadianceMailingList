How can we put it in the room in a specific location? I know, you will tell me that xform is a command that allows this funtion. The problems is that i used xform for the design of the chair itself and it's a bit difficult to use it again to move each element of the chair in the desired location. Is there a command in radiance to create a block called chair ?It will be easy after this to use xform to move the bloc chair in the desired location.\nThank you\nIm?ne\n\n___________________________________________________________\nCuisine, salon, chambre enfant?
