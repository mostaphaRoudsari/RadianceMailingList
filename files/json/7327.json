For the sky description there is a special type of geometry which is\ncalled \"source\". This is, I expect, what you use in the sky.rad file in\nyour tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read the man page for gensky to get an idea of how the program is\ntypically used. About half way through there is an example of a complete\nsky description (it starts with \"!gensky 4 1 14\"). Compare this with the\ncontents of your sky.rad file and the lines before need to go into the\nsky.rad file. This may only be the \"!gensky ...\" line or this line and the\nfollowing \"skyfunc ...\" definition.\n\nWhen you use this now in a scene you first add the sky_overcast.mat and\nthen the sky.rad file to an oconv command line to compile the octree for\nthe scene. When you want to use the same scene under different sky\nconditions you only need to replace the sky_overcast.mat file with another\none which contains a different \"!gensky ...\" command to create an\nintermediate or sunny sky.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120716/5b64b499/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] question about sky.mat", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 19:48:29 +0200"}
