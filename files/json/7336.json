{"body": "\nI think I can answer my own question. As the rendering\nprogressed, the memory growth slowed, and it finally ended at\n6.4GB. A higher-resolution rendering is showing the same fast\ninitial growth, and slow later growth, also ending near 6.4 GB\n\nI suspect Radiance loads each of the 407 individual geometry\nchunks (octree instances?) when it is first needed. It took until\nnear the end of the render to load in the last one.\n\nNow I ask: will Radiance ever drop a chunk? If I want 24m instead\nof 12m cylinders, I'd need ~13GB. I can only presume that\nRadiance doesn't know this, and will continue to ask for more\nmemory, with the OS obliging with excessive page swapping.\n\nMy options for larger scenes seem limited:\n1) analyze the geometry and reduce surface overlap, or\n2) buy a server with 16 GB RAM.\n\nMark\n\nOn Mon, 1 Sep 2008, Mark Stock wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809010025380.11715@joust.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "sender": "Mark Stock", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809021240150.7440@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "refs": ["<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809010025380.11715@joust.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>"], "datetime": "Tue Sep  2 09:48:13 2008", "email": "mstock at umich.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: rpict memory usage keeps increasing with -aa0"}
