{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nYou are correct in your deduction that Radiance loads chunks (octrees\nin this case) as they are first required during rendering, unless you\nare using the -PP option, which causes the whole scene and all\nreferences to be preloaded to maximize memory sharing.\n\nRadiance doesn't do any LRU ejection of memory once it's been\nloaded.  However, virtual memory will swap out pages that are not\naccessed and this should in general be just as good.  You only need\nto make sure you have enough free disk space to accommodate your VM\nsystem.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809021240150.7440@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C82DEF4A-F814-48E0-B11D-4C2D2DBC94AA@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809010025380.11715@joust.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>", "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0809021240150.7440@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>"], "datetime": "Tue Sep  2 10:39:57 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: rpict memory usage keeps increasing with-aa 0"}
