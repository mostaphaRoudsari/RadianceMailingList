Adding the object to the octree is a\nmuch more robust solution, however.  If you were to insert samples\nusing rhcopy, you could end up with some odd reconstruction errors in\nrholo.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck fi", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Jun 21 14:27:09 2004"}
