{"body": "\nHello all,\n\nSo I hate to ask a stupid, basic question (yet again :)\nhowever I've read all I can, and not being able to find\na copy of the 'Rendering with Radiance' book anywhere,\nthis is the only place I can turn to.\n\nI can't figure out what application the 'alias'\nmaterial modifier is for. I understand how to\napply modifiers, and patterns, and I've read the old\ntutorial, the new tutorial, the help files,\nand the man pages, and still can't get my head\naround what this is for or where you would apply\nit.\n\nIf anyone could point me to a help file,\nor just give a few quick examples of what the\nalias modifier would be used for in application,\nI would be incredibly grateful.\n\nThanks a ton,\n\nJeffrey\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<14F4D3C7236B9C42B381D1F66D78C6D9A09149@hunt-exch-01.huntsmanag.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 7 Oct 2003 10:37:21 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] 'Alias' material modifier questions..."}
