Bear in mind that certain surfaces do not report\nirradiance, such as glass, which you see through as usual with the -i\noption.\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nRight again -- sources don't report light landing on them\n(irradiance), since they are considered to be emitters, and thus\naren't affected by the -i option.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "<1220630461.4902.1272373303@webmail.messagingengine.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<ED238147-F7A4-473D-B806-2860256D9A7B@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1220630461.4902.1272373303@webmail.messagingengine.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Sep  5 10:13:51 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] irradiance vs. radiance / luminance vs.illuminance"}
