{"body": "\nHi Cw,\n\nI'm not sure how pfsview converts colors to luminance values, but it\nmay apply a different set of coefficients from those used in Radiance\n(and pvalue).  This could explain the discrepancy.  The best way to\ncheck is to compare values for a gray pixel, which should be the same\nregardless of the color -> luminance conversion.\n\nAlso, are you 100% sure you are checking the exact same pixel(s)?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Pvalue for converting to luminance", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E954AF0A-D435-403C-8DFC-ADE1DFC13967@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<da2acf910809051927l37900acl208a1b111caeac93@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Sep  5 19:36:03 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Pvalue for converting to luminance"}
