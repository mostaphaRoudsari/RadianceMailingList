{"body": "\nHi Chew,\n\nYes, pvalue -o -b * 179 and the ximage 'l' command should report the\nsame values for the same pixels, though it's a bit difficult to know\nif you are in fact checking the same pixels -- the ximage 'p' command\ncan help with that.\n\nI guess this is moot since you couldn't compile ximage.  I believe\nEcotect offers a Windows-ready substitute free of charge.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Pvalue for converting to luminance", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<FBD21558-20C3-472F-8AE9-2A8F6BEB4470@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<da2acf910809051927l37900acl208a1b111caeac93@mail.gmail.com>", "<E954AF0A-D435-403C-8DFC-ADE1DFC13967@lmi.net>", "<da2acf910809051939q233b7b9eq7f0843cfb2a022e5@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Sep  5 21:15:08 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Pvalue for converting to luminance"}
