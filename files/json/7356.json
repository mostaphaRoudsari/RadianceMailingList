If there\nis, I'd like to present:\n\nImaging Fluid Dynamics for Art\n\nIn this talk, I will present methods that I have used for nearly\n10 years of modeling, rendering, and display of digital artwork.\nThis includes creating and converting data from computational\nfluid dynamics research, handling large models, rendering\nlarge single frames, and experimental display techniques.\n\nMark\n\nOn Thu, 4 Sep 2008, Gregory J.
