{"body": "\nProblem solved, I think.  The confusion arose from me jumping to\nconclusions based my comparison of luminance/illuminance images.  I saw\nthe bright floor plane outside and assumed it was a mistake.  It\nactually turned out that the reflectance of the local ground plane was\nset to 0.25 while gensky defaults to 0.2.\n\nPerhaps 0.25 is a bit too high for asphalt but reasonable for concrete?\nBRE [1] list a table of surface reflectances with asphalt = 0.07 and\nconcrete = 0.2 ~ 0.3.  Anyone know of a more detailed reference for\nsurface reflectances?\n\nNick\n\n[1] BRE Report 380 2000 - Environmental site layout planning: solar\naccess, microclimate and passive cooling in urban areas\n\nOn Fri, 05 Sep 2008 12:12:33 -0400, \"Jack de Valpine\" <jedev@visarc.com>\nsaid:\n\n", "replyTo": "<48C15A71.7080808@visarc.com>", "sender": "Nick Doylend", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1220871136.2558.1272751313@webmail.messagingengine.com>", "refs": ["<1220630461.4902.1272373303@webmail.messagingengine.com>", "<48C15A71.7080808@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Sep  8 03:55:42 2008", "email": "radiance at ndoylend.fastmail.fm", "subject": "[Radiance-general] irradiance vs. radiance / luminance vs.illuminance"}
