Cloudy skies or sunless skies are no problem.\n\n\nThe accuracy of non-planar, specular reflectors is actually better than #1, but the results are somewhat noisy.  A new -c option to vwrays (coupled with the rtcontrib -c option) is a good way to reduce noise that is available in the latest HEAD.  This is a better way to reduce noise than increasing -ad, and less costly.\n\n\nAndy has proposed an improved annual simulation method, which we hope to work on next year, to remedy the direct solar sampling difficulties in the 3-phase method.  It should also alleviate problems with external facade geometry and reduce the need to subdivide windows.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF xml into Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 25 Jul 2012 09:44:51 -0700"}
