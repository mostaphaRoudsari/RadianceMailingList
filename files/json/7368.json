{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\n\nIf you query a pixel on a window, the window acts as if it's not\nthere, so it's transmittance has no effect.\n\n\nThe BRTDfunc isn't one of the materials on the list, so it shows up\nwith an irradiance value like other materials.  I'm sorry if this is\nconfusing, but you can usually tell simply by looking at the image\nwhich materials are transparent and which aren't.  If you want all\nmaterials to be treated the same and irradiance to be computed for\neverything, you can use the following in place of the rpict -i option:\n\nvwrays [view options] -ff -x xres -y yres -pa 0 | rtrace -h -ff -opN\noctree | rtrace -ffc -I -x xres -y yres > irrad.pic\n\nThe first trace comes up with the intersection points and surface\nnormals for the second trace, which computes irradiance at those\npoints.  You need to be sure that your view has no distant light\nsources in it, since those don't have intersection points or surface\nnormals.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "<124b40400809090142j12ec9053tf835014451a0b847@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<BD18B196-7074-42B0-A7A8-CD7EF8C58CBC@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1220630461.4902.1272373303@webmail.messagingengine.com>", "<ED238147-F7A4-473D-B806-2860256D9A7B@lmi.net>", "<124b40400809080517m63a2380bv9919336ea45691df@mail.gmail.com>", "<8DA1BD2B-A662-46EB-9269-FE6F9DD60E9D@lmi.net>", "<124b40400809090142j12ec9053tf835014451a0b847@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Sep  9 08:24:38 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] irradiance vs. radiance / luminance vs.illuminance"}
