I am going to try\nit with rtcontrib (sensors) and wanted to ask for advice on how to setup\nthe points for averaging.  For example, if I choose 4 for -c, do I send\nin the same point 4 times or is there a heuristic for perturbing or\nregularly spacing these points for improving results?\nThanks for creating this feature!\n\n- Dan\n\nOn 7/25/2012 10:44 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF xml into Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Daniel C.
