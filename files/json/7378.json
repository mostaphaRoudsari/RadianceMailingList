The \"validation\" in the above code is very basic and will also fail if genskyvec does not receive any input at all.\n\nYup. Genskyvec.pl is indeed not getting anything when the full command chain is called. For example, this (Ruby) code:\n\ntempIO = IO.popen(\"gendaylit -ang #{tsSolarAlt} #{tsSolarAzi} -L #{tsDirectNormIllum} #{tsDiffuseHorIllum}\")\nillumTemp = tempIO.readlines.to_s\ntempIO.close\nputs \"illumTemp: #{illumTemp}\"\n\n?at runtime, prints the gendaylit output. But this code:\n\ntempIO = IO.popen(\"gendaylit -ang #{tsSolarAlt} #{tsSolarAzi} -L #{tsDirectNormIllum} #{tsDiffuseHorIllum} | genskyvec#{perlExtension} -m 1 | dctimestep ./output/dc/#{space_name}/maps/#{space_name}_map.dmx | rcalc -e #{vLambda}\")\nillumTemp = tempIO.readlines.to_s\ntempIO.close\nputs \"illumTemp: #{illumTemp}\"\n\n?at runtime, prints nothing. I had exactly the same thought of modifying genskyvec.pl to accept a file as input but I'd like to avoid the extra file I/O. I hope to have time to look at this some more today. Thanks for the input!\n\n- Rob\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Genskyvec error revisited", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Thu, 26 Jul 2012 09:39:33 -0600"}
