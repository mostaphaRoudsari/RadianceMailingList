It isn't always an improvement, however.  The \"light\" type is best reserved for actual luminaires and the like -- this is what Andy found in his experiments if I remember right.\n\n\nActually, all noise should be reduced somewhat.\n\n\nYes, I think so.  The main advantage of increasing -c as opposed to -x and -y is efficiency -- the output picture files are smaller, so you don't have as much disk i/o (which can be a bottleneck) and don't have to filter the results, either.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF xml into Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 10:58:36 -0700"}
