{"body": "\nI've been scratching my head for a while over this one (I'm sure it's\nsomething stupid I've done).  But I'm exporting from Ecotect using a\n100lux overcast sky, rendering with the -i option to get a daylight\nfactor image.  I've narrowed it down to something that looks like\nself-luminous ceiling soffits (I've rendered the scene with all the\nother objects apart from the floor slabs and it's fine) - tracing the\nilluminance value on the roof gives 100Lux as expected, but the floor\nslabs are ablaze with light (>1kLux).  The image\n(http://ndoylend.fastmail.fm/temp/test0_c5.jpg) looks pretty cool, but\nit's absolutely useless.\n\nCan anyone shed some light (sorry) on this one?\n\nNick\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Doylend", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1221947902.9573.1275064747@webmail.messagingengine.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Sep 20 14:58:30 2008", "email": "radiance at ndoylend.fastmail.fm", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Insane Daylight Factor Rendering"}
