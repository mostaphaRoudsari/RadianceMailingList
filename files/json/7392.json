I suppose I should reduce the\nambient value to zero and increase the indirect to get a more realistic\nDF, but is it worth it (these are for visualisation only)?\n\nThanks for the suggestion,\n\nNick\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nThomas Bleicher\nSent: 21 September 2008 09:22\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nOn 20 Sep 2008, at 22:58, Nick Doylend wrote:\n\n\nHere's another one:\n\nWhat's your -av  setting?
