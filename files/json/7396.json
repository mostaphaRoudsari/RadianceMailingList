{"body": "\nHi Nicolas,\n\nDaysim is using the Perez Sky model, so I would use gendaylit instead of\ngensky for a comparision.\nSecondly, I assume, that you have to use the -R instead of the -r\nOption, since you are dealing with irradiance rather than radiance. This\nis causing the big difference, I assume.\nBut  be careful: -R is expecting horizontal direct irradiation, not\ndirect normal irradiance!\n\nJan\n\nNicolas Roy wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080922/5243b335/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] DAYSIM vs. Radiance illuminance values", "sender": "Jan Wienold", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<48D7AE70.3060905@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "refs": ["<OF69E5AD77.A3B2DA4B-ONC12574CC.004AD3ED-C12574CC.004D478B@velux.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Sep 22 07:47:23 2008", "email": "jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] DAYSIM vs. Radiance illuminance values"}
