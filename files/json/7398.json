Is it\ncalled 'rcontrib' or 'rtcontrib'?\n\n\nRob, for Windows binaries I see there are rcontrib and rtcontrib.\nSo rcontrib calls new version and rtcontrib old version. Right?\n\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120810/719d738f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 13:05:49 +0200"}
