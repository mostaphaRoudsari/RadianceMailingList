{"body": "\nHi Ben,\n\nI should know, but I don't.  Does the Window 5 program output colored\nmaterials for Radiance?  Maybe Judy knows.  (Judy?)\n\nThe names of the colors don't really help, much.  You need either\nspectral transmittance and reflectance values or (at least) CIE (x,y)\nchromaticities for each transmitted and reflected color.  I can't get\nthese values from the names.  Perhaps Window 5 can??\n\nOther help!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Realistic glass colours", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C7077DE7-FA99-11D7-9ED6-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 9 Oct 2003 13:47:20 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Realistic glass colours"}
