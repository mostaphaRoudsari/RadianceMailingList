Grobe", "body": "\nHi all,\n\nMarija, yes, the new rcontrib is in the HEAD, and is available in the latest NREL binaries. Lars, the symlink is only created by the makeall script. If you use the NREL binaries, rtcontrib is really rtcontrib, and rcontrib is rcontrib. Clear as mud, eh? Greg, you should have named rcontrib \"totally_different_coefficient_calculator\". =)\n\n- Rob\n\n________________________________________\nSent: Friday, August 10, 2012 6:11 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Marija!\nThe new one is rcontrib, but there is a symlink named rtcontrib pointing\nto it, so you do not need to change your scripts.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New rtcontrib?", "tags": [], "sender": "grobe at gmx.net", "datetime": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 07:12:20 -0600"}
