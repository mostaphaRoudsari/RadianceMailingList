{"body": "\nDear Radiance users,\n\nAs you probably know, registrations are now open for the next Radiance workshop which will take place in Fribourg (Switzerland) from 30 to 31 October 2008 (see home.hefr.ch/compag/rw2008/<http://home.hefr.ch/compag/rw2008/> ).  We expect to receive your registration before the end of September.\nMore important: the hotel reservation should be made through the Fribourg Tourism office using the dedicated form not later than Friday 26th September. This is due to the fact that the rooms we have pre-booked for the workshop cannot be held longer since there is another big congress in need of room space that may require them...\n\nRaphael Compagnon & Greg Ward\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20080925/03104853/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Compagnon_Rapha=EBl?=", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<70DD3A1408BDA8498790E8D553B7D253A9C0FB2B01@HEFRMAIL.sofr.hefr.lan>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Sep 25 06:00:21 2008", "email": "Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reminder: Radiance workshop registrations"}
