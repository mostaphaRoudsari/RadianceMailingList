Is there any simple\nway to model a typical lightshelf?\n\nI would like to thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\nKind regards,\n\nVirginie G.\nSecond-year student at ESIROI CODE (Sustainable Construction)\nhttp://esiroi.univ-reunion.fr/Reunion Island, France\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120814/45a02fba/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "GROSDEMOUGE Virginie", "datetime": "Tue, 14 Aug 2012 06:31:28 +0000"}
