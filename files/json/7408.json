However, the low\nresults obtained stroke me and I think that I cannot trust them. I suppose that my definition of materials is not correct. In fact, I am using Google Sketchup and Daysim in order to conduct my simulations. A daysim materials library can be imported in Sketchup. Currently, when I used the typical singleglazclear90 I have this description \"void\ntrans SingGlaz 0 0 7 0.9001 0.9001 0.9001 0.0000 0.0000 0.0909 1.0000\".\nIn order to check if I understood properly the trans definition, I\nwould like to know if it means that my glazing only transmits about 10%\nof light inside my room? I have some difficulties to fully understand the trans definition. Nevertheless, when I try to change the\ntransmission parameters, the results seems to be too high... If someone could help me to understand, I would be very grateful.\n\nIn addition, I have seen that there is another way to define glazing, with the glass definition. What is the difference between these two definitions of materials? What is the simplest way to define a typical single glazing? There may be a library with examples of glazing that I could use?\n\nI would like to thank you in advance.\n\nKind regards,\n\nVirginie GROSDEMOUGE\n\nSecond-year student at ESIROI CODE (Sustainable Construction)\nhttp://esiroi.univ-reunion.fr/\nReunion Island, France\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20120814/049ec56a/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "GROSDEMOUGE Virginie", "datetime": "Tue, 14 Aug 2012 10:25:58 +0000"}
