{"body": "\nHi!\n\nI am new to Desktop Radiance and wish to ask if anybody knows why I could\nnot get any differences in luminance rendering clear and dark glass.  I have\n2 types of glass, one is clear with below transmittance:\n\nvoid glass Clear\n0\n0\n3 \t0.890 0.961 0.961\n\n\nAnother glass is darker with below transmittance:\n\nvoid glass Project_SC_0_2\n0\n0\n3 \t0.308 0.308 0.308\n\nWe wish to know how dark would the rooms be with a glass shading coefficient\nof 0.20 and visible light transmittance of 0.28.  The above radiance\ntransmission numbers were generated by Ecotect.  I tried editing them to:\n\nvoid glass Project_SC_0_2\n0\n0\n3 \t0.28 0.28 0.28\n\nBut I get the same image rendered, the objects behind the glass looks the\nsame.  Looks like there is no difference in the transmission thru the glass,\nor is there something wrong with my approach?  But when I click on the image\nto display luminance I get different cd/m2 numbers.\n\nAny advise would be helpful.  Thanks in advance!\n\n\nRgds,\nJun\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Jhun Calixihan", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001701c9282a$6b836340$428a29c0$@com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Oct  6 19:56:43 2008", "email": "jcalixihan at cladding.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Glass Transmittance not showing"}
