{"body": "\nWhen you export 3d geometry from rino you have a choice of the file type\n(3d studio, dxf etc) and you also have the choice (a slider bar) of how\nmuch detail to export for complex surfaces. If the stuff that's in your\nmasterplan is rectilinear (i.e. not a bunch of NURBS objects) then this\nslider should be almost all the way to the left (for less detail). That\nmight be where all those triangles are coming from, as rino is designed to\nmodel complex shapes like sailboat hulls, it has to reduce its curvy\nobjects to faceted objects (so other programs can read them) and if it\nadds too many triangles then the file will be unnessicarily large for what\nyou want to do.\n\nis it a DXF file?  It probably should be. (just a guess : )  )\n\nAlso, how large is the file size? Maybe you can ask for your architect to\nsupply you with several exports, low, med and high file size exports of\nthe same geometry.\n\nIt's been a few years since I have used rino extensively so i hope this\nhelps.\n\n-Kyle\n\n******************************************\nKyle Konis\nPhD Student\nLawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)\nUC Berkeley Center for the Built Environment (CBE)\n206.303.9786\n******************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 56, Issue 4", "sender": "kkonis@berkeley.edu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<49304.198.128.27.129.1223673464.squirrel@calmail.berkeley.edu>", "refs": ["<cmu-lmtpd-9561-1223665211-0@cyrus7.calmail>"], "datetime": "Fri Oct 10 14:17:50 2008", "email": "kkonis at berkeley.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 56, Issue 4"}
