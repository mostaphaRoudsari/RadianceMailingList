{"body": "\nhi Greg, Ben,\n\nI don't believe windows 5 can output colored materials for Radiance,\nmaybe you are thinking of Optics 5?  There's an option in Optics5 to\nexport a radfile of whatever glazing you chose.  You can get Optics5 here.\n\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/default.htm\n\nYou want to compare the glazing types from looking from outside?\nIn that case I think you'll have to use the BRTDfunc \"front\" material.\n\nhope that helps...\n.\njudy\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Realistic glass colours", "sender": "judy lai", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3F85DE95.2000105@lbl.gov>", "refs": ["<C7077DE7-FA99-11D7-9ED6-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu, 09 Oct 2003 15:17:57 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Realistic glass colours"}
