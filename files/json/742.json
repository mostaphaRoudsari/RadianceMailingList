Does anyone happen to have the 3ds2rad converter from Ole Lemming?\nBoth his website and he himself seem to have vanished from the internet\nand even after extensive search I was unable to find his converter.\n\n2. Does anyone know a reasonable method to render an ArchCAD (6.5+)\n3D model with radiance? All the DXF output options I have tried so far\nwere rather unsuccessful, I have not found a way to correctly\nexport/ translate materials or elements from ArchiCAD.\n\nWith Georg's dxf2rad I get a Radiance model, but the resulting Radiance\nscene is pretty much unusable which is not Georgs fault. If I load the\nDXF file into AutoCAD for examination I see that the DXF file is just\nmessed up with regards to layers/blocks/materials.\n\nAny input very welcome!\n\nErwin\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "datetime": "Wed Jun 23 21:06:46 2004"}
