{"body": "\nDear list,\n\nA beta version of the new LEARNIX live-CD is up for grabs:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/\n\nLEARNIX is now based on Ubuntu, rather than Knoppix. We use Bernd's\nofficial Radiance packages. Please get it, test it, and send any\nfeedback off-list directly to me. Note that some of the documentation\nhas not been updated, e.g. the Getting Started Guide and Luisa's ESP-r\ntutorial.\n\nAlthough some seemingly unmaintained or non-functional packages have\nbeen dropped, we are happy to announce that Andreas' radview, as well\nas Ilya's mt tools have made it into LEARNIX.\n\nThere are a number of test scripts under /usr/local/share/learnix\nwhich are designed to verify the functionality of Radiance and\nadd-ons. We would greatly appreciate if you could give any feedback\nand/or suggestions on them, too.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<100441490810170754p65631534sa445e9c90beaf841@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 17 07:54:41 2008", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] LEARNIX 2008-1 beta"}
