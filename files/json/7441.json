{"body": "\nHi Ljubica,\n\nI just want to add to what Thomas wrote.  Quoting your webpage:\n\n\nSince your trans surface blocks visibility of the light sources, I\nwouldn't recommend using the mirror type for this at all.  I'd just\nuse an 80% reflective metal material (pure specular) and let the\ninterreflection calculation handle it.  I don't think an illum is\nsuitable, due to the high variance in luminance over the surface of\neach panel.\n\nI'm actually quite surprised at how bad these results look.  I think\nsomething else must be going on that I don't understand, like leaks\nat the sides of the structure.  Anyway, try it without the mirror\ntype and see if that helps.\n\nYour calculation time could probably be improved without too much\nloss in accuracy by using a glow material for the cylindrical light\nsources -- set the distance limit to something like 4 times the size\nof one of your light panel widths.\n\nFinally, I don't think a pure diffuse translucent material can have a\ntransmission over 50%.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling an artificial sky : help needed", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<890008EE-CB5A-4B8E-B3BB-02D675A0843E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<48FEEC96.2070807@deluminaelab.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Oct 22 15:03:05 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Modelling an artificial sky : help needed"}
