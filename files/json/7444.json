{"body": "\nIt's a new set of scripts, though I started with Schorsch's scripts,\nas well as the Radiance makefiles. This new set of scripts has ended\nup very different because I had different goals. The scripts use more-\ncurrent SCons features. They are cross-platform, though the set of\nplatforms is limited. The libraries built follow the makefile model as\nclosely as I could quickly manage (few large libraries) rather than\nthe Schorsch model (many small libraries). I like to think that this\nmakes for simpler build scripts. I do, though, incorporate much of\nSchorsh's Windows C code, so that pipes in scene description files\nwork. There are two small source-code tweaks, in included headers.\nProbably the biggest practical difference is that I have not written\ninstall code into the scripts, since these are a base for\nexperimentation rather than production.\n\nRandolph\n\nOn Oct 23, 2008, at 10:53 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081023/1b798005/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Experimental Radiance build scripts", "sender": "R Fritz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<76EF9A59-0910-4A14-86A0-FFC0E6C46AD1@u.washington.edu>", "refs": ["<DFFAAFCB-863D-403C-A11C-2D82BF57BD3D@u.washington.edu>", "<9A13A351-A1A8-47B4-9D13-48240EAA9B3B@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Thu Oct 23 11:20:17 2008", "email": "rfritz at u.washington.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Experimental Radiance build scripts"}
