How did you acquire the Radiance\nsource code? Did you just grab the HEAD? If so, you need to grab the\n\"auxiliary files\" archive from the same place you got the HEAD:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/download-radiance/un-offici\nal-head-version/index.html\n\nI'm pretty sure that's where helvet.fnt lives. You can also use the CMake\nbuild system. There was a thread on the dev list recently:\n\nhttp://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001242.htm\nl\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 9/18/12 7:09 AM, \"Aksel Gro?\" <aksel at gobo.io> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FAQ - Known problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Tue, 18 Sep 2012 08:35:57 -0600"}
