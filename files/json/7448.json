{"body": "\nDear Greg,\n\nI'm just updating my tutorial, and decided to be be more consistent\nwith directories and file extensions. I personally still use trad a\nlot--it's convenient, fast, and doesn't get in the way.\n\ntrad still puts the old .pic extension on image files. The general\nconsensus nowadays seems to be to use .hdr. Since it's a quick\nfind-and-replace jobbie, may I propose to use this convention for rad\nand trad as well. I'd be happy to send you patch.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<100441490810250720n6c6ddf64iceb54c768a459b16@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Oct 25 07:20:17 2008", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR extension in rad, trad"}
