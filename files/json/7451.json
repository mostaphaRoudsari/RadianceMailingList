It was my error, i reentered all paths as stated on the site. Works now like a charm!\n\nThe problem though came because i first installed the version from NREL http://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\nThere it says:\n\"On MacOS or Linux, add these lines to your .profile or .bashrc ?assuming you are using the bash shell (this is most commonly the default)? files, respectively:\n\nPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH\nExport PATH RAYPATH\"\n\nThose where the paths i entered before, and those didn't do it. Most likely because appending to a non-existing RAYPATH won't do a thing?\n\nAksel\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FAQ - Known problems", "tags": [], "sender": "=?windows-1252?Q?Aksel_Gro=DF?=", "datetime": "Wed, 19 Sep 2012 10:12:30 +0200"}
