If it is\nnot set, nothing will be appended, that it is.\n\nIf you really typed Export as above, with capital E, that may be the\nproblem.\n\nI am not sure about the syntax. On bash I would not first define the\nvariables and than export them to the environment, but directly set the\nenvironment variables as\n\nexport PATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH\nexport RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH\n\nBut both may be valid.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FAQ - Known problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
