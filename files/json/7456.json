{"body": "\nHi Tom,\n\nIt's been a while since your original post, I'm behind on reading the\nradiance general emails.\n\nA while back I was able to download the linux source code and compile it on\nMac OSX with some minor changes to the makefile.  I don't remember what\nmodifications were, but I think if you try to compile daysim and look at the\nerrors the necessary modifications can be deciphered.\n\nI used Daysim version 2.2P2 (Linux) to do this.\n\nAndy\n\n\nOn 7/18/08 3:04 AM, \"Tom Young\" <thdyoung@mac.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daysim on osx", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C52B57D4.74D5%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Oct 27 11:39:06 2008", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] daysim on osx"}
