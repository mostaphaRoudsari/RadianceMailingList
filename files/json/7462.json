{"body": "\nHello\n\nAzimuth and altitude angles are both given as comments in the output of the gensky program.\nHere are two very simple C-shell scripts that will just extract these values. You may use them to build a script to generate the data you need.\n\nHope this will help you.\n\nRaphael\n________________________________________\nDe : radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org [radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] de la part de sokol dervishi [dervishi_sokol@yahoo.com]\nDate d'envoi : lundi, 27. octobre 2008 20:44\n? : radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] Azimuth and Altitude\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI need to calculate solar altitude for 2008, from 6.15 to 18:00 every 15 minute step, and use this information to calculate the direct normal irradiance and together with diffuse irradiance  (I have direct and diffuse irradiance values) as an input for  PEREZ model using RADIANCE.\n\nI wanted to ask if RADIANCE can provide me with this information, so a list of sun altitude for a year-based.\n\nI have seen some website where I can calculate the sun altitude for a single step, however I need the data for a year-based, and it is not a good idea to calculate it each time step.\n\nIf not, can someone provide me with some sources  (formulas) how to calculate the values?\n\nI thank you in advance,\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSokol Dervishi,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: getaltitude\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 196 bytes\nDesc: getaltitude\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081027/bba3201e/getaltitude.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: getazimuth\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 196 bytes\nDesc: getazimuth\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081027/bba3201e/getazimuth.obj\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Azimuth and Altitude", "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Compagnon_Rapha=EBl?=", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<70DD3A1408BDA8498790E8D553B7D253BBBB30F681@HEFRMAIL.sofr.hefr.lan>", "refs": ["<127681.31787.qm@web56906.mail.re3.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Oct 27 14:03:34 2008", "email": "Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Azimuth and Altitude"}
