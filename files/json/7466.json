I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find\nfunction file \"rayinit.cal.\" I searched through the mailing list\narchives and found a few items on the placement of library files and\nsetting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I\nhave my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make\nsure\nthat rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables\nare\nexporting properly as I can see the paths when I \"echo $PATH\" and\n\"echo\n$RAYPATH,\" however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for\nsome\nreason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nDave\nMaino\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081027/354efff3/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Calcagni", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<d5d7d3120810270954v178b0cd2p34fdd40b5adba46c@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Oct 27 09:54:38 2008", "email": "nac342 at drexel.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problems"}
