{"body": "\nAll suffixes in Radiance are just a convention, but since both\nWindows and Mac OS X look at the suffix as a first indication of file\ntype, it's not a bad idea to standardize them.  The \"hdr\" suffix has\ndefinitely been picked up by the mainstream as a Radiance image file,\nwhile the \"pic\" suffix gets confused for other types on the different\nsystems.  In this respect, I agree with Axel that it would be\nbeneficial to change this convention, if people are OK with that.\n\nAlthough I can see Rob's point that it's nice to have a suffix that\nuniquely identifies a Radiance-generated image from other possible\nsources, the de facto use of extensions does not support this these\ndays.  An extension indicates the file type, not its creator.\n\nIf anyone else has a good reason why we should not switch to using\n\".hdr\" in place of \".pic\" in rad/trad/etc. in the next release, now\nis the time to speak up.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR extension in rad, trad", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4171DA5C-83A6-4B53-941F-37B0C28EDA61@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<100441490810250720n6c6ddf64iceb54c768a459b16@mail.gmail.com>", "<59C09612-3EB9-4C83-9C08-2BF10C84533C@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Sat Oct 25 10:10:39 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR extension in rad, trad"}
