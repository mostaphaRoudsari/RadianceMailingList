You will never be able to get exactly the\nsame result every time, but by tightening the simulation parameters you can\nreduce the difference between runs considerably.  Better simulation\nparameters means longer simulation times - it's a typical tradeoff between\nprecision and duration (you can have noisy results quickly or precise\nresults tomorrow).\n\nI suggest looking at the descriptions of simulation parameters in this\ntutorial:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/radiance_tutorial.pdf\nand those starting on page 10 of this tutorial:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/radiance-primer.pdf\nand playing with your results.\n\nI'm a big fan of convergence testing of simulation parameters to build\nconfidence in results.  Without convergence testing I have no way of\nknowing what parameters are good for a model.  John Mardaljevic did some\nconvergence testing in his thesis (see figure 3-26 & 3-30):\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=resources:mardaljevic_chap3.pdf\n\nIt also helps to look at your model interactively in Radiance with rvu to\nmake sure that everything is how you expect.  I think there is a version of\nrvu that works on windows in the NREL radiance package:\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\nOn Tue, Oct 2, 2012 at 10:15 AM, shailan zareiy <sh.zareiy at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121002/40c7bd80/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] radiance problems", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Tue, 2 Oct 2012 10:44:24 -0700"}
