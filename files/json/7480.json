The best way to do this is by increasing -ad.  You should also try\nreducing ambient interpolation by increasing -ar and/or decreasing -aa.\n\nIt is common for beginner (and intermediate, and expert) users to focus on\nthe -ab parameter, but I find adjusting other ambient parameters is\ntypically more effective.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 3, 2012 at 8:28 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\nRobert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121003/ba5bc1ed/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA3225FDC07C04@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 09:41:19 -0700"}
