{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\ngreat to know the packages are useful here, too. What I'm wondering\nabout is if there's anything else out there which is under a DFSG\ncompatible license and could be included in Debian, too? If somebody\nelse would like to maintain such packages in Debian just let me know and\nI'll happily review and sponsor the uploads for them - or create and\nmaintain the packages if you want me to.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nGPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] LEARNIX 2008-1 beta", "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<48F8B5F9.4020908@bzed.de>", "refs": ["<100441490810170754p65631534sa445e9c90beaf841@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Oct 17 08:57:27 2008", "email": "bernd at bzed.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] LEARNIX 2008-1 beta"}
