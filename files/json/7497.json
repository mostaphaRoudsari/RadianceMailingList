{"body": "\nHi all\n\nI'm trying to install Radzilla onto my Mac.  I am at the beginning of my understanding of all things Unix based and installing Radiance was a steep hill.  Can anyone give me an idiots guide on what I need to do to install Radzilla?  So far I have installed QT4 okay and I have Xcode tools installed.  However the Radzilla install completes with a number of errors...\n\nAny pointers will be greatly appreciated.\n\nDan\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Dan Fitzpatrick", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<7385040.13911223982726829.JavaMail.servlet@kundenserver>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Oct 14 04:12:17 2008", "email": "danf at eb7.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radzilla install"}
