I have figured out\nthat it does not pass an illum surface and cause any additional\nillumination.  It does, however, change the luminance of the luminaire\nwhen viewed directly (i think only when using the \"illum\" primitive for\nthe ies data and not the \"light\" primitive).  So, I would like to get\nthis \"Glow\" correct so that I can compare the luminance ratios of\nvarious fixtures.  In Desktop Radiance's fixture library it seems to\ntypically use 53.195959 as the RGB radiance value.  I can't figure out\nwhere this number came from.  First of all, what units are these\nRadiance values in?  W/ster/m2?  If this is the true than I calculate\nfor say a T8;\n\n32 W / 4*pi steradians / 2*pi*0.5 sf = 0.8105 W/ster/sf\n\n0.8105 W/ster/sf * (m2/ 10.764sf) = 0.0753 W/ster/m2\n\nThis doesn't seem right.  Please correct me if there is any error in my\ncalculation.\n\nIf the radiance vaue is supposed to be photometric and in units of\nlumens/ster/m2 than I calculate;\n\n2900  lumens / 4*pi steradians / 2*pi*0.5 sf = 73.46 lumens/ster/sf\n\n73.46 lumens/ster/sf * (m2/ 10.764sf) = 6.824 lumens/ster/m2\n\nThen the Rendering with Radiance book on Page 322 and 323 gives examples\nof using the \"lampcolor\" program and for a daylight fluorescent (? not\nsure what this is) with 2900 lumen output it gives RGB values of\n0.867251 1.189160 1.066163.\n\nI am confused.  And seeing as how this \"Glow\" primitive completely\neffects the luminance of my parabolic troffers I do not want to continue\nmy comparison without assurance that I am modeling them correctly.  Any\nclarification would be helpful.  Thanks!\n\nRegards,\nZack Rogers\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Zack Rogers", "datetime": "Tue, 18 Dec 2001 18:01:07 -0700"}
