Radiance has been developed on a similar\narchitecture (Power G4,G5) over the years, it is happy with\nLittle/Big-endianess, so I would not expect problems.\n\nI do not know how the virtualization is solved, probably you can get\neither one node with many available cores or many separate cores. Both\nis fine, as Radiance supports forking processes on one node (-N NCPUs)\nas well as distributing among machines (using e.g. ssh and shared\nambient files). I have used ranimate in the past for cluster rendering\n(without ssh), which may be a possible (but not required) approach here:\n\nhttp://larsgrobe.de/content/distributed-rendering-ranimate\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IBM pSeries 575", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
