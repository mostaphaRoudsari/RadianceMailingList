{"body": "\nHello raytracers,\n\nI've occasionally come across object clipping in some parallel views\nwithout setting any clipping plane. I've always assumed that the\ncamera for parallel views was at infinity and everything in the scene\nwas visible to it. I've included an example below that clips the\ncorner of a rectangle. Is there a workaround to this, say, a simple\nconversion to a parallel view from very far away? Am I overlooking\nsomething? I'm using Radiance 3.8, by the way.\n\nThanks in advance. Cheers,\n--Dave\n\n\n\nView file:------------------\nrview -vtl -vp 33.4282 -12.544 6.49047 -vd -0.813537 0.363387 -0.45399\n-vu -0.489383 -0.00613896 0.872047 -vh 100 -vv 100 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0\n-vl 0\n----------------------------\n\n\nRad file:-------------------\n!gensky 4 1 12\n\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\nwhite polygon plane\n0\n0\n12\n45   -15  0\n45   15   0\n-45  15   0\n-45  -15  0\n----------------------------\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "David Smith", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<694e132c0811040827l36c100afsf28cb6c44939e035@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Nov  4 08:27:26 2008", "email": "dbs176 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Clipping in a parallel view?"}
