{"body": "\nI have been thinking about a material library/editor for a while too. For many  needs it would be probably sufficient to have a basic database with the simpler materials (plastic, metal, glass,...) but as soon as it comes to more complex/combined materials the task of providing a useful interface becomes more of a challenge. Schorsch has addressed this with his material editor in Rayfront but this is not targeting beginners. I think that for many users it would be just fine to have something similar to the colorpicker tool (http://www.luxal.eu/resources/radiance/cp4r.shtml), maybe extended with the functionality of adding at least your own custom textures (image uplaod) to basic materials.\nAnyway, as a start it might be worth thinking about a central web based material depository where we all can share our own creations. The display format can be a simple list with mat, cal, pic files and a little preview.\nAnyone interested in starting that?\n\nRegards,\nErwin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Erwin Zierler", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<0003A3FE.4912A89E@192.168.0.81>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Nov  5 23:26:58 2008", "email": "radiance at rendigo.com", "subject": "Re-2: [Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials.."}
