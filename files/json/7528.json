{"body": "\n\nMaybe one should first consider a database of measured values. Based on\nthis, one could implement a material editor that could query that\ndatabase and give a radiance material definition as a result. The\nadvantage is that I could compile the material data available into a\ndescription fitting the needs of my specific application. It is\nimportant to keep in mind that our measurements and simulations not only\nhave a degree of accuracy but also a scale. A material for a wall of\nbricks is not only depending on exterior influences (dirt, humidity,\nvegetation) but also on the scale we look at it - from far a way it will\nbe sufficient to define it as one uniform color, sampled e.g. over\n2mx2m, from a close point of view I would want to have a brick texture\nincluding the different colors of brick and mortar, and for a detail\nview I would need the color and structure of only the brick itself, as\nthe mortar would be a different material. Just one very simple example,\nother materials are much more difficult. Still sharing the measured\nvalues (including very detailed descriptions of object and set-up) would\nbe very useful for the secondary materials, those that a simulation not\nreally focuses on and could be approximated. Think I would be interested\nin contributing.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials..", "sender": "Lars O.
