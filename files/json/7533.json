Assuming those two files are in your current dir, try:\n\noconv ./mod3.rad ./summer_sky.rad > summer.oct\n\nIf that works, then you can add \".\" to your path.\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\nOn 10/18/12 10:22 AM, \"Alex Krickx\" <akrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>> wrote:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI am having a weird issue with the RAD command. Radiance is running on my machine: I checked my scene before and had no issue with using oconv on my scenes and then using rvu to check out the octree. But once I set set up my .rif file and run \"rad summer.rif\" I get the following error:\n\noconv mod3.rad summer_sky.rad > summer.oct\noconv: system - cannot open scene file \"mod3.rad\": No such file or directory\nrad: error generating octree\nsummer.oct removed\n\nIf I change the filename in my .rif for mod3.rad I get a different error (\"no such file\") so it should be pointing to the right file. Any suggestions? I'm running radiance on a Windows7 machine. I'm pretty sure I downloaded the files from NREL's openstudio site. Any suggestions? I've attached my files - they're pretty simple.\n\nThanks,\nAlex Krickx\n\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n\n________________________________\n\nI N T E G R A L\n\nGROUP\n\n\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>\nwww.integralgroup.com<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n\n_______________________________\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems with RAD", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 10:36:54 -0600"}
