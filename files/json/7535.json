Therefore, I suspect something is wrong with your file permissions.  If you can \"cat\" the file using \"cat mod3.rad\" in the same directory, then try running oconv by hand to see if that works -- just copy and paste what rad produces before the error.\n\nThis won't solve your problem, but it may help to figure out what's going wrong.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Problems with RAD", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 09:51:20 -0700"}
