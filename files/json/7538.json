And so I left it at that.\n\nThe library idea sounds appealing at first but i think the\npractical value of validated colour charts is just as big as\na good conversion from the published RGB values. The\nreal world problem I see is that the colour changes it's\nproperties depending on the material it's painted on.\nTake wall paint on plaster for example and compare this\nwith the same paint on a dense wood fibre board (HDF\nor whatever you call it). The texture of the material will\nchange the properties of the paint.\n\nSo instead of a big honking official library a nice and\nsmall peer-reviewed  HOWTO on the conversion from\nmanufacturer's RGB data (and colour space) to\nRadiance values would have more practical value.\nI assume that there is such a conversion procedure.\nIf we have to measure before we get any realistic\nvalues then a library seems to be the thing to do.\nNice job for a student in the need of a thesis ...\n\n\nYours humbly,\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials..", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3E122C36-3118-4518-BF56-655DF88E42B4@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<694e132c0811061457h201ee2d2m6b81d9393cd71f5@mail.gmail.com>", "<491402F4.8000109@iebele.nl>", "<BAY143-W9E36BA7FE3385B42C2051E0190@phx.gbl>"], "datetime": "Fri Nov  7 02:21:32 2008", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials.."}
