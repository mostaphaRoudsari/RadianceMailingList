The former took 9\nmin to finish, whereas the latter used 13 min ...\n\n\nI was quite happy to see all the 8 cores of the CPU are fully utilized in\nthe beginning, but I was quite upset when the results turned out to be\nworse than not specifying anything ...\n\n\nWhy the -n option didn't reduce the simulation time but increases it ? ...\n\n\nDid I miss something obvious here regarding Radiance parallel rendering ?\n\n\nThe two bash scripts are something like:\n\noconv ./Sky_m3_d21_h13.rad ./materials.mat ./Context.rad >\n./Octree_files_m3_d21_h13.oct\n\ncat ./sensor.txt | rtrace -I -h -w -oov -u- -aa 0.1 -ab 6 -ad 1024 -ar 256\n-as 512 ./Octree_files_.oct > ./Results_m3_d21_h13_ir_RGB.txt\n\n\nand:\n\n\noconv ./Sky_m3_d21_h13.rad ./materials.mat ./Context.rad >\n./Octree_files_m3_d21_h13.oct\n\ncat ./sensor.txt | rtrace -I -h -w -oov -u- -aa 0.1 -ab 6 -ad 1024 -ar 256\n-as 512 -n 8 ./Octree_files_.oct > ./Results_m3_d21_h13_ir_RGB.txt\n\n\nThe test was done on a Macbook Pro, OS X 10.8.2, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 (8\ncores), with 8GB REM.\n\n\nThe images showing the CPU core usage for the two simulations are put at:\n\nhttp://episode-hopezh.blogspot.sg/2012/10/rtrace-parallel-rendering-myth.html\n\n\nAdvices are appreciated! and thanks in advance!\n\n- Ji\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121019/009cc77d/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ji Zhang", "datetime": "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 23:02:47 +0800"}
