Actually there is an\noption -r for the rholo command which is supposed to open the holodeck file\nonly for reading, but each time I try to use it with the destination hdk-file i\nget the following error:\n\nrholo: fatal - cannot create read-only holodeck\n\nIt doesn't matter how I use rholo, without or without -n/-o, this error appears\nevery time. Maybe I'm missing something about how to use this -r option? Or is\nthere another possibility just to view the content of a holodeck file without\nactually recalculating the rays?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nregards,\n\nOlga\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "O Graf", "datetime": "Fri Jun 25 17:47:11 2004"}
