You don't get a speed-up from parallel processing if you fail to set the -af option to share indirect values.  This is because you force each process to recompute the same values redundantly.  Add a -af option and see what happens.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD83LVJRUQ1v+Y4euFZPp0OOMmgJipbcM31OaHovuTsj8pVUcA@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 08:18:16 -0700"}
