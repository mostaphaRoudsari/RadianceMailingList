{"body": "\nSorry, I keep forgetting that I'm replying to the digest. Re-posted\nwith proper Subject line...\n\n\nJan Diepens of University of Technologie Eindhoven sent me a complete\nlist of RAL colours some time ago. I have to admit that they are still\nnot in the ColourPicker. I've put them up for your perusal:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/ral_mat.tgz\n\nIf anybody is going to translate the names to English, please bounce\nthe changes back to me for inclusion in the ColourPicker. The values\nwere measured with a Minolta chroma meter from samples. YXZ was then\nconverted to Radiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file, so the values\nshould be accurate.\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<100441490811070508v7b7a6d9emb612b60d49b3ad6a@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Nov  7 05:09:01 2008", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials.."}
