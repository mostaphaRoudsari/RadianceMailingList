{"body": "\nHi guys,\n\nI am not an expert with the radiance and i do not know if i am\nrepeating any simple stuff here.\n\nColour is a function of both the reflectivity and incident light.\n\nReflectivity itself is an intrinsic function and in this case i think\nwe are assuming lambertain( equal reflectance in all direction)\nmaterials.\n\nThe amount of light that is reflected off a surface would be dependent\non the spectral shape of the incident light and the reflectance.\n\nSo in order to talk about the color properties of different object we\nneed to measure its reflectance ( use of a spectrophotometer).\n\nPerhaps we can also include the type of incident light sources (\ntungsten / sunlight) if we want to talk about reflectivity\n\nCheers\ncw\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Nov 7, 2008 at 10:52 PM, David Smith <dbs176@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials..", "sender": "chang cw", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<da2acf910811070705x4ad100fbl1909ac3877b3c34c@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<694e132c0811070652t1077a518w16c333c4527309d5@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Nov  7 07:05:58 2008", "email": "solomoncw76 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials.."}
