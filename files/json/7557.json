{"body": "\nHi Germain,\n\nThe \"too many modifiers\" probably means that the mirrorfull_mat is\nbeing reused many times in your file.  You should define the material\nonce somewhere and reuse it in our your included scene files.\n\nAs for the nothing output, this is of course suspicious, but without\nseeing your input files, quite impossible to diagnose.  Perhaps you\ncould send those my way in an off-list e-mail and I'll take a look.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib - rad3R9_linux", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E34A6C68-20C5-40A2-A4A5-9705EFF889AE@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1226309216.4917fe6021a3b@webmail.epfl.ch>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov 10 11:49:19 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtcontrib - rad3R9_linux"}
