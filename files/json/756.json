{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nGurneet and I figured out the problem with falsecolor.  There was a\ndeclaration of errno in ev.c that has been deprecated, which was\ncausing a run-time error with the following message on some systems:\n\nIncorrectly built binary which accesses errno, h_errno or _res\ndirectly. Needs to be fixed\n\nTragically, this message was being spat to stdout rather than stderr,\nwhich then got passed to psign rather than being visible to the user.\n(Those whacky GNU compiler guys -- what a fun bunch they are!)\n\nThe solution is to take out the line \"extern int errno;\" from\nray/src/cal/ev.c and run \"rmake install\" in the ray/src/cal directory.\nThe source tree has been updated as well.\n\nSorry for the trouble!\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: problem with falsecolor", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B8AAE0A4-FE66-11D7-9668-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 14 Oct 2003 09:51:56 -0700", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: problem with falsecolor"}
