{"body": "\nSure, Rob.\n\nJust add \"-N 4\" to the \"set opts=\" line near the top of objview.  The\nrad program passes whatever is set with -N to the new rvu -n option.\n\nAs for using a saved view, the syntax:\n\nobjview -v \"-vf myview.vf\" octree\n\nshould work, but it doesn't because I forgot to put quotes around the\nargument to the -v option.  On line 35 of objview, fix it to:\n\nset vw=\"$argv[1]\"\n\nHopefully, that will work.  (I'll fix this for the next release and\nadd a -N option as well.)\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] objview & rvu -n", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4716CE0F-7F59-44D4-ACDC-D6242A649B37@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4925F3EA.5030807@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Thu Nov 20 17:32:13 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] objview & rvu -n"}
