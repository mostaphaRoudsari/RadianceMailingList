Are you expecting to see direct reflection of the sun that is missing? Are you expecting higher overall values? Are you seeing a direct reflection when you were expecting it to be scattered?\n\nYou mention the error occurs when the light shelf is less than 0.5m. Is it 0.5m square? Or is it 0.5m by some longer length? Also, what are the dimensions of the room it's in? And is there a lot of additional geometry outside of the room, like the rest of a building, or even surrounding buildings? How large is everything outside the room?\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121112/794b16d2/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] reflector siz", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Mon, 12 Nov 2012 13:20:29 -0500"}
