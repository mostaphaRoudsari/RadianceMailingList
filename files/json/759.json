But now I would like to generate a false-color image of the\nilluminance values on a plane .8m above the floor. I can easily do\nthe floor (or walls, etc.) with a parallel projection view, but I\ndon't see how to get the workplane illuminance values without creating\nan opaque surface at the correct height which would change the light\ndistribution. Does anyone know of a way to specify a \"virtual\" surface\nor other technique to do this?\n\nThanks,\nJim Estes\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jim Estes", "datetime": "Sun Jun 27 23:02:29 2004"}
