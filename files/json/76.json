After giving it a try for myself, i\nam now agreeing with you that the -i option of rpict does produce incident\nirradiance values.  I haven't yet tried this out on a visualisation\nincluding specular highlights, but have no reason to believe that the\nspecular highlights will appear and make the results meaningless.\n\nSeems that, without looking into the source code, i was mislead by the\n(all-too-brief) explanation in the Radiance manual.\n\nThanks again,\nPhil G.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] re: trans material with sunless sk", "tags": [], "sender": "Phillip Greenup", "datetime": "Wed, 19 Dec 2001 14:38:59 +1000"}
