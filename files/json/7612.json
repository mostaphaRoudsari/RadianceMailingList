Certainly this is\nimportant, but ambient resolution (-ar) can have a significant impact on\nresults followed by the other ambient related parameters (-ad, -as, -av).\n\nI note that in an earlier post of yours regarding \"reflector size\" you\nshow parameters with -ar 32. Although I have no idea of the size of your\nspace, this seems low to me.\n\nI think if you are doing a design comparison and looking at performance,\nyou need change as few variables as possible between design scenarios.\nIdeally, in this case, the only \"variable\" that should change between\nsimulation runs is light shelf or no light shelf. That way your\ncomparison is not undermined by questions of other varying parameter\nsettings.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 11/19/2012 9:16 AM, Christopher Rush wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121119/7fc29917/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] lightshelf simulati", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 09:29:24 -0500"}
