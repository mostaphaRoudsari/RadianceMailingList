I fixed it manually all the time by editing Version.c (which should be aut-generated by the makefile). As it just happened again to me, I wanted to share that the reason for the incomplete Version.c when installing on a standard Debian.\n\nRadiance depends on the editor \"ed\" to create it using a template file. If you install it, make install will hopefully pass without errors. So in case you expect such problems, type apt-get install ed (as superuser)...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
