{"body": "\nHi,\n\n\nIf you'd add something like 'under the same license as Radiance is\npublished' or 'and publish them under the MIT or BSD license', then the\nresults could be published and distributed together with radiance and\ncould be used for whatever people need to use them. Only 'sharing' does\nnot mean you're allowed to use them in (commercial) projects later.\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nGPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Material database - taking measurements", "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4915A8A7.7000505@bzed.de>", "refs": ["<100441490811070928web4563bs198d9343e81e4b60@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Nov  8 06:55:50 2008", "email": "bernd at bzed.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Material database - taking measurements"}
