The *Tforward.xml* was generating using genBSDF on a simple clear\nwindow, and the Daylight and View matrix were computed folowing the Andy\nMcNeil tutorial.\n\nI tend to think it is a problem in the configuration of Ubuntu? I mean, the\npermissions or something. But I do not know how to fix it.\n\n2012/12/4 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121204/544f10fe/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Persistent problems on dctimestep and Insta", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 07:36:25 -0400"}
