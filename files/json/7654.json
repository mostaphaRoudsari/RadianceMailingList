Randolph Fritz can get you a copy of the Rendering with Radiance text, which is the rosetta stone for figuring out a lot of Radiance's underpinnings. As far as CAD you can use just about anything, but there are some tools for specific CAD programs that make life easier going from CAD, to RAD. Thomas Bleicher has the su2rad program which allows you to take a SketchUp model and convert it to a Radiance project, complete with a GUI for assigning materials and the like. The DIVA for Rhino project facilitates the use of Rhinoceros models in Radiance. OpenStudio also leverages SketchUp for geometry creation, but allows you to convert the thing to Radiance as well.\n\nlinkage:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/su2rad/\nhttp://diva4rhino.com\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n________________________________________\nSent: Tuesday, December 04, 2012 9:02 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi,\n\nSomething that has worked for me until now (I am still learning) is to follow the tutorials (http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials) from the basics, and to read the mailing list e-mails every now and then.\n\nUntil now I have not used any other CAD interface than SketchUp, so I am useless in that area.\n\nGerm?n\n\n2012/12/4 Tim Fikkert <tfikkert at ameriluxinternational.com<mailto:tfikkert at ameriluxinternational.com>>\n\nWhat does someone need to get started using Radiance? Computer, Cad versions, etc. Is there any beginners resource for this program?\n\nTim  Fikkert\n\n920-632-6064<tel:920-632-6064>\n\nAmeriLux International\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Getting Started", "tags": [], "sender": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "datetime": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 09:19:45 -0700"}
