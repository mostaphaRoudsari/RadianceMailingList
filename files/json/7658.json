{"body": "\nMark,\n\nThat's where gamma values come in. Let's say the RGB values of a paint\nsample from EasyRGB are (125,150,175), a blue gray. Take each channel,\ndivide by 256, take the result to the power of 2.2 (monitor gamma) and\nthen multiply by 256.\n\nR = (125/256)^2.2 * 256 = 52.9\nG = (150/256)^2.2 * 256 = 79.0\nB = (175/256)^2.2 * 256 = 110.9\n\nIf you put the resulting values (52.9,79.0,110.9) in as the R G and B\nmaterial colors, you should get the correct paint color in your\nsimulation that matches the physical paint color.\n\n--Dave\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "David Smith", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<694e132c0811061457h201ee2d2m6b81d9393cd71f5@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Nov  6 14:57:41 2008", "email": "dbs176 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials.."}
