At this point, we should take the discussion off-list to work out what is going wrong with your compile and/or operation on Ubuntu.  I will send another e-mail shortly.  Do not reply to this one.\n\nWe will post a summary of what we find to the list when the issue is resolved.  There may be some delays as I am presently on vacation.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20121204/9d771cdf/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Persistent problems on dctimestep and Insta", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 08:53:40 -1000"}
