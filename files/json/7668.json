I can understand that the upper limit is not hard (as Kevin said, it can be argued that such a limit does not make sense at all, which is still kind of an open discussion). Still I find it tricky to reference a UDI metric with all these definitions. I tend to use John's climate-based-daylighting.com as a (moving) reference, which would lead me to \"latest revision of UDI-e is >3000lx.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] UDI upper limits", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
