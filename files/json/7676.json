You can double-click the rvu.exe file and load an octree from there, or from the command line you can just type \"rvu your_model.oct\".\n\nI am working on updated installers this week as well, so stay tuned for an update announcement.\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\nOn 12/12/12 12:16 AM, \"mazhi1982\" <mazhi1982 at gmail.com<mailto:mazhi1982 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi,\n\nI have downloaded \"Standard Windows one-click installer: radiance-4.2.a-win32.exe<http://openstudio.nrel.gov/accept/file/1043><http://openstudio.nrel.gov/accept/file/1043>\" , but i don't know how to run Qt-based rvu on Windows Xp.\n\nBest Regards,\nMZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] [Radiance-dev] About Cross Platform GUI rvu", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Wed, 12 Dec 2012 10:03:27 -0700"}
