{"body": "\nHello All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to compare the difference in glare given off a building\nafter a cladding retrofit (from the perspective of occupants in\nneighboring buildings). The original curtain wall cladding is a\nwhite/grey marble and glass spandrel panels with a white patterned frit\nare proposed for the retrofit. This is my first time using the software\nand I am using Radiance in IES' Virtual Environment Program.\n\n\n\nI have some questions about determining/selecting material properties,\nspecifically deciding what material type (plastic/metal) and secularity\nto use for the two cladding options.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy assumptions:\n\n\n\nMarble - Originally white, but panels have become grey with dirt over\ntime, not polished, dull finish\n\nType:                Plastic\n\nColour:             (0.91, 0.91, 0.83)\n\nSpecularity:       ?????? (I think this may be low because it is not\npolished marble)\n\nRoughness:      0.05 (???)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlass Frit - Composed of: Clear glass, 60% coverage white frit, clear\nglass, 100% coverage white frit. From Window 6, I estimate the solar\nreflectance of the system to be around 25-35%.\n\n\n\nTyple:               Metal ??? (Does the frit have specular and diffuse\nreflection of light?)\n\nColour:             (1.0,1.0, 1.0)\n\nSpecularity:       ????? (Clean polished glass)\n\nRoughness:      0.00\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone has information from doing a similar simulation or has any\nsuggestion on what specularity values I should use to model these\nmaterials it would be very much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nNastassja\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081104/c11fb4fe/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Pearson, Nastassja", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5AD4CD82E@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Nov  4 06:50:55 2008", "email": "npearson at halsall.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Determining Specularity Values - SpandrelPanels: Marble vs Fritted Glass"}
