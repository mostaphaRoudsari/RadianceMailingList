{"body": "\nHi Nastassja,\n\nThe identified glare sources are shown with their average luminance\nin cd/m^2.  The shape shown does not correspond necessarily to the\nactual shape of the sources.  The shape shown is the centroid of the\nactual source with the estimated source solid angle drawn as a circle\n(which may appear as an ellipse depending on the view projection used).\n\nDoes this clear up your confusion?\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Quantifying Glare Sources", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2AD1D381-D509-4B63-AADD-E92C48562177@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5AD4CD874@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Dec  3 09:14:06 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Quantifying Glare Sources"}
