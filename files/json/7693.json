Will this lead to over-estimation of illuminance when using cumulative\nsky derived from \"global horizontal radiation\" ?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n- Ji\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130102/fe7b11cf/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Ji Zhang", "datetime": "Wed, 2 Jan 2013 00:36:24 +0800"}
