{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nI'm pretty sure its a question how you modeled the end of your \"light-pipe\".\nPhoton mapping is doing an density estimate to calculate the radiance\nand is searching for photons in the nearby.\nUnfortunately the algorithm is doing this also for surfaces , which are\n\"leaving\" a closed space. For example, if you have a closed box and you\nadd a surface to the scene, which is half inside and half outside the\nbox, you will get light into the box.\nYou can avoid this phenomena, if you really \"close\" your pipe (I assume\nso  ;-)  ).\n\nThe question of photons and how many of them should be collected within\nthe density estimate cannot be answered without knowing more about the\nscene. Its similar to \"pure Radiance\", the parameter setting is depending\non the scene and materials.....  ;-)  .  Anyhow, 2000 for the \"collecting\"= bandwidth seems to be high for me.\nHave you also tested the bias compensation (-apcb) in order to reduce the splotches?\n\nBy the way, we will probably update photon-mapping for the 3.9 version\n(or the 4.0) version within the next half year, fixing also some bugs.\nThis depends on a new project probably launched in January.\n\nCheers,\n\nJan\n\nLars O.
