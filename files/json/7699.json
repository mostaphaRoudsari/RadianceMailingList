{"body": "\n\nI have looked at this in the past, but not recently, I admit.  The\nchief problem as I see it is that the photon map is implemented as an\neither/or strategy that's decided at compile time.  If it were\nimplemented as a separate module, there would be no question of\nincluding it in the distribution.  However, since the implementation\nis intimately entangled in the main rendering code, there are\nmaintenance issues that I cannot resolve.  When I go to change or add\nsomething, I don't understand the pmap add-on well enough to know\nwhat I'm doing won't break it.  In other words, including the pmap\nmodule as written means I would have to be done developing Radiance,\nessentially.\n\nIn my opinion, the best solution would be to create a separate tool\nusing the photon map to replace mkillum in certain circumstances.  I\nam starting to head this direction with my rtcontrib developments,\nthough I also need to add support for BRTDfunc and other material\ntypes for this to be complete.  Such a solution would do well for\ndaylighting systems, but wouldn't achieve the caustics that many\nconsider the most valuable contribution of the photon mapping method.\n\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] experiences with the photon map", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<07F2446D-4883-4AB6-B5C8-A81A430F2754@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<49378E3A.8050803@gmx.net> <4938DB56.7070208@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<4938DF21.5000804@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Fri Dec  5 08:51:00 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] experiences with the photon map"}
