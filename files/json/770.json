{"body": "\nHi Karen,\n\nNo one ever responded to your query, so I thought I'd offer some\ngeneral ideas, since I've never done this myself.\n\nOne thing you could try is creating a mask in Photoshop by drawing into\na separate alpha layer over the area you want to average and saving the\nlayer out as a grayscale TIFF.  (Start in Photoshop from the\nfull-resolution original converted to TIFF using ra_tiff.)  Reverse\nthis through ra_tiff to get a Radiance picture you can then feed to\npcomb, like so:\n\n% ra_tiff -r mask.tif mask.pic\n% pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)*li(2)' -o orig.pic mask.pic | pvalue -d -b -h -H |\ntotal\n\nTake this result, which will be a single number, and divide it by the\nsum over the mask:\n\n% pvalue -d -b -h -H mask.pic | total\n\nThis is your area average.  I'm assuming that you have made the mask\nwhite where you want it to average, and black everywhere else.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Average luminance or illuminance for a irregular shaped space", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D9F23788-261B-11D8-9814-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<3FC5074C.2020201@visarc.com> <007b01c3b50b$9edfca40$6400a8c0@Karenswindows>"], "datetime": "Wed, 3 Dec 2003 21:36:46 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Average luminance or illuminance for a irregular shaped space"}
