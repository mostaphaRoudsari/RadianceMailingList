Version 2 includes animatable\nmaterials and geometry, dynamic daylight simulation capability and\nartificial lights via IES files.\nDetails and download at\nhttp://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi\nVersion 0.2 should be fairly 'stable' but bug reports, questions and\nfeature requests are most welcome.
