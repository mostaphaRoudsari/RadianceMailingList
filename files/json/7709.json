{"body": "\n\n\nLars,\n\nIt won't be of much help to you probably, but EN 12464-1:2002 (paragraph\n4.2) gives you a range of reflectances for interior surfaces:\n? ceiling: 0,6 to 0,9\n? walls: 0,3 to 0,8\n? working planes: 0,2 to 0,6\n? floor: 0,1 to 0,5\n\nFor similar lighting evaluations we normally use: ceiling 70%, walls 50% and\nfloor 10% or 20%.\n\nCasper Esmeijer\n\n\n...\nI have seen the assumption of 80%, 50%, 20% neutral grey levels for\noffice spaces quite a lot, but I wonder if there is anything like a\nstandard for a \"generic\" office environment anywhere. Does anyone have a\nlink to a recommendation what to use when doing studies on an office\nspace whose surface properties are not known yet?\n\nThank you, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<493F9256.1080807@gmx.net>", "sender": "Casper Esmeijer", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<LAEELIFELGJCEOKFMDAAKEHNCIAA.C.Esmeijer@mook.peutz.nl>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Dec 10 04:41:32 2008", "email": "C.Esmeijer at mook.peutz.nl", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Reference reflectances for office spacesurfaces?"}
