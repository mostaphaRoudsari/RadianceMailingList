From\nOBJ you then use the Radiance tools obj2rad or obj2mesh to convert the\ngeometry into a Radiance native format. You have to experiment with these\ntools to find a modeling and exporting workflow that suits your needs.\n\nBRD-CAD also includes sample source code for non-CSG exporters (ie. face\nbased geometry like it's used in Radiance). It should not be too difficult\nto write a native Radiance exporter based on this - if you know C, of\ncourse.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Wed, Jan 2, 2013 at 3:06 PM, Philippe de Rochambeau <phiroc at free.fr>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130105/bdd22c0a/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRL-CAD 7.22", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Sat, 5 Jan 2013 09:09:04 -0500"}
