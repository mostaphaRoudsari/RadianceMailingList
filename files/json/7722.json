{"body": "\nHi Jan, Lars:\n\nIt's important when discussing these material types to be aware of\nwhat works and what doesn't.  While I concede that the BRTDfunc type\ndoes not account for the sky correctly in it's \"directional-diffuse\"\ncomponent, the diffuse and specular components are done properly.  In\nthe case of a glazing system that has a mixture of specular peaks\n(reflected and transmitted) and diffuse (e.g., scattering from frit),\nthe BRTDfunc does a perfectly adequate job.  This is why it is\nemployed in the glaze script and other places to represent glazings.\nYou'll notice that the directional-diffuse part of the glaze output\nmaterials are zero.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: BRTF for glazing", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4E8957AD-1A8F-44C1-B2C9-8973B26F869D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<49378E3A.8050803@gmx.net>\t<4938DB56.7070208@ise.fraunhofer.de>\t<4938DF21.5000804@gmx.net>\t<4938F959.6040208@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<493FAB44.2050805@gmx.net> <49403579.7040704@ise.fraunhofer.de>"], "datetime": "Thu Dec 11 08:52:12 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: BRTF for glazing"}
