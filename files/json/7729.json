After that, I tried using the HEAD release from some days ago, on Linux, and same deal \"Segmentation fault (core dumpted)\".\n\nThe same sky, without the O option does not return an error, but whenever I put O1, O2 or O0, it throws back a segmentation fault.\n\nIs this a known issue? what can I do to avoid it?\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\nGerman Molina\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaylit -O segmentation fault", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Mon, 14 Jan 2013 13:43:39 -0700"}
