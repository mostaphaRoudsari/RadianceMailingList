{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nI'd like to create a library of packaged luminaire geometry and photometric\n(.IES) data that I can drop into my scenes. However, it seems as though the\nphotometric data will only last through one oconv command. It's the same\nbehavior if the octree is frozen or not, and all of the files remain in the\nsame directory. The geometry itself works just fine. Should I just stick to\nxform-ing RAD files (I was under the impression that OCT instances saved\nmemory) or is there something I'm overlooking?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers,\n--Dave\n\n\n\nHere's an example that (I think) should have two light sources:\n\n#[test.rad]\nvoid plastic mat 0 0 5 .4 .4 .4 0 0\n!genbox mat box 250 250 1\nvoid instance lightsource 5 light.oct -t 100 100 100 0 0\n!xform -t 200 200 100 light.rad\n#[/test.rad]\n\nCommands:\nies2rad -dm/1000 light.ies\noconv -f light.rad > light.oct\nobjview test.rad\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081216/7cc8a8b9/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "dbs176@gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<001636164aa76ebe4d045e2e8e07@google.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Dec 16 10:59:20 2008", "email": "dbs176 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Oconv and IES photometrics"}
