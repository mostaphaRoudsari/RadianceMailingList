While doing so, I had to make sample\nrenderings of lots of mountains. So, if you like mountains and like\nRadiance, you might like these images.\n\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/shops/TinyMtn\n\nI hope the renderings are good enough to warrant the shameless plug.\n\nDetails:\n\nMy own rockpng program converted the 16-bit PNG heightfield to a trimesh.\nMeshlab-server did some automatic processing on the mesh. I used GMSH to\ngenerate text and Carve to union that text with the model (all F/OSS).\nModels are 500k-900k triangle Wavefront .obj files (easy to read and\nwrite), converted to Radiance mesh format for rendering. The room was\nmodeled after my living room (down to including two large green trees out\nthe two windows), and rendering used an imagemap of my stone coffee table\nand some rpict depth-of-field with -aa 0 -ab 3 -ad 16 for ambient settings\nand -ps 1 -u+ -w- -lw 1.e-3 -ds 0.2 -dj 0.7 for rendering. The raw .hdr\nimages were dropped to 8bpp first, then reduced 4:1 for the site (less\nnoise doing it in that order).\n\nMark\nmarkjstock.org\ntinymtn.com\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Fri, 18 Jan 2013 10:29:44 -0500 (EST)"}
