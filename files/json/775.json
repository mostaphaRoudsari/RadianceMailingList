Conventional\nmodelling architectural black/white card display board. The reflectance\nvalue for black mounting board was measured by Cannon-Brookes (1996) and is\nquoted at 8.5%. A standard 60W incandescent light bulb was also fitted to\nthe dark box to fit into the recessed aperture, and was made removable for\ndaylight monitoring whereby the recessed aperture acted as a window or sky\nlight (without glass). I take your points though, that scale will influence\nthe final results, and in absence of good data for the GE 60W standard light\nbulb I am using, its not good scientific comparison.\n\nAnyway, I am more interested in the accuracy of the program with respect to\n*daylight* rather than electric lighting. To date, I can only locate your\nown work to the accuracy of the Radiance accuracy with daylight (as in the\nRwR manual)...\n\nJust on this point....does anyone know of any other references that have\ncompared daylight measurements with Radiance? would be great to include them\nin my literature review.\n\nIt would be nice to model this simple box I have constructed in two\npositions = recessed roof light, and recessed side window, facing each\norientation on overcast and sunny days. I could then create the model of the\nbox to scale (1=1) in Radiance and compare results with monitored values on\nthe roof of the campus building here in Dublin. What do you think about\nthis? or can you suggest some ways of enhancing the tests?\n\nKind Regards,\n\n\nAnthony\nDublin Institute of Technology\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]On Behalf Of\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org\nSent: 30 June 2004 18:05\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner@radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

Your little trick would work.  I don't think he\nreally needs it, though, since he already has a method for generating\nthe grid points for rtrace.  He can simply increase the resolution of\nthe grid he already has (as Raphael suggested) and/or upsample the\nresult using pfilt.  Or your method.

I understand that colorpict\nmultiplies the material color components with those of the picture.\n\nIf I have a grayscale image processed by normpat (which means that the\naverage gray value is 1.0) and apply it to a material, the overall\ncolor and brightness will remain the same. So I get the \"pattern\" from\nthe image, but the surface still has the correct material properties\n(color, brightness etc). I used this so far.\n\nNow I want to use a colored picture for mapping. I also apply normpat\nto it, so, as far as I understand, the average of all R, G and B must\nbe 1.0, right? For example, I use a normpat'ed picture of green marble.\nI than apply this using colorpict to a surface, which has a \"marble\"\nmaterial. Will the overall color and brightness still be that of the\ndefined material, as the picture map has the average of 1.0?\n\nThe background: I try to use exact data for material definitions, but\nthe image maps can't all be color corrected. So I want the overall\ncolor and brightness from defined materials, e.g. from the plastic\nmaterial, and use the map only for what I would call \"local color\nvariation\". The reason is that I have e.g. red marble, got its color,\nbrightness and all that defined as plastic marble. But the marble has\nblue particles which won't appear if I use a grayscale imagemap. So I\nwant to use a normpat'ed (NOT colorcorrected e.g. by macbethcal!) to\nbring these blue parts onto the surface. The whole surface however must\nstill have the average color of my plastic marble material.\n\nIf I understand the man-page of normpat, that's just what it was\ninvented for. However, I am a bit unsure, as all Radiance documentation\nuses colorpict with a bright white material.\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n--\nLars O.

I believe that you DO want\nto use macbethcal to callibrate the color values of the image and\ndetermine an estimated reflectance. Then using normpat on the image will\nmove the values in image so the average is 1.0.\n\nSo steps as follows:\n\n1. acquire sample material image by photography, scan....\n2. callibrate sample image with macbethcal\n3. use callibrated sample image to estimate average color\n4. calculate reflectance based on average color values, grey(r,g,b)\n5. normpat the callibrated image\n\nThen create material as follows:\n\nvoid colorpict color.image.pattern\n7 red green blue <normpat picture>.pic picture.cal Px Py\n0\n1 <aspect>\n\ncolor.image.pattern plastic color.image.material\n0\n0\n5 <grey(r,g,b)> <grey(r,g,b)> <grey(r,g,b)> <s> <r>\n\nSince the colorpict is normalized to an average value of one, it will\nmodify the plastic around the reflectance of the plastic. For example,\nif colorpict returns 1.1 for red then the red of the plastic will be 10%\nbrighter.\n\nIn short I think that there are two main ways to use colorpict\n\n1. final reflectance set by colorpict image - colorpict is used to\nset final reflectance of material, that is use callibrated image\ncolorpict modifier and material with reflectance of  1.0\n2. final reflectance set by base material - colorpict is used to\nmodify reflectance set by material, that is normpat image\ncolorpict modifier is used to modify reflectance set by material\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack\n\nLars O.

Ah, that's better.\n\n(even\n\nThe results you get are likely to depend on the size of the box\nand the type of lamp, not to mention a few other factors.\n\nYou could model the bulb as a luminous sphere.  But you'd have to know\nwhat the luminance of the bulb was.  Also, a sphere light source is not\nsubdivided, i.e. it is sampled by a single ray (p511 RwR).  Which may\ncause problems if the box is small compared to the bulb.  A 'frosted'\nor pearl bulb may have a largely isotropic luminous output, provided you\ndon't see too much of the (luminous) shank where it connects to the\nsocket.  Any measured output distribution (say, IENSA) would, I guess,\nbe sensitive to the type of lamp.  And it would assume a 'point source'\ndistribution, even though you would model it as, say, a disc or polygon.\n\nSquinting at my desk lamp through a pinched-finger aperture (hence the\nspots) revealed that the uniform luminance of the pearl bulb was an\nillusion - much of the output of the bulb is from around the filament.\n\nIn sort, I suspect that any comparison between measurement and predictions\nfor your bulb & box will say much about the precision of the photometry,\nmaybe a little bit about the limitations of single ray light source\nsampling,\nand not much at all about the intrinsic accuracy of Radiance for realistic\narchitectural scenarios (electric or daylighting).  The direct light source\ncalculation for small angular light sources (e.g. 'spherical' bulb from\nseveral feet away with no occlusion) is pretty much a 'no brainer' and\nRadiance will give a result that is near as dammit to the exact solution.\nWhen you get close up to a non-ideal bulb however, then it's a matter of\ngetting the photometry right.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\njm@dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\n<radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nMessage-ID:\n<84F05BA9118BBD4A8FC6409808CE266C113AE1@ENGRMAIL2.engr.psu.edu>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"utf-8\"\n\nAnthony,\n\nYou can download an IES photometric file for a PAR 60W incandescent narrow\nflood from Osram Sylvania at\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/60PAR30.CAP.NFL25.ies\n<http://www.personal.psu.edu/mum13/60PAR30.CAP.NFL25.ies>\n\nUse  \"ies2rad 60PAR30.CAP.NFL25.ies\"\n\nThis will create the file \"60PAR30.CAP.NFL25.rad\" in metric units (meters).\n\nI never saw photometric files for simple incandescent lamps.\n\nI am currently running a fairly accurate simulation in AGI32 V1.7, which\nwill complete in 3 hours for a simple empty box 3X3X3 meters and one PAR\nlamp.\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wed 6/30/2004 7:42 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nCc:\n\n\nI am currently carrying out basic validation techniques of the Radiance\nsoftware using a black box and standard 60Watt bulb therein.\n\nI cannot locate a standard incandescent 60W bulb (just bare hung from\nceiling, no lamp shade) on the desktop radiance program.\n\nCan anyone help me by way of an add on file for a standard light bulb (even\nif not 60W!) or refer me to a suitable IESNA file?\n\nKind regards\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5190 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl :\nhttp://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040630/0\n51f97e3/attachment-0001.bin\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nMessage-ID: <E5788A0C-CAB7-11D8-9111-000A959DDB22@gmx.net>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed\n\nHi Jack,\n\nthank You for the reply.\n\n\nI want to do this, I have the material values, the colorpict is just to\nadd some visual credibility ;-) But I also want to have the final\noverall (that means the average over the whole surface, like selecting\nan area in ximage vs. a point) color from the base material.\n\n\nSo, if I already have the rgb for the base material (which is plastic),\ndo I really have to calibrate (macbethcal) the picture map?\n\nMaybe I show you an example:\n--\n# porphyry red 1: values from ximage and macbethcal'ed pic\nvoid plastic porphyry_red_1\n0\n0\n5 .09 .06 .05 .02 0\n\n# non-calibrated normpat'ed pic\nvoid colorpict sophia_porphyry_red_1_pattern\n13 noop noop noop sophia_porphyry_red_1.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v\n-s .2 -rx 90 -rz 90\n0\n0\n\n# give alias the modifier as output from dxf2rad\nsophia_porphyry_red_1_pattern alias l_porphyry_red_1 porphyry_red_1\n--\nWill this be correct?\n\nTIA, CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
