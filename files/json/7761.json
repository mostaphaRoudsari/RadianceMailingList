{"body": "\nI am modeling (in Ecotect v5.6) a light pipe in a very simplistic manor, just as simple light with a profile of 1.0 for angles 0 to 50deg and 0.0 for all others (60deg to 180).\n\nThe radius is 10\" and a spec defines the luminous flux at 15000.\n\nSo I calculated the luminous intensity as 5681 candela, and plugged all the numbers into Ecotect:\n\n5681 cd\n15000 total lumens\n10\" radius\nand defined the profile (candela polar plot) as 1.0 (0 to 50deg) 0.0 (60 to 180deg)\n\nProblem #1\nThe first problem is that Ecotect does not seem to produce the same RGB radiance values as the 'lampcolor' program. When I export from Ecotect to Radiance with the above values the Radiance 'light' object has RGB values of 1416.6, but lampcolor produces 131.6 (for a ring of .254m radius (10\") and 15000 lm).\n\nSo I have to 'fake' out Radiance by entering a much lower value for total lumens in Ecotect so it will generate the correct (131.6 RGB values), a value of 1400 lumens in Ecotect gets close (132 RGB value).\n\nThere is the first question, why do I have to use 1400 lumens when it should be 15000?\n\nProblem #2\nThen, the second problem, even using 1400 lm I still get lux values in Radiance which are about 3 times greater than the electric light simulations in Ecotect!\n\nSo, what am I doing wrong?\n\nthank you in advanced for any feedback.\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081223/2449b99c/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "reichj@skyhibroadband.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<W561903178397191230056239@webmail5>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Dec 23 10:17:21 2008", "email": "reichj at skyhibroadband.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Lighting result discrepancies between Ecotectand Radiance"}
