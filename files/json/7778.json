However, just for future references, isn't it possible to\nevaluate the illuminance incident on a surface with trans or glass material\napplied?\nGreg: with respect to the -i rendering option or not, I must admit I simply\ndo not know enough to have a sufficient grasp on this. As I read it from\nthe manual -i basically determined if you consider radiance or irradiance\nand therefore subsequently if you consider illuminance or luminance. Do I\nunderstand that correctly?\n\nSorry for all the potential trivial and basic questions and thank you for\ntaking the time to answer them!\n\n--\nBest regards,\n\n*Martin Vraa Nielsen*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130125/e2df1997/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Martin Vraa Nielsen", "datetime": "Fri, 25 Jan 2013 10:49:49 +0100"}
