I\nam using the official Mac LBNL release (could not compile the Head one);\njust for you to know.\n\nIn the other hand; I am trying to see the difference between the BSDF\ngenerated when modeling a glazing using the \"glass\" primitive given by\nOptics; and the BRTDfunc given by the same program. For now everything\nsuggest that the second one will need much more rays to converge... am I\nright?\n\nI am expecting to see difference in the reflecting part, not in the\ntransmitted part.\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\nGerman\n\n2013/1/30 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130130/ee1772a8/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF -n option doubt", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 17:15:31 -0500"}
