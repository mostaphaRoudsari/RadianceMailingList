There were a number of bugs fixed in genBSDF and related procedures since the official 4.1 release, and you really should be using the HEAD for that.  Also, the -n option works much better in the latest code using the new rcontrib, although I expect you still won't see much of a boost for simple geometries.\n\nIf you use the Klems matrix to represent a BSDF, it won't resemble the output of Optics due to the spreading of the direct component in the former.  You might do a little better with a tensor tree representation, but a BSDF data file will never live up to a material model when it comes to sharp peaks.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130130/304cbd4c/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF -n option doubt", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 14:30:55 -0800"}
