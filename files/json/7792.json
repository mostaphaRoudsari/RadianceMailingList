{"body": "\nDear Neha,\n\nRadiance uses ray-tracing to perform lighting calculations in\nbuildings.  It is not configured for optical ray-tracing.  For such a\npurpose, you are better off with any of the number of commercial\npackages available (TracePro, Optics Lab, ORA LightTools, etc.)\nWhile it is *possible* to use Radiance for optical design, it is not\ngeared for it, and you won't find many people who have applied it to\nthis task.  I am just starting to work with it myself, but even the\naccurate definition of a lens given the lack of bicubic patches is\nproblematic.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] About Radinace - Lens material", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<21854D2F-B7D4-401E-84A7-A1937A2D4134@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<7b883ed90812260208j5189febbh424e7fcbbc245666@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Dec 27 08:35:05 2008", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] About Radinace - Lens material"}
