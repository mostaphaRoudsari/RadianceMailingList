The luminance efficacy of the sun is\nmuch lower than for the sky and this is taken into account by the model.\n\nSo for your case\n\ngendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -G 500 200\n\nyou get\n425 W/m? visible radiation\n\nif you use\n\ngendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -O 1 -G 500 200\nyou get\n695 W/m? solar radiation  which is +- the input radiation of\n500+200=700W/m?\n\nSo the results are as expected.\n\nThe included luiminance efficacy model works properly within gendaylit -\nat least a recently internal performed validation study on measured data\nshowed this.\n\nBy the way, my colleague will announce later today a major update of\ngendaylit, which have some significant improvements included.\n\nCheers,\n\nJan\n\n\n\nOn 01/31/2013 11:56 AM, Julien Boutillier wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
