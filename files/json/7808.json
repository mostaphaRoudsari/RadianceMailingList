It is understandable that the direct calculation was optimized by assuming the direction of the ray before and after transmission to be equal. Especially as thin dielectric volumes were the standard application before the glass modifier came into play. In our days, as we use the dielectric practically only for such exotic cases, one might have decided for a more flexible tracing rather than optimizing, as we have glass. In my current case, I can easily workaround the problem.\n\nStill I am having difficulties now to understand how Wendelin's correction can work if the direct ray would entirely miss the source. Applying a factor to a value of zero should not improve the result. Did you use an extended source of type glow? Or was it rather large, so that (most) rays were hitting it even though the direct calculation sent them towards the  wrong direction? It is hard to imagine how this would be possible e.g. with the sun as the only source.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130201/aa33ffea/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] usage of rtrace within a materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
