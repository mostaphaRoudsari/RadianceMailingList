I'm getting low overall illuminance values out of dctimestep so I'm not convinced the results are truly representative of the combination of model and weather data.\n\nHere's an example of data I've pulled out from the err file generated by gen_yearvec.bash, tested in gendaylit.\n\ngendaylit 2 1 8.5 -a -20.27 -o -148.73 -m -150 -W 1031 44 | genskyvec -c 1 1 1 -m 1 |cut -f1 |tr '\\n' ' ' >> testAirlie.vec\nsky clearness or sky brightness out of range 13.563423\t 0.052832\nBad sky description!\n\nCan anyone explain how these values are out of range? I know it seems like a very high direct normal and very low diffuse horizontal, but we're in tropical north Queensland, Australia, here, under sunny skies in December. (Well, I'm not, but the project in question is).\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn.\n\n\njohn at relume.com.au\n0411 519 738\nRelume Consulting\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130201/79b61cb0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Ford", "datetime": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 14:18:09 +1100"}
