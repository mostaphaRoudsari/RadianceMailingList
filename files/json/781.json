That is what I was not able to describe ;-)))\n\n\nYes, this is true, I was just guessing that it can't be that easy ;-)\n\n\nThat (the average) is necessary, while the details (e.g. those famous\nsprinkles and streaks and dots would be nice).\n\n\nIn fact, I hoped that this could be somehow done with the radiance\ntools in a script, I just don't know how. It's similar to what normpat\nis doing, only it doesn't normalize to 1/1/1, but to R/G/B values I\nknow as the average material color (->brightness). I think I will have\nto take a look at normpat to find out how it does that in detail -\nwould be a nice tool if it could bring pictures to (known) color values.\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
