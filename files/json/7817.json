Your glow is effective only in the indirect calculation. rtrace calculates irradiance on a virtual diffuse surface, so the glow is hit over at least one bounce.\n\nI have to admit that I tend to forget the exact behavior of rtrace here and cannot test it. The -I may internally increase -ab, but I would not expect it.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit Visible radiati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
