That means that whatever sky distribution you generated, it will not be considered in your calculation. If you really got the same results for your sky with -ab 0 and -ab 1, that means that you did not have any diffuse sky component in your scene. Maybe the input was out of the valid range of the Perez sky, and only the sun (which is modeled as light, not glow), was written to the sky description.\n\nTry it out yourself - create a scene with a 180 degrees source, modified by a glow definition of RGB 1, 1, 1. This should lead to an irradiance of RGB pi. With -ab 0, you will get zero irradiance, with -ab 1 and anything higher you get the expected 3.1416.... W/m2.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit Visible radiati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
