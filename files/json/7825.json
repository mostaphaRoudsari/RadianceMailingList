It might not work for everyone as is, but it should\nbe easy to modify the script to do what you want.\n\nThe script copied below does the following:\n- creates a directory in /Applications/Radiance/  with yesterday's date.\n- downloads the head and support files from radiance-online using wget\n- creates a bin directory in ray/ for the binaries\n- compiles the head using expect to answer prompts\n- copies cal files to the library directory\n- updates a symlink (current) to point to the new ray directory\n\nI keep the following in my .bash_profile:\nPATH=$PATH:/Applications/Radiance/current/bin\nRAYPATH=/Applications/Radiance/current/lib\nMANPATH=$MANPATH:/Applications/Radiance/current/doc/man\nexport PATH RAYPATH MANPATH\n\nWhile this is a not the standard installation location for binaries and\nlibraries, I like it because I can keep previous HEAD releases and go back\nto them if necessary and I can update the symlink to point to new binaries\nwithout having to restart the shell.\n\nI keep this script in a directory on my PATH so i just need to issue the\ncommand \"sudo installhead.bsh\" and get a new working head!\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n######### installhead.bsh #############################\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndir=`date -v -1d \"+/Applications/Radiance/%Y-%m-%d_HEAD\"`\n\nmkdir $dir\ncd $dir\n\nwget http://www.radiance-online.org/software/snapshots/radiance-HEAD.tgz\nwget http://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R0supp.tar.gz\n\nrm -r ray\n\ntar -xf radiance-HEAD.tgz\ntar -xf rad4R0supp.tar.gz\n\ncd ray\nmkdir bin\n\n\nexpect <<- FIN\nset timeout -1\nspawn ./makeall install\nexpect \"What is your preferred editor*\"\nsend \"\\n\"\nexpect \"Where do you want the executable*\"\nsend \"${dir}/ray/bin\\n\"\nexpect \"The Radiance Software License*\"\nsend \" \"\nexpect \"*Do you understand and accept the terms of this agreement*\"\nsend \"y\\n\"\nexpect \"*Please select your system*\"\nsend \"3\\n\"\nexpect \"*Where do you want the library files*\"\nsend \"${dir}/ray/lib\\n\"\nexpect \"*Do you want to change it?*\"\nsend \"n\\n\"\nexpect \"*export PATH*\"\nsend \"\\n\"\nFIN\n\ncp src/cal/cal/* lib/.\ncd ../../\nrm current\nln -s ${dir}/ray/ current\n\n######## end of installhead.bsh ###########################\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130205/acb1ad1b/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 10:52:21 -0800"}
