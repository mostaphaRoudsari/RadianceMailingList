The weather data I use has a\ncolumn with photometric units, and as I am interested in luminance and\nilluminance as the result of my simulations, I try to avoid introducing\nany additional conversion. One should however be aware that fields in\nweather data may actually be derived from models of luminous efficacy,\ntoo, as not every station measures both irradiance and illuminance...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit Visible radiati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
