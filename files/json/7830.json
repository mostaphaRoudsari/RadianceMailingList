As I understand transformations used\nare part of code Radiance code too.\nMy search on Internet was also futile (maybe wrong search keywords :)\n\nCan someone please point me to some site with such transformations or give\nsome equations here?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130213/79666e85/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "datetime": "Wed, 13 Feb 2013 09:43:47 +0100"}
