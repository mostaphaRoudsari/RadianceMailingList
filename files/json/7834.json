Unfortunately, the calculation depends on the projection, and there are several projections included in Radiance now. One simplification may be to reproject anything to e.g. an equisolid fisheye, where the solid angles of all pixels should be equal and could be calculated as the solid angle of the image divided by the amount of pixels.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Pixel to solid angle transformati", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
