{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nThanks for the advise. I have customised Ubuntu 7.10 for my needs and also\nhave a very old PC. So, I did not upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu.\n\nI tried the back-ports server from Ubuntu 7.10 but Synaptic as well as\napt-get did not report Radiance as available.\n\nWill now upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10 as per your recommendations.\n\nRegards,\nJiten\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nTo: \"Radiance general discussion\" <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nSent: Thursday, December 11, 2008 11:35 AM\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "grobe@gmx.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000601c95b62$173a7740$3b00a8c0@Jiten>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Dec 10 23:23:00 2008", "email": "\"Lars O.
