{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFor glazing definition we always use BRTDfunc material, which we define\npartly automatically partly manually.\nWe export each glazing layer from Optics5 (I don't have idea what you can do\nwhan you don't have access as administrator), and then combine them in BRTD\nfunc. If no data in Optics5 database, we use some estimated values for\ntransmittance and reflectance.\n\nFor transmittance/reflectance functions of each layer we use functions used\nin glaze output. For coated glazing also. I think glaze.csh has some\nfunctions for laminated glass too, but not sure.\n\nMarija.\n\n\nHi Jan, hi list,\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20081210/4860580f/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "<493FAB44.2050805@gmx.net>", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<124b40400812100408l388276b3w31d513b80fa2f693@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<49378E3A.8050803@gmx.net> <4938DB56.7070208@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<4938DF21.5000804@gmx.net> <4938F959.6040208@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<493FAB44.2050805@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Dec 10 04:08:30 2008", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] BRTF for glazing (was: experiences with thephoton map)"}
