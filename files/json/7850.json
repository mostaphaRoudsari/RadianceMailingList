And no, the GPU dctimestep is not needed for this to work (nor is that version of dctimestep in HEAD). Nope, gendaymtx works with all the standard Radiance tools. You simply need a weather file formatted the way it wants, which is the same format as a DAYSIM weather file. Andy McNeil notes that DAYSIM has a tool to convert the EnergyPlus weather file format (.epw) to the DAYSIM format. OpenStudio will be modified to automatically provide gendaymtx with the epw data in the format it expects. I noticed that gendaymtx also accepts weather data from STDIN, and that there is an option to feed it less than a full year (8760) of data. We will leverage this ability in OpenStudio for sure, as well.\n\nExciting times!\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS: RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Tuesday, February 19, 2013 12:25 PM Mountain Standard Time\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nCc: bldg-sim; radiance-openstudio\nGood to know!\n\nIs gendaymtx available in the HEAD version of Radiance?

These packages include the brand new 'gendaymtx' utility that greatly speeds up the annual calculation when using the daylight coefficient tools in Radiance.\n\nWe hope to add gendaymtx into the OpenStudio tool chain and workflow in the coming weeks, but in the meantime, I'm sure Greg would appreciate any feedback from users willing to try it out on their own, especially those Windows users out there. There's a man page explaining its use, and it's pretty straightforward.\n\nGrab yours here:\n\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\nOk, bye.\n\n-Rob Gee\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS: RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319<tel:303.275.4319>\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130219/51b3c677/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "gmolina1 at uc.cl>", "datetime": "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 13:16:31 -0700"}
