{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\n\nLars O. Grobe wrote:\nYes! And the higher the bandwidth is the more will be transferred in the\nthe \"dark\" space. But its only a problem, if the \"outside\" is very dark\nand no photons are stored there. Then, the density estimate searches for\nnearby photons and collects the \"wrong\" ones.\n\n\n\nWe will probably include BRTDfunc into pmap, but this is not clear now.\n\nA remark from me: I never use BRTF in RADIANCE now, since all the\nangular information you put into your model is lost for the glow\nmaterial. That means, if you model a specific sky luminance distribution\nand you are using BTDF-func, no angular information of your BTDF-model\nis used! It is treated lambertian ! And this is especially hard, if you\nwant to model a system, which is intended to redirect the bright zenith sky.\nIf I model advanced glazings, I use either standard glass and modify it\nby brightfunc or for high reflective materials I use a mixfunc of glass\n(+brightfunc) and metal. I always check the angular transmission and\nreflection of the model by a virtual measuement - and I also test, if it\nstill works for the sky.\n\nBut Greg  presented at the workshop the BTDF implementation into mkillum\n- this seems to me a very good approach to calculate the advanced window\nsystems! So this can probably solve your problem now. But I don't know,\nhow it treats the sky and if the angular information is also \"lost\".\nThis is also new to me - I haven't tested it yet.\nI have to admit, that we work here still with the 3.7 version (RADIANCE\nand pmap). No experience with 3.8.\nIf you are using pmap, don't use the -I option for rtrace - it is giving\nyou wrong values. This is one of the bugs we will solve in the near\nfuture. If you want to calculate the illuminance, you should calculate a\n180 degree fish-eye-picture at  your calculation points and integrate\nthe picture  (you can use findglare or evalglare to calc an illuminance\nfrom a picture)\n\nWell, this is not so easy to answer. It is also a problem of maintenance\n- we can maintain only, if we have funding. And we are still looking for\na volunteer  for that.....\n\nCheers,\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
