{"body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI am involved in the simulations of interior Venetian blinds in a\n10' wide, 18' long and 10' high\noffice room with one 6 ' by 6 ' window placed on the south\noriented wall. The window sill height is 3'.\nI am calculating Glare index at 4 reference points inside the\nroom.\n\nThere seems to be problem with glare Index. I am attaching the\nscript for Illuminance calculations and glare Index calculations.\nnewglares.csh is the file name for the glare script and\nfinalmultiplesim1.csh is the shell script used for illuminance\ncalculations.\n\nI just want to make sure that the scripts used are correct .. ?\n\nThank you\n\nG V DEEPAK\nGraduate student and Research Assistant\nM.E.
