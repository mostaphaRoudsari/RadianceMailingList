The old way of doing\ndctimestep for a single time step and looping requires the V, T &\nD matrices to be loaded and multiplied for each time step - clearly this\nisn't efficient for an annual run since the matrices don't change.\n\nThe updated version of dctimestep performs as well as the dctimestep?pu, is\nmore robust than dctimestep?pu (no segfaults when matrix dimensions don't\nmatch) and can handle rendered view matrices.\n\nYes, you gan give dctimestep a rendered view matrix and have hourly annual\nrenderings after about 2 hours.\n\nHope that helps,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Fri, Feb 22, 2013 at 6:57 AM, Germ?n Molina Larrain <gmolina1 at uc.cl>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130222/e31d42ee/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAF-iH4JGEXn2UQGZq0+MRiCndJYvN+pJLXgoG+Y6WGmHxx=OwQ@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 09:31:41 -0800"}
