Avoid using it, there are better, supported software around based\non current versions of Radiance.\n\nSecond, glare analysis is based on the pixel values. Thus I would not\nadjust anything in images that are supposed to be used for analysis. To\nmake sure that you are working with original pixel values, use pcomb -o\n: pcomb -o filtered.hdr > raw.hdr and use raw.hdr as input for all your\nanalysis.\n\nBut: Images generated by pcond -h can NOT be used for such analysis, and\nas far as I know, there is no way to revert the changes made to the\npixel values. The idea behind pcond -h is to give a visual impression\nwhat an scene would be perceived like by a human observer, which\nrequires changes to the pixel values beyond exposure settings.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 2\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\n<28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B052BD821F34 at AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nI would suggest it is good practice when using pcond -h to save the image\nas a low dynamic range file rather than .pic or .hdr, since pcond is meant\nto create nice looking pictures, not useful data.\ne.g.\npcond -h image.hdr | ra_ppm | convert ppm:- image.jpg\n\nThat way you never mix up .pic or .hdr files that contain adjusted and\nincorrect data values.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\nTHat's a good idea, Chris. I usually make it a habit to name my tone\nmapped .hdr files with a suffix that indicates to me that it's been run\nthrough the pixel wringer, and of course the header will also indicate\nthat the image is the product of pond, but your method eliminates the\nmiddle man. =)\n\n- Rob\n\nOn Feb 27, 2013, at 7:31 AM, Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>\nwrote:\n\nimage as a low dynamic range file rather than .pic or .hdr, since pcond is\nmeant to create nice looking pictures, not useful data.\nincorrect data values.\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 4\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\nThat's a good practice, and one I follow as well.  Since pcond output is\nmeant to be sent to a printer or low dynamic-range display device,\nconverting it to a lower bit-depth at the same time makes perfect sense.\nSome of the programs that convert to such formats have built-in\ntone-mappers that are similar to pcond but less sophisticated and faster.\nSee the ra_bmp '-e' option and the normtiff command.\n\n-Greg\n\nimage as a low dynamic range file rather than .pic or .hdr, since pcond is\nmeant to create nice looking pictures, not useful data.\nincorrect data values.\n----------\n2 different VLT:\nin order to reflect more accurate visual view showing the differences\nbetween clear and darker glass.\nused \"pcond -h\" on the images.\n\"pcond -h\" should be used prior to glare analysis.
