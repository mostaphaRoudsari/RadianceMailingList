What we are seeing here is really why I\ncreated an IES_gensky.py module that comes with SPOT and creates a clear,\npt cldy, and cldy skies according to IESNA recommendations (pre handbook\n10, not sure if there were any changes).  Software 2 (SPOT) uses\nIES_gensky.py (and IES_skybright.cal) for it's \"design day\" calculations\nand we are seeing the output from that.  It then uses weather data to\nadjust for its annual or specific day calculations.  In creating SPOT we\nfelt these \"design day\" skies were still good to review as it can give a\nbetter idea of the extremes a space might see.  Relying solely on Perez\nskies and weather data skies might not yield a perfectly sunny winter\nsolstice and while this may certainly be representative of a given climate\n(Seattle ;-) one cannot claim a sunny winter equinox will never exist.  Now\nthe town might be outside celebrating if this ever happens, making it all a\nmoot point, but I digress...\n\nHere are the numbers I get for a Boulder, CO equinox clear and sunny sky at\nnoon from TMY2 weather data, IES_gensky, and gensky\nWeather data = 7,893fc\nIES_gensky (5,000elev) = 9,416fc\nIES_gensky (0) = 8212fc\ngensky = 5823fc\n\nYour current SPOT sky is almost 2x that of gensky which should explain much\nof your interior discrepancies.  This sky did have an elevation adjustment\nfor 5,000ft.  I would recommend taking that out and just using 0 elevation\nwhich results in exact IES recommendations.  The elevation factor was\nderived from a weather study for higher elevation locations, and while I\nthink it works ok for really high elevations and high sun angles (it\nmatches our high mountain Colorado skies fairly well during the summer\nmonths) it does not seem to help the Boulder sky.  I guess there is too\nmuch smoke in the air ;-)\n\nI also looked at the difference in distribution and found none - which is\ngood as they both should be using the CIE recommended clear sky\ndistributions, just not the same magnitude.  I put the sky definitions into\nfiles and ran:\noconv 3_21_12.01_1.sky >  SPOTsky.oct\nrpict @calc.opt -vta -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vv 180 -vh 180 -x 1250\n-y 1250  SPOTsky.oct >  SPOTsky.hdr\noconv e12pm_gensky.sky >  Gensky.oct\nrpict @calc.opt -vta -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vv 180 -vh 180 -x 1250\n-y 1250  Gensky.oct >  Gensky.hdr\npcomb -e \"ro=ri(1)/ri(2);go=gi(1)/gi(2);bo=bi(1)/bi(2)\" SPOTsky.hdr\nGensky.hdr > SPOTgen_ratio.hdr (single back quotes on linux)\n\nyou can compare resulting illuminance (in fc) from these skies for global\nand all orientations like so:\necho 0 0 0 0 0 1 | rtrace @calc.opt -h -I -faa -ov  SPOTsky.oct | rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1*4.40805+$2*11.1436+$3*1.07777\" >  SPOTsky.dat\necho 0 0 0 1 0 0 | rtrace @calc.opt -h -I -faa -ov  SPOTsky.oct | rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1*4.40805+$2*11.1436+$3*1.07777\" >  SPOTskyE.dat\necho 0 0 0 0 -1 0 | rtrace @calc.opt -h -I -faa -ov  SPOTsky.oct | rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1*4.40805+$2*11.1436+$3*1.07777\" >  SPOTskyS.dat\necho 0 0 0 -1 0 0 | rtrace @calc.opt -h -I -faa -ov  SPOTsky.oct | rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1*4.40805+$2*11.1436+$3*1.07777\" >  SPOTskyW.dat\necho 0 0 0 0 1 0 | rtrace @calc.opt -h -I -faa -ov  SPOTsky.oct | rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1*4.40805+$2*11.1436+$3*1.07777\" >  SPOTskyN.dat\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 26, 2013 at 5:31 PM, Allison Bygott\n<Allison.Bygott at megroup.com>wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n211 North Public Road, Suite 220\nLafayette, CO 80026\n(303)946-2310\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130228/8e776718/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image002.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 3575 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130228/8e776718/attachment.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image006.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 784 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130228/8e776718/attachment.jpg>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image004.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 752 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130228/8e776718/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Randance and different sky descriptions", "tags": [], "sender": "Zack Rogers", "datetime": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 13:58:22 -0700"}
