While I agree it is not written up\nvery clearly, I do believe LEED intended a \"clear sky\" to be an IESNA\ndefined clear sky that would have a solar disc included and would use the\nIES standardized formulas for deriving the diffuse (via a zenith luminance)\nand direct illuminances.  LEED v4.0 (yet to be released) has this new\nsDA/ASE thing, have you had a chance to give that a spin?  The challenge\nseems to be in simulating blind control.\n\nCheers,\nZack\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 27, 2013 at 2:18 AM, John Mardaljevic <J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n211 North Public Road, Suite 220\nLafayette, CO 80026\n(303)946-2310\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130228/c45bc642/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Randance and different sky descriptions", "tags": [], "sender": "Zack Rogers", "datetime": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 14:10:45 -0700"}
