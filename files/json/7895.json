{"body": "\nHi Galen,\n\nI won't comment on the usefulness of your proposed study, other than\nto say it sounds interesting to me...  I do have a couple of\nsuggestions, however.\n\nThe output of Optics5 should not be used directly, but should be\npassed through the \"optics2rad\" script to get the desired angular\nbehavior from the selected glazing.  In the case of multi-layer\nglazing systems, you may be better off using the \"glaze\" script to\ndefine your material.  This script does a much better job modeling\nthe multiple reflections that occur in a double-glazed system.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Glazing transparency/reflectivity study", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<068220D8-FB37-43BB-A5C2-BE41D08A8F6B@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<A1A14AD0D93971429BCB2E82636833C071B372A345@AUEXC01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Jan 14 14:57:44 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Glazing transparency/reflectivity study"}
