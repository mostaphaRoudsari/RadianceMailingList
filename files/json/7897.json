Instead of adding 3 columns for each time step, it appears to be appending each time step to the end of the file.  This creates a problem when I try to run dctimestep, which gives me a \"system- header read error\".\n\nMy commands are something like this:\n\nepw2wea tacoma.epw  tacoma.wea\nrtcontrib -h- -faa -V+ -b tbin -bn 146 -m skyglow -f tregenza.cal < test.pts ${options} test.oct > daylightcoeffs.dc\ngendaymtx -m 1 -r -90 weather/tacoma.wea > weather/tacoma.smx\n| dctimestep -n 8760 daylightcoeffs.dc weather/tacoma.smx > test_illuminance.dat\n\nThanks for any insight on this nifty new tool.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Galen Burrell", "datetime": "Mon, 4 Mar 2013 16:11:50 -0800"}
