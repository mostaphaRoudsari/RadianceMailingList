{"body": "\nDear Galen,\n\nI have been following your discussion regarding modeling of glazing types\nand was hoping you might be able to point me in the right direction. Your\ndiscussion so far seems rather relevant to the issue with which I am\nconcerned. I have little familiarity with Radiance or writing scripts for\nRadiance, however.\n\nI am doing a comparative study of glazing types for illuminance levels on\nthe interior of a large atrium space lighted by a barrel vaulted skylight.\nI am using Ecotect and exporting to Radiance, allowing Radiance to render\nthe image and then re-importing the point data back into Ecotect for\ngraphic representation and interpretation. The specific glass types I am\ntrying to model are Viracon's VE340, VE340 with 30% grey frit and VE340\nwith 50% grey frit. Viracon provided the .rad files from Optics, but the\nresults I am obtaining don't seem to correlate. I suspect it has something\nto do with the Optics output and how it deals with a frit. I have attached\nthe files and was hoping you could provide some insight.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTed Biro\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VE340-NFRC 6057+Clear-NFRC 103_glass.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 714 bytes\nDesc: VE340-NFRC 6057+Clear-NFRC 103_glass.rad\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090115/ee6285ce/VE340-NFRC6057Clear-NFRC103_glass.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VE340-30%V175+Clear-NFRC 103.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 708 bytes\nDesc: VE340-30%V175+Clear-NFRC 103.rad\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090115/ee6285ce/VE340-30V175Clear-NFRC103.obj\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VE340-50%V175+Clear-NFRC 103.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 708 bytes\nDesc: VE340-50%V175+Clear-NFRC 103.rad\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090115/ee6285ce/VE340-50V175Clear-NFRC103.obj\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "biro0013@umn.edu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<Prayer.1.0.16.0901152255590.8119@vs-a.tc.umn.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jan 15 20:55:59 2009", "email": "biro0013 at umn.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fritted glass script for Radiance"}
