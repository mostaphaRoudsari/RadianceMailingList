Core dumps in general should not happen, but can if the command line arguments are badly wrong since some programs don't check argument counts carefully.  I think the new rcontrib does, but I don't know for sure about rtcontrib.  In any case, I don't see anything obvious here.  What happens when you type \"rtcontrib -version\" by itself on the command line?  What happens if you type \"rcontrib -version?\"\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130306/96fc4545/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] three-phase method", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 6 Mar 2013 08:54:44 -0800"}
