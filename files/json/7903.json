I have been unsuccessful, so far, to generate  more than\ntwo reflections.  I would appreciate any help in generating the 3rd, 4th\nand subsequent reflections.  I would be happy to send images to anyone\ninterested.\n\nShamim Javed\nPhD Candidate\nCollege of Architecture and Urban Studies\nVirginia Tech\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130311/557e2b7e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Shamim Javed", "datetime": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 08:31:54 -0400"}
