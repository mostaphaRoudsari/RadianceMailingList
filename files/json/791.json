I\nmanaged to find a website for this product\n(http://www.thefarleyceiling.com/default.asp), but it is a bit thin on\ninfo.  From what I can tell, this is just a fabric panel.  Is this\ncorrect, or is part of the system the skylight well above the panel?\nEither way, judging from the photos on the website, is seems like a\nsimple job for plastic & trans (and illum sources!), to model this in\nRadiance.\n\nCan you share more info about this ceiling system?\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] The Farley Ceilings - parameters for TRANS", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<402276BF.9090202@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<E6494AE57E6C1343B133D3B383992458036C39@sbs1.sbs>"], "datetime": "Thu, 05 Feb 2004 12:00:47 -0500", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] The Farley Ceilings - parameters for TRANS"}
