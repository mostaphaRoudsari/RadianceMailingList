{"body": "<77F8075E-A343-4A9A-867D-A4F15D7CC1BE@arcor.de>\n\nThanks Lars and Thomas,\n\nIt is working !!\nI copied the rayinit.cal and skybright.cal into project folder.?Now \"rpict: command is working. Image is rendered and i am able to see in HDR shop.\n\nWell i am not a expert unix guy....?just started with cygwin..... to install radiance ....i refered?\" install.txt\"\nRadiance 3R9 for Cygwin 2005-08-03\nHOW TO INSTALL IT QUICKLY ...\n1. Launch the Cygwin console (double-click on the Cygwin desktop icon)? 2. Change to root directory (don't type the dollar sign):??? $ cd /\n3. Create the \"opt\" directory:???? $ mkdir /opt?? 4. Create the \"radiance\" directory inside /opt:???? $ cd /opt ,?? $ mkdir radiance\n5. Copy the radiance_cygwin_3R9.tar.gz inside C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance 6. Extract the archive: $ cd radiance .....?? used win rar instead of? ..$ tar zxvf radiance_cygwin_3R9.tar.gz? 7. Copy the bash_profile file to your home directory:???? $ cp bash_profile >> ~/.bash_profile? ( Instead i did copy paste in windows)??8. Close the Cygwin console.? 9. Re-launch the Cygwin console. 10. Enjoy!\n\nNow i really want to fix the problem of PATH for future. Therefore i am explaining my directory structure.\nUnder cygwin\\home\\abc directory? ..... i have folder? \"opt\" and files .bashrc , .inputrc, bash_profile, BASH_HISTORY\n\nbash_profile?changed content is given below\n\n# System-wide .bashrc file\n# change the directories if necessary\nPATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin:$PATH\nRAYPATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/lib:$RAYPATH\nMANPATH=/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/doc/man:$MANPATH\nexport PATH RAYPATH MANPATH\n\nthen under?? cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\n?i have \"bin\", \"doc\", \"lib\" and \"obj\" folders. and my source files ( now it includes rayinit.cal and skybright.cal)?are also into?? - \"cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\"\n\nWhen i relaunch the cygwin console and??execute?$PATH .... i get the following info on the console\nbash:?usr/local/bin: /usr/bin: /bin : /usr/X11R6/bin : /cygdrive/c/Program: No such file or directory.\n\nand when i do $RAYPATH then no message or info?comes on the console.\n\nfor execution of source file - once i am inside the \"cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\" ditectory\nI do\n1. export PATH=$HOME/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin/:$PATH ( Without this command i am \"oconv\" commoand is not executed)\n2. oconv command.........\n3. rpict command ............\n\nI suppose?my path is set to bin? and it does not point on lib folder? How i can set the path(s) such that i do not use export command\n\nBest Regards,\nBrajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nSent: Tuesday, January 20, 2009 1:15:15 PM\n\n\nOn 20 Jan 2009, at 10:47, Brajesh Lal wrote:\n\n# System-wide .bashrc file\n# change the directories if necessary\nPATH=.:/opt/radiance/bin:$PATH\n#RAYPATH=.:/opt/radiance/lib\nRAYPATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/lib\nMANPATH=/opt/radiance/doc/man:$MANPATH\nexport PATH RAYPATH MANPATH?\nstill i am getting the same error. How do i fix it to view the rendered image ?\nDid you reload ('.' aka 'source') the config file after\nyou made the changes?\n\nAs an immediate help copy the rayinit.cal file into your\nproject directory (where you execute the rpict command).\n\nLong term fix: As Lars wrote, there is something unclear with\nyour PATH. First you need to find out whether your settings\ntake effect or if they are taken from somewhere else. I'm\nalways puzzled by the variety of bash configuration files\nand need to consult the man page to work out what .bash_profile\n.bash_login and .bashrc are doing exactly.\n\nTo find out if your settings are effective, you should 'log off'\nfrom the cygwin environment and start a new session. This will\nreinitialise your environment. Then type\n\necho $PATH\necho $RAYPATH\n\nat the command prompt and see if the output is what you expect.\n\nIf you don't get your settings read the bash man page regarding\nthe startup sequence and the Cygwin documentation about the\nlocation of configuration files and the environment paths.\n\nThat should give you an idea how the path should look like\nand where it should go.\n\n?And how do i use rview - for viewing the image ? any other software is required ?\n\nFor image viewing you use 'ximage'.?\n\nThe 'rview' program has been?renamed to 'rvu' (the tutorial\ndoes not reflect that). It provides an interactive preview of\na scene, not an image. You can use it to control your view\nsettings before you start a long running rpict calculation\nwith high quality settings.?\n\nI don't know if ximage or rvu work on cygwin but?you will need\na running X server if you want to use either. Again, check?the\nCygwin documentation on this topic (eg. http://x.cygwin.com).\n\nRegards,\nThomas?\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090120/6f993b13/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "tbleicher@arcor.de", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<979697.21996.qm@web51909.mail.re2.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jan 20 05:32:19 2009", "email": "Thomas Bleicher", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problem"}
