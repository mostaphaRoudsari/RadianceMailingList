If\nyou have the resources I recommend installing Linux on an old\ncomputer or setting up a virtual machine with Linux. It will make it\neasier for you to understand Unix.\n\n\nFirst: According to this you are user 'abc' on your Windows machine.\nIs this correct or did you set this up intentionally? You can verify\nby typing\n\nwhoami\npwd\n\nin the console window. The first should give you 'abc' the second '/\nhome/abc'\n\n\nSecond: This 'opt' is not were it is intended to be. That might be\nthe problem.\n\nCygwin creates its own file system 'root' in its installation\ndirectory (typically \"C:\\cygwin\"). Every command you enter in a\nCygwin shell will use this as the start for the file system tree. An\nabsolute file path in Unix starts with '/' (no dot!). So if you see a\nUnix path '/home/abc' this translates to \"C:\\cygwin\\home\\abc\".\n\nFollowing this logic '/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin'\nshould be found as\n\"C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\bin\". Just keep the\nfiles as they are and move the cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9 folder to the\nright location.\n\nYou should not mix your project files with files in the distribution.\nYou might accidentally destroy essential files.\n\n\nNote that there should be a '.' in front of the file name:\n'.bash_profile'. The '.' hides the name for the user so this file is\nsomewhat protected. It is still part of the file name and without it\nthe file will not be recognised. This may be why you don't have the\n$RAYPATH set correctly.\n\n\nIf you follow the renaming as above these settings should work now.\n\n\n\nMove your source files to a folder in your HOME directory ('/home/abc/\nproject1' for example). Keep your Radiance installation clear!\n\n\nSee above. IF you are user 'abc' AND the file is called\n'.bash_profile' it should work.\n\n\nWhat you do here is what should happen in the config file. You only\ndid change the PATH setting, but did not create a RAYPATH. Therefore\nyou could use oconv and rpict but the search for 'rayinit.cal' failed.\n\n\nOne last thing: If you copy-and-past from Windows to Linux you should\nchange the line end characters. Windows will create a '\\r\\n' at the\nend of a text file while Unix only uses '\\n'. The bash configuration\nfiles should not be affected, but other programs might have problems\nwith that.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problem", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B0A950DE-530E-4BE8-99D7-238C620E7C54@arcor.de>", "refs": ["<110565.573.qm@web51901.mail.re2.yahoo.com>", "<77F8075E-A343-4A9A-867D-A4F15D7CC1BE@arcor.de>", "<979697.21996.qm@web51909.mail.re2.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jan 20 10:44:25 2009", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problem"}
