{"body": "\nHello\n\nI have recently installed the lenny package with radiance and\ninstalled the 4 radiance packages through synaptic package manager.\n\nI am not sure if any RAYPATH has to be set separately to run the\ncommand \"rad\" or any command exclusively associated with radiance.\n\nNow what's happening is when I try to execute the rad or ranimate or\nranimove executables from /usr/bin, nothing is happening. Even when I\nrun command \"rad\", it does not give any message that this commend not\nfound or something, simply nothing happens.\n\nFurther I tried to run the examples files .rad using rad program, it\ndid not run.\n\nCan I expect some help?\n\nThank you\nRegards\nChandrayee\n\n\n--\nChandrayee Basu (M.Tech)\nSchr?felhofstra?e 12, WG 07/02\n81375 M?nchen\n+49-89-289-22403\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Chandrayee Basu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<a3b82cc90901210515r68233a30oe7530719f2c18dff@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jan 21 05:15:08 2009", "email": "chandrayeeee at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] installation of Radiance in lenny"}
