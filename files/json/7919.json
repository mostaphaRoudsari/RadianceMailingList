Of course, the materials wil have to be\nadapted: I was planning to use spectrally averaged solar properties (grey\nworld), and I have no intention of obtaining lighting information out of\nthese calculatons.\n\nAs you might guess, I am not quite sure I know what I am doing, haha, but\nmy understanding is that it should work, right? My idea is to validate all\nthese, though.\n\nTHANKS\n\nGerman\n\n\n2013/3/11 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130312/b51cee34/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaymtx axis convention and -O 1 option.", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Tue, 12 Mar 2013 09:35:34 -0400"}
