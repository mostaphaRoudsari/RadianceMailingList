{"body": "\nHi Greg!\nI have been looking in that, too. I think a great solution would be a\ntool that converts IES into\n\na) .rad: \"wireframe\" geometry, a bit like what genworm does, normalizing\nthe dimensions so that one scale it according to luminous output and\nplace it in a scene to explain light sources' qualities.\n\nb) .meta: polar line plots like the common diagrams we get, which is\nwhat we are used to look at. This would\nprovide an easy way to compare the data we get in our IES with the data\nthe manufacturer published in print.\n\nI think both is doeable even using nothing but shell scripts, genworm\nand the various plotting utilities coming with radiance. The problem I\nwas facing was the IES format, with all its variations. To create a\nparser that really handles all IES luminaire distribution formats seems\nto be not that easy, especially if you want to extract metadata, too\n(which would be nice to have included in the plot in case b) and as\ncomment lines in the scene in case a).\n\nMaybe these two could also be just options for ies2rad...\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file viewer", "sender": "Lars O.
