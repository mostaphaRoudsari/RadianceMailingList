{"body": "\nYes, well I was thinking much more along the lines of what Rob has\nalready done, that is provide a means to graphically confirm a\nluminaire's output distribution in a Radiance context.  I.e., it\nshould take ies2rad output, not reinterpret the IES file, as Zack and\nothers have noted that ies2rad itself is occasionally suspect.  Also,\nhaving the Radiance coordinates as a final check of placement in the\nscene is often useful.\n\nI don't use IES files that often myself, which is probably why I have\nnever spent much time on this.  I just thought a false color fisheye\nimage might be an interesting way to confirm the IES file was being\nloaded and interpreted and placed correctly.  Sounds like there are\nenough tools out there already, though.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file viewer", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<43A4FB1C-A069-4911-BBBA-D8DA7E771ECC@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<AAA27794.460@wmtao.com> <49773301.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com>", "<BDB941EB-B68F-4ED8-9DD9-D898CF30786D@lmi.net>", "<4977D155.9090309@nus.edu.sg>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 22 08:17:28 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES file viewer"}
