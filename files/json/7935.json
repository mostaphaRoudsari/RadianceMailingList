{"body": "\nHaving the ability to look at a 3d web interactively (ie rotate the web or orbit around it) really helps to understand it.  On my old version of AGI, (they have probably updated this) I can bring up the 3d web but can't orbit around it.  In the render view, where you can orbit around the fixture, the web is not shown.  So the only way to look at different parts of the web is to change the view to one of the preset isometric or orthogonal views.  This is OK, but not as good as being able to rotate it (or rotate around it).\n\nI seem to remember Lightscape having the ability to display the 3d web of a light fixture.  This made it very simple to aim the light properly.\n\n[{--Wm. Tao & Associates, Inc.--}] This message and content is privileged, intended only for recipients named and/or addressed.
