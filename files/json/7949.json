{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nSeems to me you have a pretty good grasp of what's going on with this\ncalculation.  You didn't really leave me anything else to explain...\nSince S(1) returns exactly 0 for off-view pixels, the 1e-30 threshold\nis set to allow for *very* small pixels, as you might have in a very\nhigh-resolution image.\n\nJust beware that because the Radiance RGBE encoding doesn't have an\nexact representation of 1.0, that the actual count will be off (by\n-0.5% if I remember right).\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Getting number of pixels for fisheye view", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<B90A790C-0014-4E88-8CF7-42D21A17FE9F@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<497FD2AD.1030506@nus.edu.sg>", "<1B56BB3F-6AFF-4614-88E4-5C39CC52EB7D@lmi.net>", "<49805784.9000606@nus.edu.sg>"], "datetime": "Wed Jan 28 08:54:37 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Getting number of pixels for fisheye view"}
