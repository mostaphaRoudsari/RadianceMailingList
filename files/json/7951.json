The multiple\nedges evident particularly from the bottom of the frame are the giveaway.\nYou are using Radiance light objects, and these always give these\nexceedingly (unbelievably) sharp edges to the pools of light that they\ncast. Radiance lights based on a photometry file tend to have softer\nedges, even those based on directional lamps.\n\nJack's trick worked because even tho you have -aa at zero, you have -ab 2\nwhich will still cause the ambient calculation to be run; the increased\n-ar has the effect of softening the halo, I think. -aa 0 simply turns off\ninterpolation, not the ambient calculation altogether.\n\nI think.\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange halo artifact in rendering", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 10:03:54 -0600"}
