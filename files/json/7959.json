{"body": "\nAh, thanks, pvalue does the trick.\n\nTwo things of note though which I don't think are documented: It looks like\npvalue needs the ASCII input to have a Radiance header - at\nleast \"#?RADIANCE\" on the first line followed by a blank line. In the\ncommand \"pvalue -h image.hdr | pvalue -r > image2.hdr\" the second pvalue\nwill not know what to do with the output from the first pvalue.\n\nAlso, the -d switch on pvalue works on the reverse operation as well. If\nyou do something like \"pvalue -d image.hdr | pvalue -r > image2.hdr\", the\nsecond pvalue will use the header to determine the dimensions but ignore\nthe red and green columns (assuming they were supposed to be x and y), so\nyou'll get only the blue channel in image2.hdr. However, \"pvalue -d\nimage.hdr | pvalue -r -d > image2.hdr\" will reproduce the original image.\nThis behavior is noted in the Bugs section but not in the description for\nthe -d option.\n\n--Dave\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090130/afcfc230/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "dbs176@gmail.com", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<0016361e7d941c003b0461b5273c@google.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Jan 30 07:49:40 2009", "email": "dbs176 at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Image from text"}
