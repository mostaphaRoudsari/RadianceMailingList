{"body": "\nI agree with Marija's comment, it is easy to lose your bearings after\nrotating the fixture a bit and forget which axis is which. Might be\ndifficult to do with actual text labels for X Y and Z in a 3D view, but\nSketchup and AutoCAD seem to agree on a red X axis, green Y axis, and\nblue Z axis. In sketchup the positive axes are a bolder color than the\nnegative axes for clarity (of course it's easy to recommend additions to\nother peoples work ;)\n\nAnother handy feature would be just to display the maximum candela value\nof the distribution, to be able to judge the total output quickly\nwithout going to the \"Show Photometric Data\" window.\n\nthat being said ... it's a great tool, Thanks!\n\ndialog or some tool-tip when we are on image.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090122/09c4d247/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file viewer", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE704889282@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<AAA27794.460@wmtao.com>", "<49773301.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com><BDB941EB-B68F-4ED8-9DD9-D898CF30786D@lmi.net><4977D155.9090309@nus.edu.sg><24A618F8B54C4348B54C8684C918963BD41D92@BUGS.ideasi.com><82100A6A-80E4-4ACE-984A-C1270A98457C@u.washington.edu>", "<124b40400901220313n45357644tdb4e8ffee6673e37@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 22 12:13:52 2009", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES file viewer"}
