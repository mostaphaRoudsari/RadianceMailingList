{"body": "\nHi!\n\nNo, I won't announce anything useable here ;-) But at least, something\nwhich proofs that it is possible to import and store Radiance scenes in\nXML.\n\nRadianceML is a project I just started to define a DTD for Radiance\nscenes in XML, together with XSL-translators to import and export data.\nAt the moment, I have a very simple DTD describing... hmmm.. let's say\na subset of the Radiance scene language (actually only comments,\nspheres and polygons are understood ;-) and a XSL-template that imports\n.rad-files (containing only this \"subset\") into RadianceML-XML.\n\nWhat has to be done until 1.0:\n\n- complete Radiance scene language in DTD and import-template\n\n- \"xmlizer\", small tool tagging Radiance scenes (XSL can process\nonly XML, so I have to tag the radiance scene files before\nimporting them)\n\n- export-template from RadianceML to rad\n\nLater, this will / can be extended to export to e.g. x3d, think about\ndocumented scenes (docbook), ...\n\nSo, whoever is interested in this project, send me a mail asking for\nthe current \"distribution\". It is not GPLed at the moment, and I won't\ngrant you the right to redistribute it now, because I want to get an\nidea if there is interest in this. If you have any comment about the\nproject, or questions, or proposals, or if you want to participate,\njust send me (private, not list-) mail.\n\nCU, Lars.\n--\nLars O.
