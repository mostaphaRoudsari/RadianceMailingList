{"body": "\nHello\n\nWell I am not getting any message at all...I just went to run command\nand gave 'rad'. But once again I am telling that 'nothing' is\nhappening. Basically my problem is after installing it in lenny I am\nnot able to start the interface of radiance from anywhere. Moreover it\nis not included in the applications under lenny.\n\nThanks\n\nOn Wed, Jan 21, 2009 at 3:05 PM, Lars O.
