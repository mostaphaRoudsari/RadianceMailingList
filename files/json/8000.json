You will want to be sure that your ambient calculation parameters are the same for both, in your case it looks like you're taking the rtrace defaults for both. If you revise your model or calculation parameters, you will also want to manually delete the ambient cache before you run again, because you will either see strange results or an error message if you inadvertently try to use the old cache for a new calculation.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130328/91813155/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<DE46D9B5CE328142B74007B522D5E6FA1CB8A458@XSERVER22B.campus.tue.nl>", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 12:41:39 -0400"}
