{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have never used radiance on windows and do not know about windows\nneither. Still there is something strange in what you describe:\n\n\nYou found rayinit.cal in a subdirectory called\ncygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\lib, so I guess your binaries are in\ncygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\bin, right? Still your PATH points to\n/opt/radiance/bin, and you are able to call oconv. So something is\nwrong. Is it possible that the settings in this .bash_profile are\noverwritten somewhere?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problem", "sender": "Lars O.
