{"body": "\nYes, well, unfortunately Greg doesn't know what he's talking about,\nbecause Galen was right when he said that the glaze script demands\none surface be clear glass.  Your suggestion is better, and should\nwork, since the glaze script only uses the transmittance and\nreflectance values for it's models.\n\nCreating a model that properly accounts for the deepening hue\nexperienced at off-angle transmission through colored glazing would\nrequire hand-modeling, since the glaze script only considers a\nsurface coating.  I don't know the construction of the Evergreen\nglass, so I'm not sure what's appropriate.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Glazing transparency/reflectivity study", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D93C8B19-F766-469C-8A63-C61D52AD3878@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<SYDEXC02D7Fjm0fwYdk000035c5@sydexc02.global.arup.com>", "<A1A14AD0D93971429BCB2E82636833C071B372AA28@AUEXC01.global.arup.com>", "<49709F0C.9050801@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Jan 16 08:36:05 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Glazing transparency/reflectivity study"}
