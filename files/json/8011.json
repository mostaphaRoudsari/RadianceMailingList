{"body": "\nHi Galen,\n\nIt has been a while, but I think that the color/tint comes from the rgb\nvalues for the coated glass. So the color would be conveyed by \"VE2-2M\non Evergreen\" monolithic export from Optics 5. So this should account\nfor the color of the coated glass. However, I think that I have to defer\nto Greg on this for confirmation.\n\nNote for Viracon:\n\n<type><color>-<transmittance>\n\nso\ntype = VE = Low-E\ncolor = 2 = Green\ntransmittance = 2M = ~70%\n\nif you want \"Evergreen\" you need to look at color 8.... so VE8-2M\n\n\nOne way to sanity check is to run a single layer output from glaze and\nspecify s1 as clear and s2 as VE2-2M on evergreen. The last three lines\nof the material description should give you:\n\nRext_r Rext_g Rext_b\nRint_r Rint_g Rint_b\nTr Tg Tb\n\nThe rgb components should be the same as those exported from Optics5\n(even though you are specifying \"clear\" for one layer).\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\nGalen Burrell wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090116/5a0893dc/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Glazing transparency/reflectivity study", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<49709F0C.9050801@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<SYDEXC02D7Fjm0fwYdk000035c5@sydexc02.global.arup.com>", "<A1A14AD0D93971429BCB2E82636833C071B372AA28@AUEXC01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Jan 16 06:52:07 2009", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Glazing transparency/reflectivity study"}
