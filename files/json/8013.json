So if you have sloped skylights you can use the +Z\nvector for view up, and the BSDF will be oriented so that the +Y direction\nis uphill on the skylight.\n\nHowever if your skylight is horizontal, than +Z is parallel to the view\ndirection (or BSDF surface normal) so as you suggest you need to provide a\nnon-vertical view up vector.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 3, 2013 at 7:24 AM, Germ?n Molina Larrain <gmolina1 at uc.cl>wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130403/a7542913/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genklemsamp - surface orientati", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 09:34:17 -0700"}
