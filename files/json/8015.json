This includes gendaymtx and\nthe annual invocation of dctimestep.\n\nIf you use the three phase method or daylight coefficient method you should\ncheck this out.  It saves a considerable ammount of time in the matrix\nmultiplication step.\n\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf\n\nAndy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130403/1de85fab/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 11:01:51 -0700"}
