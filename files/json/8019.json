Perhaps your question isn't completely clear, because I'm not sure of the answer, either.\n\nYour fc_fp2.cal file seems to be tailored for a particular arrangement of objects.  In general, you can add a transform to your colorpict string arguments to account for simple surface movements.  Did you try:\n\nvoid colorpict fc_val_fp2\n9 red green blue images/vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr fc_fp2.cal fc_u fc_v -rz 7.3\n0\n0\n\nIf that doesn't do the right thing, you can try \"-rz -7.3\" instead.  Alternatively, you can eliminate fc_fp2.cal entirely with:\n\nvoid colorpict fc_val_fp2\n15 red green blue images/vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr . Px Py -s 20.1 -t -167 -248 0 -rz 7.3\n0\n0\n\nAgain, I am guessing a bit here as your situation isn't entirely clear to me.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130409/6cf5352c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rotating image to mach a rotated polyg", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 15:47:40 -0700"}
