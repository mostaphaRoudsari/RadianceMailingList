{"body": "\nJack,\n\nJust the sound of BRDTfunc scared me off.  I'll have to have a closer\nlook at this material type.\n\nI apologize for resurrecting a previously discussed topic.  But my\nsearch (\"dichroic,\" \"multiple material,\" \"materials with multiple\nproperties,\" etc. on radiance-online, as well as \"dichroic brtdfunc\" on\ngoogle ) resulted in no useful results (that I found).  Do you have\nsome suggestions as to other search terms to find this past discussion?\n\nThanks for always responding so quickly.\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John An", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D62FCF27-6B30-11D8-8BB7-000A95871DF2@mac.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Mar  1 04:30:16 2004", "email": "whollycow at mac.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mixfunc for dichroic film?"}
