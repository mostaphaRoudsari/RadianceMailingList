I\ndownloaded the last version you provided ( 1.3a_ubuntu.zip) and it seems\nsome source files from the common radiance source folder are missing for\nsuccesfull compilation :\ncone.c    cone.h    face.c    face.h    free_os.c  image.c  instance.c\ninstance.h  loadvars.c    mesh.c    mesh.h    modobject.c  otypes.c\notypes.h  readmesh.c  readobj.c    readoct.c  sceneio.c  tmapluv.c\ntmaptiff.c  tmaptiff.h\n(i copied them from the radiance-HEAD source available on\nradiance-online.org)\n\nThen there is a java issue\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/include/jni.h:45:20: fatal error: jni_md.h: No\nsuch file or directory\nthis error comes from the fact that the file is located in the\ninclude/linux rep. (\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-hdfs-dev/201205.mbox/%3C117050669.38033.1336464885155.JavaMail.tomcat at hel.zones.apache.org%3E\n)\n\nAnd now it works!!\n\nThanks! You just provided me with a great tool that will be quite usefull.\nIt would be even more if i can directly load a bsdf.xml file from the\ncomand line (or by an other way). Ist that possible??\n\nI see this ubuntu version includes tensor trees. That is great! I have been\nreading a bit about tensor trees and would like to use them to create bsdf\nfrom the simulation of complex fenestration systems. I looked at the code\nin the genbsdf routine that creates the tensor tree but i am realy not\nfamiliar with perl... then i found the bsdf_t files in the common dir of\nradiance. Is there any specific documentation about this, or an example i\ncould start from to create and store tensor tree bsdfs?? Idealy i would\nlike to create a C++ object to do that... Any help or advice would be\ngreatly apriciated.\n\nKind Regards.\n\nAndre\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 12, 2013 at 1:26 AM, <\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130412/94552578/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andre Kostro", "datetime": "Fri, 12 Apr 2013 11:07:30 +0200"}
