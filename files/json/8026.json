{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI have one question about the glass modifier.\n\nTransmittance depends on both the materials properties and the distance\nthat light is traveling through the material. This distance depends on\nthe angle under which the ray hits the surface, and will be shortest if\nhit perpendicular. Is this correctly modeled by the glass modifier,\nwhich does not know the thickness (but the refraction of the material)?\nOr do I need a 'solid' glass body to model this, with dielectric?\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars Oliver Grobe", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<BFC10A1E97E4FF4D96B41D896D5A0BC706120C00@MBX02.stf.nus.edu.sg>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jan 13 21:41:46 2009", "email": "akilog at nus.edu.sg", "subject": "[Radiance-general] glass modifier under different angles"}
