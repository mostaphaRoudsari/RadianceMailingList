{"body": "\nHey John,\n\nMy apologies, although I seem to remember somebody somewhere talking\nabout dichoic glazing in radiance (albeit a long time ago), after having\nfollowed my own advice to check in the archives, I have not been able to\nfind anything. In any event, I think that something like BRTDfunc or\nperhaps transfunc will do what you want. Do you have any performance\ndata that you can share so people can get a better sense of the\nperformance characteristics of the material.\n\n-Jack\n\nJohn An wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mixfunc for dichroic film?", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4042BC15.2060506@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<D62FCF27-6B30-11D8-8BB7-000A95871DF2@mac.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar  1 05:29:25 2004", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mixfunc for dichroic film?"}
