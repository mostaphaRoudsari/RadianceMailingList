It may be just a matter of linking fileds to\nrpict options\n\nWhat would be usefull is to have a small window (128 x 128 or so) that\nrenders a simple scene (with rview? or rpict?)\nMaybe the scene is a sphere in a cornell box or something\n\nAnd then several fields that correspond to the options in rifs - quality,\nPENUMBRAS,  DETAIL,   VARIABILITY etc\nplus advanced rendering options... ad   as  ar  ab   aa  etc.\n\nchanging any of these values would re-render the thumbnail with those\nsettings.\n\nIf it could be done, it would be helpful in determining good render\nsettings.\n\nOr - Ive heard and kind of experienced that each scene has its own quirks\nand needs - maybe a simple scene would not give a reasonable idea of what\nwould be needed for a complex scene.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRob F\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Fitzsimmons, Rob", "datetime": "Wed Jul  7 22:18:52 2004"}
