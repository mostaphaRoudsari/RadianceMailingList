What I generally recommend is that you substitute the actual mountain with proxy geometry closer to the building (say, within 100' of the building perimeter) that represents the shading effect of the distant ground. In other words, project the mountain onto flat polygons closer to the scene-\n\n...and Greg just chimed in with a better answer. =)\n\n\nSent: Wednesday, April 17, 2013 10:35 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nOn the other hand, the reason I modeled the mountain is to actually consider the shading it provides (that is the area I am working on)... so I think just eliminate it would not be the solution.\n\nIs color bleeding a problem that \"would occur in real life\"?? I mean, is a modeling problem (clearly the mountain is not completely brown), or a weird effect of the algorithms involved?\n\nTHANKS AGAIN!\n\nGerman\n\n2013/4/17 Germ?n Molina Larrain <gmolina1 at uc.cl<mailto:gmolina1 at uc.cl>>\nHi Robert,\n\nMy material definition was the following (I assume it is easy to notice what is what)\n\nvoid glass SL_glass\n0\n0\n3 .92 .92 .92\n\nvoid plastic GroundMat\n0\n0\n5  0.435 0.306 0.216  .00 0.06\n\nvoid brightfunc floorpat\n2 .4*rand(floor(Px/.25)-.25*floor(Py/.25)-.25)+.6 .\n0\n0\n\nfloorpat plastic Floor\n0\n0\n5\n.3 .3 .3  0 0\n\n\nvoid plastic SL_default_material #(basically every wall and ceiling)\n0\n0\n5 .7 .7 .7 0 .01\n\nMy ambient parameters were (the rest are all defaults):\n\n-ab 8 -ad 2000 -aa 0.05 -ar 256\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\nGerman\n\n2013/4/17 Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>>\n\nHey German,\n\nFor sure it looks like there is some color bleeding, and also the fact that you have modeled the entire mountain - making your model extents fairly large relative to the area of interest (your building interior) is likely causing you some pain here too. It would be helpful to see your material definitions, and also your rendering parameters (particularly the ambient (-a*) ones).\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319<tel:303.275.4319>\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n\n\n\nOn 4/17/13 10:12 AM, \"Germ?n Molina Larrain\" <gmolina1 at uc.cl<mailto:gmolina1 at uc.cl><mailto:gmolina1 at uc.cl<mailto:gmolina1 at uc.cl>>> wrote:\n\nDear List,\n\nSo I have been rendering with some interesting features in SketchUp, like exporting landscapes (hills and mountains) from GoogleEarth.\nHere is a link for you to understand what I am talking about<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ltv125db6hjp74a/hsnL6S-_JI>\n\nAnyway, I have been rendering some stuff and I have two doubts:\n\n1.- My environment is basically grey, but only the mountain near my building is brown; but everything has turned to be brown (as can be seen in Image2)... is that the \"color bleeding\" (or something like that)? Is that a good result? or there is a problem with my modeling?\n\n2.- As can be seen in Image (the one that shows the interior of the building, looking out), there are some weird effects, making my image to look as it was painted with a brush or something. What is the parameter that would help me reduce that?\n\nI am not sure why in Dropbox the images look much more darker than in my PC. They were created using rpict, and then filtered with \"pfilt -x /2 -y /2 image.hdr > image.tiff\"\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\nGerman\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130417/22f755a5/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering parameters help and weird colors", "tags": [], "sender": "gmolina1 at uc.cl", "datetime": "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 10:50:01 -0600"}
