{"body": "\nSo of course I ran into that problem of having perfectly black surfaces\nin my field of view. If ever anyone needs a way to get around this, here\nis my solution for now, using nothing but primitive text processing (and\nI am sure that the grep line could be written nicer):\n\nN_PIXELS=`vwrays fisheye.hdr | grep -v -c \"0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00\n0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00\"`\n\nSo I feed my image (fisheye.hdr) into vwray, which will produce\nviewpoint/direction vectors for each pixel. For pixels that are outside\nthe view, it writes out three times zero. Grep -c counts those, but grep\n-v -c counts the lines NOT containing the six zero expressions. And this\nis the number of pixels inside my image's view.\n\nMaybe someone finds it useful one day.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Getting number of pixels for fisheye view", "sender": "Lars O.
