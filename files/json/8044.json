(X,Y,Z origin = 0; X,Y,X\ndirection is from Up or 0 0 1) then:\n\n1. Does it creates ONLY a single Ray from this point (0 0 0) towards\ndirection (0 0 1), in this case normal towards Zenith? Just to make sure I\nam getting the right concepts of ray tracing.\n\n2. If it is so, then output irradiance is from ONLY the Up direction (0 0\n1), and not from any other direction?\n\n3. If it is so, then: is it possible (may be a rarest of the rare case) to\nget Zero irradiance at a point from a particular direction?\n\nI am asking this because I am getting Zero irradiance at a vertical surface\ninside the room when the direction given to rtrace is normal to this\nsurface. E.g for a point on North wall, the direction given is 0 -1 0. For\nall the other interior surfaces I am getting some reasonable irradiance\nvalues, but only for North wall its Zero. So my reasoning for this was,\nsince rtrace traces only a single ray from a point towards a particular\ndirection then it is possible (though rarely) to get zero irradiance from\nthat direction. I just thought to get your opinion on my reasoning.\n\nAll surface normals are towards inside of the room.\n\nThank you in anticipation! Hope I made my question clear.\n\nBest regards,\nVaibhav Jain\nwww.vaibhavjain.co\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130421/fded1913/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Vaib", "datetime": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 11:45:08 +0200"}
