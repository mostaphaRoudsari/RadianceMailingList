I think it is easier for you to see it instead of reading\nit. You can go to http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install and\ndownload the BSDF viewer, and put Show Patch Numbers.\n\nAbout the units, I understand they are Incident Irradiance over Outgoing\nRadiance, and the number there can be deduced as the percentage of\ntransmission of that transmitted by an \"air\" layer. In the case of Klems\n(W6 standard) basis, the values for the air layer are, aproximately:\n\n*Patch Number* *1/cos(?).?*  1 41,9043  2-9 42,8764  10-25 45,6281  26-45\n42,333  46-69 44,6724  70-93 44,6724  94-117 50,7996  118-133 45,6281\n134-145 57,0215\nThe experts may have much more information about this.\n\nGood Luck,\n\nGerman\n\n\n2013/4/22 leceta <aitorleceta at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/b0b85deb/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF reader", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 12:37:25 -0400"}
