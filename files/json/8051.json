(Same goes for others -- thanks!)\n\nThe data order in the file is a matrix running from smallest to largest Klems patches, with the columns (inner loop data) corresponding to the input directions.  This is verified by a tag in the \"DataDefinition\" section that says:\n\n<IncidentDataStructure>Columns</IncidentDataStructure>\n\nIf \"Rows\" appears there instead of Columns, then the outgoing directions are the inner loop, but this would be unusual and probably not supported by WINDOW.\n\nThe units of a BSDF are 1/steradians.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to link to C code, you may also use the existing BSDF parser library included in the Radiance source tree to do the data loading and interpretation.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130422/b91be1b0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF reader", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:43:05 -0700"}
