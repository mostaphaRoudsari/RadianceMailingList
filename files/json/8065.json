I\nhave heard that material reflectivity is a very important parameter that.\nHow important are:\n\n- Color (I am pretty sure I read something in this list about grey-world\nsimulations... I think it was Rob).\n- Textures\n- Specularities\n- Patterns\netc.\n\nMy concern is that defining materials is actually not a very easy task, so\nI just wanted to know what are the most important things here.\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH!\n\nGerman\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130426/223e4531/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Fri, 26 Apr 2013 11:36:27 -0400"}
