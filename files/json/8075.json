{"body": "\nHi\n\nAs per the installation specification in the README of Gendaylit, I tried to\nedit the COPTS of the makefile, but it is giving errors and the compilation\nis failing. The default COPTS is -Ae -g. Will it work with the gcc of linux.\nI had specified '-o' COPTS for linux and it says the undefined reference to\nthe trigonometric functions and to 'main'. Is it necessary to use a HP-UX\ngcc compiler? Will it work if I use the ILP32 hp-gcc?\n\nThank you\nChandrayee\n\n--\nChandrayee Basu (M.Tech)\nSchr?felhofstra?e 12, WG 07/02\n81375 M?nchen\n+49-89-289-22403\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090216/4c8eaf93/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Chandrayee Basu", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<a3b82cc90902160442q3b915fadq84fd166a2d53de4a@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Feb 16 04:42:37 2009", "email": "chandrayeeee at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Installing gendaylit"}
