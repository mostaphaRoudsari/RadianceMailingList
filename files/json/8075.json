Wikipedia says the command ??type?? is an equivalent, but I haven??t tried it.\n\nAbout genprism, I think the argument before the vector should be -l (lower case ??L??) not -1 (the number one), I??m not sure which one you??ve used, but may be worth checking.\n\nHope this helps.\nSantiago\n\n\n\nSent: 2013??5??9?? 7:42\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nI??m working through the tutorials in Rendering with Radiance & have 2 commands that I??m having trouble with so far.\n\n\n1.       !cat (concatenate)  - from page 80 in book ?C Scene 1 Tutorial, section 2.5 - is this still a valid command?  I couldn??t find an executable file for it in my  Radiance directory & a search online didn??t bring up reference to it either.    The error I get when I try to run oconv is ??Can??t find executable for ??cat?? .system ?C cannot execute ??!cat ./lib/table_1.rad??\n\n\n\n2.       Genprism ?C from page 53 in book ?C I can run genprism if I don??t put in the final 4 extrusion factors.   What am I doing wrong?\nIf I run the command as written in the book:  genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_sw 4 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -1 0 0 2.5 > look.txt\nI get the following error:               Usage:  genprism material name { - | vfile | N v1 v2 .. vN} [-1 1vect] [-r radius] [-c][-e]\n\nIf I run the command without the extrusion vector (final 4 #??s) it creates the prism with the ??z?? values at 1 which I??m guessing is the default.\n\nThank you for help!!\n\nRegards,\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130509/c4093be6/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130509/c4093be6/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Beginners Questions", "tags": [], "sender": "shouck at brummitt.com", "datetime": "Thu, 9 May 2013 09:24:01 +0800"}
