The interior surfaces in your test box do not participate in the ambient calculation when you exclude them.  This is not the same result you would get if they were completely \"black.\"  It only means that the -av value is substituted for an indirect calculation at that point.  The direct calculation proceeds at all diffuse surfaces, so your initial sampling from your test point using -I+ will see a bright ceiling.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<518F8019.9000602@gmx.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 12 May 2013 08:11:23 -0400"}
