After I set the Trans,Front Trans,Back ect.. I conducted the calculation by Calc [F9] button. Following error massage came out to me. How can I solve it?\n\nOne of the layers for Glazing System 1 does not have detailed spectral data or the spectral data analysis was disabled in Preferences. This may result in incorrect results for optical properties such as SHGC and TVIS. Custom layers with detailed spectral data can be created in Optics and imported into the Window Library\n\n\nI attatched my situation.\n\nogata\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130513/26a2e58c/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: situation.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nSize: 61512 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130513/26a2e58c/attachment-0001.pdf>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "oga6ya at yahoo.co.jp", "datetime": "Mon, 13 May 2013 18:08:00 +0900 (JST)"}
