{"body": "\nHi Jack!\n\nYou mean that, while at 60 degree the specular reflectance is higher,\nthe average specular reflectance over all angles of incidence should be\nthe expected value of 76%? I try to get what the values really mean... a\ndesperate attempt without really knowing what had been measured.\n\nThanks!
