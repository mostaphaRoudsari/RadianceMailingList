DIVA Day is a conference on the use of environmental analysis in design practice and research.  The full-day event includes a series of presentations and discussions, focused on how DIVA and associated simulation tools can be used in design and performance-evaluation workflows.  Sessions include introductions to new features by the DIVA Team, and research and case studies by practitioners at leading architectural, engineering and consulting firms and universities. This year, the afternoon will be devoted to an ?Educators Session? which will focus on ways DIVA is used in college and university architectural and building technology education. We are adding presenters daily. For more information on DIVA Day 2013 click here<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013/agenda>.
