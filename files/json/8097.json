{"body": "\n\nHi Lars,\n\nYes, I would like to change the projection of the existing image from an\nequi-angular to hemispherical fisheye, if that is doable. But my\nintention was similar to your motive. I have used hemisherical fisheye\nimages in the past to calculate illuminance at the camera point\n(averaging luminance within the circular area and multiplying by pi).\nSince the physical fisheye lenses have equi-angular (or equi distant)\nprojections (not cosine corrected hemispherical fisheye projections), I\nam trying to calculate illuminance from a HDR photograph taken with a\nfisheye lens.\n\nThanks,\nMehlika\n\nLars O.
