The above steps (except the first) will have to be repeated for your different windows.  If you do a year at a time, you'll have to sum all these images together in batches, since pcomb only handles up to 1024 images at a time (so long as you don't run into system limits first).\n\nI hope this addresses your question.  To be honest, I've never done anything like this and I'm not entirely sure I got it right.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendyamtx - cumulative results", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Jun 2013 11:44:02 -0700"}
