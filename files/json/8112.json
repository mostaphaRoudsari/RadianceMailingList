(Should have been \"total -id3 -744\".)  This works because gendaymtx outputs time steps as columns in the matrix (inside sort). The final output will contain 3 ASCII triplets for each patch, so you don't need to change anything for different -m options to gendaymtx.  You just need to make sure your matrix dimensions are expecting the right number of patches.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Jun 7, 2013, at 2:20 PM, Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130607/4d1c9449/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendyamtx - cumulative results", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Jun 2013 16:06:28 -0700"}
