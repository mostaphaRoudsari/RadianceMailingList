{"body": "\nHi!\n(...)\n(...)\n\nSo you mean, as the blind settings are the same for both models during\nyour current test runs, you actually have the same model set-up with\ndifferent geometry?\nIs the \"whitealum\" material specular or diffuse?\n\nAre you sure that your ambient paramters are suiteable for that set-up?\nAs far as I understand it, you get illumination only for the light\n\"directly\" hitting your surfaces from the sky you generated. So you have\na very non-uniform environment for your rtrace-call. Did you ever render\nan image of the scene, with the same parameters, using a fisheye-view\nfor the same view as your rtrace measurement point is getting? Imagine\nthe rtrace-measurement-point being a sensor, or put yourself into its\nplace, what do you expect to see - and do your rendering settings\naccount for that? As I have not seen the result, these are only guesses\nfor now, but I am pretty sure that you will need higher -ab settings for\nsuch a set-up (probably -ab 4 or higher), and using ar and aa settings\nto get a uniform luminance over your rooms surfaces. I guess your\nceiling is more or less black now (except the -av-contribution, but what\nis your aw than)?\n\nGood luck!\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance Values", "sender": "Lars O.
