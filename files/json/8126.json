Complex spaces quickly become expensive to compute, and the meshing of them can be a nightmare.\n\nIf you need to compute the illumination of an empty box, then anything is going to be fast.  If it's really, really important for you to compute empty boxes in a second or two, then radiosity is the way to go.  If you can wait 30 seconds, Radiance works, too.\n\nIf you have a complex building to render with trees and sky, have fun doing it with radiosity!\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130621/fe958680/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiosity method implementation on Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 09:17:18 -0700"}
