I actually do not know much about artificial\nlighting, hahaha.\n\nChristopher,\n\nI have some ideas that I would like to evaluate both in accuracy and speed.\nIs not that any other software does not handle well what I am trying to do,\nbut as you said, I need some procedures and programs that exist in\nRadiance, such as evalglare and the Perez model... sacrificing the\nspecularity is what I meant by \"giving up some accuracy\".\n\n\nThe advantage that I see on Radiosity+ray-tracing is that the ambient\ncalculations can be done with radiosity, and the direct calculations can be\ndone with ray-tracing. By doing that, the ray-tracing parameters are\nrelaxed, and fast to compute.\n\nWhen everything is done, it is possible to move and render images fast,\nusing the precalculated values. This might be important to choose where to\nlocate furniture, for example.\n\nI am going to stick to what Greg said for now:\n\n*\"If you need to compute the illumination of an empty box, then anything is\ngoing to be fast.  If it's really, really important for you to compute\nempty boxes in a second or two, then radiosity is the way to go.  If you\ncan wait 30 seconds, Radiance works, too.\"*\n*\n*\nIf I have time in the future, I will try to test my ideas... whether they\ndo their job well or not, would you, guys, be interested on having some\nradiosity modules here for research purposes?\n\nTHANKS FOR COMMENTING ALL OF YOU!\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n2013/6/21 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130621/532115fd/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiosity method implementation on Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 16:19:53 -0400"}
