The translation happens by cables and fixed and\nmovable wheels (I used thin plastic pulleys and clothe lines). It moves\nsuch that when the table is on the horizontal, the line connectiong the 6AM\nposition (as high as the table) to the center of the table is in an angle\nof 23?25' to the rotation axis.\n\nA special switch with 13 positions and off was installed.\nI made several drawings and concluded that such a geometry may reproduce\nsolar angles with enough precision, even at high latitudes.\n\nI built it inside a dark room because that time (12 years ago) we needed\ncontrast for our film cameras.\n\nEverything costed me less than US$ 500.\n\nA picture is attached. I cannot find plans any more.\n\nAlo?sio Leoni Schmid\nUFPR - Curitiba - Brazil\nvisit: http://www.elecs2013.ufpr.br\n\n\n\n\n2013/6/27 Christoph Reinhart <tito_ at mit.edu>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130627/7a99eff6/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Construction drawings for a Heliod", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Alo=EDsio_Schmid?=", "datetime": "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 10:47:30 -0300"}
