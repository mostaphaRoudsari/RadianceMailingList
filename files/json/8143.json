How did it migrate here?\n\nIn any case, we were talking about inline commands in Radiance scene descriptions, not regular Radiance commands.\n\nIt is true that pcond likes to be given its file argument.  That's because it reads the file twice.  Your set of commands could be simplified by:\n\nrpict scene.oct | pfilt -1 -x /2 -y /2 > temp.hdr\npcond -s temp.hdr | ra_ppm | convert ...\n\nThe \"-1\" option of pfilt avoids making two passes on the input to determine exposure, which pcond overrides, anyway.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond stdi", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:28:18 -0700"}
