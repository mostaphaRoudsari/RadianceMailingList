I want to build my own spatial mapping of illuminance values in\nanother visualization tool.  Sorry for the newbie question!\n\nHow would I do that?  Can anyone lend some hints of where I would look to\nsee this, files, etc?\n\nThanks,\nCS\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130701/926a87ba/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Chien Si Harriman", "datetime": "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 05:33:51 -0700"}
