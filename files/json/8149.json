{"body": "\nHello\n\nThank you for the help. The Gendaylit is installed properly now. Actually I\nam facing some errors while trying to export scene from ESP-r to RADIANCE\nfor which I was suggested to install Gendaylit. I have installed the\ncomponents of Gendaylit in the default target locations as given in the\nmakefile. My RADIANCE is also working properly. But still I am getting error\nin ESP-r as 'problem detected in opening filename.rif and\nfilename_day_f.sky. Is there any problem regarding the location of\nGendaylit? The binaries of RADIANCE are in /usr/local/bin while the\nlibraries are in /usr/local/lib/ray. But the default location of the\nGendaylit components is /usr/local/radiance. Could this be a problem? Do I\nhave to reset the environment variable PATH for Gendaylit?\n\nThank you.\n\nChandrayee\n\n2009/2/16 Jan Wienold <jan.wienold@ise.fraunhofer.de>\n\n\n\n--\nChandrayee Basu (M.Tech)\nSchr?felhofstra?e 12, WG 07/02\n81375 M?nchen\n+49-89-289-22403\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090217/ce0f7612/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Installing gendaylit", "sender": "Chandrayee Basu", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<a3b82cc90902170334g78d85747pe3dcd5739e83efa6@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<a3b82cc90902160442q3b915fadq84fd166a2d53de4a@mail.gmail.com>", "<49997514.8050105@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<F6CA8838-B3A3-4029-B7E8-4432C7136F94@arcor.de>", "<a3b82cc90902160741s3d4b9adaj22a5d452ce17460f@mail.gmail.com>", "<a3b82cc90902160815m6af4e98cobf05e2545f4b36bb@mail.gmail.com>", "<499994C8.6050803@ise.fraunhofer.de>"], "datetime": "Tue Feb 17 03:35:14 2009", "email": "chandrayeeee at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Installing gendaylit"}
