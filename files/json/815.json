So shadowing from these frames will only be visible when\nwindows are hit by a dircet source (the sun), while those frames e.g.\non the north walls won't cast shadows. The only way to change this\nwould be to use subdivisioning of the illum surface.\n\nAm I right here? I have to decide that modeling topic now, and I am\nstill not really sure about it. If I have to use subdivided illum\nsurfaces, I think that manually defining each pane as ONE illum surface\n(so that subdividing would not be necessary any more) is better than\nmaking a subdivision that doesn't exactly fit the panes.\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
