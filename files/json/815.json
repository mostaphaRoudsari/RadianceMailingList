{"body": "\nOk,, my renders internally are doing odd things. The inside of the\nchapter house im modelling I would expect to be a little orangey as the\ntextures are orangy-ish colour. Which is what I get when I do a render\nthen run pcond -s, its too dark really for an unfiltered render:\n\nhttps://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/0j8_md0p1NAu1fdWB6pt8A7o/12hrinter\nnal-s.jpg\n\nBut when I run pcond -h the renders come out very grey, any idea why\nthis is? Is it correct, is it something to do with the light levels, or\ncontrast forcing it to grey?\n\nhttps://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/2u4diWLd_7Kih_chtUlZTA7o/12hrinter\nnal-h.jpg\n\nIf it is meant to be like this then why? Any ideas\n\nJohn\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040405/add49c9d/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Sutherland", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000501c41ae9$05b02ab0$0300a8c0@cumberland>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Apr  5 10:35:19 2004", "email": "js0754 at bris.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Why is this happening in my renders?"}
