In good years LBNL receives meager funding for Radiance from the US\nDepartment of Energy and/or California Energy Commission.  In bad years\nGreg has provided support without recieving anything in return.  There have\nalso been some people that have paid Greg directly to develop new features.\n\n\nMaybe we should add a full list those who have provided funds at\nradiance-online.org.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Wed, May 15, 2013 at 12:16 PM, Chien Si Harriman <\nchien.harriman at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130709/2ea929d0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] (no subject)", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Tue, 9 Jul 2013 16:15:35 -0700"}
