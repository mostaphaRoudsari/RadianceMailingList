Please download the new version there now, and *follow* the instructions on the download page for setting your environment (PATH and RAYPATH), and you should be good to go.\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n- Rob\n\n\nSent: Saturday, January 26, 2013 5:47 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHello,\nI have to install radiance, I installed radiance by downloading from http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/windows-installation. But it lacks a lot of things. Does anyone know how to install from source code? or is there any other proper windows install available?\nRegards\nImran\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130709/82500ed1/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] how to insta", "tags": [], "sender": "ar_imranagha at yahoo.com", "datetime": "Tue, 9 Jul 2013 15:46:19 -0600"}
