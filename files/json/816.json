The inside of the chapter\nhouse im modelling I would expect to be a little orangey as the textures are\norangy-ish colour. Which is what I get when I do a render then run pcond -s,\nits too dark really for an unfiltered render:\n\nhttps://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/0j8_md0p1NAu1fdWB6pt8A7o/12hrinternal-\ns.jpg\n<https://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/0j8_md0p1NAu1fdWB6pt8A7o/12hrinternal\n-s.jpg>\n\nBut when I run pcond -h the renders come out very grey, any idea why this\nis? Is it correct, is it something to do with the light levels, or contrast\nforcing it to grey?\n\nhttps://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/2u4diWLd_7Kih_chtUlZTA7o/12hrinternal-\nh.jpg\n<https://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/2u4diWLd_7Kih_chtUlZTA7o/12hrinternal\n-h.jpg>\n\nIf it is meant to be like this then why? Any ideas\n\nJohn\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040405/175d5ab6/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F90FAF3BE@l-gnts05>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Apr  5 10:57:49 2004", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Why is this happening in my renders?"}
