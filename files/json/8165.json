The pmap development is going on, Jan had presented the 4.x-pmap extension on the workshop in Copenhagen. It is not available at the moment, so we have to wait until he can make any new announcements, but I would for sure prefer waiting for the new pmap to be polished and released instead of tweaking the old code.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pma", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
