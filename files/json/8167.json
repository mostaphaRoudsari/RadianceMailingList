{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nNice that I slept through this one, too...  Your debugging tips are\nhelpful.  Another way to determine whether you are looking at the\nback or front of a surface is in rvu, which reports the first surface\nhit (even if it's invisible) and tells you back or front.  This is\nonly for materials that care which side you hit, like lights, illums,\ndielectric, etc.  Plastic and metal won't let you know.  The only way\nto tell for these surfaces is to turn backface visibility off with -\nbv0.  This can cause your scene to look a bit confused, so I only\nrecommend it as a last resort.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum illuminating outside?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40DDF63F-B90C-4229-8BFE-D8C0B7C73491@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<MAILGW02KrQkHwEI78K00254eb6@smtp.nus.edu.sg>", "<4992B6CA.1010306@nus.edu.sg>"], "datetime": "Wed Feb 11 07:20:42 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mkillum illuminating outside?"}
