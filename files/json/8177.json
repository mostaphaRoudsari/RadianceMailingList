I typically use a single\n360 degree source to encompass by sky and ground.\n2 - Your zip file didn't include test_Model1.opt, used by the rcontrib\ncommand, but make sure that -ab is 2 or greater to\nget inter-reflected contribution from the sky on a ceiling illuminance\nsensor (if -ab isn't sepcified in the opt file rcontrib defaults to -ab 1).\n\nLet me know if these two changes don't give better results and I'll\ninvestigate further.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 23, 2013 at 4:02 AM, Don Stearn <don.stearn at iesve.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130723/d7cf0e59/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image001.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 2684 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130723/d7cf0e59/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Query regarding rcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 09:27:10 -0700"}
