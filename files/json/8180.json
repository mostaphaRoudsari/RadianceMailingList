Put this in your white_sky.sky:\nvoid glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4  1 1 1  0\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4  0 0 1  360\n\n\n@Andy\nThe file names are all messed up by Windows. It's test_Model2.opt that\nyou're looking for. -ab is actually set to 5.\n\n@Don,\nyou're overwriting rcontrib's default for -lr:\n$ rcontrib -defaults\n...\n-lr -10     # limit reflection (Russian roulette)\n...\n\nYour setting it to -lr 8\nNote the difference between positive and negative integers. I have to\nadmit that this is one of the more obscure options that I don't tend to\ntemper with. See man rpict. I ran your model with the -lr 8 removed from\nthe opt file. Completely different outcome.\n\nAlso, your -ad is not very high. Unless you nudge it up a lot, there is\nno point in using 4 Reinhart subdivisions of the Tregenza patches. An\n-ad of 4096 is decent for a normal rtrace daylight simulation. For\nrcontrib, it should be much higher.\n\nI don't know how you post-process the irradiance vector, since this\nscript(?) is not included in the Zip file. However, you're calling\nrcontrib with the -V+ option. This gives you the *absolute* contribution\nfrom the sky patches, ie the irradiance at the sensor points.\n\nOne tends to use -V- here to get the daylight coefficients, ie the\n*relative* contribution from the sky patches. Once they have been\ncalculated, the DC are multiplied with the sky vector to get actual\nirradiance values.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Query regarding rcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 22:43:34 +0100"}
