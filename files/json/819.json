{"body": "\n47000 comparato a 55600....\nbe' non e' mica male...\n...boh!\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]On Behalf Of\nCaroline Prochazka\nSent: 06 April 2004 14:46\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n4. On a perfectly clear morning in a low pollution\narea (assumed turbidity=2) my light meter reading read\napprox. 55600 lux. A Radiance test (modelling an\nunobstructed horizontal plane outdoors) for the same\ndate and time, and lat. long settings, with\nturbidity=2 produced an exterior light level of 47000\nlux (15% off the true reading!). While there may have\nbeen some diffuse reflection off nearby buildings,\nthere was certainly no direct reflection or shadow on\nthe light meter. This seems to be much too large a\ndifference. Any suggestions?\n\n__\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F90FAF3CF@l-gnts05>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr  6 16:01:06 2004", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Exterior light levels and daylight factors"}
