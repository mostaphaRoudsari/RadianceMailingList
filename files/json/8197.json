I am probably not going to be able to stay\nthe second day of the conference (I'll be there the 12th and 13th), so\ncould you schedule me for the 13th to present?\n\nAlstan told me that he received a free admission to the last Radiance\nconference when he gave a pre-workshop session. Since the workshop is free\nthis year, will the 4/5 of us presenting on the 12th get any compensation,\nlike the dinner?\n\nThanks,\nKera\n\n\nOn Wed, Jul 24, 2013 at 5:29 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\nRobert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130724/d650de7b/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA322630D7D499@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Kera Lagios", "datetime": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:31:44 -0400"}
