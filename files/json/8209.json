During sunrise and\nsunset, gendaylit shows \"ERROR: Model parameters out of range\".   so I plan\nto use gensky to generate the sky model (-B b -R r), where b and r are\ncalculated by \"illumiance/179\". However,  I found the illuminance value at\n5 pm (calculated using gensky with default sky type) jumps a lot from illum\nat 4 pm (calculated using gendaylit). I changed the sky type to +i, which\ndecreases values.  My question is that how I should choose the sky type for\ngensky to avoid big change from gendaylit?\n\nThanks\n\nJH\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130731/a98a1439/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jia Hu", "datetime": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 00:20:01 -0400"}
