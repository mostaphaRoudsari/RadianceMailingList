{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nA bared cylinder lamp (with 60cm length and 3.2cm diameter) is installed on\nthe wall and illuminance values were measured at some points and to some\ndirections as shown in the linked image. Unfortunately, the illuminance\nvalues calculated with Radiance are different from measured values,\nespecially when the sensor is near the lamp or  the incident angles are high\n(K~O).\n\nLink image <http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test.gif>\n\nWhat can be supposed as the cause of the discrepancy?\n\nrtrace command was as follow.\ncat pts.pts | rtrace -I -oov -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2 -ds 0.02 test.oct\n\nand all the walls, floor and ceiling was covered with non-glossy black\npaper.
