All new features of gendaylit will be presented\nalso during the radiance workshop and we hope to have the new release 2.2\nready before the RADIANCE workshop takes place.\nHowever, the error you have mentioned might be a different one. We are\njust working on some bugs of the -L option. Are you using this option?\nPlease specify the precise command that leads to the error, including the\nprecise error message and your version of gendaylit (just type gendaylit\nin your terminal).\n\nWendelin\n\n\n___________________________________\nMag.rer.nat.

During sunrise and\nsunset, gendaylit shows \"ERROR: Model parameters out of range\".   so I\nplan to use gensky to generate the sky model (-B b -R r), where b and r\nare calculated by \"illumiance/179\". However,  I found the illuminance\nvalue at 5 pm (calculated using gensky with default sky type) jumps a lot\nfrom illum at 4 pm (calculated using gendaylit). I changed the sky type to\n+i, which decreases values.  My question is that how I should choose the\nsky type for gensky to avoid big change from gendaylit?\n\nThanks\n\nJH\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130731/a2c36858/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Wendelin.Sprenger at ise.fraunhofer.de", "datetime": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 15:28:36 +0200"}
