The picture out of pcond is just visually less bright? If you're looking at values prior to using pcond, your process to get values out of your image is probably based on the assumption that the scene is set up using defaults (visible W/m^2/sr). If you convert to lumens in your scene description from gendaylit, then you have to be careful that you're not again converting to lumens (with a 179 multiplier) after your calculation.\n\nSent: Monday, August 05, 2013 8:13 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nHi all, I'd appreciate your help on the following question:\n\nI'm creating a radiance scene using gendaylit to generate the sky, since I have data of the diffuse horizontal and direct normal irradiance (W/m^2) I'm using the -W option and then -O 2 to obtain the output in lm/m^2/sr (luminance). Then I'm using rpict to generate the picture, and pcond -h to convert it to a human visual response.\n\nBut I realized that if I use the default value of -O in gendaylit (output in radiance of the visible radiation W/m^2/sr) the picture looks less bright.\n\nSo I don't know which one is the right one to use in this case.\n\nI tried to find out if the default input when using pcond would be luminance rather than visible radiation, but couldn't find an answer for that, or maybe there is another command other than pcond, that takes the input in luminance values, then that would be the one I should use.\nOr maybe there is an additional step that I'm missing...\n\nI wonder if somebody can give me a hint about this, and/or where to look..  :)\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\nCh.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130805/2a43e864/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond, luminance or visible radiation?", "tags": [], "sender": "miinchaca at gmail.com", "datetime": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 14:08:42 +0000"}
