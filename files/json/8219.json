I am reading\nTHIS<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdatainformation.pdf>,\nand it says \"Illuminance (Global Horizontal, Direct Normal, Diffuse\nHorizontal, Zenith Luminance).\n\nMy question is: Is there any reason for not using the Direct Normal and the\nDiffuse Horizontal information for making calculations instead of using the\nPerez Model?\n\nI understand that the Daylight Coefficients would not directly apply since\nthe luminance distribution would be unknown? Is it too bad to consider the\ndirect illuminance as it is, and assume the diffuse illuminance as\nisotropic (i.e. assume the diffuse daylight entering through my window is\nthe same as the horizontal) ???\n\nTHANKS\n\nGerm?n Molina\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130805/75a3704c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 20:05:31 -0400"}
