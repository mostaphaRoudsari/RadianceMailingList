{"body": "\nDear Greg,\n\nI have done some additional measurements and the results show as follow.\n\n\nhttp://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test01.gif  Setup\n\nhttp://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test02.gif  Fluorescent lamp (Measurement)\n\nhttp://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test03.gif  Simulation\n\nhttp://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test04.gif  UV lamp (Measurement)\n\n\n\nThe results indicate the UV lamp has different diffuse characteristics\ncompared with common fluorescent lamps if the UVC sensor is cosine corrected\nwell as written in the sensor. If there is no problem with UVC sensor, it\nmight be not easy to model UV lamp with RADIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nSung\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090405/2afbeeaf/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Minki Sung", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3acd9e4a0904050446o3418968fr6ee649c8389ff474@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sun Apr  5 04:46:52 2009", "email": "mkii at iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Re: Comparison of values measured by sensorsand calculated with Radiance (Greg Ward) (Minki Sung)"}
