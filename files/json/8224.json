{"body": "\nHi Sung,\n\nI'm not exactly sure what we are looking at with these plots, but\nit's clear that you need to characterize the sensor response in order\nto understand the situation.  Did  you perform the cosine sensitivity\nexperiment I suggested?  You could mask off a portion of the center\nof a tube if you don't have a small UV source, and see how the sensor\nresponds as a function of incident angle at a fixed distance.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<3acd9e4a0904050446o3418968fr6ee649c8389ff474@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<DB77915B-7DFD-45CE-8B58-DBA5BDA757FB@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<3acd9e4a0904050446o3418968fr6ee649c8389ff474@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sun Apr  5 07:19:49 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Re: Comparison of values measured bysensors and calculated with Radiance (Greg Ward) (Minki Sung)"}
