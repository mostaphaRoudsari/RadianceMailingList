Most probably something is wrong with your\nRadiance installation, the most common origin of all trouble are PATH\nand RAYPATH settings not pointing to the right directories. But here we\nhit a point that I cannot really help you - I have zero experience with\nRadiance on Windows, and usually it is guaranteed 100% more pain for\ndoing the same.
