In order to help move things along, let's all make sure we are good to go on the conferencing tools.\n\nYou need to log on to this url:\n\nhttp://www.mymeetings.com/nc/join.php?i=748078570&p=1653&t=c\n\n...and then enter this info:\nMeeting number:        748078570\nMeeting passcode:      1653\n\nThis will get you onto the webcast. You need to do this whether you are at NREL or remote. You need to have Java enabled, and you will need a plugin as well. Please try getting onto the site well before your presentation slot! Once you are on, we will be able to transfer control to you at the appropriate time. During Q&A, I will be transferring control to the next presenter's system, so we'll lose your slides. I'll try and wait till the last minute in case you need to reference your presentation during the Q&A.\n\nWe will do a better job of fielding questions from the webcast attendees as well.\n\nTo hear what's going on, call one of these numbers:\n1-210-516-8514           1-877-960-9637\n...and enter this code:\nPasscodes:\nParticipant: 8824531\n\nPlease mute your phones, if you are not presenting! (At any given time, that means, like, all of you.)\n\nWe'll be going live in a little bit, \"see\" you then.\n\n- Rob\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, August 09, 2013 5:21 PM\nTo: 'Baldy, Chris J.

Here are some final details for you as you prepare -- better late than never, eh?\n\nAll Presenters:\nWe would like to have the slide decks pre-loaded if at all possible, especially for days 2 and 3, so that the transitions occur smoothly. Please (please?) upload your slide decks to:\n\nhttp://dbinbox.com/rpg777\n\n...when they are ready. The night before is totally fine, even the morning of.  Remote presenters, this includes you too! We will work with you if you absolutely must use your own computer, but we would like to minimize that. If you are planning to use your own computer, please see \"Remote attendees and presenters\", below.\n\nAttending in person:\nBe sure to bring your government-issued PHOTO ID, and this goes double-triple for foreign nationals. We got word today that all paperwork is in order with NREL Security, but they will not let you on campus without your required ID (passport, visa, etc -- that is all spelled out in the FNDC forms you filled out).\n\nBetween Jennifer's Doodle poll, Greg's email, and Mudit's Doodle poll(s), I think you all have multiple methods for getting together on rideshare, should you wish to do so.\n\nArriving at NREL:\nHere's all you need to know about that:\nhttp://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html\nSecurity knows what you're here for (so does the NSA), and we will have hosts to escort you, but FYI we are meeting in the San Juan Conference Room in the RSF, all three days.\n\nRemote attendees and presenters:\nTo access the screencast, hit up this url:\nhttp://www.mymeetings.com/nc/join.php?i=748078570&p=1653&t=c\n\n...and then enter this info:\nMeeting number:        748078570\nMeeting passcode:      1653\n\nYou will be able to view the presentation, and we will give remote presenters control of the show when needed.\n\nTo hear what's going on, call one of these numbers:\n1-210-516-8514           1-877-960-9637\n\n...and enter this code:\nPasscodes:\nParticipant: 8824531\n\nCertain dialing restrictions can apply from specific countries. See this link for details:\nhttps://www.mymeetings.com/audioconferencing/pdf/GlobalAccessDialingInformation.pdf\n\nThat's it for now, until I remember all the other stuff I was supposed to tell you. Safe travels, and see you next week. We'll leave the lights off for ya (get it?)!\n\nRob & Jennifer\nRadiance Workshop Organizers, 2013\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Workshop - Attendee Details", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Rober", "datetime": "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 08:13:45 -0600"}
