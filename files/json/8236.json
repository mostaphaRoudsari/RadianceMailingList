As soon as those are produced, we'll get them posted somewhere and links will be made available. Hopefully those will be ready in a few days.\n\n-Rob\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNREL Commercial Buildings Research Group\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2013 05:37 PM Mountain Standard Time\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Andy,\n\nCould you make the Radiance Workshop presentations available with the audio attached?
