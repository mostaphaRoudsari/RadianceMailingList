However, I also understand that the second term of the 5phase method\nintends to subtract the direct sun, but leaving there the inter-reflected\nsun. That is, all the sun's contributions are calculated on the first term\n(3phase method), and then, all those rays going directly from the sky to\nthe window are eliminated, but leaving the rays that come from the sun and\nfirst bounce on the exterior scene.\n\nShort answer is NO? I hope I understand, hahaha? my head hurt after that\nday, haha.\n\nBye!\n\n\n2013/8/17 Leyla Sanati <leylasanati at gmail.com>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130817/3afc376e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Sat, 17 Aug 2013 12:02:51 -0400"}
