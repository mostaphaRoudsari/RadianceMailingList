While anything based on daylight factors is limiting, you\nhave qualified that every step of the way. The nice thing about this is\nthat you have created a process for really applying a daylight factor\napproach early on in the design process. You should cross-post this to\nthe radiance list!\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 9, 2009, at 7:02 AM, Reinhart, Christoph wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\nDear colleagues:\n\n\n\nIt might be a complete 'faux pas' to send a design sequence based on\nrules of thumb to a building simulationmailing list. But, I take the\nrisk. We recently developed and validated a rules-of-thumb based design\nsequence for diffuse\ndaylighting:http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents\n/DiffuseDaylightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf. The series offers design\nadvice for daylighting at the programming and massing stage and - being\nbased on the daylight factor  - applies to climates with either mostly\ndiffuse sky conditions or heavily obstructed sites. Alternatively, the\ndesign sequence can be used in combination with a direct shading study.\nThe supporting research can be found\nathttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDa\nylightingDesignSequenceInLRT.pdf.\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing.\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\nGund Hall 331b, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart@gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart@gsd.harvard.edu>\n\nDaylighting Design: Rules of Thumb\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDay\nlightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf> , Simulation\n<http://www.daysim.com/> , Executive Education\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01683>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090413/3326e8df/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "rpg@rumblestrip.org", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF03612264@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Apr 13 05:59:22 2009", "email": "Rob Guglielmetti", "subject": "Re: [Bldg-sim] Daylighting Rules of Thumb"}
