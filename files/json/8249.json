Standard bash syntax doesn't seem to work in that case (i.e. xPos = 5 and $xPos).\n\nSpecifically, the coordinates of some of my objects change as a function of angle. So instead of recalculating all the x, y, and z coordinates by hand it would be really useful to just define a new angle and let Radiance's oconv program use the updated Cartesian coordinates.\n\nI somehow have this deep belief that this should be possible :)\n\nIf you know a clever way to do this, please let me know.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael\n\n\n--\nMichael Bannert, Dipl.-Psych.\nVision & Cognition Lab, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Univ. of T?bingen & BCCN T?bingen\nOtfried-M?ller-Str. 25, 72076 T?bingen, Germany\nPhone: +49 - (0)7071 / 29 - 89031\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Michael Bannert", "datetime": "Fri, 23 Aug 2013 09:51:50 +0200"}
