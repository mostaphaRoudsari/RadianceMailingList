Oftentimes,\nthese are only relative values, and you can't expect to get meaningful\nabsolute units as a result.  What you will have is a valid color, where\nCIE (x,y) chromaticity is computed by:\n\nx = X/(X + Y + Z)\ny = Y/(X + Y + Z)\n\nNote that the absolute values drop out of the above formulae.\n\nIf on the other had, your units are watts/whatever, your result from\ncieresp.cal will be lumens/whatever.  If you had radiance in\nwatts/steradian/meter^2 on input, your Y output will be\nlumens/steradian/meter^2, or \"nits.\"\n\n\nYes, you should divide by 179 to get back into RGB radiance color\nvalues.  The pages 305-307 deal with reflectance, which is unitless and\ntherefore has no conversion factor.\n\n\nAgain, yes.\n\n\nDo you mean \"gensky?\"  If so, the solar radiance is in units of\nwatts/sr/m^2 using the standard 179 value for luminous efficacy.\nUnless you know better, it is recommended to simply use this value, so\nit drops out of the calculation when you return to photometric units\nduring the analysis phase at the end.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Units", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Jul 16 07:13:45 2004"}
