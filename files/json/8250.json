{"body": "\nHi!\nI think that there are two ways. One is to generate a mapping on a\nsource object, the other is \"modeling the athmosphere\". The second\noption is quite ambitious, and may depend e..g. on photon map, spectral\nrendering and other stuff (i.e. modifying mist parameters only exists in\nRadzilla, not in Radiance Classic now afaik). The first option seams to\nbe more realistic with Radiance Classic - so the formulae would have to\nbe translated into a colorfunc, and the near-distance atmospheric\neffects could be modeled using mist.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] sky models and color gradients", "sender": "Lars O.
