You just have to export the variable before calling a Radiance command parsing the file. All lines starting with ! are expanded when the scene is parsed, so this is a generic method to include any text (which can be parameters for materials, geometries, complete Radiance scene objects).\n\nCheers, Lars.\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130823/d58743da/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "grobe at gmx.net>", "datetime": "Fri, 23 Aug 2013 08:39:43 -0600"}
