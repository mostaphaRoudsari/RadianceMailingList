The PDF of his slides (large) is at:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co/VanDenWymelenberg-LuminanceMetrics.pdf\n\nThe parent webpage has links to the actual presentation videos:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co\n\nThe talk was in the first afternoon session:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmACL4gejp0&list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx&index=2\n\nKevin starts talking around the 47 minute mark.\n\nI recommend you also check out the research of Dr. Mehlika Inanici at U. Washington:\n\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/MI-RESEARCH.html\n\nI am cross-posting this to the HDRI mailing list, where you might prefer to follow up.
