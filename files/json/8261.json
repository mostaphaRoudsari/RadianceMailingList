You need to have radiance installed, but that's about it.  The\nscript downloads geometry and files needed for the simulation.  It's\nwritten in bash so it should work on Mac or Linux (sorry windows).\n\nBest,\nAndy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130826/c42c94d5/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Mon, 26 Aug 2013 10:43:01 -0700"}
