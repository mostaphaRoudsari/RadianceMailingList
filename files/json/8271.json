If you use the \"-1\" option to pfilt, I don't think you will get this error.\n\nAlso, I would like to point you to the 2002 paper I wrote with Elena on tristimulus color approximations, in case you haven't seen it:\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/index.html\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<2C27481A-9DB2-4C16-A7E3-DB6A40397A63@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 28 Aug 2013 09:47:19 -0700"}
