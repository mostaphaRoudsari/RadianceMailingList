If that's your problem\nupgrade/downgrade to a different\ndriver version or replace the graphics card with another type/chip.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090424/59af9a43/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] fatal XIO - newbie", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0904241329n36da68c2w7d8c699679fbe4da@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<ae8c0edd0904230747x59b20473m567cc30a913dd4b6@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Apr 24 13:29:21 2009", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] fatal XIO - newbie"}
