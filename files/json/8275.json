The properties of the\nglass are as follows:\n\nVisible Transmittance: 67%\nReflectance: 18%\nClarity (small-angle scattering): 4%\nThickness: 8mm\n\nTo generate accurate BSDF files, I thought I should model the blind slats\nas trans material, but I am struggling with translating above properties\ninto trans material modifiers.\nI'd appreciate it if you helped me with writing the blind material script.\nAlso, I am not sure where to include the glass thickness. genblinds does\nnot seem to have an option for blind thickness.\nDoes the glass thickness in this case affect the BSDF results?\n\nThanks,\nLeyla\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130830/be467039/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Leyla Sanati", "datetime": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 00:00:45 -0500"}
