The basic reference is section 5.2.6 from \"Rendering with Radiance,\" attached below for your convenience.  (Responders please delete attachment in your replies.)\n\nPlugging in your parameters of:\n\nTs = .04\nTd = .67 - .04 = .63\nRd = .18\nRs = 0 (guessing no clear reflections)\n\nThese yield:\n\nA7 = Ts/(Td+Ts) = .04/(.63+.04) = .0597\n\nA6 = (Td+Ts)/(Rd+Td+Ts) = (.63+.04)/(.18+.63+.04) = .7882\n\nA5 = 0 (adjust if you want to scatter your transmitted rays a bit)\n\nA4 = Rs = 0\n\nA1 = A2 = A3 = .18/((1-0)*(1-A6) = .18/(1-.7882) = .85 (assumes uncolored material)\n\nSo, there's your material:\n\nvoid trans frosted_glass\n0\n0\n7 0.85 0.85 0.85 0 0 0.7882 0.0597\n\nRegarding thickness, so long as the distance between slats is 16 cm or greater, you needn't worry about it.  If they are closer together, you may want to use the xform -a option to create your own array of slats.  It's actually pretty simple -- genblinds isn't doing that much for you with flat slats, anyway.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130830/531eb0f4/attachment-0002.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: TransParams.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nSize: 81902 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130830/531eb0f4/attachment-0001.pdf>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130830/531eb0f4/attachment-0003.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 5-phase method tutorial - section 6.1", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 15:43:23 -0700"}
