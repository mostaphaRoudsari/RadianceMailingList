Possibly because\nantimatter messes up the ambient exclude logic?\n\nAs soon as I changed the color of the little \"light bulb room\" to pure\nblack, the situation improved:\n\nOld: http://markjstock.org/transfer/img06.png\nNew: http://markjstock.org/transfer/img11.png\n\nAmbient parameters might actually be too high. But the rendering looks\nnice! Turrell must have used a very black little room for his light\nsource!\n\nFiles: http://markjstock.org/transfer/afrum1.tar\n\nImprovements/comments welcome. More Turrell pieces are in the works,\nas I figure them out.\n\nMark\n\nOn 9/2/13, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Spots when recreating Turrell installati", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Tue, 3 Sep 2013 22:00:31 -0400"}
