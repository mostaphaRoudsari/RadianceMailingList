The room is positioned 3 meters above the ground (on second floor).\nFor the windows, I generated venetian blinds using genblind. I used -a\noption in xform to duplicate the venetian blinds. Then I used xform to\nposition the South wall, the windows and venetian blinds on xy plane with\nthe interior wall facing up at z=0.  In genBSDF script, I set -dim command\nto cover the two windows and the wall between them. Since I am new to\ngenBSDF, I am not sure what is causing the error. Does the clerestory\nopenings on the south wall need to be filled when creating the window BSDFs?\n\n\n#objects/venetain80.rad\nvoid plastic blindslat\n0\n0\n5 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.1 0\n\n!genblinds blindslat blinds .02 2 1 83 80 +r .2 | xform -rz -90 -t 5.0 3.95\n3.8 -a 2 -t 4 0 0\n\n$ xform -rz 180 -rx -90 objects/glazing_W.rad objects/venetian80.rad\nmaterials/room.mat objects/Swall.rad > bsdf/windows-v80-1.rad\n\n$ xform -t 12 -3 -4  bsdf/windows-v80-1.rad > bsdf/windows-v80.rad\n\n$ genBSDF +f +b -geom meter -dim 1 7 0.8 1.8 -.2 0 -t4 5\nbsdf/windows-v80.rad > bsdf/windows-v80_t45.xml\n\nPlease let me know if you need to look at any of my files.\n\nThanks,\nLeyla\n\n\nOn Fri, Sep 6, 2013 at 5:12 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130907/95cdde3e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF error", "tags": [], "sender": "Leyla Sanati", "datetime": "Sat, 7 Sep 2013 10:54:58 -0500"}
