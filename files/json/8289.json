The Radiance file you attached doesn't even contain your BSDF material.  It is a single-material object made of a smokey dielectric.\n\nAt the very least, you should include the error that you got and the context in which you got it.  Otherwise, no one can help you.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130909/c870ee4c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] FW: BSDF Material Error", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 08:19:12 -0700"}
