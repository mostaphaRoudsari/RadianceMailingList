The source is located\nin /rad/install/ray.  Any ideas?  I know a few of you out there are\nrunning Radiance on Cygwin, but I have just about zero experience with\nit.  Any tips or pointers to FAQs would be most appreciated.\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Mon Jul 19 19:31:00 2004"}
