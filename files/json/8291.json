{"body": "\nHi Marina,\n\nYes you want to describe the glass geometry, that is one polygon\nrepresenting the multiple layers of the physical makeup. The material is\nwhat should represent the behavior. If you take the output from Optics\nand run it through optics2rad you will get a single BRTDfunc material\ndescription. One thing to be careful of is that this is dependent on the\ncorrect orientation (normal) of the glass geometry. I believe that the\nnormal is supposed to be pointing \"into\" the interior of the building.\nOne way to check normal orientation in radiance is to assign\n(temporaryily) a \"glow\" material to the glass geometry and view it. The\nsides that are \"black\" are the back sides of the geometry, the sides\nthat are not black are the positive normal side.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\nmarina aviles olmos wrote:\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<49F85AE5.5030606@gmail.com>", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<49F86A28.9080509@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<49F85AE5.5030606@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 29 07:54:35 2009", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Description of complex glass systems (geometry+\tmaterial)"}
