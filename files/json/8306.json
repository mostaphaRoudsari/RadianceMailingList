I expect that a scene with ~4000 suns should\nhave higher parameters for direct sampling anyway.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Radmap irradiance shifts", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE705206932@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE705206736@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "<C61DDE17.A374%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 29 11:06:35 2009", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radmap irradiance shifts"}
