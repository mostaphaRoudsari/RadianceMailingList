I am using the HEAD version from about yesterday...\n\nTHANKS\n\nGerm?n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130912/5bcb81b2/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Germ=E1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 16:03:47 -0400"}
