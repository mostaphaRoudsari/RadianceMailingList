What -O setting are you using when compiling Radiance?  Anything above -O2 has been known to generate incorrect code with gcc.  Even -O2 sometimes causes runtime errors.\n\nIf you recompile and get an error using -O1, try without -O, just using -g, and run it in the debugger.  This is the only way to find out where it is going wrong.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130912/b4b47dc9/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pkgBSDF weird behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 17:00:34 -0700"}
