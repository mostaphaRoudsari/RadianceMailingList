The \"OPT=\"\nline is the one that you should edit according to Greg's suggestions. So\nI think that you could first try:\n\n\"OPT=-01\"\n\nand then if that does not help, you could try:\n\n\"OPT=\"\n\nThis will turn of optimizations.\n\nI think that -g gives debugging output. I think that you could do the\nfollowing to compile with this:\n\nchange\n\nCC=gcc \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\nto\n\nCC=gcc -g \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBest,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 9/13/2013 8:30 AM, Germ?n Molina Larrain wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130913/cdee5bce/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pkgBSDF weird behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Fri, 13 Sep 2013 08:46:33 -0400"}
