I have modeled a window with\nvenetian blinds on the lower part and translucent louvers on the upper part\nof the window. I tried to run genBSDF with my geometry including the\nblinds, louvers, glazing and the window reveal, but I did not get any\nresults back after 14 hours.\n\nI know genBSDF runtime is long, but I wonder if I am doing something wrong,\nor if I could change anything in my model that could make genBSDF run\nfaster.\n\nAttached are the geometry files. Here is what I typed:\n\ngenBSDF -n 12 +f +b -geom meter -t4 5 reveal_glazing.rad venetian80.rad\nLChazed.rad > bsdf/v80_hazed_t45.xm\n\nBest,\nLeyla\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130917/535caff4/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: reveal_glazing.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 2996 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130917/535caff4/attachment.obj>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: venetian80.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 128 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130917/535caff4/attachment-0001.obj>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: LChazed.rad\nType: application/octet-stream\nSize: 137 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130917/535caff4/attachment-0002.obj>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Leyla Sanati", "datetime": "Tue, 17 Sep 2013 18:02:53 -0500"}
