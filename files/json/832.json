{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to simulate the extinction of light inside a MIST volume, for\ndifferent sky conditions.\nThe simulations seems to work well using \"sun\" as the light source, but I\nhave problems when using an overcast sky or a sunny sky with no sun (-s\noption).\nThe light sources for the MIST volume are \"sun\" and \"sky\" which is defined\nusing glow.\nDid MIST work for glow type light sources? If not, what do you recommend to\nuse to simulate this case, with diffuse light coming from the sky?\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nGuedi\n---\nArch.
