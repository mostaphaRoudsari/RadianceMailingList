My actual world.rad file contains this:-\n\n*******************\n\n# C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MinGW-Radiance\\bin\\gensky -ang 45 45 -s\n\n# Ground ambient level: 14.8\n\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n\n2 skybr skybright.cal\n\n0\n\n7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow 0 0 4 1.00 1.00 1.00 0\nskyglow source sky   0 0 4 0 0 1 180\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5     0.5   0.5   0.5   0.0   0.2\n********************\n\n\n\nOther bits of the scene are represented in another file <the rectangular groundplane and horse).\n\n\nYou did direct me to one bug, my specified sky colour was ignored and [1 1 1] was always inserted. Luckily I've only ever used a [1 1 1] sky, thanks for fixing my future-bug.\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n________________________________\nSent: 18 September 2013 14:54\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDo you have a sky dome hemisphere definition in your scene such as the following? It would have to come after your gensky command in the scene.\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\n\nHowever, when I try with the -s sky:\n\nIt just fails to render \"pfilt: picture too dark or too bright \". The -c -u -i skies also don't render.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20130918/ac8e98af/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Confused by GenSk", "tags": [], "sender": "pgl2 at st-andrews.ac.uk", "datetime": "Wed, 18 Sep 2013 14:40:19 +0000"}
