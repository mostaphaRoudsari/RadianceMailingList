I\npersonally would not ever go for nVidia.\n\nIf you are using a distro which default-enables Compiz desktop effects,\nsuch as Ubuntu, try disabling them:\n\nSystem > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects\n\nUbuntu defaults to a setting which give you semi-tranparent windows,\nsmooth animations when launching apps or switching desktop. It's called\n'Normal' in the control panel, When set to 'Extra', all the whizz-bang\nis enabled, leaving OSX and Windows 7 in the dust.\n\nTry setting it to 'None', and see if your problem goes away. I had a\nsimilar problem on an Ubuntu box with nVidia card some time ago. rvu\nwould launch, but then get stuck for up to 30 seconds. The fix described\naboved sorted the problem.\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] fatal XIO - newbie", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<49F2B1AB.2050001@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<49e38c23.20018e0a.2a5e.68beSMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Apr 24 23:38:33 2009", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] fatal XIO - newbie"}
