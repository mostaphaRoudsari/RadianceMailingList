Great information, very useful\nJohn! I have two further going questions which some of you might have\nencountered in the past:\n\n*\tIs there a way to extract a view point defined in  a 3ds file into\nRadiance?\n\n*\tA problem with AutoCAD 14R seems to be that when it exports into 3ds\nfile format the naming of the layers changes from whatever they are in\nAutoCAD into m_GLOBAL_x (x=1,...,n). This is really bothersome as it forces\nyou to go through the file and identify what GLOBAL_x is. Is anybody aware\nof a workaround for this?\n\n\nChristoph\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040719/4325238d/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "datetime": "Mon Jul 19 20:52:19 2004"}
