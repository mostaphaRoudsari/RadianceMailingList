{"body": "\nhi,\nglow is considered as a light source by the direct component only within the\ngiven distance (4th number of glow definition) and I guess \"mist\" doesn't\nconsider glow with 0 (or -1) because it is not a direct light source.\n\na quick and probably useless (**) trick is to change the sky description\n\nfrom\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n3 1 1  1\nto\n\nskyfunc light skyglow\n0\n0\n3 1 1  1\n\nthis way the 1st bounce is now direct but -ds doesn't work on the sky and\nthere is just a big point source above so ...  (**)\n\nanother trick (this time should be ok) is to create a big polygonal volume\nof brightfunc-light-sources with the sky distribution... in this case you\ncould be able to use -ds.\n\nhope it helps,\n\ngiulio\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]On Behalf Of Guedi\nCapeluto\nSent: 16 April 2004 10:07\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\nHi,\n\nI am trying to simulate the extinction of light inside a MIST volume, for\ndifferent sky conditions.\nThe simulations seems to work well using \"sun\" as the light source, but I\nhave problems when using an overcast sky or a sunny sky with no sun (-s\noption).\nThe light sources for the MIST volume are \"sun\" and \"sky\" which is defined\nusing glow.\nDid MIST work for glow type light sources? If not, what do you recommend to\nuse to simulate this case, with diffuse light coming from the sky?\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nGuedi\n---\nArch.
