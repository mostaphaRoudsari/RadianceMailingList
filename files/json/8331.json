I have a large database of northern european\nwoodland reflectance spectra (Parkkinnen et al, an IEEE paper), though\nunfortunately it's not labelled, so perhaps not that useful. Luckily I\nhave a spectroradiometer so can go out and measure some target plants.\nIn my example I made up my reflectances but the transmission data was\nfrom a maple leaf\n(http://www.apogeeinstruments.co.uk/content/transmissiongraph_large.jpg).\n\nThanks for the link to the book, it looks very useful! I think if I'd\nread more when I started using radiance four years ago,  I wouldn't be\nstuck re-writing my Matlab wrapper now. All my previous Radiance models\nhave been for simple visual stimuli for experiments so they have all\nbeen grey plastics. Now I need to re-tool for leaves I have to unwrap a\nlot of spaghetti-code!\n\nBut yes, the project is really fun, here's a summary of some early work\n<https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxkhw64wd3gkd7w/Lovell_et_al_IECASAB_Poster_A4_FINAL.pptx>.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 20/09/2013 12:28, Reinier Zeldenrust wrote:\n\n\n--\nDr P.
