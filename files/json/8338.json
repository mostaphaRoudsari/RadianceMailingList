It does not really work on our side.\n\nBoth a folder and a file have been created.\nBut the folder is empty and the file just has a short header with three\nlines:\n#rhino2rad;  ;#Materials:;  ;Geometry:\n\nIs there something wrong with our system or do we have a wrong rhino\nversion (engl. 4.0 evaluation)?\n\nThank you for a short answer...\n\nArne\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090423/68ad7115/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rhino2rad - Rhinoceros to Radiance", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF03826775@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<8EDE692B-C91A-4FEE-9D49-B217DB2E1851@andres-lichtplanung.de>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr 23 14:36:18 2009", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rhino2rad - Rhinoceros to Radiance"}
