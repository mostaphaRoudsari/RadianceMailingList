{"body": "\nI am very interested in a colored sky model as well Mark. Thank-you for\noffering to share! This work would be a perfect topic to present at the\nRadiance workshop in November. FYI, 3ds Max Design already has the Utah\nsky model implemented. It generates really impressive sunsets.\n\nChristoph\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Mark\nStock\nSent: Thursday, April 16, 2009 9:26 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nI am interested in this, too. How best to make it work? Convert\nthe formulae in the paper to a .cal file (that modifies a mist\nvolume or a dome-like source?) Pre-render a sky dome? Modify the\nRadiance source itself?\n\nSince it is unlikely that one of us has the extra classes to make\nthe authors' sample code work, I volunteer to share what I come\nup with if I get done first.\n\nMark\n\nOn Thu, 16 Apr 2009, Lars O.
