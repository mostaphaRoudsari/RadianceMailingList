{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI remember that I once have seen a paper on modeling the color gradients\nof the sky dome related to weather, time and location information, and\nif I am not completely wrong, the authors had done that work using\nRadiance. I am aware of several models for creating color gradients, but\nI could not find anything that has been applied to Radiance. Of course I\nam aware of Mark Stock's skycolor.cal, but that one takes known colors\nas an input. Does anyone else have information on the topic, how to set\nextend radiance brightness distribution by color models for the sky dome?\n\nThanks!!!
