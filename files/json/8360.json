{"body": "\nHi,\n\nFor Radiance images preview and analysis in Windows and Linux you can use\nfree tool RadDisplay <http://deluminaelab.com/en/tools.html>\nIt has graphical user interface, and you can make false color images with\nvarious palettes.\nYou can also adjust image exposure, trace pixels, and preview either\n(ir)radiance or (il)luminace values.\nCurrent version can only save images in jpg format, but we are preparing new\nversion that can also save in .pic/.hdr file format.\n\nFor now it doesn't offer possibility to print images, but thank you for\nidea. We'll try to implement it in next version of the program.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090408/411ba586/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance and irradiation", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<124b40400904080145p19be4b82w173185f81bc2a7f3@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<8202BD94.197@wmtao.com> <49DB29EF.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com>", "<49DB7D06.20903@rumblestrip.org>", "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7025DD2FB@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "<49DBA5AD.4050502@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr  8 01:45:38 2009", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance and irradiation"}
