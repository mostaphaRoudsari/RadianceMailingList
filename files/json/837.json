I don't want to map on a transparent surface, but an opaque\none, to describe a mosaic. If I used the void modifier, I think I would\nhave to model three surfaces, so that each surface takes one material\nmodified by the mixpict \"mask\" - that doesn't sound very reasonable to\nme. So the question is still if I can use a mixpict-modified material\nas background in a mixpict modifier's definition, some kind of nested\nmixpict modifier.\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
