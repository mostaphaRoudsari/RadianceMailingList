{"body": "\nHi Caroline,\n\nThere are as many possible reasons to your problem as there are option\nsettings in rpict.  (I.e., a lot.)  You have to give us a little more\ndetail about what settings you are using in your rad input file (if\nyou're using rad) or your rendering/simulation command (if you're\ncalling rpict or rtrace directly).  Posting an image if you have a\nwebsite is also an incredible help.  If you haven't generated any\nimages, I recommend you do so, even if you don't require them for your\nanalysis.  Renderings are one of the best debugging tools ever\nconceived.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<20040416185745.37206.qmail@span.corp.yahoo.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<7C92C554-8FDB-11D8-8667-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<20040416185745.37206.qmail@span.corp.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Apr 16 21:23:18 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Radiance simulations maintain 200 luxminimum?"}
