{"body": "\nThanks for your quick reply Lars, of cousrse I meant Windows!!! ;)\nSo here I am into the Command Prompt but if I specify what you suggested\nme pcomb fails and no output is created (more precisely: a 0 kb file is\ncreated as output).

Any\nclue about how I can fix that?\nThanks!\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Lars\nO.

The most useful way would be\nfalsecolor images. As falsecolor by default multiplies pixel values by\n179 to get from radiometric to photometric units, you must tell it to\nuse a multiplier of 1 instead of 179. Than, you most probably have to\nset the scale in a way that you see the irradiances in your image. One\nexample, using a scale of 0-5000 and the multiplier 1 (to avoid the\nconversion to lx) would be like this:\n\nfalsecolor -i input.hdr -m 1 -s 5000 -l \"Watts/m2\" > output.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry but I have no idea wether you can do that.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3017F646B@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr  7 04:44:24 2009", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Radiance and irradiation"}
