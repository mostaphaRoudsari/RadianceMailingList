{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI am a keen Radiance user since one year now but unfortunatly, not\nhaving access to a Linux machine, I am forced to stick to pc. This is\nunder a number of aspect quite convenient because being an architect,\nall of the other software I use is pc-based and I am totally unnfamiliar\nwith the linux os. I hope you can help me bearing in mind my type of use\nof the software.\nI have a couple of questions:\n\nI understand radiance calculates irradiance and then uses a standard\nconversion factor Kr=179 lumens/watt. Hence it should be possible to use\nit for solar irradiation calculation as well as for light analysis.\nMy question is, how can I display directly watts/m2 instead of lux?\n\nAs well, in order to perform irradiation analysis a sky generated\nfollowing the perez-all weather model would be more accurate than just\nusing the standardCIE skies supported by gensky. I understand there is\nan application called gendaylit that does exectly this. From where can I\ndownload a windows version?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nGiovanni Betti\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090407/6506d038/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Giovanni Betti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3017F6467@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Apr  7 03:54:21 2009", "email": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance and irradiation"}
