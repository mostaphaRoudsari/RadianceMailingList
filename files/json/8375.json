Rendering the images for every 5\nminutes is not a problem, however, I stuck when trying to convert the HDRs\nto some tonemapped images. As far as I got it, In ra_jpeg/hdr2jpeg no\nexposure can be given at all, in ra_tiff/ra_bmp only relative exposures can\nbe applied.\n\nThus my question: is it possible to explicitly set the exposure used in the\ntonemapping process with any tool in Radiance?\n\nThanks in advance!\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131022/4d184717/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Geisler-Moroder", "datetime": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 15:45:47 +0200"}
