I think that what you are looking for is the second option that\nI describe above.\n\nNot sure if this answers your questions, but perhaps gives you some\nthings to look into.\n\nBest,\n\n-Jack\n\n--\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 10/22/2013 9:45 AM, David Geisler-Moroder wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131022/a6efb9e7/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Tone mapping for animati", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 10:05:15 -0400"}
