{"body": "\nDear Greg,\n\nI am so sorry not to have explained the model enough. I'll check my sensors\nat first and drop a line here if I could find what is problem. Thank you\nagain for your kind reply.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSung\n\n\nMessage: 5\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general@radiance-online.org>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; delsp=yes; format=flowed\nDear Sung,\nIt seems I misread your diagram the first time, so misinterpreted\nyour problem.  I'm thinking now that the issue may be the cosine\ncorrection of your sensors rather than what is going on in Radiance.\nMost lux sensors have a crude calibration with respect to incident\nangle.  I recommend checking your sensors against one that is more\nreliable, or at least verifying that they have the proper cosine\nresponse by measuring a point source at varying incident angles.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090403/ba4deb24/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "gward@lmi.net", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<382F0401-1EAD-4D2F-BD31-FC2CF19FFF42@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 08:59:18 -0700", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Re: Comparison of values measured bysensors and calculated with Radiance (Greg Ward)"}
