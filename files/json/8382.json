Depending on which version you have, it applies either a Reinhard TMO or a variant of the histogram adjustment operator in pcond, but there's no way to tell it to use a specific curve as you can with the pcond -I option Jack mentioned.  The latter technique with phisto is what I generally use if I want a sequence exposed the same.  And, you can go on using the same histogram for future frames so long as they don't change too much from the range of past frames.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131022/39f534fb/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Tone mapping for animati", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 09:11:45 -0700"}
