{"body": "\nDear Sung,\n\nIt seems I misread your diagram the first time, so misinterpreted\nyour problem.  I'm thinking now that the issue may be the cosine\ncorrection of your sensors rather than what is going on in Radiance.\nMost lux sensors have a crude calibration with respect to incident\nangle.  I recommend checking your sensors against one that is more\nreliable, or at least verifying that they have the proper cosine\nresponse by measuring a point source at varying incident angles.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<3acd9e4a0904020042t16c2035bk3a223a8b6567adb3@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<382F0401-1EAD-4D2F-BD31-FC2CF19FFF42@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<3acd9e4a0904020042t16c2035bk3a223a8b6567adb3@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Apr  2 08:59:19 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Comparison of values measured by sensorsand calculated with Radiance (Greg Ward)"}
