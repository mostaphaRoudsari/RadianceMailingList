It allows Radiance to use the\nBSDF data in lieu of sampling the geometry during the direct sun simulation.\n\n\nThe BSDF is not always produced by genBSDF, it can come from WINDOW or from\nmeasurement as well. But regardless, the intention is that optical data in\na BSDF file is not specific to a size of window, and so you could use it in\nvarious sized windows.  For example if lightlouver produces a BSDF for\ntheir product using genBSDF for one project you might want to use it in a\n2m window for one project but a 3m window for another. Addtionally there\nmay be times when you want to use a different thinckness for the\nsimulation.  I can think of probably half a dozen reasons why you might not\nwant to use dimensions baked into a BSDF file, an as is typical with\nRadiance we lean towards generalization.\n\n\nYes, but it isn't worth it unless you have a good Radiance material model\nfor the lasercut panel.  Otherwise you're better off using the BSDF\n(assuming it was measured).\n\n\nThe BSDF, even high resolution tensortree BSDFs, are spatially averaged.  A\nvenetian blind that is angled to admit stripes of light modeled with only a\nBSDF will result in a rectangular patch of intermediate brightness.  Using\nproxy geometry results in bright sun alternating with dark shadows.\n\nThe WINDOW XML file standard says inside is +Z outside is -Z, up is +Y.\nIn Radiance we use up as +Z and inside and outside, well it depends on the\nspace your modeling.\n\n\n\nThere should be three values per skypatch (R G and B) I don't know why you\nare getting twice as many.  Can you send the full command you are using?\n\nAndy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131101/53b4c5ac/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 5Phase & proxy geometr", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 11:23:34 -0700"}
