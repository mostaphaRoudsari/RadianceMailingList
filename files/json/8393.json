{"body": "\nHello Thomas,\n\nMust say, I love your exporter.\n\nI have my (undergraduate Architecture and Interior Architecture)\nstudents using it for a project this week.\n\nSystems: Microsoft XP/Pro | Linux Kubuntu 8.10 via vmplayer\n\nI have noticed the following issues:\n1) Path name: will not export if there are spaces in the path name.\n2) Parallel views are exported as vtv (perspective) rather than (vtl)\nand the view height seems to be very high compared to the camera height\nwhen the view was set.\n\nFor the future...\nWould be useful to document how to add new sky programs...\n\nWe use the genrad program (Simon Crone\nhttp://espace.library.curtin.edu.au/R?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=1313\n3&local_base=gen01-era02 pages 49-54)\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/\n004202.html which adds the a new option for skies. According to the\nauthor genrad supplies the direct and diffuse radiation to the standard\ngensky/gendaylit programs to produce better accuracy than the CIE skies.\nParameters include altitude and turbity.\ngenrad -a xxx -o xxx -m xxx -O 0\n\nexamples\n!gensky 6 21 14:0 -c -a -31.9330 -o -115.8330 -m -120.0 | xform -rz\n-180.00\n!genrad 6 21 14:0 -c -a -31.9330 -o -115.8330 -m -120.0 -O 0 | xform\n-rz -180.00\n\n\nYour efforts are very much appreciated.\n\nRegards\n\nTerrance Mc Minn\nSchool of Built Environment\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nPhone: 08 9266 7175\nFax: 08 9266 2711\nE-mail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J (WA) 02637B (NSW)\n\nThis email, including any attached files, may contain confidential\ninformation for the sole use of the intended recipient(s).
