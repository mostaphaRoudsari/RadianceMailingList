You can separate your polygons by name with:\n\nvwrays [resolution & view options] | rtrace -h -osv scene.oct | sort > surfaces.txt\n\nYou should get a selection of radiance values for each surface based on the selected view.  If you want orthonormal values for _every_ polygon, not just those visible from one perspective, more sophisticated methods are needed.  You would have to read in the scene file and generate a custom view for each polygon.  It can be done, but it might require some scripting/programming to accomplish it.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  If you want irradiance/illuminance values rather than radiance/luminance, use the rtrace -i option.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131112/ed56b890/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<3C120D8376A40D4D8EFDC0ABA036E813091CF9FD@UOS-DUN-MBX3.st-andrews.ac.uk>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 09:54:49 -0800"}
