This\neffectively gives you an outer integral over the area and an inner\nintegral over the directions per surface element. The latter is weighted\nby the cosine of the angle to the surface normal and the differential\nsolid angle. Lacking ascii art skills I'll refrain from cramming the\nformula in here.\n\nIn the very simplistic situation where the emission is invariant with\nrespect to direction and position on the luminaire (i.e. diffuse), this\nintegral simply becomes:\n\nPower = L * pi * A,\n\nThe RGB radiance values in the example above are derived from these\nrules (lampcolor assumes a diffuse emitted), and they also include a\ndepreciation factor for the luminaire.\n\n\nMe too! :^)\n\n\n--\n\"Life is too boring for short videos\" (TechVision)\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Roland Schregle", "datetime": "Thu, 20 Dec 2001 19:50:55 +0100"}
