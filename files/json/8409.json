So I hope this is not entirely off-topic.\n\nI have been using mgfilt from time to time as a convenient tool for\ngetting color coordinates from measured reflection spectra. However some\nresults appeared a bit strange, and thus I did a comparision with what I\nget from mgfilt and the results of using the CIE formulae with rcalc\ninstead. To make it short, the results I got from mgfilt were quite off,\nand I am wondering wether I did something wrong or the accuracy\nimplemented in mgfilt is really that much worse.\n\nI uploaded a short report on the comparison here:\n\nhttp://static.larsgrobe.de/spec2Yxy-20131115.pdf\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
