First, you might want to read through Peter Apian-Bennewitz's recent review of the various Radiance types, which he has posted at:\n\nhttp://www.pab.eu/docs/Review_of_simulating_four_classes_of_window_materials_for_daylighting_with_non-standard_BSDF_using_simulation_program_Radiance.pdf\n\nPeter does an excellent job of explaining the different types, what they do, and when they are useful -- something that has been missing from the documentation and literature for decades, now.\n\nWhat I think you will learn as it applies to your case is that without an interreflection calculation, the transdata and transfunc types will not give you a solar patch on the interior of your test space no matter what your material parameters.  The BSTDfunc type would, however.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131125/9b3ef156/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Translucent material modeling with Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 25 Nov 2013 09:25:08 -0800"}
