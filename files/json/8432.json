Try the \"glaze\" script if you have a multi-pane system you wish to model.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131204/d75b681c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] question transmission an reflection glass", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 4 Dec 2013 12:29:10 -0800"}
