{"body": "\nThanks Greg,\n\nOur intention is to simulate light extinction inside a tree (yes yes...a\ntree) or a group of trees with the purpose of studying light penetration\naccording to different morphologies. The mist approach looked to me much\nsimpler than modeling the whole tree (or a lot of trees), considering than\neven in this case the model will be just an approximation.\n\nAnyway I will try constructing a dome from polygons\nbrightfunc-light-sources, as Giulio suggested.\n\nGuedi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Monday, April 19, 2004 1:30 AM\nTo: Guedi Capeluto; Radiance general discussion\nCc: pillo.pillo@tin.it\nHi Guedi,\n\nWell, then you can try Pillo's suggestion of simulating the sky as many\nsmall sources, but I don't hold out much hope that you'll get an\naccurate answer.  What local phenomenon are you trying to simulate,\nexactly?  A puff of smoke?\n\n-Greg\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Using MIST for  overcast sky", "sender": "gward@lmi.net", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20040419065134.DC45836FC@techunix.technion.ac.il>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Apr 19 08:51:40 2004", "email": "Greg Ward", "subject": "Re: Using MIST for overcast sky"}
