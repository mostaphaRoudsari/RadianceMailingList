I've already fixed this in\nthe package. So if you want ot compile radzilla on non-Linux OS es,\nissue a rm *.o in the /util directory first\n\nI've heard rumours mention that then the stuff also compiles and runs on\nMacOSX..\n\n- a bug in the rzvu view input diaologue has been fixed, too\n\nTo bother the list no longer, I've set up an update page in the download\nsection of the radzilla site, which serves to collect the most recent\ninfo and bugfixes/updates\n\nThanx to Jeffey McGrew and Giulio Antonutto for the the first feedback,\ncompile tests and bugreports !!\n\n-so long\nCarsten\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "cbauer-@t-online.de", "datetime": "Thu Jul 22 17:46:42 2004"}
