{"body": "\nDear list,\n3 questions -\nI am modelling solar shading of glass panes. I have modelled them as a\ncombination of trans and mirror material type. The mirror material is\napplied in order to take into acount the specular reflections in the pane in\ndirect sun. However now I have come in doubt, whether this approach is good\nenough. The lamellas will be tiltet in different positions in front of the\nfacade and interreflections between the lamellas will occur. I want to\ninclude the effect of the interreflections in my model.\n\n1) Therefore question 1 is - does trans and mirror in some way take into\naccount the variation of reflectance and transmittance for different\nincident angles? I have tried to test my \"sample\" with a glow sky where I\nrotate the sample around the x axis. However when I am above a tilt of 45\ndegrees I get a reflectance of 0... ( My sample have the dimensions 3.5 x\n3.5 in x and y and my rtrace point is placed close to the x axis (0.2))\n\n2) To include the spectral dependency with different incidence angles I need\nto use the BRTDfunc instead - right?\n\n3) And as the lamellas are made of one glass pane I can use the\nwindow.cal-file for defining my material?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nAnne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090521/577df020/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<fdd7db810905210200j4e636747k185a3e25059ecbe0@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May 21 02:12:39 2009", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Material made of combined trans and mirror vs.BRTDfunc"}
