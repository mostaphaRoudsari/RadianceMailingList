For parallel views, it's not difficult to compute the world coordinates from picture position, but the other view types are more challenging.\n\nI should have also mentioned what people more typically do is generate two images, an \"irradiance\" image and a regular one, then use falsecolor to combine the two into a contour plot with legend.  This isn't quite what you asked for, but contains essentially the same information.  I.e.:\n\n$ rpict [rendering options] -vf myview.vf -x [xres] -y [yres] scene.oct > myrender.hdr\n$ rpict [rendering options] -vf myview.vf -x [xres] -y [yres] -i+ scene.oct > myirradiance.hdr\n$ falsecolor -i myirradiance.hdr -p myrender.hdr -cl -s auto -l Lux > mycontour.hdr\n\nGive it a try.\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131211/c77a24a8/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD7gt0UWp8YKxd4+DL_aNirF-i4EWWvrT39_9Nh=3f_=vOWC4Q@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 11:10:52 -0800"}
