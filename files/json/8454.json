Ill spend some time looking at the material format versus the\nradiance definitions. For now Terrance's suggestion will work. I created a\nmaterials.rad file with the definitions.\n\n\n\nI had some trouble with missing source auxiliary files, but have added them\nin. I must have made a mistake during the installation.\n\n\n\nSo I have inserted my sample Catia object with materials.rad description\ninto the red ball/light example.\n\n\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Monday, December 23, 2013 2:44 AM\nTo: Brian A Karr; Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHello Brian,\n\nA quick check of http://www.fileformat.info/format/material provides some\ninformation on the file format which could be used as a guide.\n\nUsing your {mtl} file:\nnewmtl appearance0\nKa 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125\nKd 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125\nKs 0.119 0.119 0.119\nNs 119.04\nd 1\nillum 2\n\nTo list all materials in the mtl file listing all line containing the newmtl\nstring:\ngrep newmtl {mtl}\n\nIn your case the first materials name is appearance0\nAccording to http://www.fileformat.info/format/material:\nThe Ka statement specifies the ambient reflectivity using RGB\nvalues.\n\n\"r g b\" are the values for the red, green, and blue components of the color.\nThe g and b arguments are optional. If only r is specified, then g, and b\nare assumed to be equal to r. The r g b values are normally in the range of\n0.0 to 1.0. Values outside this range increase or decrease the reflectivity\naccordingly.\n\nThe Kd statement specifies the diffuse reflectivity using RGB\nvalues.\nThe Ks statement specifies the specular reflectivity using RGB\nvalues.\n\nTherefore a simple material definition for your appearance0 might be:\nvoid plastic appearance0\n0\n0\n5 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125 .1 .1\n\nThe last two parameters (.1 and .1) are the specularity and roughness.\nSpecularity fractions greater than 0.1 and roughness values greater than 0.2\nare not very realistic.\n\n\n\nTerrance McMinn\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20131223/039b6fc4/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Conversion of obj files", "tags": [], "sender": "t.mcminn at iinet.net.au", "datetime": "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 21:37:53 -0500"}
