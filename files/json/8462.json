Exceptions to this are the countries marked on this map\nhttp://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/images/time_zones.jpg\nwith a star.\n\nCountries that have a TZ of GMT +/- X.5 hrs or -(X*15) + 7.5 deg include:\n- India\n- a bit of Australia\n- Iran\n(there are more...)\n\nFinally, there is Nepal which is at GMT +5:45 hrs or -5.75*15 = -86.25\ndeg in Radiance notation.\n\nIn other words: the 'round to integer' part of your equation is correct\nin most, but not all, cases.  You might end up with a floating point\nnumber if your project is located in exotic places.\n\nFYI: This integer bug existed in epw2wea which just recently made it\ninto Radiance HEAD. It was fixed just before Christmas.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Site Standard Meridian argument in genrsk", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Sun, 05 Jan 2014 16:18:32 +0000"}
