{"body": "\nHi Paul,\n\nAnother tip:\n\nIf you are planning to simulate several sky conditions and times, you should\nconsider separating the electric light and daylight into two simulations.\nOnce you have a single rendering of the electric lighting and multiple\nrenderings of the daylight scenarios you can add the electric light\nrendering to each daylight rendering using pcomb.  This saves the time of\nrendering electric lighting with every daylight condition.\n\nAlso, since you are less concerned about the accuracy of the electric\nlighting you might consider adjusting the -dt parameter.  If I remember\ncorrectly the most computationally expensive part is the shadow testing.\nIncreasing -dt reduces the number of shadow tests performed and should speed\nup the simulation significantly.\n\nandy\n\n\n\nOn 5/26/09 10:08 PM, \"Rob Guglielmetti\" <rpg@rumblestrip.org> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<453B05AD-DD6F-476F-877C-F465701C0224@rumblestrip.org>", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C642BAF2.AD0A%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed May 27 09:40:08 2009", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering large space with small detail (smallpicture now attached!)"}
