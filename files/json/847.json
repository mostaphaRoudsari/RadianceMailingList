Since a modifier generally affects\nthe material reflectance or transmittance, values in a pattern above\n1/reflectance (or 1/transmittance) are not physically valid.  However,\nthey may be useful when representing an object that includes luminous\nelements, such as a panel display, or one that contains diffuse and\nspecular materials, which you are not modeling separately.  In other\nwords, the surface may appear to \"create light\" either due to specular\nreflections, or due to actual emitting elements.  The stickler in me\nsays you need to model these as separate materials, but as a practical\nmatter, it is usually easier to \"cheat\" and do it with an HDR pattern.\nThe results won't be exactly right, but they'll be better than\ntruncating the highlights and pasting the pattern on a diffuse surface.\n\nAs for the lower end of the dynamic range, real objects don't get much\nbelow 1% reflectance, so you don't really need HDR to represent the\ndeep blacks.  The standard image range will do.  Of course, you must\nconvert this as you say to HDR format for Radiance, but doing so with\nra_tiff -r from a 24-bit RGB file should work fine.\n\nTrue HDR patterns are perfectly appropriate for modifying glow sources,\nsuch as the sky.  Jessi Stumpfel et al. have a paper on HDR capture of\nthe sun annd sky, which will be presented at the Afrigraph conference\nthis November.
