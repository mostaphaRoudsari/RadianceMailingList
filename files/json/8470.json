{"body": "\nHi Rob, Andy,\n\nThank you both for you suggestions. I've been concentrating on getting the\nglow material to properly work first.\n\nI've looked at the Radiance reference manual and read the description of\nglow. In my rad file I've made a new glow material:\n\n*void glow* glowsurface\n0\n0\n4 0.898 0.898 0.898 50\n\nand I've changed the name of the polygon that I want to glow from it's\noriginal surface name of 'plaster_insulated' to the name specified above\ni.e. 'glowsurface'. However in my image the surface appears to be black and\nI've tried changing the maxrad variable but this hasn't had an effect. I've\nread what it says about maxrad but I'm still unsure of what it is\nexactly and what the variable range is (is it a 0-1?) and what a typical\nvalue is.\nCould you please help?\n\nRegards,\n\nPaul.\nOn Wed, May 27, 2009 at 3:08 PM, Rob Guglielmetti <rpg@rumblestrip.org>wrote:\n\n\n\n\n--\nPaul Chilton\n\nRenewable Energy Engineer\n\n[m] 0400 306 791 | [e] p.chilton@gmail.com\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090528/a18a3d9d/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "<453B05AD-DD6F-476F-877C-F465701C0224@rumblestrip.org>", "sender": "Paul Chilton", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<63252a3e0905272041i775cf0aek3890e6f258f74c60@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<896A338E-3E8D-471B-A874-38D99E4E9C2A@dmu.ac.uk>", "<63252a3e0905190235t68890498y4587c14a30f72504@mail.gmail.com>", "<4A129189.7090801@gmx.net>", "<63252a3e0905191909u67cdf21dj6ec4db9981fcdb7a@mail.gmail.com>", "<E0623274-AE12-46E0-8B65-486D93BAA7A0@rumblestrip.org>", "<63252a3e0905261907n771521c8ued989f23ec20dac9@mail.gmail.com>", "<453B05AD-DD6F-476F-877C-F465701C0224@rumblestrip.org>"], "datetime": "Wed May 27 20:43:07 2009", "email": "p.chilton at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Rendering large space with small detail (smallpicture now attached!)"}
