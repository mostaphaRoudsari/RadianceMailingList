That is an optimized modifier modeling transmission and reflection for thin glass panes surrounded by air (which is a function of the direction a ray is passing through).\n\nBRTDfunc is meant to describe transmission and reflection using the mathematical description language of Radiance (see the cal-files coming in the library). It does not make sense to use it without any mathematical model.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n09.01.2014 tarihinde 18:10 saatinde, \"Sierd Tilma\" <tilma.sierd at gmail.com> ?unlar? yazd?:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140110/67af340d/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRTDfunc", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
