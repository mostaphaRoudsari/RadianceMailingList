In my\nproject is the reflection of this pane very important and I was thinking the\nBRTDfunc will help me whit this. So for  that I have found the glazing.cal\nfile in the library to calculate my glas but is ther also an explanation of\nthese calculations\n\ncheers, Sierd.\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n[mailto:radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org]\nVerzonden: vrijdag 10 januari 2014 21:00\nAan: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nOnderwerp: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 119, Issue 9\n\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than\n\"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

That is an optimized modifier modeling transmission and reflection\nfor thin glass panes surrounded by air (which is a function of the direction\na ray is passing through).\n\nBRTDfunc is meant to describe transmission and reflection using the\nmathematical description language of Radiance (see the cal-files coming in\nthe library). It does not make sense to use it without any mathematical\nmodel.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n09.01.2014 tarihinde 18:10 saatinde, \"Sierd Tilma\" <tilma.sierd at gmail.com>\n?unlar? yazd?:\n\n[I was thinking this is the reflection]\n[I was thinking this is the transmision]\n0\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL:\n<http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140\n110/67af340d/attachment-0001.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 119, Issue 9\n************************************************\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRTDfunc (Lars O.
