I am capable of producing renderings and performing glare analyses.  I have been asked to produce a falsecolor illuminance rendering.  I have the latest version of radiance installed and I see that there is a falsecolor program but I am not sure how to use it as it is not a recognized command.  I have been told I need perl to operate the falsecolor program.  What exactly is perl? Where do I download it and how do I install it?  Once installed, to execute the falsecolor function same as calling it out in the command prompt like rpict and ies2rad? I was given this task today and need to produce this by the end of tomorrow. Any help provided would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you,\nKyle\n\n\n\nKyle E.
