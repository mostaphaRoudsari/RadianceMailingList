{"body": "\nDear Radiance Community,\nI'm trying to compare measurements done in an artificial sky with\nradiance simulations. The problem I'm currently facing is how to model a\nlamp with a diameter of 70 centimeter that produces 20000 lux with an\naperture of 1.5? (nearly parallel light) in Radiance?\n\nWill be the only possibility to measure the existing lamp in a\nphotogoniometer and use the ies format data files? Or are there other\nand maybe easier ways to simulate such an artificial sun lamp in\nRadiance? Some quick and dirty way would be nice!\n\nKind regards,\nKai\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to simulate an artificial sun", "sender": "Kai Babetzki", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<LFFDE8775B2834c91A6274974180F44D5.1243614740.scalix.transgmbh.local@MHS>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 29 09:32:35 2009", "email": "babetzki at transsolar.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] How to simulate an artificial sun"}
