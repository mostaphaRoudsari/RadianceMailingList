Whatever you do,\nreflection and transmission should be a function of the incident\ndirection for clear glazings. One other approach may be the trans\nmaterial, which allows to define reflection and transmission at normal\nincidence. The angular dependance will follow a Fresnel-term if you stay\nwith only clear transmission and reflection, roughness=0. This may be\nwhat you want?\n\nPeter did a very nice comparision on the various models available in\nRadiance:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4214.pdf\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] BRTDfunc (Lars O.
