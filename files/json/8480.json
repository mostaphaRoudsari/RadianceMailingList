{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nfirst of all thank you for your answer.\n\nI'm aware that modelling infrared radiation as a visible color doesn't make sense in that way. I just wasn't able do figure out how to create a source with the corresponding energy. In my application there would be on esource - a blackbody - at several degrees above roomtemperatur. I want to know the amount of energy which arrives at a certain area within the scene also regarding the energy emerging from other object in \"sight\" of the detector area.\n\nI thought it might be possible to model the surfaces of these other objects as radiation sources as well, according to their temperature (which will be about 20?C) and emessivities/reflectances in the far infrared. When searching for a solution I appeared to me that radiance was the most promissing tool - but if you say it's not possible I fear I will have to search on.\n\nMaybe you know a better alternative?\n\nThanks,\nAlex\n_______________________________________________________________________\nNur bis 31.05.: WEB.DE FreeDSL Komplettanschluss mit DSL 6.000 Flatrate\nund Telefonanschluss f?r 17,95 Euro/mtl.! http://produkte.web.de/go/02/\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Alexander Utz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<538505078@web.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 29 10:36:58 2009", "email": "AlexanderUtz at web.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation"}
