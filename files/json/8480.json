This packaged was installed by the standard Add/Remove\nSoftware utility in Debian. Then I downloaded\n\"radiance-4.2.a-Linux.tar32.gz\" from the NREL's website and copied it's\n\"radiance\" folder at /usr/local/. Then I added the RAYPATH in the .bashrc\nfile as per the instructions given on the website. I tried to check the\ninstallation by running gensky command, and it works fine. But I have\nobserved some issues with \"rvu -o qt\" and \"objline\" :\n\n1. \"$ rvu -o qt myScene.oct\" gives me this error: rvu:\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.15' not found\n(required by rvu)\n\nAND\n\n2. \"$ objline myScene.rad | x11meta\" gives me this error: fatal - cannot\nopen file \"/usr/local/lib/meta/vchars.mta\", mode \"r\"\n\nIn the previous standard installation of Radiance, \"$ objline myScene.rad |\nx11meta\" use to work fine. Do you know what has happened now? and, have I\nre-installed radiance properly? Thank you!\n\nRegards,\nVaib\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140119/560756a5/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Vaib", "datetime": "Sun, 19 Jan 2014 22:16:38 +0100"}
