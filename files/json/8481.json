{"body": "\nHi Kai,\n\nIs the 20,000 lux measured at the source or at the receiving surface?\n\nYou are best off using the \"source\" type with a 1.5-degree solid\nangle, even though your source is not infinitely distant.  Do you\ncare very much about the fall-off at the edges of your model?  You\ncould create an aperture that passes the infinitely distant source --\nessentially a large opaque ring with a 70 cm hole in the appropriate\nplace.  Does the behavior of the light source have to precisely\nmatch, or is an approximation such as this good enough?\n\nDoes this make sense?\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to simulate an artificial sun", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<3B755747-C02D-460C-BB0D-4724E1293A12@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<LFFDE8775B2834c91A6274974180F44D5.1243614740.scalix.transgmbh.local@MHS>"], "datetime": "Fri May 29 10:40:45 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] How to simulate an artificial sun"}
