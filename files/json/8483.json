Do you care very\nmuch about the fall-off at the edges of your model?  You could create an\naperture that passes the infinitely distant source -- essentially a\nlarge opaque ring with a 70 cm hole in the appropriate place.  Does the\nbehavior of the light source have to precisely match, or is an\napproximation such as this good enough?\n\nDoes this make sense?\n-Greg\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: AW: Re: [Radiance-general] How to simulate an artificial sun", "sender": "Kai Babetzki", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<H000008c00292f91.1243628738.scalix.transgmbh.local@MHS>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 29 13:25:39 2009", "email": "babetzki at transsolar.com", "subject": "AW: Re: [Radiance-general] How to simulate an artificial sun"}
