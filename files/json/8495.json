{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nI'm currently trying to find a way to simulate the radiant power distribution for a given scene in the far infrared (about 8-14um wavelength). Using the search option I saw that there already was a discussion on this subject, but I can only find fragments of it - so please forgive me if I ask questions already answered ;).\n\nSo my question is: How can I model a blackbody source at about 300?K as radiation source?\n\nI tried using blackbody.cal and and xyz_rgb.cal as I saw in another posting:\n\necho 300 100 | rcalc -f blackbody.cal -f xyz_rgb.cal -e 'xi=cct_x($1);yi=cct_y($1)' -Yi=$2;Xi=Yi*yi/xi;Zi=Yi*(1-xi-yi)/yi' -e '$1=R ( Xi,Yi,Zi ) ; $2=G ( Xi,Yi,Zi ) ; $3=B ( Xi,Yi,Zi ) '\n\nand it results in\n\n18.3632205      143.92786       0\n\nSo I modeled the blackbody as polygon light source with this RGB values and it's real physical extent.\n\nFirst of all I must admit I don't understand the YL lightning parameter (100 in this case). Shouldn't this already be clear by giving the temperature of the blackbody?\n\nAnd are these values correct for the infrared radiation the blackbody emits at such low temperatures? Or do I still have to define the spectral range I'm interested in somehow?\n\nIt would be great if someone has already experience with thie and could give me some tips.\n\nThenks in advance and best regards\n\nAlex\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nNeu: WEB.DE FreeDSL Komplettanschluss mit DSL 6.000 Flatrate und\nTelefonanschluss f?r 17,95 Euro/mtl.!* http://produkte.web.de/go/02/\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Alexander Utz", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<535501632@web.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May 28 03:52:48 2009", "email": "AlexanderUtz at web.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation"}
