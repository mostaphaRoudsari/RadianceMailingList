Birgit has told me a lot about the work that she did with Denis Fan and John Mardaljevic.\n\nThe current project involves using a Raspberry Pi to capture bracketed shots and I would love to be able to code Radiance onto it. I saw a post on radiance-online (regarding Beagle Bone), and therefore wondered if a compatible version of the code was now available for a Raspberry Pi please? I have trawled the internet and not as yet found a suitable version.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards\n\nMarie\n____________________________________________\n\nDr. Marie Bassford MPhys PhD MInstP\nBSc/MPhys Physics Course Leader\nSenior Lecturer, Faculty of Technology\nMember of the Centre for Computational Intelligence\nSTEM Ambassador\n\nDe Montfort University\nT: +44 (0) 116 2577055\nE: mbassford at dmu.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140128/5f0d85f4/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: PastedGraphic-1.tiff\nType: image/tiff\nSize: 3516 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140128/5f0d85f4/attachment.tiff>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: PastedGraphic-2.tiff\nType: image/tiff\nSize: 3388 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140128/5f0d85f4/attachment-0001.tiff>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Marie Bassford", "datetime": "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 09:38:08 +0000"}
