It's just as well, though, since I'm not aware if anyone has ported Radiance to the Raspberry Pi.  If anyone on the mailing list has worked on this or has some helpful information, I hope they will respond.\n\nThere were some folks working on a RP port of hdrgen, which I think they got working.  Perhaps this would be useful to your project as well?\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140128/180d6f06/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance on Raspberry Pi", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 10:30:43 -0800"}
