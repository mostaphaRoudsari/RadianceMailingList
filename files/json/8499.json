{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nA falsecolor scale that colors zero as black is actually very useful.  I\noften use pcompos and image masks to achieve the same effect.  A second\nversion of falsecolor modified as you suggested is a major convenience for\nme.  Thanks!\n\nIf others agree that it is useful, maybe it can be incorporated in\nfalsecolor as an alternate color scale (similar to the -spec option)?\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn 5/27/09 8:37 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gward@lmi.net> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] DF for a polygon", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C642BDA6.AD0E%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed May 27 09:51:38 2009", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] DF for a polygon"}
