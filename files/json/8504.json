(Michael and Mehlika, i will likely\ncontact you directly!).\n\nBest,\n\n-Kyle\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n-----------------------------------------------\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140129/08e7919f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Kyle Konis", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 10:54:02 -0800"}
