Again, it ends up being easier to create the opening for a thick wall.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140129/46505b70/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Creating a void in a wa", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 11:54:17 -0800"}
