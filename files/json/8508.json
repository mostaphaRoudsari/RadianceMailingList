Last time I used it, I compared the measurement values with the results I achieved using Macbeth chart and macbethcal (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/macbethcal.1.html) and the results were very close.\n\nAs Greg mentioned, the photographs of the sample and Macbeth chart should be taken under stable and uniform lighting conditions.\n\nMehlika\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 29 Jan 2014, Kyle Konis wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAAzVHq0AMYoHV5oE9L4vV7ePkBH6tA7-UfBLVuD1Gfq4VoYDRA@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Mehlika Inanici", "datetime": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 14:41:46 -0800 (PST)"}
