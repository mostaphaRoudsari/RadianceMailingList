The distributions are thus given, not affected by a turbidity. The turbidity value would be used to \"scale\" the distributions if you rely on the model-based assumptions instead of using measured / otherwise expected illuminance or luminance, but not when you pass that value using the -B parameter. Thus, in your case, you get a sunny sky and the turbidity is simply ignored. If you skip the -B parameter, then the sky luminance will be scaled based on the models included in gensky, and these would make use of the turbidity parameter. You can check this by varying -t and removing -B 55.87.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] confused by turbidit", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
