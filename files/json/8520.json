My guess is that creating the octrees at the beginning of\neach iteration gives the OS plenty of time for the unlock to cascade. Is\nthat a reasonable possibility/assumption, or did I misunderstand the\nsecond solution?\n\nI will try these (and any other suggestions), and report if successful...\n\nThanks again!\nChris\n\nOn 1/31/14 3:43 PM, Gregory J.
