After installing Ubuntu\ndirectly onto the computer, rpiece was fast, and the file busy problems\ndisappeared.\n\nThanks to those who gave advice...I hope this message helps future\nrenderers.\n\n-Chris\n\nOn 2/1/14 12:03 PM, Chris Kallie wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140204/68495e12/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<52ED28D6.9080803@umn.edu>", "tags": [], "sender": "Chris Kallie", "datetime": "Tue, 04 Feb 2014 00:45:31 -0500"}
