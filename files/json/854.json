You bring up a good point.\nSince in this case the outside geometry is a downtown area, and the\nshading from all the buildings will have a great effect on the study,\nthe illums will have to be subdivided to a reasonable degree in order to\nproperly account for all the shadowing.\n\nActually your response brings up another question! :)\n\nIf one were to have a complex daylight entry system at the windows,\nwouldn't it make sense to run a mkillum calculation with illums outside\nfirst, and then a second mkillum calculation (with the first set of\nillum planes in the octree) of illum planes inside (beyond the daylight\nentry system)?  You could get carried away with this, but hopefully you\nget what I'm getting at.\n\nMark\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040802/e33ed7d0/attachment.html\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "datetime": "Mon Aug  2 16:43:18 2004"}
