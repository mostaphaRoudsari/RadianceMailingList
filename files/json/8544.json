{"body": "\nHi Christoph,\n\nWe've had pretty good success using the Sigma 4.5mm fisheye on a Nikon\nD40.   The images do need to be calibrated for which we use a Minolta\nCS-100a luminance meter.  We found the latter on E-Bay for a fraction\nof the price of a new one.  A colleague has a Nikon Coolpix P-1 point\nand shoot which seems to be spot on, needing no calibration  (perhaps\nbecause Greg has the same camera?:)).\n\nChris\nChristian Humann ~ Associate\nLOISOS + UBBELOHDE\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwww.coolshadow.com\n\n\n\nOn May 14, 2009, at 6:34 AM, Reinhart, Christoph wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090514/bbd1719f/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR images", "sender": "Chris Humann", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<204A1C4D-E76E-4480-872D-53B68465C655@coolshadow.com>", "refs": ["<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF03B487D3@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>"], "datetime": "Thu May 14 10:44:32 2009", "email": "chris at coolshadow.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR images"}
