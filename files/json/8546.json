{"body": "\nDear colleagues:\n\n\n\nI am planning to introduce HDR imagery in my daylighting class in the\nfall using Photosphere. My understanding is that I will need a CCD\ncamera, a wide-angle/fisheye lense and a luminance meter to calibrate\nthe camera. Could anybody recommend any specific products that I should\nbuy? Has anybody compiled Photosphere under Windows (sorry GregJ).\n\n\n\nThanks a lot,\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing.\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\nGund Hall 331b, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart@gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart@gsd.harvard.edu>\n\nDaylighting Design: Rules of Thumb\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDay\nlightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf> , Simulation\n<http://www.daysim.com/> , Executive Education\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01683>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090514/7688f8b1/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF03B487D3@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu May 14 06:34:56 2009", "email": "reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] HDR images"}
