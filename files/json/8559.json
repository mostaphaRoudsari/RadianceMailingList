I am among the many who brought up that idea here and than. The infrastructure is rather easy to set up. I did with a CMS (Drupal), a FAQ template to fill, some useful tools such as a TeX interpreter to enable writing math into the FAQ. It works well. Pitfalls are others:\n\n1) spammer - even with spam protection, a site without content review gets filled with spam easily - captchas do not entirely filter out this\n\n2) the volume of the knowledge around - compiling a list with only the top 20 Q&As is a lot of work if you want to be accurate (e.g. trans definition...), and than - chances to find a solution to my specific question are still higher using the search engine of the mailing list archive\n\n3) maintenance - the archives have recorded decades of discussions in a quite complete approach, who can commit to capture just, say, the next five years\n\nSo I think it would be useful, I did not even give up my futile attempt, but learned that given my limited time budget it will take me a year just to complete the top ten Q&As...\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposa", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
