I have personally found the answer to many\nof my questions by reading the emails from the archive but always suffered\nfrom the poor layout. The attachments are missing and in some cases it is\nreally hard to follow the conversations.\n\nI would be happy to devote some time to develop the code to parse the email\narchive and put them in a better format that is easier to follow. I\npersonally like the layout of Grasshopper discussion pages which is similar\nto many other pages on the web. Just a random example: (\nhttp://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/window-forms-param-data-binding)\n\nAny of the options provides an API that let us problematically generate\ndiscussion pages from the current emails?\n\nMostapha\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 5, 2014 at 8:20 PM, Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140205/c4fca982/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposa", "tags": [], "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "datetime": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 20:34:30 -0500"}
