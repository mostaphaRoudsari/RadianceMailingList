{"body": "\nHi Greg,\n\nfirst of all, there is a mistake in my previous mail. I wanted to say\n< and I cannot get its description from Optics5.>\n\nIt is the latter case:\noutside the laminate (glass pane + optical adhesive coating +... +\ninterlayer + ... + adhesive coating + glass) then the air gap and the\ninside that is a float glass.\n(It is a switchable glass in a double glazing)\n\nHow can I then describe this glasses?\n\n(I have the possibility to measure the double glazing or the different\nlayers separately)\nJust a naive idea that could helps:\n\nIf the combined R and T are the ones resulting from the hole double\nglazing which could be measured in the spectrometer if I measure the\ncomplete double glass and not the separated layers:\n\nTotal Reflectance front\nTotal Reflectance back\nTotal Transmitance\n\nCould be with this data a way to describe them?\n\n\nMarina\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n", "replyTo": "<564F6B2A-42F1-4F34-9D7E-93E72BFED5E9@lmi.net>", "sender": "marina aviles olmos", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4A007F18.20208@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<49F85AE5.5030606@gmail.com>\t<124b40400904290716v13f3b8ecw881138a58723fc27@mail.gmail.com>\t<124b40400904290756o3cb46efh272cf6e931d30690@mail.gmail.com>\t<49FF0881.2090306@gmail.com>\t<D82A56C3442F4C36948C60333A2AD760@lbl.gov>\t<4A0055C9.8070108@gmail.com>", "<564F6B2A-42F1-4F34-9D7E-93E72BFED5E9@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Tue May  5 11:02:02 2009", "email": "marina.aviles at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Description of complex glass systems (geometry+material)"}
