{"body": "\nDear colleagues,\n\n\n\nMy apologies for any cross posting.\n\n\n\nThis is a reminder/invitation that we will be hosting a three day\nExecutive Education Program on 'Daylighting Buildings' on June 29/30 and\nJuly 10 at Harvard University, Graduate School of Design\n(http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01683) . The workshop has been specifically designed for A&E and\nconsulting firms interested in adding advanced daylighting analysis\ntechniques to their portfolio. The first two days of the workshop will\nconsist of presentations and hands-on exercises. On the third day, which\nwill take place about a week later, we will reconvene either in person\nor electronically, and participants will be asked to present an example\nof how they applied the course content to a project of their choice. The\nclass and instructors will review the results and provide constructive\nfeedback. The main purpose of that third day is to 'force' participants\nto apply what they have learnt shortly after the workshop so that they\ndo not forget the course content and start feeling more confident about\ntheir simulation skills.\n\n\n\nAs software we will be using:\n\n-          CAD modeling: SketchUp, Ecotect and Rhino\n\n-          Analysis: Ecotect, Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare\n\n\n\nThe following topics will be covered. Additional topics can be added at\nparticipants' request:\n\n-          The role of daylighting and simulations in design\n\n-          Rules of thumb that work\n\n-          Balance point and direct shading studies\n\n-          Daylight factor calculation and analysis\n\n-          Model Q&A\n\n-          Climate-based daylighting metrics\n\n-          Modeling occupant behavior\n\n-          Predicting electric lighting energy use\n\n-          Advanced glare analysis\n\n-          Modeling light and health phenomena\n\n-          Presenting results\n\n-          Modeling advanced materials\n\n\n\nPlease contact Margaret Moore de Chicojay (corlette_mccoy@harvard.edu;\n617-496-8728) or myself should you have any questions regarding the\nprogram. You are strongly encouraged to register by June 15.\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing.\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\nGund Hall 331b, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart@gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart@gsd.harvard.edu>\n\nDaylighting Design: Rules of Thumb\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDay\nlightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf> , Simulation\n<http://www.daysim.com/> , Executive Education\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01683>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090603/58e02f6e/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Reinhart, Christoph", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF03DDF07D@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Jun  3 06:19:53 2009", "email": "reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylighting training @ Harvard"}
