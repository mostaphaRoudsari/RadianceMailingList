{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\nThanks for explaining your exact problem.  The documentation for\nRadiance is scattered and frequently application-specific.  Did you\nbrowse the \"Seminars and Course Notes\" section of:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/\n\nFrancesco Anselmo's Radiance wiki is also useful:\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php\n\nCheck out Axel Jacob's tutorials at:\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml\n\nAs for describing a mixture, you need to use the \"mixfunc\" type.\nCorrecting what you gave in your e-mail:\n\n\nDon't bother dividing the value up, just give it three times:\n\nvoid light bright\n0\n0\n3  146.305 146.305 146.305\n\n\n\nShould be:\n\nvoid plastic brown\n0\n0\n5  .2  .1  .1  0  0\n\nvoid glow bit_of_glow\n0\n0\n4 100 100 100 100\n\nvoid mixfunc brown_glow\n4 brown bit_of_glow 0.5 .\n0\n0\n\nbrown_glow sphere BB\n0\n0\n4  2  1  1.5  .125\n\n--------\nNote that I gave half of each, so their actual values will be reduced\nby 50%.  In some cases,  you may wish to double the parameters to\ncompensate.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<93B3B280-B4D9-4DA7-8F05-BA3F3FE3AA27@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<547513647@web.de>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun  4 10:30:02 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation"}
