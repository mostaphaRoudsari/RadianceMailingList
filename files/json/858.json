Resulting ambient values are\nsomething around 5, but I think it is too high for interior.\n\nSince I have to compare real and simulated values how can I know which -av\nvalue is good enough?\n\nThanks,\nMarija Cvetkovic\ncveleglg@bankerinter.net\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "marija cvetkovic", "datetime": "Sat Aug  7 14:46:51 2004"}
