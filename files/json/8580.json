{"body": "\nHi Giovanni.\n\nI'm not quite clear if you want to use the Radiance tools from the command line\nor if you expect that there is a 'use these values' button in EcoTect.\n\nIn the fist case you have to find the file that contains the sky description in\nthe scene that's exported by EcoTect. -B and -R are options to the gensky\ncommand that should be on one the lines in this file.\n\nFor a batch calculation of different values you have to loop over\n\n1) modify the gensky command\n2) recreate the scene octree\n3) do the calculation again\n4) move the images (or rtrace results) to a different place\n\nThis is possible with a bit of command line scripting.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 4, 2009 at 6:07 PM, Giovanni\nBetti<gbetti@fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3017F65A6@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0906050421l410ae7cehfe657c216e39496f@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3017F65A6@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>"], "datetime": "Fri Jun  5 04:21:37 2009", "email": "tbleicher at arcor.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] batch renders with explicit direct and diffuseirradiance"}
