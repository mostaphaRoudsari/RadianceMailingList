There is a little diddy it uses called\n\"gen_dc\" that automatically generates the skypatch and solar array DC\nfiles.  This calls out to an \"rtrace_dc\" program which I think was the\nprecursor to rcontrib.  It then has a couple programs that use those DC\nfiles to perform annual simulations.  One called \"ds_illum\" which uses the\nDC files and a weather file, creates perez sky models and assigns flux to\npatches and solardisc locations, and ultimately creates an annual\nilluminance file.  I would like to see this annual illuminance file format\nbecome a standard as well.  All the new dynamic daylight metrics we are\ndeveloping can be calculated from this one annual illuminance file and SPOT\ncreates an identically formatted annual illuminance file.\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\nOn Thu, Feb 6, 2014 at 2:11 PM, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n808 S.
