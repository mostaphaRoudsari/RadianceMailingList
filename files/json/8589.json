The dev list is primarily for development/debugging issues.\n\nThe getbbox command will give you a tight box (right rectangular prism) on the entire scene, whereas oconv will report an enclosing cube.  However, this won't help you much if your space is non-rectangular or not axis-aligned.\n\nA general tool for extracting the walls from a room is technically the 3-D convex hull problem.  There are programs out there to compute this, but I haven't played with them.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140207/1fa0f35d/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF619982360D839D44@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 09:47:47 -0800"}
