If\nyou need an ambient value for the interior, the procedure in the book\nshould be followed on an interior view.\n\nYou should also investigate the \"compamb\" script:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/compamb.1.html\n\nThis script relies on an operational rad input file, which it uses to\ngenerate the ambient values for several views, setting -av 0 0 0.  It\nthen averages the ambient values computed by rpict into a suitable -av\nsetting, which it appends to your rad input file.  This is the\n\"scientific\" way to set -av properly.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Question about -av parameter", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sat Aug  7 16:28:03 2004"}
