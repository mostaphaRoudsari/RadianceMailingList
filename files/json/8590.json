(I'm also trying to find the \"ray\" directory\nand the \"rad\" command, but that is secondary.)\n\nThank you,\n--\n\n*Jill Dalglish, PE, LEED AP BD+C*\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140207/92a149d0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jill Dalglish", "datetime": "Fri, 07 Feb 2014 15:42:41 -0700"}
