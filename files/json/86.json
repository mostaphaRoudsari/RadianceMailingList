{"body": "\nI would like to recover the surface normals of the surfaces visible in\nevery pixel of a Radiance scene.  In other words, I want to trace the\ninitial ray cast for each pixel, and find the surface normal of the first\nsurface that ray hits.  I figured out that I could do this using rtrace\n-on, if I feed rtrace the rays corresponding to each pixel in my\nimage.  Is there an easy way to compute all of these rays automatically\nusing an existing Radiance program, or will I need to write a special .cal\nfile for rcalc?  I have the feeling that some Radiance gurus could\naccomplish this task in one or two lines.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice,\n\nRon\n\nPhD student, MIT AI Lab\nhttp://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rondror/\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace", "sender": "Ron O.
