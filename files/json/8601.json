Rooms/scenes are mostly right\nrectangular prism; and also they are normally kept aligned with principal\naxes, only the sky (if with sun) is rotated to change the North. I guess,\nto rotate the sky instead of the scene must be preferred for modeling\narchitectural scenes in Radiance.\n\nFurther, just out of curiosity: getinfo -d foo.oct gives [Xmin, Ymin, Zmin,\nSize] of the bounding cube (I guess cuboid too?). I couldn't figure what\ndoes Size mean? Is it Xmax or Y/Zmax?\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\n\n\nOn 7 February 2014 18:47, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140212/c5d2f58f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4FE4F9C0-F21A-4AE8-A4E8-7B9AFF1BC397@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Vaib", "datetime": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 23:08:22 +0100"}
