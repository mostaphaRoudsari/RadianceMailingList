It?s done for the reasons you cite, as well as for efficiency in the octree. There are a few posts on this on the archives.\n\n- Googs\n\nReply-To: Radiance discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nTo: Radiance discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\nThank you Dr.Greg. It makes sense now.\n\nI am just curious to know your opinion on changing the site's North by rotating the Sky. Do you think it is a good practice? Because on rotating the building/room, one cannot take full advantage of other good programs such as getbbox and/or getinfo -d.\n\n\nOn 12 February 2014 23:18, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\nThe size returned by \"getinfo -d octree\" is the cube side length, which is of course the same in all three dimensions.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\ngetbbox will solve the issue at hand. Rooms/scenes are mostly right rectangular prism; and also they are normally kept aligned with principal axes, only the sky (if with sun) is rotated to change the North. I guess, to rotate the sky instead of the scene must be preferred for modeling architectural scenes in Radiance.\n\nFurther, just out of curiosity: getinfo -d foo.oct gives [Xmin, Ymin, Zmin, Size] of the bounding cube (I guess cuboid too?). I couldn't figure what does Size mean? Is it Xmax or Y/Zmax?\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\nOn 7 February 2014 18:47, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\nYes, let's keep this on the general mailing list.  The dev list is primarily for development/debugging issues.\n\nThe getbbox command will give you a tight box (right rectangular prism) on the entire scene, whereas oconv will report an enclosing cube.  However, this won't help you much if your space is non-rectangular or not axis-aligned.\n\nA general tool for extracting the walls from a room is technically the 3-D convex hull problem.  There are programs out there to compute this, but I haven't played with them.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD7gt0WrBMHvg8HRjqUjc--WuGPb0Q4r3tiT62fNLfAvdhfQGg@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "datetime": "February 12, 2014 2:08:22 PM PST"}
