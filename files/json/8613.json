{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nThere isn't really a \"vinfo\" command, is there?  What does it do?  I\nused the name because the editor it applies is in fact \"vi,\" so it\nseemed appropriate.  Feel free to modify the code to edit the header\nas you like.  The getinfo command can be used with \"ed\" to accomplish\nthis.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Adding view information to hdr files", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8556761F-A78E-4072-9B42-553E279551A7@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4A44967E.9040404@nus.edu.sg>\t<1246010595.7360.9.camel@tb-laptop.snowdonia.trampolinesystems.com>", "<20B625EF-CD89-4A9C-A151-A6D0953411D8@lmi.net>", "<4A48218B.8040801@gmx.net>"], "datetime": "Sun Jun 28 20:59:43 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Adding view information to hdr files"}
