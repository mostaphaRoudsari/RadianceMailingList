However interpolation does not increase resolution. Think of it as if you were taking a picture with a smartphone from the 90's - the overall average luminance may be correct, but you will never be able to add information on detail in between the pixels by interpolation. So if you want / need high resolution, run genBSDF accordingly.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Interpolate BSDFs", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
