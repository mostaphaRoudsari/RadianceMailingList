It will not hide the light source\ncompletely but the source itself is shown in black instead of the actual\nbrightness that the object (lamp, light fitting etc) would have. I think\nthat was done to avoid high intensity peaks that would confuse certain\nevaluation algorithms in other applications.\n\nIn your case you should be able to hide the light sources using a clipping\nplane. Check the -vo option of rpict.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Sun, Feb 16, 2014 at 5:19 PM, Vaib <vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140217/daa66e02/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAD7gt0UD_foJ1H0KwVvxkNRkawqZ1dWyokb_8YDgR1is42ztUA@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 09:15:55 -0500"}
