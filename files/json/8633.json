Know I need to calculate the vertical illuminance for similar point I have in the grid that just facing the window opening as I need these readings to calculate the glare index for room I am studying it.\n\nThe problem that I am no that expert in using radiance, so is there any simple tips can help me in solve this problem?\n\n\n\nI do appreciate your help in this matter\n\n\n\nMany thanks and best regards,\n\n\n\nHana\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140218/a5d2b337/attachment-0001.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nTo: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\n<CAD7gt0U0qXM8Mtg_t2ehe1YGg8q4kengN9cXGyDs9Onac4pSww at mail.gmail.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n\nHi Hana,\n\nIf I understood your question correctly, you need to calculate illuminance\non a vertical grid in Ecotect. I guess you have already calculated\nilluminance on a horizontal grid at 0.8m height above ground (working\nplane). If this is correct, then please see the image attached.\n\nI also started with Ecotect, but I am not sure it has its own user group.\nBut in this group too, there will be people who are experts in Ecotect.\nHope it helps.\n\nRegards,\nVaib\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140218/848d24f1/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: verticalGridEcotect.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 58013 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140218/848d24f1/attachment.png>\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 120, Issue 37\n*************************************************\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "datetime": "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 13:23:06 +0100"}
