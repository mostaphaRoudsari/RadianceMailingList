{"body": "\nThanks John,\n\nI understand what you are proposing and have read your thesis previously\nduring my studies.\n\nLocal weather information available contains data for an average or\ntypical year. The sky may not be sunny during the time when the building\nhas the highest level of solar exposure (Winter solstice). Since the CIE\nClear Sky represents an extreme sky condition I thought I could pretty\nmuch cover the worst case scenario, not actual measured irradiance data.\n\nSo, I am still unsure weather Radiance or Gensky will automatically\ncalculate the direct and diffuse illuminance given a clear sky, time\nlocation etc. and if it does will these numbers be realistic or\ntheoretical? I am not concerned about overdesigning to handle an extreme\nsky condition.\n\nSurely once light from the sun has penetrated the earths atmosphere it is\nat a constant level, varying in intensity by solar altitude (cosine law).\n\nThanks,\nBen\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040506/d04544f6/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "<T69684ffa47ac10071554c@cwmsw1.conwag.com>", "sender": "Ben Masters", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<OF9C8C4383.6CA26D39-ONCC256E8C.0081F6EF-CC256D1E.0080DC1C@conwag.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May  7 01:29:46 2004", "email": "mastersb at conwag.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Calculating maximum illuminance levels fromdaylight"}
