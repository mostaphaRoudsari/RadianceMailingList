{"body": "\nBen,\n\n\nYes, gensky can *estimate* absolute values from just location, time\nand user specified sky conditions, e.g. CIE clear.  But there is no\nknowing how good the estimate is until you make comparison with\nabsolute values from, say, a TRY.  My suggestion is: find the\nmaximum global horizontal irradiance (& associated diffuse horizontal)\nin the TRY, and use those to set your -R and -B gensky parameters.\nDoesn't matter too much when in the year it occurs, it's more a\ncase of getting an idea of what likely magnitudes are.\nMaybe increase the overall value by a little to account for very extreme\nconditions, but be careful not to exceed theoretical limits.\n\n-John\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<E1BM1Kr-0000Cj-00@saturn.dmu.ac.uk>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May  7 11:08:22 2004", "email": "jm at dmu.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Calculating maximum illuminance levels fromdaylight"}
