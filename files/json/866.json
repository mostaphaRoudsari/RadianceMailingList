{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am in the process of developing a new BRTDF / BSDF as a part of my PhD\nthat incorporates:\n\n1) Anisotropic\n2) Stratified multilayered media with Beer-Lambert transmission\ncalculations.\n3) Subsurface light scattering based on Stokes vector and Mueller\ncalculus.\n4) Diffraction based on Fourier optics.\n5) Monte Carlo methods\n\nTo simulate materials such as iridescent (pearlescent) paint, CD / DVD,\nmother-of-pearl, pearls, opals and various other complex multilayered\nsurfaces. I've converted the various algorithms into a series of  simple\nC functions and would like to use Radiance to simulate these material\nproperties. However, after a quick examination of the dielectric.c file\nthe implementation is not going to be as easy as I'd expected especially\nincorporating Monte Carlo sampling methods.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions on how I go about\nincorporating the algorithms into Radiance, and especially how I go\nabout incorporating Monte Carlo sampling into the BRTDF / BSDF within\nRadiance?\n\nThanks\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040507/3f484606/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "David", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<00d501c43448$e754f1d0$a4015882@kitkat>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May  7 17:27:48 2004", "email": "david.k.brayford at stud.man.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Adding a new BRTDF /  BSDF"}
