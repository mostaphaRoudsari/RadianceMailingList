The .pl files that come with\nthe radiance installer (from NREL) don't seem to work for windows. It\nappears that you converted them to .exe files, but when I follow the link to\nyour webpage they are not found. Is there a way you could share the .exe\nversion of genBSDF (and the others)?\n\nThank you,\nJustin\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Justin Shultz", "datetime": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 18:16:18 +0000 (UTC)"}
