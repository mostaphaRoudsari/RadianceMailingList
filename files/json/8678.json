The idea was to make Windows Radiance\neasier to install, without having to worry about a Perl interpreter as well.\n\nThe exe files were on my server for a while, but not realising that\nother Windows Radiance users might be interested in them too, I removed\nthem after my class was finished.\n\nSince I've been receiving a few emails enquiring about those exe files,\nI set up a web page where they can be downloaded:\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml\n\nHope this makes setting up Windows Radiance a little easier for some of you.\n\nIf you want to help with porting some of the old Radiance C shell\nscripts to Perl to make them work under Windows, please give me a shout.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Sun, 09 Mar 2014 16:37:24 +0000"}
