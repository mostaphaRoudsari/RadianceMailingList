These will change the x and y mappings of your view.\nAre they the same values in your view.vf file? If so, they are redundant and could be misleading in the future. If not, this is why your rpict and rtrace images do not align (vwrays is generating a different set of rays).\n\nSorry, but I don't have a quick answer/suggestion for your other questions.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nChris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wednesday, March 19, 2014 7:55 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear Radiance People.\n\nI'm rendering scenes with both rpict and rtrace and I noticed some discrepancies between them. Despite both using the same view point definitions my images differ between the two renders: (the scene shows a green rectangular panel, a green elipsoid, some sky, green ground).\n\n1) the rpict image (top in the attached file) seems to normalize the sky values so that they aren't too bright.\n2) the rtrace image has a subtly different viewpoint.\n\nThree questions:\n\n1) Can you tell me which command arguments determine the way that image values are clipped or remapped?\n2) Can I specify the same clipping in rtrace?\n3) Why are the views different despite using the same viewpoint?\n\n\nHere are the commands I'm running, in the sequence that they are executed.\n\nrpict -vf view.vf  -x 2400 -y 2400 -vh 28.07 -vv 28.07 -ps 2 -pt 0.03\n-pj 0.95 -dj 0.85 -ds 0.09 -dt 0.03 -dc 0.75 -dr 5 -dp 0 -sj 0.85 -ab 5\n-ar 64 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -lr 12 -lw 0.001 wholeScene.rpict\n\npfilt -x /1 -y /1 -rad 0.60 wholeScene.rpict > wholeScene.pic\n\nvwrays -vf view.vf -x 2400 -y 2400 >surfaces.txt\n\nrtrace -h -osv wholeScene.oct < surfaces.txt > rtrace_surfaces.txt\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGeorge\n\n\n--\nDr P.
