You would still need some CAD\nsoftware to build your geometry model, but there are low cost\nsolutions to that as well. You can then calculate the required\naverage values and other ratios with a spreadsheat from the\nnumerical output. Contact me directly if you're interested.\n\nOther than that, really answering your questions would require\na repetition of almost all of \"the book\" (or one of the manuals\nfor Radiance). There are no simple recipes for this kind of tasks\nif you only have the bare Radiance engine at your hands. Radiance\nis an open toolkit, whch requires you to supply some of the logic\nby yourself, unless you are using a more abstract toolkit.\n\nYour question is a bit of the \"tell me everything\" type.\nYou will have to study the documentation in any case, even if\nyou use one of the user interfaces available. And I really\nrecommend to get a copy of the book, just for the understanding\nof what you're dealing with.\n\nMaybe this is not the answer you hoped for...\n\n\nRegards\n\n-schorsch\n\n--\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] example of a street", "sender": "Georg Mischler", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<Pine.BSF.4.30.0110021823010.64164-100000@emancholl.pair.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 2 Oct 2001 18:44:18 -0400 (EDT)", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] example of a street"}
