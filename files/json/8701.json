If your Perl environment was running on Windows Vista or later, the binaries won't run on Windows XP or earlier due to missing dependencies. I had to rebuild mine using a Windows XP VM to get around this.\n\nAlso I found a bug in falsecolor.pl recently which I've not gotten around to forwarding the fix to Greg/radiance-dev as yet for.\n\nPalbinder Sandher\nSoftware Platform Engineer\nT: +44 (0) 141 945 8500\nF: +44 (0) 141 945 8501\nhttp://www.iesve.com\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
