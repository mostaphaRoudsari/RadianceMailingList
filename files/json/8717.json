{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nSince Radiance uses an azimuth/altitude breakup of the hemisphere,\nodd things can happen at the zenith in the indirect calculation,\nwhich is why it's generally good to have a \"direct\" calculation as\nwell.  You can eliminate this problem by changing your window to an\nillum via mkillum or even applying the sky distribution function to\nthe window directly as demonstrated on page 32 of the introductory\nchapter of RwR:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/ch1/ch1.pdf\n\nYou might also try setting -aa 0, which would avoid indirect\ninterpolation and perhaps help matters by itself (though it will take\nlonger).\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Shadow above highlight?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<90E16BB0-F46B-4648-96D7-92F19ABA500C@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<200907272241.n6RMfetM031093@smtp7.server.rpi.edu>"], "datetime": "Mon Jul 27 17:28:35 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Shadow above highlight?"}
