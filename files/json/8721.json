{"body": "\nHi Sotiris,\n\nThis is not really your fault, as there is a limit of 2048 input\ncolumns to the \"total\" command I neglected to consider in the\noriginal post.  I did not try this command in advance, and made\nsubsequent modifications to rtcontrib that make the calls to \"total\"\nsuperfluous.  If you look at my Nov 17, 2007 post on the same thread,\nyou'll see a different version of the rtcontrib command that uses the\nnew -c option in lieu of calling \"total.\"  Use this method instead.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] water any news ???", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<A07FC5F8-1204-4AD8-B362-954CA2DC8BE1@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<92f99fb40907250332q627e7b40l4712f6ce481f20bd@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Jul 25 16:03:03 2009", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] water any news ???"}
