{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nI did not want to propose an animation. I was just wondering whether you\nknow the shape of the surface. I do not know how even how to describe\nthe wave patterns, it is about frequencies, amplitudes, interference and\nall that over the surface of limited dimensions, which means including\nedges reflecting back. So the geometrical description seams to be not\ntrivial, and I have no clue whether there are any standard models to use\nwhen simulating certain \"wavyness\" conditions of a pool.\n\nI think that this geometry topic is much more difficult then the\nrendering stuff once the model is generated.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090723/052fe046/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "<4a684d00.0508d00a.0738.ffffc785@mx.google.com>", "sender": "Lars O.
