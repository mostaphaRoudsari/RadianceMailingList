To learn how to protect yourself, please go here:\nhttps://commons.lbl.gov/x/_591B\n--------\n\nHi Ehsan,\nGerman already gave the answers, I just want to add some.\nFor a description of the Perez sky model, see page 175 of John's thesis:\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=resources:mardaljevic_chap5.pdf\n\nThe ten arguments are explained in perezlum.cal:\n\nA1 - diffus normalization\n9 \tA2 - ground brightness\n10 \tA3,A4,A5,A6,A7 - coefficients for the Perez model\n11 \tA8,A9,A10 - sun direction\n\n\nThe sky generators in Radiance output modifiers, just as German\nmentioned. This modifiers \"scale\" the brightness of whatever you apply\nthem to.\n\nIn most cases, you will scale a glow applied to a hemisphere (modeled as\na distant source) of brightness 1, as the generator will give you\nbrightness in absolute values by default. In this case, the result of\nthe generator would directly match the sky brightness in your scene.\n\nHowever, if you want color, you would first define the brightness of a\nglow material in a way that your normalize the desired color to 1, and\nthan apply the modifier to this colored glow material. The modified glow\nmaterial would keep the color you wanted, but scale this according to\nthe sky model.\n\nIn other cases, if you have no geometry outside the space you are\ninterested in, you can even apply the modifier to a glow of uniform\nbrightness of one applied to the window-plane.\n\nSo there are many ways you can make use of the distribution, and\nincluding any kind of geometry into the output of the sky generator\nwould just limit its applications.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140408/055972ff/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling sky using sky scanner MS-321L", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
