You can use genklemsamp, but have to flip the sign on the z\ncomponent of the vector.\n\nUsing Schedules in EnergyPlus:\n\nThe ability to schedule internal surface heat gains has been incorporated\ninto the trunk of EnergyPlus starting with version 8.1. The relevant\nobjects are:\n\nSurfaceProperty:SolarIncidentInside\nComplexFenestrationProperty:SolarAbsorbedLayers\n\nThe built in BSDF module gives identical results as using Radiance to\ndetermine solar absorption in the CFS layers.  However using Radiance\noffers some improvement in the interior distribution of energy (though it\nmight not be worth using Radiance for this now that EnergyPlus has built in\nBSDF capabilities).\n\nThat is the extent of my knowledge of EnergyPlus. I don't want to be\nmistaken for someone who knows things about EnergyPlus.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 8, 2014 at 1:47 PM, Lars O.
