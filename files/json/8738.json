Package updates are LONG overdue, I know, but the current HEAD has all the changes to CMake to build and install bsdf2rad. I suppose another thing that's long overdue is a HOWTO on how to use the CMake build files in the Radiance cvs. :-/\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 4/8/14, 3:54 PM, \"Chris Coulter\" <Chris.Coulter at BuroHappold.com<mailto:Chris.Coulter at BuroHappold.com>> wrote:\n\nIs there any trick to compiling/using bsdf2rad? I?ve compiled from the HEAD as recent as 3/18 and it did not get compiled and/or copied over.\nI see that bsdf2rad is listed in the Rmakefile under ray/src/cv, but not included in the ?PROGS? listing (the files above are). Does this need to get edited to properly install bsdf2rad?\n\n\nWhat is the usage of bsdf2rad? I don?t see any man page online and didn?t find one with the typical documentation in the build.\n\n\nAny help/suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nChris\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\nTel: 212.334.2025\nDirect: 212.616.0254\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com<mailto:chris.coulter at burohappold.com>\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n\n\nThis transmission is confidential and intended solely for the person or organization to whom it is correctly addressed.
