{"body": "\nHi Lars,\n\nIf you mirror a marker triangle in cad (for example autocad), then the\nnormal ends up pointing the opposite direction. Thus in radiance if you\nuse a set of markers that include mirrored and unmirrored triangles then\nsome of your instance objects will actually point down. One way to\nresolve this is to use two sets of markers (as previously pointed out in\nanother email). If you create a mirrored instance of the object, then\nyou are actually reusing the object geometry and conserving memory. The\nway to do this is create an compiled octree version of the object and\nthen create an instance that mirrors it appropriately around x y or z as\nfollows:\n\nvoid instance foo.mirror\n6 foo.oct -m<x,y, or z> -t xt yt zt\n0\n0\n\nSince you are simply resuing foo.oct then you conserve the memory. I\nmust admit that I have to play around with -m<x,y,z> to figure out how\nthe object mirrors correctly and you may need to transform the object to\nget the position to work out with respect to your marker.\n\n-Jack\n\nLars O.
