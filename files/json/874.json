First off, I regret not being able to\nattend this year's workshop, it looks like I missed a good one.\nSecond, big thanks to Peter A-B for putting the iso image of the\nWorkshop CD online so quickly.  I enjoyed perusing the extracts, and it\nwas nice to see so many familiar names, presenting exciting new work.\n\nNext year, let's have it at my house.  Airplane rides! Hamburgers! Beer!\n(and research, of course.)\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Wed Oct 13 18:34:45 2004"}
