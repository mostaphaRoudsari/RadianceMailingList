The first will be unshaded and\nrecord global horizontal irradiance.\n\nThe second will have a shadow band applied and will serve to record diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance.\n\nI will then subtract the diffuse-horizontal contribution from the global\nhorizontal value to obtain an estimate of direct-horizontal irradiance.\n\nI wanted to confirm that this is an appropriate approach, as well as to see\nif anyone has an alternative (better) idea, that does not involve a\npyrheliometer.\n\nBest,\n\n-Kyle\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n-----------------------------------------------\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140409/04d1dfe8/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Kyle Konis", "datetime": "Wed, 9 Apr 2014 17:08:21 -0700"}
