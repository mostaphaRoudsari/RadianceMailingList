First of all, I have to calculate the ratio of (disk area of the\npatch divided by real area of each patch), then multiply it by radiance of\neach patch. is it right?\nSecond, in this case, I will have some dark points between the disks which\nlook like diamonds. Unfortunately, by now I didn't find the time to\nimplement a code to create these disks.\nThank you for the consideration and support.\n\nBest Regards,\nEhsan\n\nOn Sat, Apr 12, 2014 at 1:41 PM, John Mardaljevic <J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140414/7edcea5c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling sky using sky scanner MS-321L", "tags": [], "sender": "Ehsan M.Vazifeh", "datetime": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 14:23:32 +0200"}
