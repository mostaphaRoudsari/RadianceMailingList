Your sky will of course not be continuous, but at least the total luminous output will be realistic.  See table 3-7, p70 in Chapter 3 here:\n\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=resources:thesis\n\nAnother way is to use the measured data to create a 'brightdata' representation of the sky, which will be continuous.  How that is done is also described in Chapter 3.\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "John Mardaljevic", "datetime": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 13:13:00 +0000"}
