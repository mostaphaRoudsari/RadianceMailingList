You are right, -i (lowercase) is used for picking out illuminance at scene points, and so works as Raphael has described. -I (uppercase) is what I normally use for computing illuminance at a point. I simply use -I with -ov which gives me illuminance at that point. I have not used those other output fields and I'm still a little confused as to how this \"1 meter offset\" happens with -oodv.\n\nHere's a thread-concluding post from a couple years ago that I have consulted in the past:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004213..html\n\n- Rob\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090716/c5340cfc/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: R: RE : [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd", "sender": "giulio antonutto", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<596415.68111.qm@web23107.mail.ird.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jul 16 12:10:30 2009", "email": "antonutto at yahoo.it", "subject": "R: RE : [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd"}
