{"body": "\nI believe the -I option to rtrace automatically takes the trace point\none unit in front of the point to avoid conflict with a surface (in case\nyour point is defined co-planar with a wall, floor, etc.). This would\nprobably be fine if you model was set up in inches or mm. Maybe you can\nscale your model to millimeters using xform -s?\n\nA question to the list, would the -i (lowercase) be appropriate to get\nthe value for the exact point as defined?\n\n-Chris\n\n________________________________\n\nthe command used is:\nrtrace -ab 7 -ad 2048 -oodv -I\nrcp.oct<numeric/plan_de_travail.fld>numeric/090715_BU_Rennes_07_vitrage_\nirradiance.irr\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090716/0a35b511/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd", "sender": "Christopher Rush", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE705A56A5B@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<7792B71B342F49C38BDBA8683FA0BDD7@micr817p>"], "datetime": "Thu Jul 16 09:26:33 2009", "email": "Christopher.Rush at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd"}
