To make dctimestep work for multiplying matrices together, I altered it to output a header if and only if there was more than one column being produced.  This is pretty non-standard behavior for a Radiance tool, and wasn't documented by Andy because he wrote the scripts before the change.\n\nThe -h option of rcollate means don't expect a header on input AND don't produce one on output.  To get what you want, you need to take away the -h option to rcollate and/or insert \"getinfo -\" somewhere to strip the header.  This should work for your last command:\n\ndctimestep -n 8760 -if matrices/directsun.dsmx matrices/OakLand_direct_m6.smx | \\\nrcollate -oc 1 | getinfo - > i_ds5ph.txt\n\nOr this:\n\ndctimestep -n 8760 -if matrices/directsun.dsmx matrices/OakLand_direct_m6.smx | \\\n| getinfo - | rcollate -h -oc 1 > i_ds5ph.txt\n\nIf you are OK with having a header in the output, use the first command above without the getinfo call.  Does this make sense?\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140415/2c22307a/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcollate troubles in Five-Phase CFS tutoria", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 22:15:15 -0700"}
