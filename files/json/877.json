{"body": "\n\nRadiance User: \"Boy, that objview script sure is handy for looking at\nscene geometry; if only there was something like that for looking at the\ndistribution of my light source files.\"\n\nAnnouncer: \"Well, THE WAIT IS OVER!!  That's right, now there's a script\nthat has the ease of use of objview, but is scientifically engineered\nfor use with Radiance light source input files!  Plus, if you call now,\nwe'll include K-Tel's \"70's platinum hits\" -- on eight-track --\nabsolutely free!  Don't delay, limited offer, operators are standing by,\nyadda-yadda-yadda.\"\n\nAhem, sorry.  In all seriousness, I took Greg's objview script and\nmodified it to take a single scene input file and place it at 0,0,0,\nthen surround it on five sides (top, bottom, E, N, W) with opaque\nsurfaces.  It sets -ab 1 and -ds .15 and then loads rvu with a view\nlooking into the box.  The box is 48 units square by default; you can\nchange the size of the box with the -bs switch (and no, there isn't a\n-bs- option for my posts, sorry).  All the other options in objview are\navailable in ltview.\n\nltview is useful for making sure the distribution is what you think it\nis, and that nothing went awry during the ies2rad conversion (also good\nfor checking replmarks triangle orientations, Lars).  Anyone who wants a\ncopy just ask and I'll email it to ya.\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<409FFBA4.1010609@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue May 11 00:01:05 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ltview, a light source viewer"}
