{"body": "\n2009/8/3 ??????? ??????????? <sotos.enveng@gmail.com>:\n\nReading through the man pages for rtcontrib and rtrace I would think\nthat \"-w\" and \"-ffc\" are both rtrace options. You can remove them\nto see if the command runs through then. The output would not be\nuseable, but it might help to find the problem. In particular \"-w\" turns\noff warnings from rtrace.\n\nI could not find the \"-c\" option in the (online) man pages. Perhaps\nthat's a source for an error there, too.\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] water any news ???", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0908030843rf0cc133qcb191ad8254efc30@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<92f99fb40908030727r194e5929xc0ae4c6138d38255@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Aug  3 08:43:55 2009", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] water any news ???"}
