{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nI think it would be great to have that in Debian, so I've started a packaging\neffort at svn.debian.org/svn/python-apps/packages/raddisplay/trunk (access via\nsvn:// or - if you have an account on alioth.debian.org - via ssh+svn://....).\nUnfortunately I don't have much spare time, to I would appreciate if somebody\nwould like to maintain it - with a lot of help from me of course. That's also a\ngood start into Debian packaging practice :)\n\nCheers,\n\nBernd\n\n\n--\nBernd Zeimetz                             Debian GNU/Linux Developer\nGPG Fingerprints: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\nECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485 DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New version of RadDisplay", "sender": "Bernd Zeimetz", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4A7B557B.7060906@bzed.de>", "refs": ["<4A704170.2080604@deluminaelab.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Aug  6 15:13:22 2009", "email": "bernd at bzed.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New version of RadDisplay"}
