Attached are\nmy comparisons - Results to the left (study case measurements) should be\nmultiplied by 10.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3RBjK2uI5SlaV92MTdLVHMzNUkxZWl6NGhWRHZDU19wY0xr/edit?usp=sharing\n\nBshara Rezik* |* B.Arch\n\nARCHITECTURE | INTERIOR *| *SUSTAINABLE *|* DESIGN\n\nAddress: HaNasi 28A, Apt. 6*,* Haifa, Israel *|* Tel: +972-54-6314584\nWebsite: http://www.bshara-arch.com *|* e-mail: bshara at gmail.com *|*\nLinkedIn <http://il.linkedin.com/pub/bshara-rezik/20/726/981>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140506/56dd9ae7/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Bshara Rezik", "datetime": "Tue, 6 May 2014 20:30:05 +0300"}
