It returns\nthe bin number for a point (Px,Py) based on the x and y resolution.\nThe \"depth\" of the plane is not taken into account. If you would add\nanother component you would split the 2-d array into a 3-d array.\nI don't think that's what you want to do.\n\n\nThis formula returns the number of the bin for the particular\n\"tile\" in the Xres (columns) * Yres (rows) grid.\n\nfloor_bin = column position + ( row position * columns)\n\nfloor() is the math formula to return the next smaller integer number.\n\nIt's easy to understand if you replace all the variables with\nactual values. Example:\n\nFloorXres = 13\nFloorYres = 17\nFloorOrigX = 0\nFloorOrigY = 0\nFloorWidth = 26\nFloorLength = 34\n\nPx = 5.67\nPy = 12.34\n\nfloor_bin = floor( 13 * ( 5.67 - 0 ) / 26 ) + floor( 17 * ( 1 - ( 12.34 - 0\n) / 34 ) ) * 13\n\nfloor_bin = floor( 13 * rel X position ) + floor ( 17 * ( 1 - rel Y postion)\n) * 13\n\n\nZ is not taken into account here.\n\n\nNot \"how many\" bins but \"which\" bin. The \"how many\" is set by Xres and Yres.\n\nPy\n\nI hope you can go on with the explanation above. If your floor slopes down\nyou might have adjust the area of the floor relative to a horizontal plane.\nBut that should be all.\n\n\nThomas\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090813/26ef511b/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] RE: Water any news ???", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0908131111k2a01a18al12e5cf51a7090285@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<92f99fb40908130656l38e02c70l5cbe1d5c3d89c884@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Aug 13 11:11:10 2009", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Water any news ???"}
