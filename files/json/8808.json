{"body": "\nJohn,\n\nI'd also like to see your scene, but while I wait I'll go out on a limb:\nAFAIK in radiance, an ambient sample ray is never emitted normal to a\nsurface.  I suspect your shadow results from the (slightly) decreased\nprobability of sampling the highlight from the area directly above the\nhighlight.  This effect can be compounded by the -as setting (which never\nsamples the upper edge of a division, but can sample the lower edge of a\ndivision).\n\nMy suggestion: try a high ad value coupled with no ambient super samples.\n-ad 20000 -as 0\n\n\nAs far as your comparison between raytracing and radiosity, You pick a scene\nthat plays to all the strengths of radiosity.  Radiosity with a dense mesh\nproduces a highly accurate result in relatively little time for scenes that\nhave very simple geometry and are limited to completely diffuse reflection\nand completely specular transmission.\n\nIf you had semi-specular reflection, semi-diffuse transmission or complex\ngeometry raytracing is more likely to result in higher accuracy in less time\nthan radiosity.\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn 8/13/09 1:58 PM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Shadow above highlight?", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C6A9DB35.CA05%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Aug 13 15:02:13 2009", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Shadow above highlight?"}
