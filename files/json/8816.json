I suspect that the issue\nmay be in the lumen output (or candela multiplier) in the IES file. Please\nhave a look at the report.\n\nArtificial lighting report: http://bit.ly/1qXigtU\n\nMay I request your suggestions on how this issue can be resolved ? How much\nshall I reduce the Candela multiplier, if that is to be done ?\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140522/1768541c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Vaib", "datetime": "Thu, 22 May 2014 15:33:33 +0530"}
