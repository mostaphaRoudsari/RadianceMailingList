{"body": "\nHi!\n\n\nWell, besides installing Radiance and using it to check geometry, you\ncan export your scenes to vrml(-1) and OpenInventor via the mgf-format,\nall necessary filters are part of Radiance. There is also a converter\nfrom Radiance into Wavefront OBJ, but it is limited to polygon objects\n(works well for my scenes coming from CAD, but will not work with more\nsophisticated geometry). For checking the resulting meshes, Meshlab may\nbe a good choice, as it allows to apply lots of filter to support you\nfinding errors in the mesh. It can read the mesh formats (as far as I\nremember all three of them - obj, vrml-1, openinventor) exported from\nRadiance and its filters.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: geometry checker", "sender": "Lars O.
