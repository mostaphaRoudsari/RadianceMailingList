It could be an error with the particular manufacturer?s IES file, if they?ve somehow made the IES file incorrect in the process of normalizing the IES file and applying the 8.6 multiplier. In other cases IES files are sometimes reported with a candela multiplier of 1.0 (instead of normalizing them first). Can you test with another manufacturer?s IES file of similar distribution, efficiency, and lamp type (maybe Zumtobel Claris).\n\n\nSent: Thursday, May 22, 2014 6:04 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHello Everyone,\n\nIn the following report, the simulated illuminance (artificial lighting) is un-reasonably high than the measured illuminance. I suspect that the issue may be in the lumen output (or candela multiplier) in the IES file. Please have a look at the report.\n\nArtificial lighting report: http://bit.ly/1qXigtU\n\nMay I request your suggestions on how this issue can be resolved ? How much shall I reduce the Candela multiplier, if that is to be done ?\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140522/8f1f4e7f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to verify an IES file ?", "tags": [], "sender": "vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com", "datetime": "Thu, 22 May 2014 13:14:08 +0000"}
