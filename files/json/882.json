The\nreason I'm using rad is because with the addition of the -bs option the\nscript also dosen't know how big the scene is.  I suppose I could change\nit to set up a default view like you have, and scale the -vp if the user\nenters a different value for -bs.  I was trying to change as little of\nobjview as possible though.  Anyone who's seen any of my programming\nknows why. =8-)\n\nI set -ab 1 because the scene just looks better, the bounce reveals\nfixture geometry and glow sources; I thought by scaling the room with\n-bs you could always have the light source close to the room surfaces,\nminimizing the ambient washout problems.\n\nYour erco source file shows a tiny ring (radius of .0175), but your\nroom/box is 10 units square (in your example).  Did you maybe assume\nmeters for one thing and milimeters for the other?  I did \"ltview -bs .2\nerco.rad\" and it looked fine (and there is approx. 1730 Lux under the\nfixutre, .1 units away).  I can't read an ies2rad -> rad file and spot\nerrors easily (hence this ltview utility), but I suspect maybe there's a\nunits mismatch.  That doesn't explain why your test scene at 10 units\nsquare looks OK, though.  Hmmm.\n\nCould you double-check your ies2rad input?\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ltview, a light source viewer", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40A10C70.7070805@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<409FFBA4.1010609@rumblestrip.org>", "<40A0F105.7000608@londonmet.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Tue May 11 19:25:01 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ltview, a light source viewer"}
