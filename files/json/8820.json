I then reduced the luminaire's brightness to 50% (as Thomas\nsuggested) by using \"-m 0.5\" in ies2rad. Now the simulated illuminance are\nquite close to the measured ones.\n\nThough I will calculate Lamp Loss Factor using the standard method to fine\ntune the results further. Thank you !\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\n\n\nOn 22 May 2014 19:09, Vaib <vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140522/5ccfa9ca/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to verify an IES file ?", "tags": [], "sender": "Vaib", "datetime": "Thu, 22 May 2014 23:01:15 +0530"}
