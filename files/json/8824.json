There is also a new ltpict.pl script that\nrenders a four-view representation of the light output distribution of\na light fitting or IES file.\n\nConceptually, the ltview/ltpict pair is simular to objview/objpict:\nOne is interactive, the other renders an HDR image.\n\nI don't think ltpict helps you with your particular problem, but I\nthought this thread provides a good opportunity for promoting it.\n\nRegards\n\nAxel\n\n\nOn 23 May 2014 09:52, Vaib <vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] How to verify an IES file ?", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Fri, 23 May 2014 10:45:22 +0100"}
