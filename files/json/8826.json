For that I\nam using:\n\nrpict -vta -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 sky.oct |\nfalsecolor -s XYZ -l cd/m2 > sky.hdr\n\nDr.Mardaljevic in his dissertation said to set -s argument of falsecolor\nclose to the Zenith luminance, that can be obtained by rvu's trace command.\n\nTo get the Zenith luminance, I am tracing the ray (using rvu) that is\napproximately at the centre of the image created with the above view\nparameters, and setting this ray's luminance value as the -s option of\nfalsecolor.\n\nIs this the right way to show/cover the whole luminance spectrum in the sky\n? (It doesn't look so in the image..)\n\nOr shall I trace the ray at the apparently at the brightest pixel ? (by\nreducing the exposure, and figuring out that pixel)\n\nI think the term Zenith Luminance may mean the luminance at the centre of\nthe sky, but I must take your opinion before concluding. Thank you!\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140523/79a6b2f6/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Vaib", "datetime": "Fri, 23 May 2014 23:44:22 +0530"}
