Note the peak value will not necessarily be at the zenith (which, yes, is where the vector 0,0,1 points to in a hemispherical fisheye view).\n\nI also find that for other than overcast skies, using a logarithmic scale (-log 2) is very useful for getting the most value out of a falsecolor representation of a sky's luminous distribution.\n\nOn 5/23/14, 12:14 PM, \"Vaib\" <vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com<mailto:vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI am trying to create falsecolor fish-eye image of just the sky.

(It doesn't look so in the image..)\n\nOr shall I trace the ray at the apparently at the brightest pixel ? (by reducing the exposure, and figuring out that pixel)\n\nI think the term Zenith Luminance may mean the luminance at the centre of the sky, but I must take your opinion before concluding.
