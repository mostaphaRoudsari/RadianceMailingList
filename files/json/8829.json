{"body": "\nHi Zack,\n\nthe problem you experience appears any time when you have coplanar\nsurfaces with different modifiers. A ray hitting such a surface sees\neither material, and as they are coplanar this results in a random noise\n/ mixture of both.\n\nTo use antimatter, place a box in you wall, so that the front side of it\nis in front of the wall (you would see it from your position) while the\nback one is behind. Make sure that there is no other geometry in the\nvolume of this box.\n\nNow what happens is that a ray hitting the antimatter material with the\nsurface facing it will become blind, go on traveling the same direction\n(or modify it according to what you give in the second line of the\nantimatter modifier's definition), and start seeing geomertry only once\nhe passed thru the back of an antimatter surface again. In other words,\nit is like if the ray jumps between the antimatter surfaces ignoring\neverything in between.\n\nHope this is correct, but that was the result of looking at that part of\nthe code once ;-)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090910/7e6b843d/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Antimatter and windows", "sender": "Lars O.
