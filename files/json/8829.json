I have been searching the web for candlepower distribution files\nfor standard PAR38 LED lamps you might find at your local home improvement\nstore, for conversion to an imposter surface.\n\n\n\nI haven't had a lot of luck but I'm still looking! I came across Krzysztof\nWandachowicz's papers on calculating luminaires for Radiance, getting me\nthinking more often the data might not be available and a measurement is\nrequired?\n\n\n\nAlso of interest is a Masters Thesis by Randolph Fritz describing the\ndevelopment of a luminaire modeling program called LumBuild. I haven't found\nmuch follow on information related to the program?\n\n\n\nAppreciate any knowledge you can share!\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nBrian\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140526/220b08a6/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Brian Karr", "datetime": "Mon, 26 May 2014 18:50:22 -0400"}
