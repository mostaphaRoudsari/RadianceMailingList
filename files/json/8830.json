I have been searching the web for candlepower distribution files for standard PAR38 LED lamps you might find at your local home improvement store, for conversion to an imposter surface.\n\nI haven?t had a lot of luck but I?m still looking! I came across Krzysztof Wandachowicz?s papers on calculating luminaires for Radiance, getting me thinking more often the data might not be available and a measurement is required?\n\nAlso of interest is a Masters Thesis by Randolph Fritz describing the development of a luminaire modeling program called LumBuild. I haven?t found much follow on information related to the program?\n\nAppreciate any knowledge you can share!\n\nThank you,\nBrian\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140526/2312d74f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IESNA Files & LumBuild", "tags": [], "sender": "brianakarr at yahoo.com", "datetime": "Monday, May 26, 2014 6:50 PM"}
