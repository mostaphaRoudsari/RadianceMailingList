{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nThere are a few ways to run mksource in order to control the number of\nsources produced. I believe that there is a switch for a radiance\nthreshold as well as the diameter of the resulting sources. With these\nyou should be able to control how the hdr is sampled and thus the\nresulting number of sources produced, so perhaps you could sample things\nin order to end up with just a handful of sources covering the\nhemisphere.... which would be similar to using a low res version of the\nimage to \"smear\" the light distribution.\n\nI believe source sampling is affected by -ds (this is an issue relating\nto the geometry primitive such as source, polygon, ring rather than the\nmaterial type such as light, illum or glow). You will also probably need\nto set -dj to something useful and perhaps most importantly use -u for\nuncorrelated monte carlo. This last will require greater sampling (eg\nlarger image) in order to reduce noise in image by downsampling. Not\nsure but you might have a sampling related problem anyway if you were\nable to find a solution with simple glow source hemisphere.\n\nI am trying to thing if there is some interesting trick with\nmixfunc/mixpict that could be applied, but nothing comes to mind at the\nmoment.\n\n-Jack\n\nMark Stock wrote:\n\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Multiple spherical glow sources?", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4AAFBEED.7040806@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<Pine.LNX.4.64.0909141559540.17070@punchout.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>\t<4AAEACC2.9070004@visarc.com>", "<Pine.LNX.4.64.0909141902510.7060@punchout.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>"], "datetime": "Tue Sep 15 09:21:30 2009", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Multiple spherical glow sources?"}
