There may be a\nbuilt-in limit for oconv or another process in Radiance. What happens if\nyou combine all the output files to a single file with the xform command?\n\nxform test.rad > test_combined.rad\n\n\nIf this works you can run oconv with the test_combined.rad file:\n\noconv test_combined.rad > test.oct\n\n\n\nBTW: Is there a specific reason to have so many materials in your scene?\nMost of your scene files contain only a few polygons. You can also try to\nexport the scene by group or by layer in su2rad. That (probably) reduces\nthe file count and can solve your problem.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 17, 2014 at 2:44 AM, Thompson, Ross <rt at cbgc.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140617/23bbcec0/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: imagefebc64.PNG\nType: image/png\nSize: 4616 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140617/23bbcec0/attachment-0003.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: imagebba53f.PNG\nType: image/png\nSize: 3461 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140617/23bbcec0/attachment-0004.png>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: imageb52106.PNG\nType: image/png\nSize: 3310 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140617/23bbcec0/attachment-0005.png>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Create Octree File from SU2RAD", "tags": [], "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "datetime": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 08:11:14 -0500"}
