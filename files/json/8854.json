{"body": "\nHi,\n\nLars - why not use the relevant pixels from the first run in the final\nimage?\n\nModel 1 - low res radiance map\nModel 2 - uniform white sky\nModel 3 - high res star map\n\nrpict -ab 5 mod1.oct > pic1.hdr //high quality rendering\nrpict -ab 0 mod2.oct > mask.hdr //image mask - black and white pixels\nrpict -ab 0 mod3.oct > pic3.hdr //direct only rendering, starry sky\n\nUse the mask to replace sky pixels with pixels of the starry sky:\n\npcomb -e 'Ro=if(Ri(2),Ri(3),Ri(1) etc...'  \\\npic1.hdr mask.hdr pic3.hdr > final.hdr\n\n\nThis was my initial thought when I saw Mark's query, but I thought an all\nencompassing model (ala Jack's mksource suggestion) would probably fit\nbetter.  I'm not sure how practical three images and pcomb is with M. Stock\nsized pre-filtered renderings.  But given the complexity of the subsequent\nresponses, maybe a dumber solution is more practical?\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nOn 9/15/09 7:11 PM, \"Lars O.
