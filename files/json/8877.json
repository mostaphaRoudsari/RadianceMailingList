I've uploaded sample data, including hdr images\nand csv datafiles, recorded by the camera for three days over the past\nweek( clear, partly cloudy and overcast). We're happy to share more data\nwith other researchers and daylight practitioners (but we don't have much\nto offer yet).\n\nThe images can be mapped to a Radiance sky for simulation under real sky\nconditions. I have not used the sky HDR images yet, myself, so if anybody\nuses them successfully please report back and share what you've done!\n\nQuestions about the camera hardware and capabilities should be directed to\nChris Humann at Terrestrial Light.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140626/3bdd4a1c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 16:48:07 -0700"}
