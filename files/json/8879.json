{"body": "<35D34984-2FCC-4C21-ACA6-C280D3DA81EC@u.washington.edu>\n\nDear All,\n\n\n\nI am trying to remap accurately an angular fisheye view of the sky using\nthe proj_pict_fisheye.cal developed by Peter Apian-Bennewitz, ISE, on\nJuly 96 (as it is reported on the copyright header in the .cal file) to\nsubsequently use it as light source for a diffuse sky simulation.\n\n\n\nIt seems to work fairly well (the error at the centre is about 1% of the\noriginal image) but\n\n1) a bright circle forms along the horizon\n\n2) the remapped image is constantly less bright than the original one\n\n\n\nIf anybody has any idea about the reason behind this behaviour it would\nbe very helpful\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20090908/6f4aea82/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Giovanni Betti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3033C1D32@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Sep  8 10:49:05 2009", "email": "gbetti at fosterandpartners.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] sky mappingReferences: <49B0A199.7000208@u.washington.edu><58E15A7AECA742499E0D566C95B03BD20913EB30@ex-be01.burohappold.com>"}
