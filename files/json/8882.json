Certainly one could use these HDR images to\ngenerate sky vectors and apply them to daylight coefficients for a given\nmodel(s). Greg Ward has created a cool tool called mksource to facilitate\nthis process in Radiance, identifying small, intense pixels in the image;\ncreating and placing Radiance light sources in their stead, and zeroing the\npixels to avoid double counting.\n\nConsiderations:\n- Capturing the true (full) dynamic range of an exterior scene with direct\nsun is difficult.\n- Using locally-captured HDR images for daylight availability analysis is\nstatistically dubious. Granted, so is using TMY data, for different\nreasons. This is why I changed the title of this list to \"considerations\",\nfrom \"problems\". =)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 27, 2014 at 3:38 PM, CHI-German Molina <gmolina at hdlao.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140627/027e5bbd/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Sky Camera @ LBNL's Flexlab", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 15:58:13 -0600"}
