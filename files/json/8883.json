Mksource would be helpful to zero out the pixels, but\nthe source that it makes won't be useful without adjusting the radiance of\nthe source to match that of the sun.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 27, 2014 at 2:58 PM, Rob Guglielmetti <\nrob.guglielmetti at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140627/93134e04/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Sky Camera @ LBNL's Flexlab", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 16:28:09 -0700"}
