I thought usually this position is set as \"void\"\n\n\nUsing your approach, I tried some other hdr image provided by your project,\nand it seems the global horizontal illuminance is always underestimated as\ncompared to the one reported in the csv file.\n\nrubbing my head about this issue, and advices are greatly appreciated!\n\nRegards,\nJoe\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 1, 2014 at 3:06 AM, Christian Humann <chris at christianhumann.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140701/f7fa5a33/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Sky Camera @ LBNL's Flexlab", "tags": [], "sender": "Joe Smith", "datetime": "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 13:26:47 +0800"}
