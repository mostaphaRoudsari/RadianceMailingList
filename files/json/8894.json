You can\ntell it is not a real object because it is outside for several hours and no\nbirds sit or poop on it. (Good luck HDR Skycam ! )\n\nI have zipped all the files used to make the video and put them on the page\nfor download, as well as a few experiments i have made in manipulating\nsurfaces (either transmission or shading) in response to sky data from\nPortland, Oregon using a Canon A570 with Stereo Data Maker used to automate\nbracketed image acquisition (i have a plan to post the details for that, as\nit is a very low-cost < $80 approach and will get to it).\n\nlet me know (offline) if there are issues downloading or executing the\nfiles,\n\nbest,\n\n-Kyle\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 1, 2014 at 8:52 AM, Christian Humann <chris at christianhumann.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140701/500d5529/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] HDR Sky Camera @ LBNL's Flexlab", "tags": [], "sender": "Kyle Konis", "datetime": "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 16:10:29 -0700"}
