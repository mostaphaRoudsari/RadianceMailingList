This is what\nI do, and here is a little shell script I wrote to help (my first! be\ngentle):\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n# Toast's first stab at a useful program\n# stand back parts may fly off at any moment\n\nfor file in $( ls *.pic )\ndo\necho \"Now converting '$file'...\"\nra_tiff $file $file.tif\ndone\necho \"Finished!\"\n\nThis will just give you a bunch of TIFFs. I then run a script to\nconvert them all into Jpegs (I do this in two steps, 'cause sometimes\nI just want to convert all my PICs to TIFF so I can bring them into\nPhotoshop when doing stills):\n\n#!/bin/sh\n# Toast's second stab at a useful program\n# stand back parts may still fly off at any moment\n\nfor file in $( ls *.tif )\ndo\necho \"Now converting '$file'...\"\nconvert $file $file.jpg\ndone\necho \"Finished!\"\n\nThis one relies upon the Imagemagik set of tools and it's excellent\n'convert'. Both of these work under Cygwin or Linux with no\nmodification. Both of these are basic in the extreme, and once I have\nthe time I'll put something in there that renames them all too, but it\nat least should give you an idea of how you might automate your\nanimation workflow...\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\nTarik Rahman wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate movies", "tags": [], "sender": "Jeffrey McGrew", "datetime": "Sat Oct 23 21:25:31 2004"}
