{"body": "\nDear users,\n\nI hope this is the correct forum to post this question.\n\nI have run stumble upon a strange problem rendering images with radiance.\n\nI have made a simple file containing the different commands to be executed to render the images/data needed. When I execute this file (source xxx.cal) All the output files have a (?) added to the file type (e.g. grid.xyz? instead of grid.xyz). Furthermore I cannot use \\ as line separation in my file anymore.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with these types of errors?\n\n\nBest regards\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n\nFind din nye laptop p? kelkoo.dk.
