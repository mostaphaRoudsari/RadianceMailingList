Any advice?\n\nThanks in advance,\nGiuseppe\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140713/7123eeec/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Giuseppe De Michele", "datetime": "Sun, 13 Jul 2014 13:39:02 +0200"}
