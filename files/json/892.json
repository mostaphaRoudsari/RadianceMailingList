It comes\nfrom a peculiar combination of the mist type with the new source\nobstruction rotuines.  It is not an input error -- no input should ever\ncause a consistency error.  If you get an error like this, you will\nneed to download and compile the new version of src/rt/srcobstr.c or\nuse the HEAD release.  We may offer a patch to the 3.6 release at a\nfuture date if this (or other) problems warrant it.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Mac OS-X rpict problem?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon Oct 25 20:16:26 2004"}
