{"body": "\nHi Alexa,\n\nI think that we are agreed that using a spectrophotometer is a more\naccurate solution depending on the users needs, objectives etc... ;->\n\nOne clarification though. As far as I know \"pcond\" (the radiance program\nfor physically based simulation of a variety of dynamic range and\ncontrast sensitivity functions as based on research by Jim Ferwerda,\nHolly Rushmeier, Greg Ward and others) is not used with the macbethcal\ncallibration process. The program I was refering to is \"pcomb\" which can\nbe used for a variety of image process operations on radiance image\nincluding applying a calibration function as output from \"macbethcal\".\n\n-Jack\n\nAlexa I.
