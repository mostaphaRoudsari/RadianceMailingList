Is there a more basic description that could help me understand it better? For example, I think I am supposed to describe the sky material somehow under -m but I am not sure how to do that. Also I don't understand the -e, the -b, -bn or the -faf options.\nThanks in advance,\nAle\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140716/3f990eb0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?B?QWxlamFuZHJvIFBhY2hlY28gRGnpZ3Vleg==?=", "datetime": "Wed, 16 Jul 2014 12:08:35 +0200"}
