Is it possible to exclude planes in a certain orientations from\nan rpict calculation. For example, I would like to use radiance to\ncreate a picture showing the vertical sky component on vertical\nsurfaces. Therefore I would like to exclude the horizontal surfaces to\nprevent them from cluttering up the image.\n\nIdeally, I would anticipate being able to overlay a contour image which\nexcludes the horizontal surfaces over a luminance image which includes\nthem. I suppose I could generate this from two separate sets of\ngeometry, but this is a little clunky and may result in some inaccurate\nresults, where the inter-reflections may be important and or\nsignificant. Any thoughts would be gratefully received.\n\nMany thanks\n\nNick\n\n\n\nXCO2\n\n\nXCO2 conisbee  Ltd\n1-5 Offord Street\nLondon N1 1DH\nTel: + 44 (0)20 7700 1000\nFax: + 44 (0)20 7700 4455\nEmail: nickd@xco2.com\nWeb: http://www.xco2.com\n\nengineering sustainability\n\n\n---\nThis e-mail and any attachment contains information which is private and\nconfidential and is intended for named recipient(s) only.
