I changed the path and raypath to the following to the location where I have Radiance saved:\n\nPath = c:\\Program Files\\Radiance\\bin\nRAYPATH = c:\\Program Files\\Radiance\\lib\n\nbut when I call upon the command, I am still being told it is not a recognized command.\n\nThis is the command I am using to call upon the image.\n\nC:\\g215th>falsecolor.pl ?i june.hdr ?log 2 -1 Lux > luxjune.hdr\n\nIs there another step I am missing or do I have the programs installed incorrectly? I have Pearl and Radiance saved in two different folders if that matters.\n\nThanks,\nKyle\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle E.
