Perhaps the visible component would have to be assessed first, and then the IR on a second run, after modifying the surface reflectances?\n\nMany thanks\n\nRichard Watkins\n\nKent School of Architecture  :  University of Kent  :  Kent  :  CT2 7NZ\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140722/442fc75f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Richard Watkins", "datetime": "Tue, 22 Jul 2014 11:39:24 +0000"}
