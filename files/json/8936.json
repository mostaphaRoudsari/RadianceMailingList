But even adding that for the command below I get this error \"Use of\nuninitialized value in split at /usr/local/ray/bin/genskyvec line 129, <>\nline 17.\" and some other lines of similar error.\n\nMatlab command:\nunix('/usr/local/ray/bin/gendaylit 03 12 07:35 -a 48.2 -o -16.37 -m -15 -W\n3.26 67.30 | /usr/local/ray/bin/genskyvec -m 1 -c 1 1 1 filename.dat')\n\nbut if I return this command in Terminal I get no error and works\nperfectly. Any idea why is it like that and what should I do?\n\nCheers, Ehsan\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140725/5ef01d26/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Path problem", "tags": [], "sender": "Ehsan M.Vazifeh", "datetime": "Fri, 25 Jul 2014 09:56:38 +0200"}
