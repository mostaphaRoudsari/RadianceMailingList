{"body": "\nHi Andrew,\n\nI guess I should write a program or script to create a BTDF file for\nan arbitrary shading system.  It's not particularly difficult to do\nthis using rtcontrib, but I need to find time to do it.  The next\ncouple of weeks are crazy between the workshop and the HDR Imaging\nbook deadline, so I don't think I'll get to it before then.  I won't\nbe much help with your deadline, unfortunately.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091018/de068307/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Annual simulations + BSDF", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<405CBA64-94CF-4D4B-ABF0-E53463AE0360@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<C6FDEE95.D870%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>"], "datetime": "Sun Oct 18 11:26:28 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Annual simulations + BSDF"}
