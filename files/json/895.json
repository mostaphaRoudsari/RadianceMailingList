{"body": "\nJim,\n\nI noticed the price difference at Alibris. It is probably becuase they also had momentary access to the unapproved soft cover versin of the book with its unapproved price.  I expect their records will be updated when the other online retailers also begin to carry the book.\n\n-Chas\n\n===========\n\nSo, any idea why the price quoted from Alibris is $45 ??  Is it the\ncorrect hardback version, a good deal, or just another error?\n\nThanks for the effort making the book available again,\n-Jim\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040512/99a35e99/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Charles Ehrlich", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<20040512172819.64163.qmail@web80305.mail.yahoo.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed May 12 19:35:09 2004", "email": "ckehrlich at yahoo.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Rendering with Radiance, Revised Edition"}
