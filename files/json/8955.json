{"body": "\nHi (Zdravo) Marija,\n\nAs far as I could tell, the fix given by Perez in the erratum (link\nbelow) is in the code:\n\n/* correction de modele de Perez solar energy ...*/\nif ( (epsilon > 1.065) && (epsilon < 2.8) )\n\nhttp://www.asrc.cestm.albany.edu/perez/publications/Solar%20Resource%20Assessment%20and%20Modeling/More%20Papers%20on%20Resource%20Assessment%20and%20Satellites/erratum-93.pdf\n\nNote that the AW model was based *only* on data from Berkeley.  This\nis perhaps why the overcast conditions in the AW model are different\nto CIE overcast (which has been validated as a reliable overcast model\nfor many European sites).  See:\nJ. Mardaljevic. Sky model blends for predicting internal illuminance:\na comparison founded on the BRE-IDMP dataset.
