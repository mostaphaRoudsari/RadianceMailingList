{"body": "\nHi Per,\n\nwelcome! Radiance is a simulation based on physics. Thus, if you model a\ngeometry with an opening or transparent interfaces, light will pass\nthrough. If the transparent surfaces cause scattering, this will\ninfluence the transmission just as you would observe it. There is no\nneed for special parameters as this is just what light does...\n\nI do not know whether things are different when using ESP-r, but that\nwould be related to the export filters, not to Radiance.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight passing between two rooms?", "sender": "Lars O.
