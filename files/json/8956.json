From that, it creates a color mapping file you can use with pcomb to correct the image.\n\nHowever, it does not work very well for digital cameras.  You are much better off converting the RAW files directly using Dave Coffin's dcraw, which you can find on the web.  Getting to reflectance is more difficult, and depends on your situation.\n\nCheck out the following if you haven't already:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/sg96crs.pdf\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CABzgtwqh_DosaObkar45iATWMEf-YmP-DbpujF=8fh=aQsH_3A@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 09:09:01 -0700"}
