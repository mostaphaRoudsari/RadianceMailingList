{"body": "\nIn your first image it looks like you may have light leaks at the right hand side where your floor meets the wall, possibly due to rounding error in your geometry export/conversion. Try building your walls with thickness and stopping your floor surface exactly at the inner wall surface if they're not already (i.e. inner and outer surface) to help keep stray rays out.\n\nThe aiming failure is because your surfaces appear to be triangulated, so the direct sampling routine anticipates a rectangular source, but some samples miss because the surface is only half a rectangle. Try checking that all your surfaces are precisely planar and exporting with a method that doesn't triangulate. If you're using obj2rad see the -f option.\n\nIf you have an oversized ground plane or full city modeled outside the building, your -ar value may not be high enough. Increasing ar should smooth out the interior ambient calculation.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, October 30, 2009 5:43 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\nDear users,\nI have some problem about mirror (light shelf) and illum.\nI create my scene by Rhino be careful to surface normal (normal glass\ninward) and properties of mirror surface:\nsome object are:\n\nvoid glass float\n0\n0\n3 0.958 0.958 0.958\n\nfloat polygon object_1.1 (I have a few object as poligon that represent glass surfaces) 0 0\n9\n67.7750015259      0.52999997139                7.5\n67      0.52999997139                7.5\n67      0.52999997139      8.10000038147\n\nlight shelf:\n\nvoid metal aluminium\n0\n0\n5 0.88 0.88 0.88 0.8 0.02\n\nvoid mirror light_shelf\n1 aluminium\n0\n3 0.704 0.704 0.704\n\nceiling:\n\nvoid plastic material1\n0\n0\n5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.02 0.05\n\nvoid mirror ceiling\n1 material1\n0\n3 0.01 0.01 0.01\n\nsky:\n\n!gensky 09 21 16 -a 44.30 -o 11.21 -m -15 -c -B 0.5587\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\nskyfunc glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\nrpict:\n\nrpict -vf view1.vf -i -ab 3 -aa 0.30 -ar 512 -ad 1024 -as 512 -dr 2\n-\nx 2400 -y 1800 -t 30 scene/scene1.oct | pfilt -1 -x /3 -y /3 > picture/view1.pic\n\nfalsecolor:\nfalsecolor -i picture/view1.pic -log 2 -s 7 -n 10 -l DF > picture/view1_df.pic\n\nra_tiff:\nra_tiff picture/view1_df.pic tif/view1_df.tif\n\n\n\nQuestions are:\nwhy are there some different color splotches on the bottom of the wall (view1_without ls) and a poor picture in general?\nwhy the DF value on the floor is worse than simple scene if I use a\nlight shelf?
