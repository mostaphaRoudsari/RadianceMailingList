I am\ntrying to model a series of openings in a screen using antimatter and I\nam getting really confused.\nThe screen is modelled as a single surface intersected by a number of\ncubes. As in the antimatter description I read:\n\"The viewpoint must be outside all volumes concerned for a correct\nrendering.\" I assume that means that the camera should not be inside one\nof the cubes and that (I guess) the cube normals should point outward.\nDone that, I am able to see through the cubes but I do not see the\npattern of light coming through the antimatter holes, I just have a big\nsolid shadow...\n\nIs that how it is supposed to behave? Does anybody have any clue about\nwhat I am doing wrong?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBest,\n\nGiovanni\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091030/e520feb1/attachment-0001.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Giovanni Bett", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<B564F6CD0114A44E816C0D68AE8C6E69062A24A3@MKEXCHVS2.Mail.Fiserv.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Oct 30 10:28:16 2009", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Giovanni Betti", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Antimatter"}
