{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nI'm not able to reproduce this error with the latest version of\nRadiance.  What version are you running?  Is anyone getting my e-mails?\n\nJack's example runs fine, and if you add a floor:\n\nvoid plastic gray\n0\n0\n5 .2 .2 .2 0 0\n\n!genbox gray floor 10 10 .1 | xform -t 0 0 -.1001\n\n...you get to see the shadows through the windows.  I also tried using\n\"void\" instead of \"red\" as the first antimatter modifier and that\nworks, as does making the wall infinitely thin (single surface), so I\nthink you must be running version 3.8 or your cut-out surfaces are\ncoincident or something...\n\nThe thing that doesn't work is using a non-void material as the first\nantimatter argument to cut a hole in a single-surface wall.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091030/2beb9fa1/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Antimatter", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<505048F9-06CD-4D1B-8C23-7C4385022C3D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<23576815.1099391256895795957.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost><EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7064F94B8@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "<6F5225D6E15F954BB4E58EC25F6736C3039DDB4F@corp3005.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>", "<B564F6CD0114A44E816C0D68AE8C6E69062A24A3@MKEXCHVS2.Mail.Fiserv.net>"], "datetime": "Fri Oct 30 10:47:30 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Antimatter"}
