Since the pipes are not straight I need to be sure that the\nvectors I set are correct and I am a bit confused about what the ?vu? vector\nstands for. So here is what I did.\n\n\nThe room with the pipes is oriented towards\nthe northeast and the pipe bending is towards the southwest. I generated the BSDF through a model where the pipe\nbending part is facing towards the ?y axis.  I attached a small picture to make it clearer. So here are some of my questions.\n\n\nWhat should the \"vu\" be at the daylight matrix?\nI am not sure which axis of the BSDF corresponds to the ?vu?. My guess is that ?vu? should be 1, 1, 0 or 1, -1, 0? Should the pipe\nmodel from which I generate the BSDF be correctly oriented as well?\n\n\n\nIs there any way to have the model of the\nroom oriented towards the north (y axis) and then set the correct orientation\nvia the ?vu? or some other way?\nI thank you in advance,\nVayia\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140731/27f3febf/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: dec.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 35833 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140731/27f3febf/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Vayia Koukouvayia", "datetime": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 14:53:12 +0300"}
