Greg has written a new tool, rfluxmtx, that will allow you to\ngenerate a coefficient matrix for a relationship between arbitrary\npolygons. Your model is a good example of what wasn't possible before that\nis enabled by the new tools.\n\nUnfortunately there's not much documentation of rfluxmtx other than the man\npage. I'm working on providing a three-phase simulation example using\nrfluxmtx hopefully ready by the workshop in September.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 31, 2014 at 4:53 AM, Vayia Koukouvayia <vaia13 at msn.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140731/b7c5de27/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight matrix - vu", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 10:33:38 -0700"}
