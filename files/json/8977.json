I have a room with clerestory\nwindows which consist of 2 layers of translucent panels. Exterior glazing\nis 60% VLT and interior glazing is 30% VLT with about a 30cm of cavity in\nbetween.\n\n*Simulation 1*\nvoid trans panelext60\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.65934066 0\n\nvoid trans panelint30\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.32967033 0\n\n\n*Simulation 2*\nvoid trans panelext60\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.65934066 0.9\n\nvoid trans panelint30\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.32967033 0.9\n\nrpict command is as follows,\n\nrpict -vtv -vp 0.1 7.3 1.8 -vd 1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 130 -vv 90 -x 3000 -y\n1400 -ab 4 -aa 0.08 -ar 512 -ad 2048 -as 512 -ds .01 -dj .6 -t 60 sunny.oct\n\nI was expecting a significant difference in renderings for 2 scenes. The\nsecond simulation should have resulted in more defined bright patches.\nThough that's not the case. Am I missing something obvious here?\nUnfortunately I cannot attach the complete renderings due to confidential\nnature of the project. I have attached screenshots of the area of interest.\n\nAny help is much appreciated,\n\nThanks,\n\nShri\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140807/f8cf2f6c/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: sim1_tspec_0point0.JPG\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 13249 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140807/f8cf2f6c/attachment-0002.jpe>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: sim2_tspec_0point9.JPG\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 13023 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140807/f8cf2f6c/attachment-0003.jpe>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Shrikar Bhave", "datetime": "Thu, 7 Aug 2014 18:13:38 -0400"}
