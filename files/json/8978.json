{"body": "\nHi All,\n\nthank you Mark and Rob, it helps and I got further but I am still not\nsuccessful and after few hours with that I decided to write another post.\n\nWhat I did so far.\n\nInstall Xcode and downloaded radiance-HEAD.tgz, and rad3R9supp.tar.gz. Then\nunpack them inside ray folder according to the instructions on\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/ .\nThen place ray folder to usr/local/lib/ray and run sudo ./makeall install.\n\nIt started to install, but it ended again with message \"There were some\nerrors.\"\n\nHere is part of the text from terminal with errors:\n....\n*lipo: can't open input file: /var/tmp//cc7tPgdL.out (No such file or\ndirectory)\nmake: *** [rpict] Error 1\ncc -I../common -L../lib -O2 -arch ppc -arch i386 -DBSD -DNOSTEREO -Dfreebsd\n-I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib -isysroot\n/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -o ./rvu rvmain.o rview.o rv2.o rv3.o\ndevtable.o devcomm.o editline.o x11.o x11twind.o colortab.o\n../lib/libradiance.a -lrtrad -lm -lX11\nld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.5.o\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.5.o\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nlipo: can't open input file: /var/tmp//cczmztgf.out (No such file or\ndirectory)\nmake: *** [rvu] Error 1\ncc -I../common -L../lib -O2 -arch ppc -arch i386 -DBSD -DNOSTEREO -Dfreebsd\n-I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib -isysroot\n/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -o ./lookamb lookamb.o ambio.o -lrtrad -lm\nld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.5.o\nld:collect2:  library notld returned 1 exit status\nfound for -lcrt1.10.5.o\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nlipo: can't open input file: /var/tmp//ccXciAPr.out (No such file or\ndirectory)\nmake: *** [lookamb] Error 1*\n....\n\nI guess it is something with wrong path or environment, I am not sure.\nI also did as Mark suggested:\n\n\n\n\nI wrote that to the end of file \"bashrc\" at /etc/bashrc. I was not sure how\nto re-source that file so I just write \"source ~/.bashrc\" to the beginning\nof file \"profile\" at /etc/profile, but this probably dost not work.\n\n\nThank you again\n\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091031/060984b1/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "David Appelfeld", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<e3330ba60910311501l1f296b84k471dbdc1b914b7c3@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Sat Oct 31 15:01:09 2009", "email": "d.appelfeld at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance installation on Mac OS X 10.5.6"}
