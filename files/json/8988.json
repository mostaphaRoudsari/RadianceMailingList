All\nthe other values show a clear sun-patch in the space.\n\nAny clue why this is happening? Would you expect such results? Everything\nelse is constant in the model. (images are attached)\n\nThanks,\n\nShri\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140812/c64c8f46/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: 10_diff.JPG\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 14846 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140812/c64c8f46/attachment-0004.jpe>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: 50_diff.JPG\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 15259 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140812/c64c8f46/attachment-0005.jpe>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: 90_diff.JPG\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 15221 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140812/c64c8f46/attachment-0006.jpe>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: 100_diff.JPG\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 13939 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140812/c64c8f46/attachment-0007.jpe>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Shrikar Bhave", "datetime": "Tue, 12 Aug 2014 18:51:59 -0400"}
