Would you please tell me commands that can simulate roller blind(diffuse reflection) and solar film blind(speculation reflection)\n\nIs it possible to have a solar sensor to trigger Up/Down motions of motorised roller blind and motorised solar film?\n\nWhere can I find examples of Atrium?\n\n\nThanks a lot!\nStanley\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "StanleyCheung", "datetime": "Fri, 15 Aug 2014 03:10:56 +0800"}
