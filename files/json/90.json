{"body": "\nHi Frank,\n\nThere is a very helpful document that describes the material formulas on\nthe Radiance website:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\nYou should note that the function you give to the transdata material for\nthe specular component should integrate to 1 over the sphere, not 4pi as\nwould be the case for a true BTDF.  This is because you are supplying\nonly the specular distribution, not the actual reflectance function, as\nthe formula for transdata includes some other factors (such as a diffuse\ncomponent) to build a complete BTDF.\n\nRegarding the integration of the sky distribution, all of the BRTDF\ntypes in Radiance approximate non-source contributions as diffuse,\nbecause I never built in the machinery to properly integrate arbitrary\ndistribution functions.  So, the answer will not be exactly correct if\nyou use the custom reflectance materials.  Only light sources, such as\nthe sun, will utilize the distribution functions you specify.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<3BE815AB.443540B3@lmi.net>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue, 06 Nov 2001 08:54:03 -0800", "email": "radiance-general@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: transdata formula & sky componentReferences: <200111061101.fA6B12610565@darkside-animation.com>"}
