Looks like hdr mapping is scaled.\n\nIs there some consideration in generating the tiff file or converting it to\nhdr that I am missing. I tried to use pfilt and re-size the image to make\nsure the size is fixed but it didn't help.\n\nHere is a slide that shows the problem:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/eklns2rv5bv6tyj/RhinoVSRadiance.jpg?dl=0\n\nAlso the hdr file generated from tiff image in case it can help:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o293dqh04ack1hb/random_pattern_1.HDR?dl=0\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140822/e779307c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "datetime": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 14:58:38 -0400"}
