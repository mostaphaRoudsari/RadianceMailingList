{"body": "\nHi folks,\n\nFreshly inspired from the Radiance Workshop, and cooped up under 22\ninches of snow here in Boulder, I took an old web page I created and\nintegrated it into my blog/website. A summary of my first foray into\nthe use of illums on a project, this page dates back to 2003 (right\nbefore meeting many of you at that year's workshop in Berkeley, in\nfact). I've been told it's helpful, so I thought I'd get it back\nonline with all my other crap. Here's the link, which begs to be cut &\npasted:\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/interests/light/using-the-illum-material-for-smoother-renderings-in-radiance/\n\nI hope to add more stuff soon, but right now my dog & I are gonna go\nplay in the snow!\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<C036180B-2E61-435C-AC61-8F08FD7488B2@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Oct 29 15:39:34 2009", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Blast from the Past"}
