{"body": "\nDear users,\n\nIn a current project studies need to be done for an interior room with glazed partition walls. The sunlight is passing to the room through glazed partitions both from an 'atrium' and from the facade.\n\nThis is the first time I am doing this types of studies. I know sunlight passing between zones in ESP-r/Radiance is treated as a diffuse source. How is this treated in Radiance?\n\nI am in particular interested in hearing if there is any special parameters that I have to include when using rtrace, rcalc and rpict for this type of studies.\n\nAny input is appreciated :)\n\n\nBest regards\n\nPer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTr?nger du til at se det store billede?
