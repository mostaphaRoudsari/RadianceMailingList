Rcontrib actually\ndisables the ambient cache by setting -aa 0, so you will need to\nincrease ambient divisions (-ad) parameter along with a few others. As\nquick experiment you could try 2x or 4x whatever is set for -ad in the\nrtrace run in your rcontrib run. Also it would be instructive to see\nwhat defaults rcontrib uses and perhaps work from those. To do this you\ncan do rcontrib -defaults.\n\nAxel Jacobs had a very instructive tutorial on rtcontrib (older version\nof rcontrib) that included a section that compared running rtrace and\nrtcontrib. I think unfortunately it is no longer available though.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n--\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\nOn 9/2/2014 6:43 AM, Mario Geiger wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140903/7c8a6316/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 47026 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20140903/7c8a6316/attachment-0001.jpe>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace vs rcontrib", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Wed, 03 Sep 2014 15:05:51 -0400"}
