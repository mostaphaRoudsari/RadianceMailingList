See\nhttp://puffin2.curtin.edu.au/restricted/mcminn/radiance-cdrom-v3.3.shtml.\n\nThis version is based on the Knoppix Cluster V3.3 (English) CDROM.\n\nThere is a script on the CDROM called ompiece (/usr/local/bin) which is\nuseful for experimentation into using the openmosix cluster software and\nrpiece.\n\nOpenmosix doesn't require NFS for file sharing as it has its own system\nbuilt in.\n\nPlease email any comments.\n\nRegards\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987\nPerth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<8B67F2E2D93ED5118D6E00508BB8D127043CDCC1@exmsb04.curtin.edu.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri May 14 10:04:47 2004", "email": "T.McMinn at exchange.curtin.edu.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance on bootable CDROM using Cluster Linux"}
