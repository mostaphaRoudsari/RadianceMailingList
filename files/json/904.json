{"body": "\nHi Carsten, hi list!\n\n\nIn fact, it was what I had guessed. However, I wanted to be sure. Also,\nI wonder if there is any reason why the surface normal information is\nnot used from the triangle.\n\nI think, if I replace the call to fcross() in replmarks.c by a routine\nthat aligns the z-achsis to the surface normal, mirroring\ntransformations should be supported by replmarks, right? Is there a\nfunction to get the direction of the surface normal defined that I\ncould use (I am sure it is, I just don't know where ;-) ?\n\nSuch a feature in replmarks would be very useful for me, as I could use\njust the triangle markers I have and I would not have to search for\nmirrored objects in the whole model, which would certainly introduce\nerrors as I am rather sure that I would miss some objects.\n\nCU Lars.\n--\nLars O.
