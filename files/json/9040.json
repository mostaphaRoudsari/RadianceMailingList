{"body": "\nHi Victor!\n\n\nThere are lots of such products. What you describe would lead to frosted\nglass, which can be describes in Radiance using the trans modifier. In\nmost cases, one would use clear glass, acrylic, polycarbonat with a\nstructure to scatter or redirect light. This has the advantage that\nunlike diffuse materials, which also reflect back light to the outside,\nwith clear geometry you can still make sure that the light enters your room.\n\nCheers\n\nLars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] glass diffuser?", "sender": "Lars O.
