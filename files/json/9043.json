In short: as the image of the interior is, to see the preselected(from ecotect) sensor point with its value for daylight factor.\n\nbest,  Niya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------- ?????????? ????? --------\n\n??: Mostapha Sadeghipour sadeghipour at gmail.com\n\n???????: Re: [Radiance-general] Sensor points visualize\n\n??: Radiance general discussion\n\n????????? ??: ?????????, 2014, ???????? 2 14:31:31 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Niya,\n\n\n\n\n\nI think you need to be more clear about what you want to visualize? Do you want to find the sensor in Radiance's files? Is it related to your question about annual run with Daysim and you want to see hourly values for a single sensor during the year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 1, 2014 at 7:59 AM, Todor Syarov\nthodor at abv.bg >  wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\n\n\n\n\ni was wondering\n\n\n\nIs there a way to visualize the selected sensor points from Ecotect in the Radiance output?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141002/167aba56/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Todor Syarov", "datetime": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 18:08:29 +0300 (EEST)"}
