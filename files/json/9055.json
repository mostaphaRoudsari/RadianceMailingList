If you are only doing it for a small number of renderings the simplest way is to use something like PowerPoint or Photoshop to add labels with arrows to the right locations. If you set up a template this can also be quite fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to visualize a larger number of images you have to use some home made scripts to make this work. You would first calculate the DF values for your points and then use psign and pcompos to add text at the right place in the image. You need to be fairly familiar with your scripting environment (Bash on Linux, CMD or PowerShell on Windows) to get this to work. If you are a stranger to the command line ask someone to assist you with this or you won't see daylight soon (pardon the pun).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find excellent information on scripting for Radiance on Axel Jacob's page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 10:08 AM, Todor Syarov\nthodor at abv.bg >  wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Mostapha,\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is kind of you correcting me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy question concerns only the visual output of the points and their respective values in Radiance image(render).\n\n\nIn short: as the image of the interior is, to see the preselected(from ecotect) sensor point with its value for daylight factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbest,\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n-------- ?????????? ????? --------\n\n??: Mostapha Sadeghipour\nsadeghipour at gmail.com\n\n???????: Re: [Radiance-general] Sensor points visualize\n\n??: Radiance general discussion <\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org >\n\n????????? ??: ?????????, 2014, ???????? 2 14:31:31 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Niya,\n\n\n\n\n\nI think you need to be more clear about what you want to visualize? Do you want to find the sensor in Radiance's files? Is it related to your question about annual run with Daysim and you want to see hourly values for a single sensor during the year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 1, 2014 at 7:59 AM, Todor Syarov\nthodor at abv.bg >  wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\n\n\n\n\ni was wondering\n\n\n\nIs there a way to visualize the selected sensor points from Ecotect in the Radiance output?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141007/705f1aa6/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Todor Syarov", "datetime": "Tue, 7 Oct 2014 12:55:07 +0300 (EEST)"}
