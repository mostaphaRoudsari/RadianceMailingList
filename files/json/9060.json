I saw the CUDA 6.0 requirement on Radiance blog. Would that be enough for DGP and Radiance RAD Luminance(for instance) calculation?\n#my student computer reads like that:\nI am triggering with a file from Ecotect 2011 39MB on a\nWindows System, i5-2400 @2.5GHz  RAM:4GB  and ?appr.40GB free space\nyet the DGP simulation takes at least 20 hours. -eventough i?m exporting only 10-12 sensor pts.  i believe there is some ground-snoozing in my equipment and it could go faster,no?\nAny advice is greatly appreciated,\nBest,  Niya\n\nvar m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141011/1a376830/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Todor Syarov", "datetime": "Sat, 11 Oct 2014 14:50:41 +0300 (EEST)"}
