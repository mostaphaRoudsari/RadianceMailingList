When I execute this file\n(source xxx.cal) All the output files have a (?) added to the file type\n(e.g. grid.xyz? instead of grid.xyz). Furthermore I cannot use \\ as line\nseparation in my file anymore.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with these types of errors?\n\n\nBest regards\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091008/2e0cecc3/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "<336198.48355.qm@web26604.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7062C6E3C@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<336198.48355.qm@web26604.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Oct  8 06:27:44 2009", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Strange filetype naming when rederingwithradiance"}
