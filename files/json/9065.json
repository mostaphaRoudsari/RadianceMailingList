This has to be modelled even if you also put a large disk for the ground plane.\n\nRapha?l\n________________________________\nDe : Alejandro Pacheco Di?guez [paxeco2205 at hotmail.com]\nEnvoy? : jeudi 16 octobre 2014 10:36\n? : radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane\n\nHi all,\nI am assessning DF levels in a 4th floor of a building in an unobstructed area, so I am not considering any surrounding building just a ground plane that I modeled as a circle.\nAlmost by chance I discovered increasing the size of my ground plane has a significant effect on my DF. Using a ground plane of 500m radius I had an average of 3.34%, if I increase it to 1000meters I get over 12%. As long as I understand, this should not have such a big effect, should it? Could I be doing something wrong? Can I do something to make sure I get reasonable values?\nI am running the simulation though DIVA for Rhino in Grasshopper. My radiance parameters are: -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 256 -aa 0.1. My ground plane reflectance is 0.25.\nThanks in advance,\nAlejandro\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Size of ground the pla", "tags": [], "sender": "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Compagnon_Rapha=EBl?=", "datetime": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 09:23:07 +0000"}
