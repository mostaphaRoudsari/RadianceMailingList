This has to be modelled even if you also put a large disk for the ground plane.\n\n\n\nRapha?l\n\n________________________________\n\nDe : Alejandro Pacheco Di?guez [paxeco2205 at hotmail.com]\n\nEnvoy? : jeudi 16 octobre 2014 10:36\n\n? :  radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nObjet : [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane\n\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI am assessning DF levels in a 4th floor of a building in an unobstructed area, so I am not considering any surrounding building just a ground plane that I modeled as a circle.\n\nAlmost by chance I discovered increasing the size of my ground plane has a significant effect on my DF. Using a ground plane of 500m radius I had an average of 3.34%, if I increase it to 1000meters I get over 12%. As long as I understand, this should not have such a big effect, should it? Could I be doing something wrong? Can I do something to make sure I get reasonable values?\n\nI am running the simulation though DIVA for Rhino in Grasshopper. My radiance parameters are: -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 256 -aa 0.1. My ground plane reflectance is 0.25.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAlejandro\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\nvar m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141016/a7639214/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Todor Syarov", "datetime": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 13:42:16 +0300 (EEST)"}
