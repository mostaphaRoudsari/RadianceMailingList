Santiago is right, the issue here is your huge local ground plane and consequently relatively low -ar value. For a single story building, the rule of thumb is your ground plane plan projection should be about 5x the window head height. With that, even your current -ar of 256 should be adequate to avoid these interpolation errors.\n\n-rob\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Size of ground the pla", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 08:02:52 -0600"}
