{"body": "\nHi Ignacio!\n\nThanks for the quick reply! Just to avoid misunderstandings, the -s\nparameter in falsecolor does not change the radiometric values but the\nscale that is applied to them in the resulting image (as this is a\none-way, this does not reallt matter). So with -s, you define the range\nof pixel values that will mapped to the color scale. The multiplier is\ngiven following -m, and the default (to get from radiometric to\nphotometric according to the internal efficacy of 153 lm/W that is used\nby Radiance) is -m 153. So that is why I was wondering whether giving -m\n1 would be enough.\n\nMy main concern is at the moment whether the HMI-source photometry is\ncorrectly transfered into radiometry by only using ies2rad with the\nlamptab (unfortunately I do not have more detailed information on the\nemission spectrum and luminous efficacy).\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "<4ACC61D0.5050907@aisarquitectura.com>", "sender": "Lars O.
