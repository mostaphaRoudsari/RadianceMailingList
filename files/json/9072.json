{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI am trying to get the irradiance [W/m2] on an object surface by a HMI\nsource with a known cd-distribution which I was able to get from a plot\n(I read the values [cd] from the polar plot, made a IES-formatted\nluminaire description of it and converted this using ies2rad). I had put\n\"metal halide\" into the [LAMP]-line of the ies, in the hope that\nradiance would match the HMI-type then.\n\nNow I am wondering how to interpret the results. In general, I would\nassume the results of a Radiance simulation to be in W/m2, and the\nconversion to happen at the beginning, so in the lamp.tab-look-up by\nies2rad in my case. So am I correct using the results without further\nconversion, and having -m 1 -l W/m2 as falsecolor's parameters?\n\nThank you, cheers\n\nLars.\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Lars O.
