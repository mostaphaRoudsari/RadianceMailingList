I've been ignoring the problem, so haven't\ntraced the reason as for why it occurs, but it tends to manifest itself\nwith Radiance images generated in certain atypical ways: (1) HDR\nphotographs and (2) renderings using electric lighting via IES2Rad.\n\nHere is another (very basic) rendering which has the same problem on\nWindows: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/pcond_error.pic\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\nOn Mon, 20 Oct 2014 11:54:33 +0800, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141020/299bd9d4/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4ED2D21C-5F41-4748-83FB-8AF7B6CEBA6D@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
