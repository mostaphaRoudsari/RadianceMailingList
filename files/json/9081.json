This call that was hand-written by Georg Mischler was recently replaced under Microsoft's Visual-C compiler, and I think the issue is that I'm not explicitly setting the binary file type in pcond.  Schorsch's win_popen() must have done this for me without my realizing it.\n\nI have checked in the new module and it should get recompiled at some point.  My apologies, and I hope this solves the issue.\n\nIn the short term, just use the older version of pcond.  It's the same, anyway.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\nHi,\nit must be a Windows problem.\nno problems using mac or linux (head-release 3 weeks ago).\n\nJan\n\n\nAm 10/20/14, 5:06 AM, schrieb Mostapha Sadeghipour:\nHi Radiance community,\n\nAnybody else has issue running pcond in recent versions of Radiance?
