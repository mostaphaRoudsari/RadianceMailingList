{"body": "\nHi Neha!\n\n\nI do not know much details on Ecotect. If you mean any kind of\nnon-planar, specular reflector, than the standard work-flow in Radiance\nwill not lead to good results. I think there are to options if you want\nto simulate such a system using Radiance - one being the rtcontrib-tool\n(which I have never used for such tasks), the other the photon map\nextension, which is made exactly for such cases, but available only for\nRadiance 3.7 at the moment.\n\nIn any way, you would not get a visualization of single rays. I am not\nsure whether anyone ever developed some script to generate this (whould\nbe possible with rtrace by iterating through intersection points from\ngrid positions/directions). The typical target results for Radiance\nusers would be information on the illuminances reached on a work plane\nby such a system.\n\n\nAgain, this seams to be some Ecotect-specific stuff. I have no idea what\nthey use for such calculations and whether they have the required\nforward/bidirectional tracing algorithm implemented.\n\nAnother hint, many people out there use ASAP for such tasks as reflector\ndesign and analysis.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Solar Rays Tracing path", "sender": "Lars O.
