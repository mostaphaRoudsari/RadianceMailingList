Perhaps the visible component would have to be assessed first, and then the IR on a second run, after modifying the surface reflectances? Could Radiance be used like that?\n\nRichard Watkins\nKent School of Architecture\nUniversity of Kent\nKent, UK\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141022/75a26227/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Richard Watkins", "datetime": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 13:18:48 +0000"}
