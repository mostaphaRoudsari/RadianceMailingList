{"body": "\nHi,\n\nI think Lars is right, the problem is probably the sphere. Usually, when you define an IBL sky it's better to use a source object instead of a sphere (just like when you define a normal sky with gensky). That is probably also why adding the sun source is not making any difference, if you are measuring from inside the sphere (the source is outside).\nYou can try:\nenv_glow source sphereenv\n0\n0\n4 0 1 0 180   <--- (replace with appropriate vector for the chrome ball orientation, and angle covered)\nDoes this make sense, or am I missing something?\nRegards,\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nSent: Fri 20/11/2009 21:41\nTo: radiance-general\n\nHi Lars,\nYes - have tried both - and no difference. I get however an oconv warning that my srcs.rad file is empty. The experience I have with this warning is that it is related to a missing material description, which in this case is included in the Environment.rad.\n\n\noconv Environment.rad > iblmksource.oct\n\nmksource -a 0.5 iblmksource.oct > srcs.rad\n\noconv -i iblmksource.oct srcs.rad > ibl1.oct\n\n/Anne\n\nHi!\nDoes this pass oconv without error messages? I think you just need to\nremove everything in the second line except the zero here, so it becomes\n\nlum_sun source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.6410 0.5537 -0.5315 0.5323\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n--\nAnne Iversen\nGuldborgvej 44 3.th <http://3.th/>\n2000 Frederiksberg\n\nmobil: 20646857\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: not available\nType: application/ms-tnef\nSize: 5469 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091123/155cc2e7/attachment.bin\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Anne Iverse", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4D16A091CF93B04D91453602000F97C42D5BA1@eurxmb05.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<fdd7db810911201341l48dc201cm974efe244217f679@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Nov 23 04:28:18 2009", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org on behalf of Anne Iversen", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Adding the sun to image based lightingenvironment"}
