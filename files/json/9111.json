This was caused by a failed \"clean\" operation that didn't matter on the TIFF library:\n\ncd tiff; make distclean\n/bin/sh: line 0: cd: tiff: No such file or directory\nmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.\nmake: *** [clean] Error 2\n\nNevertheless, it was helpful to see some of these warnings, particularly the \"implicit declaration\" issues, which I needed to fix.  There was also a genuine bug in the ezxml code, which was likely never triggered as it had to do with an unused attribute types extension.  I fixed that one as well, even though it isn't really my code.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141026/55e220dd/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance compilation errors", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 26 Oct 2014 10:42:21 -0700"}
