Including an if sentence\nsolved this problem - and now it works perfectly!\nThanks Santiago, from a smiling Anne.\n\nIt would however be nice if the location of the sun could be rotated without\nchanging the vector coordinates. I would like this to be possible because I\nhave calculated the sun position from the pixel coordinates of my original\n.hdr image, which I afterwards have rotated. I can of course take into\naccount the rotation in the pixel coordinates, but if the other approach is\npossible it would be easier for me ;o)\n\n/Anne\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091124/65570ddb/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Anne Iversen", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<fdd7db810911241948q1da28c90pd7ead3fc4fa928ee@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Nov 24 19:48:47 2009", "email": "iversen.anne at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] RE: Re: Re: Re: Adding the sun to image basedlighting environment"}
