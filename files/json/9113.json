The nice thing about\nthe stencil method is that it generates ray origins and directions\nover a surface, instead of a fixed size grid.\n\n\nStencil could create the x,y,z,dx,dy,dz coordinates but only\nfor one half of the cylinder (the one facing you). And the\nresolution would degrade towards the edges.\n\nPerhaps you could outline your problem. Someone might have\nanother idea.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"Sensor Surfaces\"", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0911250941q258d19c7n87234e3532892b82@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4524202860667517542@unknownmsgid>", "<89355c0f0911190607v5a7803b9l2f3b4b57656dc8bc@mail.gmail.com>", "<-2159304064395356976@unknownmsgid>"], "datetime": "Wed Nov 25 09:41:41 2009", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] \"Sensor Surfaces\""}
