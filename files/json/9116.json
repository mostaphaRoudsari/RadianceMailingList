Re: [Radiance-general] rcontrib progress report\n\nYou can look at the length of each output file as an indicator of percent completion. ?A 1920x1080 picture file will be approximately 1920x1080x4 bytes long when finished. ?\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\nFolks\n\nIs there a way to know the progress of the rcontrib run? I am creating images with rcontrib, and all I can see is the 2000+ images being updated every now and then, without knowing when is this going to end.\n\nThanks\n\nEry\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141027/f067f780/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rcontrib progress report", "tags": [], "sender": "ery.mailinglist at gmail.com", "datetime": "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:52:33 -0600"}
