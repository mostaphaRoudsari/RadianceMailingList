{"body": "\nHi Marija,\n\nI was out all last week for thanksgiving.  I hope my reply is not too late\nto be helpful.\n\nI haven't done the three phase method yet. I'm validating my bsdf data and\nhave been side tracked by other projects.  But I'll get to it soon...\n\nThis can be measured via a goniophotometer, exported from LBNL Window, or\nsimulated using Trace Pro, or radiance using rtcontrib.\n\n\nThe BSDF data should be in LBNL?s window xml format.  I enquired LBNL about\nthe format in September and at that time the documentation wasn?t complete.\nI can send you the draft specification I received in September if you like\nbut it's probably worth contacting LBNL to see if documentation has\nprogressed.\n\n\nLBNL Window 6 will write an xml format bsdf file for data a window system\ndescribed in it's program.  I found it helpful to do this to reverse\nengineer the XML file format.\n\nBut... The three phase method is intended for a system that requires a bsdf\nto characterize light transport.  If your material can be characterized\nusing a standard radiance material (like a simple double/triple glazing\nwithout blinds) than the more conventional daylight coefficient approach\n(one-phase?) will be easier, faster and more accurate.\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\nOn 11/24/09 12:51 AM, \"Marija Velickovic\" <maricanis@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: Annual daylight simulations", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C7394FDF.DEC9%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Nov 30 10:33:19 2009", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: Annual daylight simulations"}
