I had started to reply regarding adjusting the height in the IES file, but maybe someone else knows a solution for the top/bottom surface problem - which would be good to know.\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nThe product I'm looking at is this:\nhttp://products.iguzzini.com/iway_round\nwhich is why I want to get rid of the top and bottom bits of the\nies2rad geometry.\n\nWhat I was hoping to be able to do with MGF is tell it what the\nfitting looks like.  In this particular case, I'd model 3 stacked\ncylinders, enclosed with a disk at the top. Only the middle cylinder\nwould act as an emitter.  Does that make sense?\n\nBest\nAxel\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometr", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 15:14:18 +0000"}
