This might be the reason why the 'corrected' and 'uncorrected'\nopen boxes produce the same results.  Equally, there is hardly any\ndownward or upward component.  Virtually all of the emitted light is\nprojected into a narrow strip.  It still seems as if the open box does\nemit a little less light than its closed brother, even with the\ncorrection in source.cal\n\nBest\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 5 November 2014 17:19, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometr", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 11:02:26 +0000"}
