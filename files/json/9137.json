{"body": "\nHi Anne!\n\nThe best for debugging is to render the scene before converting it by\nmksource. If this does not work, you know that the initial scene\ndescription has problems to get rendered.\n\nOne thing that just catches my eye, why does your sphere have a negative\nradius (-1000)? If you wanted the normals to point inside, you should\nuse a bubble object instead of a sphere object still with positive\nradius. I do not know about the effect of a negative radius at all and\nwould guess that it is not valid.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: smime.p7s\nType: application/x-pkcs7-signature\nSize: 3740 bytes\nDesc: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091121/c67ba433/smime.bin\n", "replyTo": "<fdd7db810911201341l48dc201cm974efe244217f679@mail.gmail.com>", "sender": "Lars O.
