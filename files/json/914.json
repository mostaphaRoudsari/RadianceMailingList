{"body": "\nHi Barbara,\n\nI don't recommend using the RAW format for Photosphere or hdrgen.\nSince there is no \"RAW\" standard -- RAW is a maker-specific and\nmodel-specific(!) format, conversion is necessary before it can be read\nby any other program (with few exceptions).  You only complicate your\nlife by using RAW, and some of the exposure information that\nPhotosphere and hdrgen need is usually lost in translation to JPEG or\nTIFF.\n\nI'm sorry the manual page for hdrgen is missing from the binaries that\nare currently on the anyhere site -- I'll have to fix that as soon as\nI'm able to get back on there.  (They upgraded their servers and ssh\nisn't working right now.)  I am attaching the HTML documentation for\nhdrgen for your convenience.\n\nIf you can gain access to a Mac running OS X, you'll find it much\neasier to create and calibrate HDR images with Photosphere, I bet.\n\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040601/a9b5bcd0/hdrgen.html\n-------------- next part --------------\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] conversion of digital pictures to Radiance?", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<F356B8F3-B3D2-11D8-B962-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<5.2.1.1.2.20040528150010.01f20278@pop.ansatt.ntnu.no>", "<40B63B91.5030207@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<OJEGILOIGGNAEAODNHIIOEBPCDAA.anthony.farrell@dit.ie>", "<40B63B91.5030207@ise.fraunhofer.de>", "<5.2.1.1.2.20040528150010.01f20278@pop.ansatt.ntnu.no>", "<5.2.1.1.2.20040601153049.02018ae8@pop.ansatt.ntnu.no>"], "datetime": "Tue Jun  1 15:53:03 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] conversion of digital pictures to Radiance?"}
