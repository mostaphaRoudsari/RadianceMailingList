{"body": "\nDear all\n\n\n\nin order to be able to \"scan\" a large surface which is located behind a\npartially and non-uniformly transparent surface for \"if\" direct light hits,\nI am looking for a way to have \"Sensor Surfaces\" in a Radiance model. I\nwould like to avoid having to define discrete sensor points as this would\neither require an \"infinite\" number of such points or lead to too large gaps\nin the information, IMO.\n\n\n\nI have been unable to find any reference to such a possibility. If anybody\nhere has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate them.\n\n\n\nThanks and best regards\n\nAchim\n\n\n\nYuanda-Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091119/803e21de/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Achim Geissler", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<000701ca691e$d6958920$83c09b60$@geissler@intergga.ch>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Nov 19 05:47:38 2009", "email": "achim.geissler at intergga.ch", "subject": "[Radiance-general] \"Sensor Surfaces\""}
