I have used Radiance in the past to model them, usually using the photometric files supplied by Solatube. These files assume a certain amount of luminous flux, and apply that to a blobby distribution based on a straight tube of fixed length, and certain combination(s) of lenses at either end. Obviously this characterizes a certain time step, or season (see the manufacturers' websites for details). The flux can be scaled with a script to do a crude annual simulation, which I have done in the past.\n\nAndy McNeil posted an exciting example of how you might use the new rfluxmtx tool in Radiance to do a proper climate based annual simulation based on daylight coefficients at the 2014 Radiance Workshop, which you can check out here (starting at slide 92):\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/14, 3:09 AM, \"Bhartendu Awasthi\" <bhartendu.awasthi90 at gmail.com<mailto:bhartendu.awasthi90 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nDear All,\n\nI am new to Radiance and trying to show the effect of light  pipes in daylight levels with ECOTECT and Radiance.
