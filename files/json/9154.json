I have created the building in\nECOTECT but unable to model the light pipes exactly. Is there any reference\ndocument for the same? Or if anyone can guide me in detail how to model the\nsame?\n\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\n\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nBhartendu Awasthi\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141117/d62a26f3/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "bhartendu.awasthi90 at gmail.com", "datetime": "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 15:35:13 +0530"}
