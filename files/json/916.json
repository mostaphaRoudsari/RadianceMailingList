Andersen, M. Rubin, R. Powles, J.-L. Scartezzini, Bi-directional\ntransmission properties of venetian blinds: experimental assessment compared\nto ray-tracing simulations, Solar Energy, In Press.\n\nIt discuses mainly the method to measure BRTDs, but not much about the\napplication to simulations. If somebody has more information about this\nresearch, I would also be interested to know.\nOn the other hand, to simulate blinds, would it be possible to combine a\nBRTD with a linear function that accounts for the slats? I mean, can the\nBRTDfunc be dependent on the object coordinates? just an idea, I don`t know\nif it makes much sense.\n\nRegards,\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC32870F436D68@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>", "tags": [], "sender": "Santiago Torres", "datetime": "Fri Oct 29 20:48:07 2004"}
