But I just wan to understand *each\nstep of the calculation under the hood*.\n\nI want to digest *a breakdown of the process, *maybe in the form of a shell\nscript file (Unix) or batch file (Windows), which explains each of the key\nsteps and the Radiance programs and respective parameters used, such as how\ndaylight coefficient of a given sensor is calculated and by which Radiance\nprogram, when the gendaymtx and rcontrib are used and what are their\nfunctions, and what is generated in each step and how it is used in later\nsteps, etc.\n\nI have a simple scene prepared describing a simple room with south facing\nwindow and some shading blinds. The scene file, material file and sensor\nfile are shared in the following link:\n\nMaterial definitions:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/thisisthedaviddavidson/files/materials.mat?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nscene description:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/thisisthedaviddavidson/files/scene.rad?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nsensor file:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/thisisthedaviddavidson/files/sensor.pts?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nI hope you can give me some guidances using this simple example!\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141122/5716871b/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Davidson", "datetime": "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 15:24:16 +0800"}
