Why not just have two polygons, one for the trans and one for the glass, slightly offset from one another?\n\nOn 12/17/14, 12:16 AM, \"Randolph Fritz\" <randolphf at lumald.com<mailto:randolphf at lumald.com>> wrote:\n\n\nOne of our designers proposed a detail where (if I remember correctly) an exterior layer of transparent glass is combined with an internal layer of Solera translucent material. Is there a simple way to combine the transmissivities of the two materials?\n\n\nI am almost thinking it might be better to use a different variant of Solera, just to avoid the calculation!\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Combining \"trans\" and \"glass\"", "tags": [], "sender": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "datetime": "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:35:44 +0000"}
