I know that\nMarilyne Anderson is continuing her measurement work now that she's at\nMIT.\n\nRegarding your suggestion with the BRTDfunc, if I understand you\ncorrectly, you are suggesting that it might be possible to simulate the\napprearance of slats in the model.  I agree, but I think that might\ndefeat the purpose of using such a model, as we would be reintroducing\nirregularities in the light coming through that would then require\nheavier sampling to resolve.  That is the current problem with venetian\nblind models -- it's not that Radiance can't handle the complex\ngeometry, quite the contrary.  It is simply that the slats themselves\ncause a large variance in the penetrating radiation, to the point where\nmany ray samples are needed to resolve the agregate (i.e., integrated)\nbehavior.\n\nI hope I didn't misunderstand what you were saying.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<ABEIIOCILNBBDDEPEPICKEGICDAA.tiago@tkh.att.ne.jp>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri Oct 29 22:24:57 2004"}
