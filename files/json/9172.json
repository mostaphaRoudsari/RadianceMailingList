Site layout for planning guidance from BRE in UK states that 39.6%\nis the highest value possible when using the Waldram methodology however I\nhave a model which is achieving 40/42% do I need to set anything additional\nwithin the software?  The result is going to form part of a planning\napplication therefore I need to be confident that it is correct. Any advice\nwould be welcome.\nThanks Rosemary\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20141231/1ee2be53/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Rosemary McLafferty", "datetime": "Wed, 31 Dec 2014 10:32:33 +0000"}
