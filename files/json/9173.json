{"body": "\nDear:\n\nDaylight factors are expressed as the percentage of natural light falling on\na work surface compared to that which would have fallen on a completely\nunobstructed horizontal surface under exactly the same sky conditions. Thus,\na daylight factor of 5% on an internal surface means that it received only\n1/20th of the maximum available natural light.\n\nso we can calculate daylight factor by RADIANCE with a overcast sky. Then i\ncalculated the illuminance under overcast sky. I found the distribution of\nilluminance and skyfactor in the room is different. For example, in the room\nratio of minimum to average of daylight and illuminance are quite different.\nWould you tell me the reason?\n\nBest Regards!\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091210/dc8ec60d/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Victor Li", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<be3956780912100104w3ff65086w62a4deac27a9b210@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec 10 01:04:14 2009", "email": "victorpermanent at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylight factor"}
