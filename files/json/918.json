{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nit definitely sounds funny, but I'm in need of a genuine Radiance .rtm\nmesh for testing purposes ..\n\nI cannot easily generate one myself, as the only converter I've found so\nfar is obj2mesh, but I cannot generate .obj files..\n\nNow, to speed up things, I'll ask if someone could mail me a simple demo\nmesh or an .obj file to convert into one ? (really, nothing special is\nneeded, anything out of the trash can will do :-)\n\nMany thanx in advance !!!\n\n-Carsten\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<40C3A80B.908@t-online.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jun  7 00:18:21 2004", "email": "cbauer- at t-online.de", "subject": "[Radiance-general] mesh help"}
