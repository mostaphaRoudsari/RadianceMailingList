While having the current CIE skies in gensky would certainly nice, we do not really depend on it. Philip Greenup had the models implemented in  a little cal-file (ssldlum.cal), which used to be on www.radiance-online.org in the patches-directory but disappeared with the installation of the new web-site.\n\nStill, the file is documented on page 251 of Philip's thesis (a highly recommended reading, not only that one page..). For a quick pragmatic problem-solving copy&paste will do: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15936/1/Philip_Greenup_Thesis.pdf\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150115/eb6a510f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] CIE version in gensk", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
