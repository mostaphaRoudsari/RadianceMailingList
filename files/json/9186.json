While having the current CIE skies in gensky would certainly nice, we do not really depend on it. Philip Greenup had the models implemented in  a little cal-file (ssldlum.cal), which used to be on www.radiance-online.org<http://www.radiance-online.org> in the patches-directory but disappeared with the installation of the new web-site.\n\nStill, the file is documented on page 251 of Philip's thesis (a highly recommended reading, not only that one page..). For a quick pragmatic problem-solving copy&paste will do: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15936/1/Philip_Greenup_Thesis.pdf\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nZack Rogers developed a module for Python (IES_gensky.py) that is part of SPOT and updates the gensky model.\n\nI also seem to remember that in one of the early Radiance workshops there was a reference to an updated CIE sky generator that could produce all 15 standard sky models. I don't think it ever got a public release but the source files were exchenged off-list now and then.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Mon, Nov 17, 2014 at 2:09 PM, Ehsan <em.vazifeh at gmail.com<mailto:em.vazifeh at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nHi Dr. Ward,\n\nI will happy to have latest version of sky model. I know it is time consuming to program and update the gensky but as its part of my research work, I'll be glad if I can take part in updating it.\n\nCheers,\nEhsan\n\nOn 17 Nov 2014, at 02:40, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\nHi Ehsan,\n\nThe gensky command has overcast and clear sky distributions based on an older CIE standard.  I don't remember which one, but gensky was written in the late 80's.  Subsequently in 1991 or so, I added an \"intermediate\" sky type, but I'm not sure it adheres to the newer 2002 standard.\n\nMost people who care about the sky distribution using gendaylit, but if enough people really want it, I could see about updating gensky to the current CIE standard(s).\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\nDear All,\n\nI have a lazy question, what is the latest version of CIE sky used in gensky at the moment? their latest update was in 2002 (CIE GENERAL SKY STANDARD DEFINING LUMINANCE DISTRIBUTIONS) if I am correct.\n\nCheers,\nEhsan\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150114/b793f003/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] CIE version in gensk", "tags": [], "sender": "em.vazifeh at gmail.com", "datetime": "Wed, 14 Jan 2015 22:06:57 +0000"}
