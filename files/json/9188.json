First, Peter has some translucent samples in his BME database:\n\nhttp://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/demodata/bme/\n\nThere used to be an opal glass manufactured by Schott called Opalika. Unfortunately, when I tried to get some, I found that it was hardly available any more, so I would not plan an installation with it before getting a supplier. Still, it is interesting as there is quite detailed information even about the scatter characteristics available:\n\nhttp://www.reichmann-feinoptik.de/assets/applets/opalika_phys.pdf\n\nSo this would be an example for an opal glass which is quite close to a perfect diffuser in the visible range. The peak overlaid on the plot is obviously measured in the NIR (the directional transmission increases beyond 800nm as mentioned in the text).\n\nOf course you could also get a sample of the product of your choice and have it measured, now that there are all those goniophotometers around :)\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150115/55ca221e/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<154869e6d8844513a0224704b50a20c9@mbx080-e4-va-2.exch080.serverpod.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
