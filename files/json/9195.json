If you can't change the\noptions ECOTECT uses you can run the simulation manually as Marija\nhas shown above and then read the results back into ECOTECT.\n\nMore details within:\n\nOn Sun, Dec 13, 2009 at 4:28 AM, Victor Li <victorpermanent@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nI can't see a difference between the two gensky commands below but the\n\"-B 0.558659\" will create a sky with 100 Lux diffuse vertical illuminance. This\nis very low if you want to calculate Lux values. The only reason to do this\nis that you don't have to convert from a 10000 Lux baseline to 100 Lux (or %)\nif you want to calculate daylight factors.\n\nSince both setups and scene files (skies) are the same you would\nexpect the same values for both calculations. However, your settings\nfor the rtrace command are not very accurate so the absolute results\nare going to be different. You haven't told us yet how big the difference\nis, btw.\n\n[copied from an older mail]:\n\nFor more accuracy I would use something like:\n\"-ar 128 -ab 6 -aa 0.01 -ad 2048 -as 256\"\n\nMind you, I don't know anything about your scene so these may not\nbe the right settings at all.\n\nThe remaining settings are less important in a daylight calculation\nwithout sun. I would also remove the \"-av 0.01 0.01 0.01\" because\nthat would introduce a large amount of artificial ambient light that\nis too high for you 100Lux outdoor illuminance.\n\n[...]\n\n\nThis creates a \"ground\" hemisphere that is nearly as bright as\nthe sky (about 80%).

If you want your DF values\nto mean anything you have to know the outside illuminance of the\nsky and scale all the values if it is anything else than 100 lux.\n\nHth,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylight factor", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0912130403w283efb87l3c77285a0fbb65bd@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<be3956780912100104w3ff65086w62a4deac27a9b210@mail.gmail.com>", "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE706914999@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "<be3956780912101734m3ebe9dacre2d6d1f81aee88d1@mail.gmail.com>", "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7069150E5@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "<be3956780912122028o2c29bc2ajb206fd55c015cfb9@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Dec 14 09:17:13 2009", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Daylight factor"}
