{"body": "\nHi Rob,\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nThe bogus material error is caused by the function preload_objs(),\nwhich goes through and loads all the auxiliary data (including .cal\nfiles) for all scene objects, whether referenced or not.  This\nfunction is called by any of the shared-memory parallel execution\nmodes to maximize static shared data, thereby minimizing system memory\nuse.  The same thing would happen with the -PP option.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] New rtrace -n option", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1DBFDECA-E8BD-42CF-81EF-C0D345C3AE1C@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<C74D5D85.1894%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Tue Dec 15 15:20:48 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] New rtrace -n option"}
