Might be better to just try asking your system where it thinks your installed binaries are, e.g., \"which rpict\" should print the full path location of rpict on your system, like:\n\n$which rpict\n/usr/local/bin/rpict\n\nIf that command returns nothing, then your system doesn't know where Radiance is (which seems to be what the benchmark script is saying too). Double check that your paths are set properly, and that you are running the benchmark script from a NEW terminal window, not the one you used to compile Radiance and set the paths.\n\n\n\n\nOn 1/20/15, 9:04 AM, \"Brian Karr\" <brianakarr at yahoo.com<mailto:brianakarr at yahoo.com>> wrote:\n\nI believe you can just delete the install directories to start from new.

I will give it a try.\n\nHow do I deinstall Radiance to set it a new? I see only the unpacked folder. Is it just by deleting the folder - i guess that would be too easy to be true//\n\n\n\n-------- ?????????? ????? --------\n??: \"Brian Karr\" brianakarr at yahoo.com<mailto:brianakarr at yahoo.com>\n???????: Re: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n??: \"'Radiance general discussion'\" <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\n????????? ??: 20.01.2015 17:46\nNot sure if this applies, when I installed on Mac this thread helped:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000221.html\n\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, January 20, 2015 10:02 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nDear all,\n\nI wanted to install on Mac/Yosemite/ Radiance\nrad4R2supp.tar.gz\n\nXcode is installed and updated for compatibility with OS Yosemite*\n\nfollowing the instruction :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68#t=137\nI believe I have done something wrong installing it:\n\n#after setting the Raypath , Path and Manpath as in the video\n#I have unpacked benchmark\n#typed  :make (command)// \"i have one processor\"\n\nand experienced the following error\n\n\n------------------\n\nCHANGES\n\n2010-12-01  MJS  reworked Makefile and options so that same code will\n\nwork on any version of Radiance going back ~5 years\n\n2011-03-24  MJS  removed \"-pm 0.0\" from optionsbase because rpiece throws\n\nan error in 4R1\n\nNiyas-iMac:bench4 niya$ make\n\n/bin/sh: rpict: command not found\n\n/bin/sh: rpict: command not found\n\nrm -f serial.unf\n\ntime rpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o serial.unf scene.oct\n\nrpict: No such file or directory\n\n0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys\n\nmake: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n\n--------------\n\n\n\nHow do you solve such problem in order to proceed with installing Radiance on Mac?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nNiya\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<003201d034ca$b81eaa80$285bff80$@yahoo.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "thodor at abv.bg", "datetime": "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 16:29:10 +0000"}
