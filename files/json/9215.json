It is also tricky to separate components, such as distinguishing what came from building surfaces from the sky component.  Again, there are ways to accomplish it, but it's an advanced task and there would definitely be some debugging involved.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150120/c00d6d57/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CABr=F_jnVW_tO+zRPdXeA9dtcgh2LZKjNJYymONMcYf3BxzL0g@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 20:51:34 -0800"}
