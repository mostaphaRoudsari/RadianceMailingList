Or can you suggest a modeling\napproach to answer this question?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nGiuseppe.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150122/6f7aedae/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Giuseppe De Michele", "datetime": "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 17:28:27 +0100"}
