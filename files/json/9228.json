{"body": "\nRadiance Group,\n\nUsing pcomb it's possible add images together.\n\nIs it possible to combine ambient files in a similar way?\n\nI'm running a simulation on a Cygwin (windows) computer.  Windows won't let us share the ambient file, so creating multiple views of large scenes takes longer to do, as processors sit idle. Is it possible to run multiple rpicts of the same octree, each one with a different view and associated ambient file, and then add the ambient files together for use in future runs?\n\nThank you for your thoughts.\n\nMark de la Fuente\n\n[{--Wm.
