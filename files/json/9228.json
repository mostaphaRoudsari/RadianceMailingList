You would probably need to model the courtyard as \"indoor\" with a very transparent roof, however. Long wave exchange can be tracked in ESP-r with quite high detailing. Possibly, you could also answer the solar question with ESP-r (separating \"reflection\" from \"direct/diffuse solar\" is probably also tricky, if actually necessary and likely a question of designing a few \"experiments\"). I am not entirely sure, though, how detailed reflections in closed spaces are followed (they are, to some degree). You can couple ESP-r with Radiance and if your material properties are \"solar\" and not \"visual\", I would expect that you could get a very good idea of what is happening in your space of interest.\n\nA CFD package may be the alternative approach. However, I am not aware of any specific package in which solar reflection may be handled sufficiently. Long wave exchange should be covered O.K. One other possible source of a modelling package I am aware of could be Physibel (Belgium). They have tools that may cover your requirements.\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\nOn Jan 21, 2015, at 5:51 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\nachim.geissler at intergga.ch\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150125/53b3a6ac/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<9C0C0801-DDD4-4024-B0BC-6C0326948E26@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Achim Geissler", "datetime": "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 17:58:07 +0100"}
