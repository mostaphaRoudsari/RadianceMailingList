So I use an\nimage, apply normpat to it (so the average pixel value is one) and use it as\ncolorpict on a well defined material.\n\nSo the question of defining accurate physical properties remains in the\nmaterials' definitions. I use \"calibrated\" pictures for these, too, but of\ncourse you could use any RELIABLE source of information for these. In fact,\nthere are better ways to measure reflectance than calibrated photo scans...\n\nI have no idea about the reliability of the materials defined in\nlightscape's libraries. Also you need to find out the definition of\nLightscape rgb (what does it mean as material properties?). That is a real\nLightscape question, the definition of the values that must be supplied in\nradiance are well documented in \"Rendering with Radiance\" as well as in the\nincluded documentation.\n\nThe other way to use image maps, I asked about some months ago on this list,\nwas to use colored image maps with defined materials. It seams to be to hard\ntoo achieve valid results that way too me, so I didn't try any more. The\nthird is too have calibrated image maps on a neutral material, so that the\nreflectance is ONLY defined by the picture values, but as I understood that\nis not the way you want to / can go.\n\nGood luck, CU, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars Grobe", "datetime": "Sat Oct 30 01:26:35 2004"}
