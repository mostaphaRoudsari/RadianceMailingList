{"body": "\nGreg and Rob.  Thanks, I will check out both tools.  After sending out my e-mail, I went ahead and tried to share the ambient file just for fun.  Now I've got 8 cores working on one ambient file (which is growing) and so far no errors after a few hours and many images...  In the past I don't think I've been able to do this.  Maybe having all cores in one machine rather than running multiple machines makes a difference!\n\nMark\n\n[{--Wm.
