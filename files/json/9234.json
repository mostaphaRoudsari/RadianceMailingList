{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nRob is basically right.  There is an even simpler method, though.  So\nlong as the ambient file was written correctly, you can append it from\nanother source using getinfo to remove the header:\n\ngetinfo - < machine2.amb >> machine1.amb\n\nIf you are concerned that one or the other ambient file may not be\ncomplete, the safer method is lookamb:\n\n(lookamb -d machine1.amb ; lookamb -h -d machine2.amb) | lookamb -r >\ncombined.amb\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Combining Ambient Files", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<2013A2AD-CF2B-4727-9D6E-DCD3838047E2@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<C7564D77.199C%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Tue Dec 22 10:15:30 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Combining Ambient Files"}
