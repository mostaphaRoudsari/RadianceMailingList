So much for what I thought\nI knew about -ar... It turns out you can get a pretty nice -aa 0 rendering\nwith today's newer machines in about the same time a \"traditional\" run\n(complete with sampling artifacts) would take on 7-8 year old hardware...\nIt's a bit of an apples to oranges test, but interesting to see\nadvancements in hardware performance reducing the need for indirect\ncalculation optimization.\n\nChris, it's a 3000px rendering pfilted down to 1000px. I'll test out a\nlarger resolution too and see if the artifacts scale with the increased\niamge size.\n\nThanks!\nMM\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 27, 2015 at 6:10 AM, Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150127/163d1013/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] pure monte carlo rendering tips", "tags": [], "sender": "Mike Martinez", "datetime": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 13:21:03 -0800"}
