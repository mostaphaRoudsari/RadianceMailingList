{"body": "\nHi Olga,\n\nIt seems you did misunderstand a bit.  Rtrace is the underlying\ncomputational engine that permits the holodeck interactive program to\noperate.  Rtrace does the raw ray-tracing, and the holodeck program\nhandles user interaction and display update.  For more details on\nrunning rholo, see the manual page at:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rholo.1.html\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\nHi!\n\nIn the paper 'The Holodeck Interactive Ray Cache' the authors describe\namongs other things how the command rtrace is working. As far as I\nunderstood, it is possible to interact with the virtual environment\nusing a mouse while running this command. Unfortunately I haven't\nmanaged yet to see anything while running rtrace even for 2 hours. The\noctree-file I am using is not that huge (5,2 MB), so I thing I am not\nusing the right options of rtrace (or I misunderstood the whole thing\ncompletely). Which options I am supposed to use to run the program\ninteractively? What would be an example command line?\n\nThanks!\n\nOlga Graf\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace-command", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1DD990A6-BA31-11D8-883B-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<E1BY5Xp-0003qO-DE@www11.emo.freenet-rz.de>"], "datetime": "Wed Jun  9 18:22:23 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] rtrace-command"}
