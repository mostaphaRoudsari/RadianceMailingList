The elliptic orbit results in a periodically varying speed\nof the earth along it's path around the sun, which changes the length of\nthe solar day, i.e the time from one culmination to another. Overlayed\non this is b), the fact that the sun doesn't move along the projected\nearth equator ('ecliptic') in the sky, but changes it's height during a\nyear.\n\nPeople in the stone age didn' t have this problem, they still could live\nwith that (roughly) +/- 15 min time difference (max. amplitude for mean\nlatitudes around 50?, compared to a mean solar time of exact 24 hours)\nduring a years period. They didn't have to bother about computers and\nRadiance parameters also...\n\n-cb\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Sat Oct 30 17:11:57 2004"}
