I don't know whether it would be better to document this in the man page or change the code so that back of uniform receivers do not accumulate energy.  Is this important in your application?\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150129/ba726588/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] strange rfluxmtx behavior", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 13:40:20 -0800"}
