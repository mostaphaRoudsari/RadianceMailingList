I tried to use TRANS equations\nto derive the parameters I needed, but it did not seem to work. I think\nTRANS properties vary with the angle of incidence?? (the percentaje of\nspecular transmission does no change with different angles of incidence in\na perforated screen)\n\nI ended up using a mixture between VOID and a Plastic material, on which I\nvaried the percentage of \"Void\"... I am not sure, maybe that trick would\nalso help modelling trees.\n\nAm I correct? Is, what I did, legally from the physical laws of lighitng?\n\nTHANKS\n\nGerm?n\n\n2015-02-05 8:52 GMT-03:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150205/071ed305/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "=?UTF-8?Q?Germ=C3=A1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 09:30:30 -0300"}
