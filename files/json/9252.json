{"body": "\nHi Coralie,\n\nI was thinking the same thing as Jack, is it possible to have different\ntransmission for each side?  And even more puzzling, is it possible for a\nsubstance to absorb five times more light in one direction compared to the\nother?  Perhaps you could tell us how these values were measured?\n\nUsing your values for the exterior side I get the following trans definition\n(including sr=0.1):\n\nvoid trans transmat\n0\n0\n7 0.887 0.959 0.959 0.000 0.100 0.917 0.108\n\nIf you change your Td from 75.5 to 0.755 I think your results will agree\nwith mine.\n\nUsing your values for the interior side I get a trans definition with values\nfor A2 and A3 that are out of range, so something isn't quite right.  Again\nI think we could help if your shared your method for measuring your\ntranslucent panel.\n\nBest,\nAndrew\n\n\nOn 12/17/09 6:08 AM, \"Jack de Valpine\" <jedev@visarc.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] translucent panel ( trans material )", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C7500246.E209%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec 17 15:44:23 2009", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] translucent panel ( trans material )"}
