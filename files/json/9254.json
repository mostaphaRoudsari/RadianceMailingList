Can you advise on how\nto specify the funcfile to define the pattern and proportion of mixing of\nvoid and plastic materials?\n\nTo Compagnon: Thank you for the square-root reminder!\n\nTo Christopher and Greg: Thanks for the tip on mist! Can we imagine the\ntree object modeled in this way as a hollowed sphere whose surface is\ncomposed of a texture with an \"alternating void and plastic\" pattern, and\nthe inside of the sphere is filled with a lump of \"mysterious\" fog ...?\n\n\nOn Fri, Feb 6, 2015 at 8:14 AM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150206/d109dae3/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modeling trees in Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Joe Smith", "datetime": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 16:55:47 +0800"}
