{"body": "\nHi Andy,\n\nI followed your link and studied the description of the material GLASS in\nthe rayfront manual (see below).\nI found, that GLASS is a special form of dielectric for modelling a thin\nglas pane without internal reflections within the glas pane itself.\nGLASS produces one ray, which is transmitted, and a second ray, which is\nreflected - so far, so good.\n\nNow my question: I am looking for a diagram or an equation of GLASS, which\nshows the angle-dependancies.\nIt is well known, that with more normal incidence transmission of rays is\nincreasing and reflection is decreasing;\nwith more sloped incidence angle transmission of rays decreases and\nrefelctions increases ....\n\nWhere can I find a documentation about this angle dependancies of the\nmaterial GLASS ?\n\n-Gunter\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org]On Behalf Of Andrew\nMcNeil\nSent: Friday, December 11, 2009 5:35 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\nHi Victor,\n\nTransmisivity is the amount of light NOT absorbed in one pass through the\nglazing.  Glass is a special case of dielectric optimized for glass that\naccounts for angular dependence of transmission and inter-reflection between\nfront and back surfaces  (but is only modeled as a single surface in\nradiance).  The reason for using transmissivity I believe is related to the\ndesire to maintain a valid input range of 0-1 for the parameters instead of\nsomething like 0 - 0.92.\n\nYou can find the equation to get transmisivity given transmittance at the\nbottom of this page:\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/dielectricdef.html\n<http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/dielectricdef.html>\n\nA glazing with reported VLT of 0.325 has a transmisivity of 0.354 so the\nmaterial definition would be as follows:\nvoid glass glazing.325\n0\n0\n3  0.354  0.354  0.354\n\nAnd your other question - The first three parameters of trans is color which\naffect transmission and reflection.  Trans does not include inter-reflection\nor angular transmission properties exhibited by glass so the input values\nare transmission.\nAlso on this page there is a nice diagram describing how trans works:\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html\n<http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html>\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/10/09 7:22 PM, \"Victor Li\" <victorpermanent@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n\nSorry i made a mistake. I just want to compare the glass 3     0.325 0.325\n0.325  and trans 7     0.325 0.325 0.325 0 0 1 1 (not 0.3).\n\nIn trans, the  transmissive specularity is 1 which means the total daylight\ntransmitted through the material will be specularly transmitted, like glass.\nSo i defined the   transmissive specularity is 1.\n\nActually i had a look the webpage and i define the trans followed the\ninstruction in the page.\n\nNote also that the Radiance glass material uses \"transmissivity\" not\ntransmittance,\nso does trans use \"transmittance\" in the first three paremeters? What is the\ndifference between transmittance and transmissivity?\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n<http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general>\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\n\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091217/82d1a3dd/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<D30F19CCD96EF64BB816E0D0D7CADCF87F8E3D@smex02.mbbm.de>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec 17 02:12:56 2009", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?"}
