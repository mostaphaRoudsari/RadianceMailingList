I wonder if there\nis an easier way to address this issue?\n\nA smarter solution is probably to create a smaller part of the panel and\ncopy it around (which is what I'm going to do next) but I wanted to make\nsure that I need to do so.\n\nThanks,\nMostapha\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150209/f0d837a0/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "datetime": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 15:24:27 -0500"}
