But it\nis not the same as glass.\n\n\nThe most obvious one is that \"glass\" is a specialised \"dielectric\"\nmaterial type which modulates the reflection according to the\nangle and refraction index of the material. So if you want to\nreflections/refractions of glass with another material you should\nstart with \"dielectric\" not \"trans\"\n\nThe \"window.0.325\" material defined above has not specularity\nand no roughness. The glass material has a visible specularity.\nJust create a small test scene with a bubble of glass/trans and\na light source (like the sun) and you will see the difference.\n\nIf you don't care about the particular refraction of glass and\nspecular refraction and only focus on VTL you could say the\nmaterials are similar or equal depending on your use.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f0912130551k1adc7bb7xbec31cc9ae3414c4@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<C746ABC7.17B2%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<20091211173544.130480@gmx.net>", "<be3956780912121936g20460bafm62105762f255a1f5@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Dec 14 09:17:07 2009", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] material trans and glass?"}
