If I add the line NROWS=81 (number of sensor points) manually in the header, I do get results. But I'm trying to run the simulation for a lot of windows so adding this line each time manually or with a script is a bit painful. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?\n\nAdditionally, when I try to run dctimestep in annual mode, using the following command:\ndctimestep -n 8760 viewpts_00.mtx grate.xml daylight_00.mtx annual.smx > test.dat\nI get:\n'fatal - unexpected EOF reading annual.smx'\neven though my annual.smx has 146 rows (for all 146 Tregenza daylight patches) and 8760 columns.\n\nAny idea what is going wrong here?\n\nMany thanks,\nReinier\n\n\n\n\nReinier Zeldenrust\nEnvironmental Designer\nAtelier Ten\nEnvironmental Design Consultants + Building Services Engineers\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "datetime": "Fri, 20 Feb 2015 11:59:55 +0000"}
