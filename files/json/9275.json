{"body": "\nHi...\n\n\nThe cause of confusion was the typo in the original email. The original aim of the experiment was to compare glass and trans for the same set-up (so the question could arise why results were not the same). This comparision is only possible for clear glass. I tried to express that, as far as I understood, trans is not ment for this case, and I would not expect 100% identical results.\n\nHowever, it may be interesting to have a comparision of the three modifiers\n\n- glass\n- dielectric\n- trans\n\nto really quantify the variance for a given scene. Maybe for only direct calculation, and then for some ambient bounces. I will take a look at my copy of RwR to see where to expect differences. However, we do not even know how far off the two results were, so the discussion is a bit lacking of the numbers.\n\nCheers,\n\nLars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?", "sender": "Lars Grobe", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<20091211173544.130480@gmx.net>", "refs": ["<C746ABC7.17B2%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>"], "datetime": "Fri Dec 11 09:35:49 2009", "email": "grobe at gmx.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] material trans and glass?"}
