{"body": "\nHi Victor,\n\nTransmisivity is the amount of light NOT absorbed in one pass through the\nglazing.  Glass is a special case of dielectric optimized for glass that\naccounts for angular dependence of transmission and inter-reflection between\nfront and back surfaces  (but is only modeled as a single surface in\nradiance).  The reason for using transmissivity I believe is related to the\ndesire to maintain a valid input range of 0-1 for the parameters instead of\nsomething like 0 - 0.92.\n\nYou can find the equation to get transmisivity given transmittance at the\nbottom of this page:\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/dielectricdef.html\n\nA glazing with reported VLT of 0.325 has a transmisivity of 0.354 so the\nmaterial definition would be as follows:\nvoid glass glazing.325\n0\n0\n3  0.354  0.354  0.354\n\nAnd your other question - The first three parameters of trans is color which\naffect transmission and reflection.  Trans does not include inter-reflection\nor angular transmission properties exhibited by glass so the input values\nare transmission.\nAlso on this page there is a nice diagram describing how trans works:\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/10/09 7:22 PM, \"Victor Li\" <victorpermanent@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091211/cf9dacc8/attachment-0001.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] material trans and glass?", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C747B4B7.E0D5%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Dec 11 08:36:56 2009", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] material trans and glass?"}
