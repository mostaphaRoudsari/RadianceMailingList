If you have complete spectral information for the sky, you can perform a multi-pass spectral calculation by substituting the appropriate components and material reflectances/transmittances for your subdivided spectrum.  There are a few posts related to this in the list archives.  Try searching on \"spectral\".\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating CRI and CC", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 11:10:08 -0800"}
