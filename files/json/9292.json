This mesh must be closed, watertight, and non-intersecting, and\nwill appear to be of constant \"cloud\" density. It helps considerably\nif it's in the shape of a cloud. It can look something like this:\nhttp://markjstock.org/graphics/ray/clouds04.jpg\n\nThe other method allows varying density throughout the cloud, but is a\nlot more work. It consists of creating a large number of small,\nnon-overlapping cubes (a dense matrix of cubes with small spaces\nbetween them), each with a different mist material applied to them.\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/img2_00.jpg\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/img3_01.jpg\n\nThese options seemed to create the most cloud-like volumes (with\nclouds of size 1 and mist \"voxels\" of size ~0.01):\n-ma 0.95 0.95 0.95 -mg 0.05 -ms 0.001\n\nMark\n\n\nOn 2/22/15, Eduardo Artigas <eduardoartigas at yahoo.es> wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling a cloud", "tags": [], "sender": "Mark Stock", "datetime": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 14:36:28 -0500"}
