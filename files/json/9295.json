{"body": "\n\n\n\nDear list members,\n\nI use HDRShop to convert between mappings for environment maps, e.g.,\nfrom mirror ball to lat-long, etc.\n\nI now have two other mappings that I wish to convert to lat-long (though\nI realize that both mappings will only give me half a sphere, e.g., top\nhalf of lat-long map).\n\n1) An image taken with a Sigma 8mm 180 degree field-of-view fish eye\nlens to take a high-res image of the sky (same hemispherical mapping as\nRADIANCE renders into when using the -vth option for rview/rpict)\n\n2) An image of a diffuse hemi-sphere (diameter of 0.3 meters, turned out\non a lathe) spray painted with a diffuse grey\n\n\nI am convinced that both mappings are identical (i.e. identical to the\nhemi-spherical projection model in RADIANCE). So far I have used the\n'mirrorball closeup' format in HDRShop but found this to be the wrong\nmapping yielding incorrect lat-long mappings. I have now understood the\nentire geometrical issue and just need a piece of software to warp\nhemisphere images to lat-longs ... perhaps a plugin for HDRShop?\n\nA couple of years ago I raised this issue with the people who wrote\nHDRShop but they claimed the Sigma lens should be treated as mirror ball\ncloseup when re-mapping in HDRShop. I am now convinced this is not true\nafter having tested it  extensively.\n\nSincerely,\nClaus\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: cbm.vcf\nType: text/x-vcard\nSize: 354 bytes\nDesc: not available\nUrl : http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091207/95f0f225/cbm.vcf\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Claus B.
