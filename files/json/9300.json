{"body": "\nHi Bei,\n\nThe command:\n\n% obj2rad test.obj | getbbox\n\nreturns:\nxmin      xmax      ymin      ymax      zmin      zmax\n-1.58231   1.51769   18.3588   21.4588  0.949999      4.05\n\nFrom this, you can deduce that the sphere has a radius of 3.1 and is\ncentered at the average of the above coordinates, or (-.0323, 19.9,\n2.5).  You can also run objview on the output of obj2rad (after adding\na material) and look at it.\n\nIn general, we discourage people from posting attachments to the\nmailing list, but this one was pretty small so hopefully it won't\ncause any trouble.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: spatial scale in .obj file", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C6212EB4-79C3-4DDC-9589-2FBF17D63ABF@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<a38244780912041831w652c41e8s85077bb888396d62@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Sat Dec  5 09:06:24 2009", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: spatial scale in .obj file"}
