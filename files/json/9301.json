As ambient parameters options I have used:\n\n-ab 12 -ad 50000 -as 2048 -ar 1024 -lw 1e-8 (following the 3-phase method\ntutorial).\n\nOtherwise, I think that the dropping of UDI due to the increasing of room\ndepth is not a strange effect. This because the contribute of the rays\nrefracted from the bottom wall is smaller.\n\n\nConsidering the ?ab 12, it can be that the reflectance of the inner walls\nand ceiling have a bigger impact compared with the systems as you said.\n\n\nI suppose that also the dimension of the upper window, compared with the\nlower one, does not have a great influece on the inner illuminance values.\nHere the dimension http://s5.postimg.org/ezlt60cp3/lab.jpg.\n\n\nThe goal of this work it is to analyze the daylight level in a deep room\nusing a system of daylight redirecting. Therefore, I would like to have an\neffect of the shading system after 4 meters.\n\nMaybe I have to test different systems in order to reach the effects\nexpected.\n\n\nAnother question: Considering the characteristics of a real product I have\ncreated this material for the light shelf\n\nvoid metal shelf_mat\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5  0.98 0.98 0.98  0.96 0.01\n\nCan it be realistic? Do you suggest to use also a mirror on the shelf\nand/or on the ceiling?\n\n\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\nGiuseppe\n\n2015-02-24 16:00 GMT+01:00 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>:\n\n\n\n--\n*Giuseppe De Michele*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150225/0fe47d33/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF6199823627365C68@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Giuseppe De Michele", "datetime": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 15:35:28 +0100"}
