{"body": "\nHi all,\n\nDoes someone has an experience with parallel rtrace processes execution\nwithin rtcontrib program?\nThis is set with -n option in rtcontrib, which in child rtrace processes\nuses -PP option.\n\nIt works perfectly in Linux, but I couldn't make it work in Windows.\n\nFor command like this:\nrtcontrib -n 2  -I+ -V- -h-  -b tbin -o outfile.txt -m sky  -f tregenza.cal\n@param.opt octree.oct < points.txt\n\nI've got errors:\nbin/rtrace: fatal - command line error at '-PP'\nrtcontrib: system - select call error in wait_rproc()\nbin/rtrace: fatal - command line error at '-PP'\n\nIf started without -n option rtcontrib works without problems in both OS.\n\nSince in Windows I'm using Francesco's MinGW Radiance binaries, I suspected\nthat my binaries aren't up to date.\nI downloaded current Radiance version from CVS and rebuild all programs with\nscons in Windows.\nAfter that error remains the same, and -PP option in rtrace is not\nrecognized.\n\nGreg suggested that is could be a problem with file locking, but no idea how\nto solve this.\nMaybe some variables/flags should be set during compilation on Windows!?\n\nAny suggestions are welcome,\nMarija\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20091203/8b3044a8/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<124b40400912030328t7d4cfef7kf832909ba934710f@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Dec  3 03:28:29 2009", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Parallel processes within rtcontrib"}
