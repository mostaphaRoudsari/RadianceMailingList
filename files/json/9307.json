I searched then for some tilted files but there are\nnot existing for my luminaries.\nCan I ask, If there is any programe to tilt the actuall IES file and than\nput it into Radiance or is there any possibility to rotate or tilt an IES\nfile in Radiance ? Any tips and hints?\n\nThanks a lot\nKind regards,\n\nPeter Zatko\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150302/ab44af0e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?UTF-8?B?UGV0ZXIgWmHFpWtv?=", "datetime": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 09:04:41 +0000"}
