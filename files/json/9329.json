The program isn't smart enough to group them for you, and I suppose this requirement needs to be mentioned explicitly in the man page.  That was an oversight on my part...\n\nIf your receiver surfaces are already grouped by modifier and you are getting this error, send me your files off-list and I will see if I can figure out what's going on.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150312/768e3650/attachment-0001.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 133, Issue 8\n************************************************\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 133, Issue 8", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "datetime": "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 14:22:16 -0400"}
