If the real scene and\nthe HDR are within a certain precentage of each other, do you call them\nsynonomous?  I'd love to hear others weigh in on this topic.\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgen", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40C87CA1.1050609@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F90FAF5C6@l-gnts05>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 17:21:23 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgen"}
