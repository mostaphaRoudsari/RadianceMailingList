This is a new \"feature\" of dctimestep to simplify operation and make it more consistent with the behavior of other tools.  The default output of gendaymtx now produces a header, unless the -h option is used.\n\nAs for the bad bin number, the latest HEAD should report the number being ignored.  There may have been other fixes to the software since then, however, and it would be a good idea to get current with the latest HEAD.  If you get the error again, at least it will report the number so we can figure out what's happening.\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150324/a0a847ba/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] dctimestep fatal error", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 09:31:45 -0700"}
