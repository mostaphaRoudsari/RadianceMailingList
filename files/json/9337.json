I am using DIVA for Rhino simulation interface for\nRadiance simulation. I am representing the glass as a single surface in the\nmodel.\n\nI am struggling to come up with the Transmitted specularity(Ts), Diffuse\nTransmission(Td) , Reflected specularity(Rs) and the Diffuse reflectance\n(Cr, Cg,Cb) , so as to calculate the A1 to A7 trans material values.\n\nAny suggestion or pointers on how to estimate or get the above values?\n\nfor example, I have the following frit glass assembly with 60% coverage\nthat I pulled form glass manufacture website.\n\n1/4\" (6mm) clear VE-85 #2 and 60% Coverage V175 #2\n\n1/2\" (13.2mm) argon space\n\n1/4\" (6mm) clear\n\n\nAppreciate your help!\n\n\nBest,\n\n--\nAditya Potipireddi,\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150405/50cb948e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Aditya Potipireddi", "datetime": "Sun, 5 Apr 2015 22:57:37 -0700"}
