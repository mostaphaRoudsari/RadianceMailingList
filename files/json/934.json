{"body": "\nHi Martin,\n\nTo get a reasonable fit to a particular camera, Photosphere (or hdrgen)\nneeds more than just a few exposures.  I find that it likes at least 7\nexposures, better 9,  of a wide dynamic-range scene.  Each exposure\nshould be separated by an f-stop or so by varying the shutter speed\nonly.  This is explained in the Photosphere quickstart_pf.txt file,\nwhich I have quoted on this list recently.  (See my response to Barbara\nMatusiak on May 28 under the subject \"conversion of digital pictures to\nRadiance?\")  Once you have established the response function for a\nparticular camera, you can then reuse it for a shorter exposure\nsequence, or even a single image (though you should not expect a high\ndynamic-range result in that case).  This storage and reuse is\naccomplished with hdrgen's -r option, or via the preferences file in\nPhotosphere.\n\nIf the algorithm cannot arrive at a reasonable response function for\nyour camera, Photosphere offers the option of applying a generic\nresponse function, instead.  Although I don't recommend this if your\ngoal is accuracy, the following response file will permit hdrgen a\nsimilar fall-back using the -r option:\n\n2 1 0 0\n2 1 0 0\n2 1 0 0\n\nThis simply assigns each channel the polynomial f(x) = x^2, which\nroughly corresponds to a standard gamma curve.  It's really a crude\napproximation, but since you are taking overlapping exposures, the\nglobal errors in the mid-exposure region are reasonably small.\n\nBy the way, I managed to convert both your sequences without complaints\nin Photosphere, though the three-image sequence is a bit blurry.\nObviously, the alignment algorithm didn't quite work on this one.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't know when it's failed, so no errors or\nwarnings are issued in most cases.\n\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  In response to Pillo's inquiry, the luminance reported by ximage\nshould correspond roughly to the luminance you would measure with a\nphotometer, accounting for the photopic response of the probe's filter.\nHowever, you are definitely better off measuring something as close to\nwhite as possible, and preferably not a light source -- something more\nin the middle of the exposure range, like a grey card.  The latest\nversion of Photosphere even includes a calibration option to make this\nwork easier.\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgen", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1DC88052-BAF2-11D8-89E2-000A95BB392A@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<200406101420.10983.alex@juventuz.net>"], "datetime": "Thu Jun 10 17:23:33 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Fwd: errors from hdrgen"}
