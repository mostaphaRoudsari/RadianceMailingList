I am tying to follow to the process\noutlined and have couple of more questions:\n\n1) Since I am using radiance using DIVA for Rhino( Windows operating\nsystem), it creates a Radiance folder with in the DIVA folder. I navigated\nto the radiance folder via command prompt window and tried to call for \"\nglaze\" it gave error as glaze is not recognized. I have even installed the\nRadiance versions 4.3.a.2 for win32.exe that I downloaded form NREL\nradiance releases. Is there a command error ?\n\n2) The \"lib\" folder under both Radiance folders has only glaze.1cal( single\npane fritted) and glaze2.cal(double pane fritted) files , there is no\n\"glaze\" file are these the same as glaze file?\n\n2) does the example work flow example in the website use unix or cygwin, if\nso do i need to install cygwin? and is there specific version of radiance\nthat i need to install ?\n\n4) can I not execute glaze and optics2glazedb via windows?\n\n3) Should the \"optics2glazedb\" file put in a specific location and where\ndoes the generated database get written to. Also, what is the file\nextension for optics2glazedb ?\n\nAppreciate your help and input.\n\nRegards,\n\nAditya\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 6, 2015 at 12:24 PM, Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n--\nAditya Potipireddi, LEED AP\n480.544.4936\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150406/1bf4a670/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Frit Glass trans Paramters", "tags": [], "sender": "Aditya Potipireddi", "datetime": "Mon, 6 Apr 2015 17:00:45 -0700"}
