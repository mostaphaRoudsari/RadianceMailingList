I found this previous discussion on email list (\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007983.html)\nbut I'm not still clear about the whole workflow. I break up the question\ninto 3:\n\n1. Is it possible to generate the sky just for UV radiation? or is it\npossible to generate the sky for an specific wavelength range? I understand\nthat gendaylit does provide the full spectrum but how can can I filter out\nthe values for UV?\n\n2. In case I can generate the filtered sky (question 1), does it effect the\nRadiance calculation for light transmittance? I assume as far as I input\nthe correct number (UV transmittance) the calculation should be accurate.\n\n3. Can/should I use BSDF materials in this case? Does BSDF materials\ninclude information for UV wavelength? and how does this will work with the\nsky (question 1). As an alternate method, and in case I can't filter the\nsky, I was thinking to modify BSDF material and make it opaque for all the\nwave-lengths except UV?\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150407/23b7ca26/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "datetime": "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 13:18:42 -0400"}
