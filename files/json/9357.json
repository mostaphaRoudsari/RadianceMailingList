{"body": "\nHi Victor!\nHm, I still do not get why these two programs could be related.\nI guess this is a typo, and what you actually type in is in small\nletters (rad 5.rif?). What is the result of this, I think there is no\nview given in your RIF. Is there any result from the run of rad? I would\nexpect nothing to happen, as rad has nothing to do?\n\nHow is this related to your rad-call? Why do you have this low\nar-setting? Where are all these values derived from?\n\n\nDelete your RIF-file. Run the rtrace-command with the same parameters\n(maybe increase the ar first) several times, and compare the output in\n5.dat.\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"INDIRECE\"in .rif file", "sender": "Lars O.
