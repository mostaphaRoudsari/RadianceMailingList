{"body": "\nHi Axel,\n\nThis is really a bug.  Total computes products by converting to a log\ndomain, which of course doesn't work for zero.  I can fix this\nproblem, and will do so in the next release.\n\nCheers for pointing it out.\n-Greg\n\nP.S.  The reason for converting to log is that it allows geometric\nmeans to be computed for almost any set of numbers, which would\noverflow a straight product.\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] total -p and zeroes", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1C664345-0127-4544-967F-D446FCD75A3E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4b5b5562.aa13f30a.77e2.ffff9f3eSMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>", "<4B631225.2040107@gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Jan 29 09:08:03 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] total -p and zeroes"}
