I currently have Autocad 2007 and the free\nversion of Google Sketchup on my computer.  I'd like to be able to use\nSketchup to create the 3D geometry for importing into Daysim, but I\ncan't export to 3ds.  Autocad 2007 doesn't export either.\n\nI tried downloading the 3DsExport for Sketchup plugin, but it doesn't\nseem to handle the materials files well enough for an import to Daysim.\n\nI'd appreciate if anyone can let me know their methods for using some\ncombination of this software.\n\nThanks,\n\n--\nKaren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nBldg-sim mailing list\nhttp://lists.onebuilding.org/listinfo.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list send  a blank message to\nBLDG-SIM-UNSUBSCRIBE@ONEBUILDING.ORG\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100128/63bc1932/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: [Bldg-sim] Daysim/Radiance", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF0619BB72@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<69a9bc0a1001281420h69898d85v1dec522b3771ec5c@mail.gmail.com>", "<4B6229A9.2000001@visarc.com>"], "datetime": "Thu Jan 28 17:28:11 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: [Bldg-sim] Daysim/Radiance"}
