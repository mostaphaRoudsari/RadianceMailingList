You can even plug the values\nfrom 1 into the contrast half of the DGP equation.\n\nOf course running the calculations either with the building as a black\nhole or (more realistically) as not present at all produces some\ncomparative value as well.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\nOn 4/22/2015 9:58 PM, Alejandro Pacheco Di?guez wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150422/6127991c/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] DGP", "tags": [], "sender": "J.
