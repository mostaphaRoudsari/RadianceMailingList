{"body": "\nThank you for your reply!\n\nIt has been a while since I looked at the rad code but I'm pretty sure\nthat INDIRECT only affects the \"-ab\" value of the rpict comand.\nDepending on your QUALITY setting is either INDIRECT = -ab\nor INDIRECT=-ab-1. To keep the -ab value constant you have to\noverride it in with the \"render=\" option.\n\nI am confused by the \" INDIRECT = -abor INDIRECT=-ab-1. To keep the -ab\nvalue constant you have to override it in with the \"render=\" option.\"  In my\nsetting, \"INDIRECT would be a number, like INDIRECT = 5.\n\nFor my setting in rtrace, other ambient options are high enough to avoid the\nmistake.  And the INDIRECT is est in .rif file and rtrace is set in another\nfile.  My setting is as following:\n\nrtrace -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1\n-st .01 -ab 8 -aa .1 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 12 -lw .0005\n-af 5.amb 5.oct < 5.pts > 5.dat\n\nRESOLUTION= 640 480\nDETAIL= MEDIUM\nVARIABILITY= MEDIUM\nQUALITY= MEDIUM\nINDIRECT= 5\nREPORT= 2\n\nrender= -i\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100127/176e5fe2/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] \"INDIRECE\"in .rif file", "sender": "victor li", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<a555a441001262234s46230462le18475cb9364fa7b@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<a555a441001252340v437906d5m6b277872ee0820cc@mail.gmail.com>", "<89355c0f1001260144m8e11bd1o7ae3e34e79f58d41@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Jan 26 22:34:24 2010", "email": "victorpirates at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] \"INDIRECE\"in .rif file"}
