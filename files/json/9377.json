Is it correct?\n\nThanks!\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150426/825053c7/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "David Davidson", "datetime": "Sun, 26 Apr 2015 15:22:55 +0800"}
