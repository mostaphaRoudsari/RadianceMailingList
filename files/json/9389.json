Axel's views on these developments are detailed in an article he wrote for the Lighting Journal last September (see pages 15-17):\n\nhttp://issuu.com/matrixprint/docs/lightingjournal_september\n\nI've attempted to respond to these and similar concerns in a paper recently presented at the CIBSE Technical Symposium (16th April 2015).
