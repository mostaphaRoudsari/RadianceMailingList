This way you\ncan always accurately scale the candela values to account for different\nlamps, color filters, even lamps that aren't on that chart.  Since there\nis sometimes variance in lamp efficacy from manufacturer to manufactuer,\nit's nice to always have that lumen assumption in the file.  I think\nthis is more useful in architectural applications, but I just mention it.\n\nI realize this is nitpicking, but it's just a good habit to get into,\nespecially  if you plan to use these ies files in some sort of library.\n\n-------------------\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Ellipsoidal Spotlight ies fi", "tags": [], "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "datetime": "Tue Nov  2 16:58:05 2004"}
