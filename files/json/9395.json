You need to pay careful attention to the man page:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/genprism.pdf\n\nIn particular, the direction you extrude the surface determines the orientation of the normals, which matters for the dielectric material type.\n\nFollowing genprism, you can use the xform command with a -a option to repeat the extruded prism as many times as needed with the appropriate positioning (-t option).\n\nThe genBSDF command can be used with pkgBSDF to place the final system into your scene.\n\nYou could also try rendering using the new photon map routines that have been recently added to the Radiance HEAD by Roland Schregle, but this is only if you have the most up-to-date binaries.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these steps are simple, and this is a good challenge for an advanced Radiance user.  It would probably take me several hours to do, myself.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150505/88a7b754/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Acrylic Materia", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 5 May 2015 08:36:33 -0700"}
