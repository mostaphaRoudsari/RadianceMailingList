{"body": "\nHi Per,\n\nPerhaps you are experiencing rounding error larger than FTINY.  I?d suggest\nreplacing FTINY with a larger value (ie 2e-3) and seeing if black spots\nreduce.  A bit of trial and error might be necessary.\n\nIf that doesn?t work can you send more scene info?  I?d like to see your\nfalsecolor statement, your colorpict and mixpict material definitions and\nperhaps you could post your contour image in hdr format.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn 1/11/10 4:10 AM, \"Per Haugaard\" <perhaugaard@yahoo.dk> wrote:\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100111/7327647d/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Removing black areas in imagemapping", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C770ABB5.E599%andrew.mcneil@arup.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jan 11 10:19:52 2010", "email": "andrew.mcneil at arup.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Removing black areas in imagemapping"}
