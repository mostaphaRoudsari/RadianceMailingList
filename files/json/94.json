Or I use\nthe same way as in CAD, take a quite simple geometry and create the hole by\nmapping with colorpict onto a quite simple transparent surface. In fact, I\ndon't have much experience with textures and patterns in radiance (\"Rendering\nwith Radiance\" is next to my keyboard, I wouldn't know what to do here\nwithout this ;-).\n\nWhat do you think that I should prefer? I ask as I need to know which way is\nmore efficient as I have got a very large model to place my treed in, and I\nwant to be still able to let radiance compute on my machine in reasonable\ntimes.\n\nIn any way, I am using instances here.\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
