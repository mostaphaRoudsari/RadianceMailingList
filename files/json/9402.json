I obtain a weird\ndata format in Reflection scattering data section. This is an example:\n0.13983950.13990250.14006050.13999150.14011450.... etc. Various numbers,\nthat compose the matrix are not split by comma like in trasmission matrix.\nI ran the analysis in Ubuntu with these parameters:  *genBSDF -n 2 -c 20000\n-r -dj 1 -ds 0.01 -dt 0.05 -dc 0.99 -dr 50 -ss 100 -st 0.0001 -ab 10 -ar\n128 -aa 1 -ad 2054 -lr 50 -lw 0.0000000001*\n\nTherefore, I really appreciate if anyone can help me to create a right bsdf\nboth in trasmission and in reflection data.\nThanks so much.\n\nBest\n\n--\n\n*Andrea Zani*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150507/df78c168/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Fwd: Problem with genBSDF", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrea Zani", "datetime": "Thu, 7 May 2015 14:17:43 +0200"}
