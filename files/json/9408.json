I tried to run an annual simulation and it seems like nothing wrong happened.\n\nSo, I've only to understand how BRTDfunc exactly works. Any suggestion will be very appreciate!\n\nThank you,\n\nAnna\n\nSent: 07 May 2015 23:48\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi Anna,\n\nThe transdata (and transfunc) materials do not fully model material behavior as well as the newer BSDF type (or even BRTDfunc).\n\nI have a few models of roller shades, which you might be able to modify to your purpose.  I do not (currently) have any measurements to offer.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------\n\n# Shade material s99745 by Mechoshade, white facing front (inside)\n# Measurements by Mehlika Inanici & Judy Lai 9/20/2004\n# Diffuse measurements by Mike Rubin 10/7/2004\nvoid BRTDfunc Mechoshade99745\n10\n0 0 0\n.02*tspec .02*tspec .02*tspec\n0 0 0\nshade.cal\n0\n11\n.628     .628     .628\n.377     .377     .377\n.0225   .0225   .0225\n56        68\n\n-------------\n\n# Shade material #1 by Mechoshade\n# Measurements from Steve Hebeisen <steveh at mechoshade.com<mailto:steveh at mechoshade.com>>\nvoid BRTDfunc Mechoshade6020\n10\n0 0 0\ntspec tspec tspec\n0 0 0\nmechoshade.cal\n0\n9\n.37       .37       .37\n.56       .56       .56\n.03       .03       .03\n\n--------------\n\n# Shade material #2 by Hexcelshade\n# Measured from sample 11/3/2003\nvoid BRTDfunc HexcelshadeS065\n10\n0 0 0\ntspec tspec tspec\n0 0 0\nhexcelshade.cal\n0\n9\n.26       .28       .30\n.59       .61       .60\n.02       .02       .02\n\n-----------\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150508/22816d48/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] using transdata for roller shade simulati", "tags": [], "sender": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "datetime": "Fri, 8 May 2015 15:24:08 +0000"}
