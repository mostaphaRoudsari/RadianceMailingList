{"body": "\nHi John,\n\nYou are correct -- weighting values are not applied for the <return>\nreporting in ximage, corresponding to the radiant \"intensity\" for this\npixel or area.  There is no agreed-upon weighting for radiance values,\nonly luminance, which is the reason for the different choices.  You\ncan always divide the 'l' report by 179 if you want a photometrically-\nweighted radiance quantity.  The 'c' command reports the RGB color,\nbut adjusted by the current exposure scale, which is not really useful\nas a radiometric quantity.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Create constant radiance image", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8709742A-6B60-438B-BD61-B7598304911D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<918A0865-79C8-42EF-BA62-D56C853E0F5F@dmu.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Wed Jan  6 09:24:56 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Create constant radiance image"}
