{"body": "\nHi,\n\nHappy New Year to all members and their families!\n\nIs there some easy 'one command' way to create Radiance image with all\npixels set to some constant value?\n\nEquation like this works, where in dat file are listed pixel values\npvalue -r -h +Y 9 +X 5 -d pixel_file.dat > uniform_image.hdr\n\nBut I need images of various resolutions, so not much sense to create dat\nfile with 1024x1024 or so, equal pixels as input for pvalue.\n\nIs there some way to give some constant radiance value and resolution on\ninput of pvalue or some other program to create such images?\n\nI tried creation of small image as above and then make it bigger with pfilt,\nbut if image is completely black (all 0 pixels) for example, pfilt can't\nfilter it.\n\nThanks,\nMarija.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100105/ec258c06/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Marija Velickovic", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<124b40401001050356u2e8c49d9qc892466b743ee419@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Jan  5 03:56:27 2010", "email": "maricanis at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Create constant radiance image"}
