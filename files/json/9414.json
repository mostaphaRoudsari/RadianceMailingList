{"body": "\nHi Folks:\n\nAs a follow-on to the informal invitation made at the Radiance 2009\nWorkshop, I'd like to extend an invitation to interested individuals to\njoin a team of motivated building scientists, architects, and engineers\ndeveloping new daylighting tools and technology solutions that will\nprovide highly efficient solutions for the next generation of net zero\nenergy buildings.\n\nThe Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California has a\nnew opening in the Building Technology Department for a Radiance Senior\nScientific Engineering Associate.  The successful candidate will\nparticipate in the development, validation and maintenance of the next\ngeneration of facade, lighting and daylighting simulation and analysis\ntools and utilize these tools for the design, evaluation, and operation\nof innovative low-energy building solutions.\n\nDetails are posted at: http://cjo.lbl.gov/details.asp?jid=23906&p=1\n<http://cjo.lbl.gov/details.asp?jid=23906&p=1>\n\nFor an informal discussion about the opening, call Eleanor Lee (510 486\n4997).\n\nTo review recent projects, see:\n\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/comm_perf/newyorktimes.htm\n\nhttp://lowenergyfacades.lbl.gov/resources.html\n\nbest regards,\nEleanor Lee\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100104/426b0698/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Eleanor Lee", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4B424F4A.1060303@lbl.gov>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Mon Jan  4 12:27:58 2010", "email": "eslee at lbl.gov", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance Job Opportunity at the LawrenceBerkeley National Laboratory"}
