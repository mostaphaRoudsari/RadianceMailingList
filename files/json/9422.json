{"body": "\nI don't normally post conference announcements to the list, but this\nis an excellent symposium I have attended many times in years past\n(even co-chairing it one year), and the organizer, Karol Myszkowski,\nis a good friend of mine.\n\n-Greg\n\n--------------------\nCall for Papers\n---------------\n\nThe Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2010 will take place in\nSaarbr?cken, Germany, from June 28 to June 30, 2010.  This is the 21st\nannual event in the series of very successful Eurographics Symposia on\nRendering and Eurographics Workshops on Rendering.\n\nThe local organizers are Karol Myszkowski and Elmar Eisemann and the\nprogram chairs are Jason Lawrence and Marc Stamminger.  Up-to-date\ninformation about the conference is available on the official EGSR\n2010 web site:\n\nhttp://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/egsr2010/\n\n\nConference Topics\n-----------------\n\nConference topics include (but are not limited to):\n\n- Global illumination\n- Reflectance, volumetric scattering and translucency\n- Representations of material appearance\n- Human perception and error measures\n- Rendering hardware and its application\n- Computational photography\n- Rendering dynamic/animated environments\n- Shadows and visibility\n- Monte Carlo techniques\n- Finite element techniques\n- Sampling, filtering, and anti-aliasing\n- Texture models, analysis, and synthesis\n- Non-photorealistic rendering\n- Image-based measurement and rendering\n- Sensing for graphics\n- Point-based rendering\n- Real-time rendering and real-time ray tracing\n- Systems and software architecture for rendering\n- Virtual/augmented reality and interactive systems\n- Audio/sound rendering\n\n\nThe proceedings of EGSR will be a special issue of the journal Computer\nGraphics Forum. Because of this there will be a brief second review\ncycle for any papers that require changes to be accepted; such papers\nwill only be accepted after the changes have been confirmed by the\nprogram committee.\n\n\nImportant Dates\n---------------\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 p.m., US Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4).\n\nAbstract submission deadline: Friday, April 9\nPaper submission deadline: Tuesday, April 13\nAuthor notification: Friday, May 14\nRevisions due: Wednesday, May 26\nFinal PDF files due for printing: Friday, May 28\nSymposium: June 28 - 30\n\nThe EGSR review and publication process is very short, and to achieve\nthis quick turnaround all deadlines must be strictly observed. In\nparticular, final PDF files for printing must be finished on time.\n\n\nKeynote Speakers\n----------------\n\nGeorge Drettakis, REVES/INRIA Sophia-Antipolis (FR)\nKari Pulli, Nokia Research (US)\n\n\nInternational Program Committee\n-------------------------------\n\nProgram Chairs: Jason Lawrence (US) and Marc Stamminger (DE)\n\nInternational Program Committee:\n\nAseem Agarwala (US)          Marcus Magnor (DE)\nTimo Aila (FI)               Bill Mark (US)\nThomas Annen (US)            Diego Nehab (US)\nOkan Arikan (US)             Sylvain Paris (US)\nPhilippe Bekaert (BE)        Pieter Peers (US)\nJiri Bittner (CZ)            Kari Pulli (US)\nVolker Blanz (DE)            Eric Reinhard (UK)\nPer Christensen (US)         Holly Rushmeier (US)\nYiorgos Chrysanthou (CY)     Szymon Rusinkiewicz (US)\nPaolo Cignoni (IT)           Pedro Sander (HK)\nCarsten Dachsbacher (DE)     Mateu Sbert (ES)\nOliver Deussen (DE)          Pete Shirley (US)\nCraig Donner (US)            Peter-Pike Sloan (US)\nPhilip Dutre (BE)            Philipp Slusallek (DE)\nElmar Eisemann (FR)          Brian Smits (US)\nRaanan Fattal (IL)           Laszlo Szirmay-Kalos (HU)\nVlastimil Havran (CZ)        Bruce Walter (US)\nWolfgang Heidrich (CA)       Rui Wang (US)\nNicolas Holzschuch (FR)      Greg Ward (CA)\nWojciech Jarosz (CH)         Tim Weyrich (UK)\nHenrik Wann Jensen (US)      Alexander Wilkie (CZ)\nStefan Jeschke (AT)          Andrew Willmot (US)\nJanne Kontkanen (US)         Chris Wyman (US)\nSamuli Laine (FI)            Kun Zhou (CN)\nSylvain Lefebvre (FR)        Matthias Zwicker (CH)\nJaakko Lehtinen (US)\n\n\nLocal Organizing Chairs: Elmar Eisemann (DE) and Karol Myszkowski (DE)\n\n\nInstructions for Submission\n---------------------------\n\nAll contributions submitted to the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering\n2010 must be original, unpublished work. Any work that has previously\nbeen published or simultaneously been submitted in substantially\nsimilar form to any other conference or journal will be\nrejected. Contributions must be written and presented in English.\n\nOnly electronic submissions will be accepted. Submitted manuscripts\nshould be formatted using the Eurographics publication style\nproceedings templates, and be anonymized for the double-blind\nreviewing process.\n\nPapers should be as long as their content requires, but not\nlonger. Papers with average length requirements are expected to be 8\nformatted pages long, including references and all figures; up to 10\npages will be allowed only where justified.
