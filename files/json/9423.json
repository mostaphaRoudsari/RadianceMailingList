Try typing:\nximage -e auto window_000.hdr\n\nThis will automatically adjust the exposure of your image upon initially opening the file. It could be that your image does have non-zero values but the exposure is skewed in your viewpoint making it look black with the default exposure value.\n\nOr type\nximage window_000.hdr\nthen hit the ?a? key while ximage is active to view it with automatic exposure\nwhile ximage is active you can also hit the ?=? key and click a point in the image to adjust the exposure according to various points in the image\n\nSent: Wednesday, May 13, 2015 5:01 AM\n\n\nHowever, generated window_000.hdr file does not have light. It is a black image, even though, the render generated by rvu of the room it is ok.\nDo you know why does it happen?\n\nThank you!\nKind regards,\nUrtza\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150513/0dda6020/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<20150513110053.Horde.1O0-DjLTpl635sCmpflrS55@correu.upc.edu>", "tags": [], "sender": "urtza.uriarte at upc.edu", "datetime": "Wed, 13 May 2015 14:25:14 +0000"}
