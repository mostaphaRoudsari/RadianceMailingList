{"body": "\nHi Victor,\n\nAs is often the case with Radiance the problem likely lies outside what you\nthink is causing it.  That is why we need more info to properly diagnose.\n\nI'd suggest posting all your scene files (sky, geometry and materials), rif\nfile and complete list of commands you are using to achieve inconsistent\nresults.  Proper etiquette is not to attach files to a list posting, but\ninstead upload them to a website and include a link in your list posting.\n\nWhile I wait for more info, I'll speculate that maybe rad is creating an\noctree file with extra or fewer scene files because the rif file is missing\nsomething.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/4/10 2:33 AM, \"Lars O.
