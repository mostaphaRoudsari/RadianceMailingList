To\ndo this I have used the next command (in addition,I attached the respective\nfiles)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/c8vrn445gz2nmd8/glazing.rad?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7foi5rqb5a4ll78/Layer0.rad?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o8rz1bw28la0s8g/materials.mat?dl=0\n\ngenBSDF -n 8 materials.mat glazing.rad Layer0.rad > Case1.xml\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/objuhir1asplcog/Case1.xml?dl=0\n\nApparently,It worked right since I can see it in  BSDF Viewer.\n\nHowever , the problem happen when I connect this BSDF with the window which\ncontains WINDOW 7.3 software.So, when I try to add a shading since XML\nfile, the program shut down.\n\nI have looked over each step but I dont know where can be the mistake.Do\nyou have any idea about this problem or what is happening?\n\nThanks you in advance,\n\nKing regards,\n\nDaniel\n\n--\nDaniel Uribe C?ceres\nEstudiante de Ingenier?a Civil\nDiploma en Ingenier?a Estructural\nPontificia Universidad Cat?lica de Chile\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150513/77f980e2/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Daniel Uribe", "datetime": "Wed, 13 May 2015 11:54:23 -0300"}
