{"body": "\nAs always, thanks for the response Greg.\n\nAs suggested I tried adding the -bn option, however ;rtcontrib' still\nonly generates 248 unfinished files with the '-e MF:2' option.  All\nworks fine with 'e MF:1'.  I tried sending the files to a ramdisk, but\nstill no joy.\n\nI'm wondering if I did something funny when compiling the most recent\nhead under OS X?  Has anyone had similar results using Linux or Cygwin?\n\nThanks,\nChris H\n\nOn Feb 5, 2010, at 11:00 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Understanding rtcontrib", "sender": "Christian Humann", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<E11DB03F-E4CB-428F-A3C9-B6B544F67915@coolshadow.com>", "refs": ["<4b5b5562.aa13f30a.77e2.ffff9f3eSMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>", "<4B67512D.2010807@gmail.com>", "<D00D4CFE-C2ED-45AC-8878-C2CE7D7A64EA@coolshadow.com>", "<E470DBB2-4E70-4A03-AA7F-2C0CB2B54B71@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Sat Feb  6 12:42:31 2010", "email": "chris at coolshadow.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Understanding rtcontrib"}
