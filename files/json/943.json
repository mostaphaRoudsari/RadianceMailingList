With this email, we invite you\nto share your opinions considering a preferred date and location for the\nnext workshop.\n\nThe NRC could host the workshop next August in conjunction with the IBPSA\nconference 2005 which will take place in Montreal, Canada\n(http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/) from Monday, August 15th to Thursday, August\n18th. The workshop would take place on the Thursday and Friday before the\nconference (August 11th & 12th) at the School of Architecture at McGill. The\nschool is located in downtown Montreal within easy walking distance from\nrestaurants and cafes.\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041103/6b652bcf/attachment.htm\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance workshop 2005", "tags": [], "sender": "adiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "datetime": "Wed Nov  3 17:05:02 2004"}
