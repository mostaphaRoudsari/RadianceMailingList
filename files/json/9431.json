You will need to edit src/util/Rmakefile and remove the program \"glrad\" from the PROGS= setting near the top.  Then, rerun \"rmake install\" in that directory.\n\nYou didn't include all of your compile listing, so it's difficult to know why rpict is not found, but did you remember to do as it suggested at the end and add \"/Applications/radiance/ray/bin\" to your PATH variable?  I don't know why you decided to put everything there rather than /usr/local, but in any case, the shell won't find commands unless it knows where to look for them.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150513/a6145a0b/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<6A7D8C0C-0B25-437B-AC46-EDA351935C78@gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 13 May 2015 10:55:57 -0700"}
