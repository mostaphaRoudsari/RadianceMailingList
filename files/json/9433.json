I wish if you can help me to answer:\n\nAs Daysim and SPOT Pro's main difference is mainly how to treat with sun and sky components, is that applies to all radiance-based-engine tools (including Radiance command-line approach itself)? By other words, is the way sun-and-sky-being-treated the main motivation to go for radiance-based-engine-tools rather than simple tools (i.e. like Ecotect)? So if someone needs to just investigate how different complex fenestration systems will affect indoor daylight coefficients (no illuminance levels nor pictures needed), there is no need to generate BSDF data for those CFS and even no need to use radiance?\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\nSorry for my long emails, but really this will help me a lot at my early stages.\n\nBest regards\nIkrima\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 13 May 2015 18:46\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

In you query it sounded like maybe you were interested in possible other illuminance points (eye level or wall) for which you may need to go behind the scenes and work with classic Radiance.\n\n\nBSDF files can come from several places:  1) there is a small library of generic ones in SPOT.  2) You can generate them via genBSDF and command lines. 3) LBL's Window 7.3 program can generate them 4) If small enough samples you can have physical goniophotometer measurements that would need to be converted to the Radiance BSDF format 5) use companies like mine, we offer daylighting performance characterization and BSDF creation for complex optical daylight systems as service.\n\nAlso, what is the difference between SPOT Pro and Daysim tools in terms of\nThey both use Radiance for all simulation they just have two different approaches to annual simulation.  DAYSIM uses Daylight Coefficients, breaking the sky into atleast 145 patches and calculating the contribution from each and then using this data to simulate throughout the year. 1, 2, 3 and 5phase methods all just treat the sun and sky components in different ways.  SPOT interpolates from a range of design day calculations to simulate throughout the year.  In my opinion both have some advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy and speed and how they can treat window treatments.  The annual comparison's I have seen show very similar results between the two methods but I do feel more annual daylighting simulation studies and validation is needed of all methods in general.\n\nZack\n\n--\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n808 S.

This is why Nkbins was undefined, and probably at least one reason your simulation is not working.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150513/94185fc3/attachment-0001.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 3\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nMessage-ID: <6A7D8C0C-0B25-437B-AC46-EDA351935C78 at gmail.com>\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"utf-8\"\n\nHi all:\nI?m starting to learn Radiance and tried to install it in Mac.
