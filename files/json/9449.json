However, I would like also to set PATH and\nRAYPATH straight in a batch file for a question of Radiance version\nrequired by our tool.\n\n\n\nBelow what I have written in the *.bat file:\n\n\n\n*set RAYPATH=.;C:\\Radiance\\lib;$RAYPATH*\n\n*set PATH=.;C:\\Radiance\\bin\\;$PATH*\n\n*c:*\n\n*cd /d %~dp0*\n\n*gendaylit 1 3 9 -L 0 2500 -a 44.4167 -o -8.85 -m 15 -i 60 | genskyvec.pl\n<http://genskyvec.pl> -m 4 -c 1 1 1 > temp/skysun.skv*\n\n\n\nand this is the error that I got:\n\n\n\nprint() on closed filehandle OCONV at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line\n114, <>line 18.\n\nprint() on closed filehandle OCONV at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line\n115, <>line 18.\n\nprint() on closed filehandle OCONV at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line\n116, <>line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value in split at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line\n137, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value $ang[0] in addition (+) at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\\ngenskyvec.pl line 138, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value in split at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line\n137, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value $ang[1] in addition (+) at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\\ngenskyvec.pl line 138, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value in split at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line\n137, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value $ang[2] in addition (+) at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\\ngenskyvec.pl line 138, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value $ang[0] in addition (+) at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\\ngenskyvec.pl line 141, <> line 18.\n\nUse of uninitialized value $dom[0] in division (/) at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\\ngenskyvec.pl line 141, <> line 18.\n\nIllegal division by zero at C:\\Radiance\\bin\\genskyvec.pl line 141, <> line\n18.\n\n\n\nOf course, if I run the batch file only with:\n\n\n\n*cd /d %~dp0*\n\n*gendaylit 1 3 9 -L 0 2500 -a 44.4167 -o -8.85 -m 15 -i 60 | genskyvec.pl\n<http://genskyvec.pl> -m 4 -c 1 1 1 > temp/skysun.skv*\n\n\nall works fine.\n\n\nI have also noticed that Radiance's commands that do not require the perl\nintrepreter run without problems with the path and raypath set in the batch\nfile.\n\n\nAny advice?\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n*Giuseppe De Michele*\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150519/0b6a9df8/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Giuseppe De Michele", "datetime": "Tue, 19 May 2015 12:25:53 +0200"}
