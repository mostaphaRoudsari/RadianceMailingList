We have very good experiences with our students using a virtual linux machine under windows 7.\nWe are using the \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager\" with Ubuntu. For our students we have prepared an Image (Appliance) with all necessary programs in it for running Radiance, Evalglare and some handy scripts.\n\nKind regards,\nJan\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: maandag 18 mei 2015 21:00\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

But I do think that with the latest installer we provide here (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3) and the \"Git Bash shell\" from here (https://msysgit.github.io/), you could get pretty darn close to the same experience as you would on *nix.\n\nGood luck!\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 5/18/15, 1:44 AM, \"urtza.uriarte at upc.edu<mailto:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu>\" <urtza.uriarte at upc.edu<mailto:urtza.uriarte at upc.edu>> wrote:\n\n\nHi everybody,\n\nThanks for your suggestions.

I haven't\ndone extensive testing, but it seems like the Git Bash shell gives Windows\nusers a more similar and compatible experience to that of the Unix user,\npotentially allowing folks to use things like Andy McNeil's tutorials,\nas-written.\n\nThe installer is 17MB and just *works*, adding a shortcut to a \"Git Bash\"\ncommand prompt. Once fired up, you have access to your existing file\nsystem, and all the basic CLI tools a Unix user us used to (e.g. ls) are\nthere and just work, along with things like wildcards. =) There's no other\nsystem tuning to do. I haven't used or set up Cygwin in a long time but\nthis Git shell is a lot easier than the Cygwin I've used. I still haven't\ntested any of the more esoteric Radiance command pipelines (such as what's\nused to get view parameters passed to rcontrib), but ASSuming they work,\ncoupled with a Windows Python or Ruby interpreter I'd bet you can get\npretty close to the Unix experience on Windows with little brain damage\nnow.\n\nHaving said all that, there are still things that the Windows user gives\nup in RadianceLand. The built-in multithreading (in rcontrib, rtrace,\nrpict, et al.) doesn't work; there are a few remaining Radiance commands\nthat are written in csh so those (probably (might?)) won't work; native\nmanpage support is lacking; and Roland had to use some sub-optimal\nfunctions to get all the photon map stuff to build on Windows. Still, I\nthink we've come a long way?\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 5/15/15, 11:40 AM, \"Christopher Rush\" <Christopher.Rush at arup.com<mailto:Christopher.Rush at arup.com>> wrote:\n\nRob,\nGetting off-topic, but not sure if it warrants a separate thread... you\nimply that we can run Radiance commands in the Git for Windows bash\nshell. Is there an advantage to doing so, in comparison to Cygwin (which\nI have used in the past)? Both would have the clear advantages of being\nable to use more powerful scripted commands when compared to the Windows\ncmd prompt, but Git-bash is more lightweight while Cygwin would be more\npowerful (for things unrelated to Radiance?)? In both cases install\naccording to normal Windows Radiance installation and adjust paths as\nnecessary in each environment?\n\n-Chris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, May 15, 2015 11:55 AM\n\nWelp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with\nWindows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with\nother internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat'). As\nthey say: WTF?\n\n- Rob\n\nP.S. The wildcard does expand correctly with pcompos in a Cygwin shell,\nso there's that.\n\nP.P.S. You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing\nGit for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell\nin Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online>.orghttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 135, Issue 25\n*************************************************\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>", "datetime": "Mon, 18 May 2015 15:52:07 +0000"}
