{"body": "\nSasa.\n\nCan you please be more specific about your problem?\nIn which context are you creating these *.dat files, which application\nare you using and what is the command you use to create the files (if\nyou know that).\n\nIf the *.dat files contain only a single value per line (lux level)\nthen there should be another file that contains coordinates. Usually\nthis has the form \"x y z dx dy dz\" (no comma!). Excel can import these\nfiles even if there is no comma in the line. You just have to set the\nfield separator correctly.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 16, 2010 at 10:36 AM, sasa.cemesova@tiscali.co.uk\n<sasa.cemesova@tiscali.co.uk> wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] thank you!", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f1002160553s5814af3ci47a6072a456b9966@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<21717570.1266316616961.JavaMail.root@ps29>"], "datetime": "Tue Feb 16 05:53:30 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] thank you!"}
