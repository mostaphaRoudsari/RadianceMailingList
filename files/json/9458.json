I asked this question because I am interested in simplifying the\norganization of files in a project.\n\n\n\nI have run into issues in the past with projects that have multiple\nluminaire definitions. The image below is a screenshot from the directory\ncontaining rad files for one such project. Add or removing luminaires, or\neven sky definitions with .cal files, in a scene will be easier if I could\nadd or  replace rad files alone without worrying about the linking data\nfiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n\nSent: Wednesday, May 20, 2015 1:20 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\n\n\nHi Sarith,\n\n\n\nThere is no way to incorporate the luminaire data directly in the Radiance\nfile other than some kind of reference.  What is your concern, exactly?  If\nyou don't want to have the full path name, you can store the data files in\nthe same file as source.cal and take off the leading directory, or add a new\ndirectory to your $RAYPATH (or %RAYPATH%) environment variable and put the\ndata files there.\n\n\n\nHaving many sources refer to a common data file is one way Radiance saves\nmemory when you have many light sources sharing the same distribution.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi,\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to hard-code a data or .cal file inside a rad definition ?\n\n\n\nI am generating a few luminaire definitions using a batch file and was\nwondering if it is possible to avoid linking rad files to external files.\nFor example, in the luminaire definition below, is it possible to code the\n.dat and .cal file inside the rad file ?\n\n\n\nvoid brightdata 2RT8S_2_32_LP735_dist\n\n5 flatcorr C:/rm/ies/2RT8S_2_32_LP735.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta\n\n0\n\n1 1.54935\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nSarith\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150520/57ade15b/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image002.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 39400 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150520/57ade15b/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Hard-coding .cal and data files", "tags": [], "sender": "sarith at psu.edu", "datetime": "May 20, 2015 6:00:28 PM GMT+02:00"}
