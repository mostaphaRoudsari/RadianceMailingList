{"body": "\nHi Galen.\n\nWhich version of OS X are you using. I updated to Snow Leopard on a\n32-bit system and since then most of the applications I compiled\nmyself end in a segfault. I think the new Xcode is not set up properly\nfor a 32-bit system or the usual (auto)config rules do not work\ncorrectly for this configuration.\n\nException: I downloaded the Radiance HEAD snapshot last weekend and it\ncompiled and worked fine, including gendaylit. Greg's Makefiles seem\nto work just fine.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Sun, Feb 21, 2010 at 5:16 AM, Galen Burrell\n<Galen.Burrell@arup.com.au> wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaylit: segmentation fault", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f1002210048p120181e5u9d37f0eb9d5c7c87@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<A1A14AD0D93971429BCB2E82636833C07AF6884533@AUEXC01.global.arup.com>"], "datetime": "Sun Feb 21 00:48:09 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] gendaylit: segmentation fault"}
