{"body": "\nHi Randolph,\n\nSorry for the delayed response.  I think this is another report buried\nin a box somewhere in my basement, but it's probably not worth digging\nout.  Although the work was well-done by Anat, it compares a very old\nversion of Radiance to Superlite, and in it I seem to remember we\ndiscovered the problem of not subdividing large area sources (such as\nwindows) for nearby points.  This led to the creation of the -ds\noption.  Otherwise, the programs were in fair agreement.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Grynberg, part II", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<CAD268B7-5DC5-4419-B6D0-E7DC333DAD1F@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<hl4ikh$1q7$1@ger.gmane.org>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb 22 09:32:58 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Grynberg, part II"}
