I don't have a Radiance installation around but you should find it in the man page.\n\nIt was either that or a cunning pipe between the output of rvu (view direction) and rtrace to report the modifier.\n\nOn Wed, May 27, 2015 at 10:53 AM, Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.

I have a .rad geometry file that contains numerous polygons and it would be helpful to be able to identify a specific polygon identifier name by simply clicking on its surface within an .hdr image. This is useful for debugging purposes, where the geometry consists of a large number of geometry primitives.\n\nIf anybody has developed a Radiance utility that performs this task, I would greatly appreciate it you could share it or give some insight into the procedure.\n\nBest Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAKGV-k2N2ghEgGi8qqPhnUNbnmfJAxJOfHvXbw37K68+MSkVqA@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Wed, 27 May 2015 16:33:51 +0000"}
