I just used it to render an image and successfully identified my polygon of interest. This was sufficient for my purposes. I appreciate the help.\n\nKind Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Wednesday, May 27, 2015 11:34 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nYou could just use the \"trace\" command in rvu too; it will return the coordinates of the surface, and then the modifier. But I think Andrei wants specifically to query the output HDR, not the octree.

I don't have a Radiance installation around but you should find it in the man page.\n\nIt was either that or a cunning pipe between the output of rvu (view direction) and rtrace to report the modifier.\n\nOn Wed, May 27, 2015 at 10:53 AM, Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.

I have a .rad geometry file that contains numerous polygons and it would be helpful to be able to identify a specific polygon identifier name by simply clicking on its surface within an .hdr image. This is useful for debugging purposes, where the geometry consists of a large number of geometry primitives.\n\nIf anybody has developed a Radiance utility that performs this task, I would greatly appreciate it you could share it or give some insight into the procedure.\n\nBest Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<D18B4D0E.19C6B%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "tags": [], "sender": "Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov", "datetime": "Wed, 27 May 2015 18:57:50 +0000"}
