This forces folks to ask silly follow-up questions, like \"Where did you get your XML file and what is in it?\"  Judging by the filename, it looks like it uses a non-standard (and non-square) BTDF matrix, which probably won't work with dctimestep.  That would make sense with the error you are seeing, but it can be no more than a guess without further clues from you.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150527/40d494be/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Klems_full.cal: -b kbin(S-E)", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 27 May 2015 21:45:46 +0200"}
