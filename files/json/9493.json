{"body": "\nDear David,\n\nDid you maybe mix up direct normal and direct horizontal radiation data?\nI have seen this type of graph in the past when Daysim users tried to\nrun an annual illuminance simulation using their own radiation data. You\ncould try to simply run an empty scene in Daysim loading in your epw\nfile.\n\nBest,\n\nChristoph\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Greg\nWard\nSent: Friday, February 26, 2010 7:17 PM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nHi David,\n\nIn the case of \"cnuhw.png,\" it looks like you are specifying a\nhorizontal irradiance due to direct solar that is pretty high all the\nway to sunset.  Since the direct horizontal is proportional to the\nsine of the solar altitude, and this goes to zero as the sun nears the\nhorizon, the corresponding radiance of the sun has to increase\ndramatically to compensate.\n\nA more realistic scenario would have the direct horizontal component\ndropping to zero as the sun reaches the horizon.  My guess is that\nyour weather files aren't calibrated properly to the hour, or their\ndirect measurements actually include a significant diffuse component.\n\nDoes anyone else have experience with this?\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Annual illuminance simulation anomaly", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF0660F055@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<694e132c1002261547u3816d691k1637d50bfa675d85@mail.gmail.com>", "<C2C3418D-07F6-4568-A9ED-53FEFF7091C5@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Sun Feb 28 18:03:54 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "Re: [Radiance-general] Annual illuminance simulation anomaly"}
