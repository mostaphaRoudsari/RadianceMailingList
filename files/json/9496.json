However, you can run it like so:\n\nrtrace -ov \"\\!oconv -i static.oct lights1.rad\" < samples.inp > radiance.out\n\nThe backslash before the '!' may not be necessary if your shell does not treat this character specially.  Basically, you give your command to create the octree in place of an octree file.  (This also works for rpict, rvu, and rcontrib.)\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150531/535a97f8/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<000001d09b38$596db420$0c491c60$@psu.edu>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Sun, 31 May 2015 08:41:49 +0200"}
