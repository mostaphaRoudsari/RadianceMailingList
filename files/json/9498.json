It have 5 floors with rectangular atria in the center.\ni will to prepare the model in ecotect to export it to radiance and to daysim for daylight simulation\nMy question is: how can i modelize a one typical floor with many adjacent offices? should i consider each space as a separately zone (for example :\noffice1,office2,corridor, atria...) and modelize it separately?\na typical floor is given on attached document to give you an idea about my problem\nhow can i prepare the entire floor correctlyfor daylight modelisation?\nthank you\nbest regards\nIm?ne\n\n___________________________________________________________\nMode, hifi, maison,?
