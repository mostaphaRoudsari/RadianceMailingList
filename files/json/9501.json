I would define a\nsimulation problem as any space (or group of spaces, if they all can\n\"share\" daylight) that represents a unique architectural daylighting\nscenario. Look for unique combinations of form factors, orientations, and\nroom surface characteristics (e.g. room surface reflectance, glazing\ntransmittance). A row of offices all facing the same way could be reduced\nto a single office model. If those offices all have access to potential\ndaylight from the atrium, then a model with the atrium geometry and an\nexemplar office model for each orientation might work. Of course it's hard\nto model the effect of atria on adjacent spaces without modeling a lot of\nthe building, to be honest; the effects of the atrium will vary\nvertically, as well. But you can still probably reduce your entire\nbuilding model to a subset of modeling challenges for Radiance.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 6/1/15, 5:15 AM, \"imenslama at voila.fr\" <imenslama at voila.fr> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Simulation ecotect_radiance_daysim", "tags": [], "sender": "Guglielmetti, Robert", "datetime": "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 14:38:23 +0000"}
