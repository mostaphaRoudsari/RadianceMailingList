I have\ngone through the two tutorials in Chapter 1 & 2, a lot of code are now\noutdated but I cannot figure out.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nJiajie\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150603/98830708/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jonathan Zhu", "datetime": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 18:30:26 +0100"}
