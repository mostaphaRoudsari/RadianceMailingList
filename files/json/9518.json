I have understood that there is a bug in the code and I tried\nto follow the procedure in this discussion\nhttp://radiance-general.radiance-online.narkive.com/kKC0HCmV/su2rad-rb-update-of-the-sketchup-to-radiance-converter\nbut without success.\n\nThis is what I have done:\n\n- Add my materials in the materials.rad file in the su2rad folder of\nSketchup?s plugins\n\n- Name the layer in Sketchup with the identifier of the material\n\n\nSomething changed in the ?su2rad export window?, since the layer/material\nare displayed no more yellowish-brown but blue.  However, the materials.rad\nfile exported contains again the ?default_material? for each material.\n\n\n\nAny advice? Thank you in advance.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nGiuseppe\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150611/048d22b4/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Giuseppe De Michele", "datetime": "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:20:59 +0200"}
