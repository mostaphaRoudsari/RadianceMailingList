I tend to compile Radiance from source\non all of my machine, which is why I didn't realise it is no longer\nmaintained as a Debian/Ubuntu package.  Debian's package tracker lists\nit as removed from Testing: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/radiance\n\nAccording to the package tracker, the following actions are needed:\n- Does not build reproducibly during testing\n- The package has not entered testing even though the delay is over\n- The package depends on source packages which need a new maintainer.\n- lintian reports 278 warnings\n- Build log checks report 2 warnings\n\nSo that's probably the end of it  :-(\n\nBest\n\nAxel\n\n\nOn 17 June 2015 at 14:13, Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com> wrote:\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] learnix installati", "tags": [], "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "datetime": "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 15:45:34 +0100"}
