I'm definitely a novice at using Radiance, but I am trying to\nrun simulations as close to reality as possible for simple scenes. I have\nthe lighting and geometry down, but would like to implement defining a\nsurface with a BSDF material. I have the BSDF file but have no idea where\nto go from there.\n\nAny assistance on how to pass this or include this in the command would be\nmore than appreciated!\n\nThank you,\nChristian\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150616/491c1141/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Christian Sarmiento", "datetime": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 14:37:47 -0700"}
