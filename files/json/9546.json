And that is exactly the matrix that is taking most of the computational effort (about 4 hours I think - the same model with the 2-phase method takes 5 minutes, glazing is all simple clear glass).\n\n5pm_dsc.opt:     -ab 1 -ad 50000 -as 0 -lw 2e-5 -dc 1 -dt 0 -dj 1 -st 1 -ss 0\n\nrfluxmtx -n 4 -faa -I+ @5pm_dsc.opt -y `wc -l < $prj.pts` < $prj.pts - skies/suns.rad $pmats/materials-$i.rad $prj-black.rad windows.rad > dmx/MF6.dsc\noconv $pmats/materials-$i.rad $prj-black.rad windows.rad skies/suns.rad > octs/model_suns-$i.oct\nrcontrib -n 4 -I+ @5pm_dsc.opt -faa -e MF:6 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -o dmx/MF6-$i.dsc -m solar octs/model_suns-$i.oct < $prj.pts\n\nAm I doing something wrong or is this the normal behaviour? The data I get in the end are plausible. Could you explain why the Sun Coefficient Matrix needs to take into account the model reflectances at all?\n\nI hope I managed to explain the issue somehow...
