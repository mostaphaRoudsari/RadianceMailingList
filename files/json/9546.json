I\nhave been trying to model this room with a film of translucent white\nplastic on the window, and am really really stuck and need help\nurgently, any advice would help a lot!\n\nFirstly,  I have a translucent white plastic material with a\nreflectivity value of 0.518 and Transmissivity value 0.046, how would\nyou do the parameters for this material?\n\nsecondly, I have a model set up, and I really need to get a working\nplane with lux values on it, how do you do this in either Control Panel\nor radiance itself? I have tried to use Ecotect, but it doesnt seem to\nbe able to model a translucent material very accurately.\n\nThank you for your time in advance,\nSasa\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Working plane", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF063B77A0@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<1555777.1265909327733.JavaMail.root@ps38>"], "datetime": "Thu Feb 11 11:21:22 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Working plane"}
