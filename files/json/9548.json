{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nI am an undergraduate student trying to model a 10m x 10m room with\none corner touching the origin and a window on the south facing wall. I\nhave been trying to model this room with a film of translucent white\nplastic on the window, and am really really stuck and need help\nurgently, any advice would help a lot!\n\nFirstly,  I have a translucent white plastic material with a\nreflectivity value of 0.518 and Transmissivity value 0.046, how would\nyou do the parameters for this material?\n\nsecondly, I have a model set up, and I really need to get a working\nplane with lux values on it, how do you do this in either Control Panel\nor radiance itself? I have tried to use Ecotect, but it doesnt seem to\nbe able to model a translucent material very accurately.\n\nThank you for your time in advance,\nSasa\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "sasa.cemesova@tiscali.co.uk", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<1555777.1265909327733.JavaMail.root@ps38>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Feb 11 09:29:00 2010", "email": "sasa.cemesova at tiscali.co.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Working plane"}
