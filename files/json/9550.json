So it\nshouldn't change when you change other materials. Maybe check that your\nmaterials are actually black using rvu?\n\nThere are ways to reduce the amount of time the direct sun coefficient\nmatrix takes, the most useful is to delete the suns in suns.rad that will\nnever be used. So if you don't plan on changing the orientation or latitude\nin your simulations you can delete suns that fall outside of your solar\nband. Also if you're only doing hourly analysis, you could delete suns\nbetween hourly analemas.\n\n\nOn Wed, Jun 17, 2015 at 9:56 AM, Eleonora Brembilla <E.Brembilla at lboro.ac.uk\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150617/0ce8d18e/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] 5-phase method model reflectanc", "tags": [], "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "datetime": "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 14:20:59 -0700"}
