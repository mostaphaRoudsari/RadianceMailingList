It is called Geronimo and was developed during my time at\nEPFL. The idea of the tool was to see the effect of complex fenestration\nsystems represented by their BSDF in typical office rooms.\n\nIn short:\n- you can download the latest version (1.3) on:\nftp://kaemco.synology.me/Geronimo\n- you can find some information and a guide on: http://leso.epfl.ch/geronimo\n\nYou have a main GUI window to give options and start the simulation, and a\nlittle command window in which you can see the started commands. It is an\neasy was to learn by trying the shown commands and looking at the\ncorresponding .rad files.\n\nHoping this helps,\nBest,\nJerome\n\nDr J?r?me KAEMPF\n<jk at kaemco.ch>\n*[image: EPFL] <http://people.epfl.ch/kaempf> *// team leader *urban\nsystems simulation*\n[image: kaemco] <http://www.kaemco.ch> // founder and managing partner\n\n[image: bandeau_email_encadre] <http://cisbat.org/>\n\n2015-06-16 23:37 GMT+02:00 Christian Sarmiento <csarmiento at ufl.edu>:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150618/f76547fc/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: image003.jpg\nType: image/jpeg\nSize: 7951 bytes\nDesc: not available\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150618/f76547fc/attachment-0001.jpg>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Using BSDF materials", "tags": [], "sender": "=?UTF-8?B?SsOpcsO0bWUgS8OkbXBm?=", "datetime": "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 09:54:59 +0200"}
