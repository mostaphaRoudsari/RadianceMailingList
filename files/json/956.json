The first line in the keys.vf  file\ndoes not have a -t parameter. The first line should always be -t 0 and\nevery line needs to have -t parameter assigned.\n\nrcalc is very unforgiving in this regard. Since your first line did not\nmatch the format it just stopped. It is also very sensitive to trailing\nwhitespace, thus if you had \"-t 0 \" as opposed to \"-t 0\" this would also\ncause a problem.\n\nHopefully this will get you past this piece and onto the next.\n\n-Jack\n\nTarik Rahman wrote:\n\n\n--\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20041108/39320960/attachment-0001.html\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] problems creating animation viewfi", "tags": [], "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "datetime": "Mon Nov  8 19:25:50 2004"}
