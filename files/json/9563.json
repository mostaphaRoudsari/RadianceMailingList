Install Radiance (add it to path... that is a matter of checking the\noption)\n2. Install a perl interpreter... I used THIS <http://strawberryperl.com/>\n3. Then, in order to use genBSDF (at least for me), you have to write\nthe whole directory... What I usually do is just copy and paste the program\nin the folder where you are going to work in.\n4. run 'perl genBSDF.pl ....'\n\nAnyone knows why the perl scripts are not recognized as part of the PATH?\n\nHope it helps!\n\nBye\n\n2015-06-18 10:27 GMT-03:00 Ikrima Amaireh <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk>:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150618/978dda8c/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Installation and Running", "tags": [], "sender": "=?UTF-8?Q?Germ=C3=A1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 13:47:56 -0300"}
