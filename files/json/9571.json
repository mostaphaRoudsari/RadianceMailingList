{"body": "\nDear all,\n\nthe rtcontrib lesson has found a new home here:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.html\n\nThere are likely to be many typos, mistakes and inconsistencies left in\nit, but it's mostly done: Dynamic daylight simulations with Radiance's\nrtcontrib can be done. Well, sort of-ish.\n\nAs to the software--All scripts that are provided with the tutorial are\navailable as a download. The link is on the page. Everything was written\nto get a particular task done. There is absolutely no flexibility built\ninto any of the code. If you do decide to try some of the things that I\nhave covered and come up with some better/more elegant/more configurable\nsoftware or command lines, I'd be happy to hear from you. Please\nconsider sharing your experience.\n\nThank you all for the feedback, especially Greg! You've been extremely\nhelpful.\n\nCheers\n\nAxel\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Understanding rtcontrib", "sender": "Axel Jacobs", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4B67512D.2010807@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4b5b5562.aa13f30a.77e2.ffff9f3eSMTPIN_ADDED@mx.google.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Feb  1 14:02:55 2010", "email": "jacobs.axel at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Understanding rtcontrib"}
