Doing so the summation of the triad irradiance values should be multiplied to 179 efficacy function to give illuminance ( I = 179*(0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB)). What I don?t understand is why these weighting functions are used in calculation of radiometric quantities like irradiance ( I = 0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB). You said you calculate everything in grey (r=g=b) to avoid this problem. Shall I ask what do you mean by everything? What is the luminous reflectance of the grey you use? Moreover, is it possible to measure the effective irradiance with respect to C-lambda using adjusted weighting functions? Should the summation of the weighting functions be again equal to 1 as they are for V-lambda?\n\nCheers,\nParisa\n\n\n\nOn 22 Jun 2015, at 18:24, Jan Wienold <jan.wienold at epfl.ch> wrote:\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150622/03cc2d6f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<558836B9.5070907@epfl.ch>", "tags": [], "sender": "Parisa Khademagha", "datetime": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 23:59:42 +0200"}
