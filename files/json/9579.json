My question is whether using these C-lambda weighting functions\nis a correct way of getting effective irradiance with respect to C-lambda\nin W/m2 or not?\n\nSecond option is to use the spectral rendering as suggested by Ruppertsberg\n& Bloj (2008) in their paper (entitled *?Creating physically accurate\nvisual stimuli for free: Spectral rendering with RADIANCE?*) . In this case\nmy question is how can I spectrally model the sky?\n\nCheers,\n\nParisa\n\nOn 22 June 2015 at 23:57, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150624/90977cd6/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CF0B4046-DA6E-482B-8BB0-19F64EA4D069@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "parisa khademagha", "datetime": "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 15:04:12 +0200"}
