If, on the other hand, the RGB coefficients from David & Arne's paper were somehow computed to correlate with other aspects of irradiance, such as photopic adaptation, then you probably should use them as given.  I guess I need to read their paper....\n\nA full spectral calculation probably is not needed in this case, but it would help to have a good estimate of the sky color either way.  You should check out Mark Stock's implementation of the Utah sky model using Radiance:\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/radiance\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150624/efd437c3/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<CAPysv6D4ruQ6x1FHvHZ6q-dFVwpzikMVLsMyF85wgJWEQeRGQA@mail.gmail.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 10:15:36 -0700"}
