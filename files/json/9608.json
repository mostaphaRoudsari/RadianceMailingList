I used John's script a few times for work and modified it for an art project as well, but I cannot find any of that stuff at the moment. If I unearth it I'll post a sample of John's code, but as Thomas points out Gensky gives you most of the info you need to do this.\n\n- Rob\n\nOn 7/3/15, 6:23 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at gmail.com<mailto:tbleicher at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nGensky gives you the sun angle as a comment.

Sadly, I was unable to find anything on the net or in Rendering with Radiance to this end. Does anyone know a good source - I would want to avoid having to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n--\nSent from my Android phone with K-9 Mail.
