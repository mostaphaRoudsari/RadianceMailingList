Did you double-check that your actual image size is 1024x591 by running vwrays with the -d option?\n\nSince it stopped after 508 files when there should be 578, I suspect there is a limit under your version of Windows (or MINGW -- whatever environment you are using) to 512 simultaneously open files.  I bet if you use MF:1 it would work.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150709/f86b9014/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<2067453378.1943189.1436455826364.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 9 Jul 2015 09:04:17 -0700"}
