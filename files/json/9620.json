But what if I want I to use MF:2Now, I am using Windows 7 and do you or anyone else know how can I extend the number of open files in Windows?\nBest,Majid\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 9, 2015 6:04 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\nHi Majid,\nNormally, it's not a good idea to use the -ff option under Windows, even in a piped command, but I don't think that is the source of your problem in this case. ?Did you double-check that your actual image size is 1024x591 by running vwrays with the -d option?\nSince it stopped after 508 files when there should be 578, I suspect there is a limit under your version of Windows (or MINGW -- whatever environment you are using) to 512 simultaneously open files. ?I bet if you use MF:1 it would work.\nBest,-Greg\n\n\n\n\nDear all,\nI tried to work with rcontrib together with reinhart.cal in windows 7. When I run it in windows, it gave me 508 HDR files and only 1 kilobyte. I do appreciate if anyone can explain me what is wrong with it?\nHere is the command:\nvwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf ViewFile.vf | rcontrib -ffc -x 1024 -y 591 @test_sky.opt -e MF:2 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins?-o c_%04d.hdr -m sky_glow test.oct\nBest regards,Majid\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150709/502d3031/attachment-0001.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<22B4D8B4-AC02-4324-B05F-55EE7DD6ADE6@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Radiance-general", "datetime": "Thu, 9 Jul 2015 16:20:51 +0000 (UTC)"}
