Andy McNeil has an example of this in the genBSDF tutorial he is writing.  I will send you a draft of it off-list, as he's not quite done editing it.\n\nIn general, genBSDF always creates a virtual surface for sampling, and when you apply it to a surface for rendering, it behaves as a proxy for the actual geometry.  You can of course include real geometry if you like by giving the BSDF primitive a thickness, and this is described in my presentation from a few workshops back:\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW2_New_BSDF.pdf\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF with blinds only?", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 09:48:06 -0700"}
