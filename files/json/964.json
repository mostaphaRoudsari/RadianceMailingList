Having this information in the server (where it is\navailable to all clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in\nprevious ver-\nsions of X that required you to maintain defaults files on every\nmachine that you might use.  It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults\nwithout editing files.\n\nso, sticking to the X WIndow System standards, one would put lines like\n\nradiance.rvu.x:800\nradiance.rvu.y:600\n\nin a file and read that at start up of X. (xrdb -merge .Xdefaults would\nbe typically used in a .xinitrc file at startup)\n\nConcerning overriding the aspect ratio given in the view with that of\npixel dimensions: rshow had (and has) the same problem and being able to\nselect the behaviour is nice. To avoid yet another cmdline option in\nrvu, setting one pixel dimension would set the other pixel dimension\nfrom the aspect ratio given in the view file, whereas two user supplied\npixel dimensions will fix the view aspect ratio. That'll be backward\ncompatible too.\n\n-Peter\n\n--\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<4190DB7B.4050501@rumblestrip.org>", "tags": [], "sender": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "datetime": "Tue Nov  9 18:20:43 2004"}
