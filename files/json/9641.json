Now I?m close to\nthe results, there?re some errors I can?t fixed. There?re quite\nstraightforward in the terminal, but I have no clue. I?m wondering if\nanyone could help me out. Thank you very much in advance.\n\n\n1) The terminal says: cannot open scene feel ?art_mat.rad?, but I do have\nthe file in art_lib. After searching all the files with\nart_lib/art_mat.rad, I didn?t know what else to do. Additionally, I checked\nmy .profile and .bashrc, they both have ?.? to the RAYPATH variable.\n\n2) The terminal keeps giving me the errors concerning the views, no matter\nda or db. For instance, it says ?bad view? if I linked the view files to\nthe ones in view_lib directory. If I just wrote down the view in\nscene2_d.rif, it gives me ?view up parallel to view direction?

(\\\n\nI?m sharing my files below.\nThank you.\n\n\n--\n*Zhe Kong*\n*PhD Student*\n*University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee *\n*School of Architecture and Urban Planning *\n*2131 E.
