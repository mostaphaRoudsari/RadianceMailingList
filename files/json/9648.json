I set up a scene\nconsisting of two spheres, one completely specular and one Lambertian, lit\nit with one of Paul Debevec's light probes (\nhttp://www.pauldebevec.com/Probes/). The specular sphere is rendering fine,\nbut the Lambertian one is turning up completely black, and I have no idea\nwhy.\n\nMy code looks like this:\n\n# make environment map\nvoid colorpict uff\n9 red green blue uffizi_probe.hdr angmap.cal sb_u sb_v -rx 90\n0 0\n\nuff glow uff_glow\n0 0 4 1 1 1 0\n\n!genbox uff_glow boxenv 100 100 100 -i | xform -t -50 -50 -50\n\n# make materials\nvoid plastic spec # specular\n0 0 5 .5 .5 .5 1.000000 0.000000\n\nvoid plastic lamb # Lambertian\n0 0 5 1 1 1 0.0 0.0\n\n# make spheres\nspec sphere sph1 # specular\n0 0 4 -.5000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.300000\n\nlamb sphere sph2 # Lambertian\n0 0 4  .5000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.300000\n\nI then ran it like this:\n\noconv scene.rad > scene.oct\nrvu -vtv -vv 10 -vh 10 -vp 0 -10 0 scene.oct\n\nWhen I do this, I get a mirrored sphere and a completely black sphere. To\nmake sure that the problem wasn't with my code, I downloaded this sample\ncode from Debevec's website (http://www.pauldebevec.com/RNL/Source/). When\nI changed the materials in the .rad file to be Lambertian (lines 182-190 in\nrnl_scene.rad), the objects rendered as completely black.\n\nHas anybody ever run into this problem before? I am using RADIANCE 4.2, on\nOS X 10.7 (home) and OS X 10.9 (work).\n\nRegards,\n\nMJ\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150720/ac8a37c6/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Minjung Kim", "datetime": "Mon, 20 Jul 2015 21:41:12 -0400"}
