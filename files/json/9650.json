That did the trick.\n\nI have two follow-up questions:\n\n(1) When I set the environment map, I also tried including an additional\ndirect light source. Shouldn't the direct source have illuminated the\nLambertian sphere? I tried setting the intensity of the direct source to be\nvery high and the environment map to be low, just in case the environment\nmap was washing out the influence of the direct source -- but still, the\nLambertian sphere rendered completely black. Is it not possible to combine\nthe environment map with additional light sources?\n\n(2) I want the lighting to be from an environment map, but there to be\nadditional \"environment\" that the specular object reflects. More precisely,\nI want the specular object to be reflecting a world defined by a texture\npattern, but using the lighting pattern from an environment map. Does that\nmake sense?\n\nRegards,\n\nMJ\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 20, 2015 at 11:16 PM, Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150721/a047e524/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering with environment maps", "tags": [], "sender": "Minjung Kim", "datetime": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 13:24:11 -0400"}
