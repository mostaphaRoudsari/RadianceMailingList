What percentage of \"holiness\" does the surface possess, on average?  Are the wholes aligned in a grid or a hexagonal pattern?  Are you going to be in a rendering position where you actually see the holes, or do you just want the correct average behavior with a minimum of noise?\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modelling perforated materials", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 20:51:58 -0700"}
