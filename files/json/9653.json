The open area is 40%. The viewing position is at a distance, so correct average behaviour might work, however I am relying on the inside surface of the holes to reflect light to the viewer, so I?m not sure how using a trans material or suchlike would work in this case. The plan was to render one panel to show effect of being internally when veiwed from below on ground level.\n\nThanks,\nJohn.\n\n(may be duplicated- replied from wrong address)\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150722/4be39be9/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] modelling perforated materials", "tags": [], "sender": "John Ford", "datetime": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 14:23:04 +1000"}
