But maybe this is a nonsensical thing to\ndo, since the light probes contain scene structure in there? I'm not sure.\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\nRegards,\n\nMJ\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150722/fd5d6090/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering with environment maps", "tags": [], "sender": "Minjung Kim", "datetime": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 17:42:39 -0400"}
