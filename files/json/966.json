{"body": "\nThanks for your reply, Greg!\n\nThe purpose is to try to manipulate a holodeck file in terms of inserting an\nartificial object (like a mirrored shpere) into a laser scan of a room. Of\ncourse it is possible to do so in the appropriate .rad file (or in the octree),\nbut I was just wondering if it's also possible to do it directly by changing\nthe actual holodeck file. This is why I wanted to see the actual values.\n\n-Olga\n\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck file", "sender": "O Graf", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<1087815954.40d6c1122ab97@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "refs": ["<1087739284.40d595942ea25@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "<C1F5FD5D-C342-11D8-B62A-00306540F848@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 21 13:05:58 2004", "email": "s0343631 at sms.ed.ac.uk", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck file"}
