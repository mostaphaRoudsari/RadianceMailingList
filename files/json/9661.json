How does one use (select and\ncombine?) the appropriate release/pre-release files to compile a fully\nfunctional program suite? Presently, I need the original functionality\nplus the ability to compute caustics (making the latest official release\ninsufficient).\n\nI am sure this is a common issue, but without access to a convenient\nsource of organized information (i.e., a wiki), I find myself fumbling\nwith Google searches and generally lost.\n\nThanks again,\nChris\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Chris Kallie", "datetime": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 11:16:08 -0400"}
