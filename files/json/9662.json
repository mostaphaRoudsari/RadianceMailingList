I managed to install rad4R0supp.tar.gz\nand radiance-HEAD.tgz. However, I had to install XQuartz to avoid\nerrors. Still lots of installation warnings though.\n\nAlso, the github releases seem to be different than the releases\nmentioned above. Other than warnings, my standard (non-github)\ninstallations seem to be working. I might benefit from using CMake, but\nI don't know how to use it.\n\nAs long as the warnings are non-problematic, I am happy with the\ninstallations that seem to be working.\n\nThanks for your help!\n-Chris\n\nInstallation output, in case the devs find them useful..\n\n1) Radiance 4.2 installation (output: www.kallie.org/RadInfo/Rad42info.txt )\n2) Radiance-4.2.2.tar.gz did not have a lib folder, so I tried adding\none, but it installed with errors (output:\nwww.kallie.org/RadInfo/Rad422info.txt )\n3) rad4R0supp.tar.tz and radiance-HEAD.tgz (output:\nwww.kallie.org/RadInfo/Rad50info.txt )\n\n\n\nOn 7/31/15 11:49 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] instructions for compiling pre-releases", "tags": [], "sender": "Chris Kallie", "datetime": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 19:00:35 -0400"}
