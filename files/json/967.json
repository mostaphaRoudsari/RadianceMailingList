{"body": "\nHi Olga,\n\n\nI don't recommend inserting samples into a holodeck for this purpose,\nbut you could create one or more rpict pictures and use rhcopy to add\nthese to the holodeck manually.  Adding the object to the octree is a\nmuch more robust solution, however.  If you were to insert samples\nusing rhcopy, you could end up with some odd reconstruction errors in\nrholo.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck file", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4440EC32-C37E-11D8-80D0-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1087739284.40d595942ea25@sms.ed.ac.uk>", "<C1F5FD5D-C342-11D8-B62A-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "<1087815954.40d6c1122ab97@sms.ed.ac.uk>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 21 14:27:09 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: output in holodeck file"}
