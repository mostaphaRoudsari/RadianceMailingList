My\nmaterial is now behaving more or less how I want it to :-) .\n\nIn fact the main problem was, that the function for the direct-diffuse\nmust be a vector function, which I didn't realize before :-[ .\nAfter some tests I realized as well, that this function doesn't\ndistinguish between transmission and reflection per se, but with some\nsimple dot-products in the cal-file between the rays and the surface\nnormal I can distinguish this as well.\n\nA small remaining question is how to specify additional parameters to be\n\"transferred\" to the function in the cal file. If I specify the A10\n(within the description of BRTFfunc) , I can access A10 from the cal\nfile as well. In case I specify a \"A11\" or \"A12\" or more, I can't access\nthem (error message \"rtrace: A11`testfunc: undefined variable\"),\nalthough I specified them in the BRTDfunc description. Of course I can\nhard-code these properties in the cal file, but it would be nicer if I\ncan specify it in the material descriptions.\nAnd: A10 is not used per se by BRTDfunc, or? So at least I can use this\none. But I would have 3 other parameters to be submitted to the functions.\n\nthank you so much!\n\nJan\n\n\n\nAm 8/6/15 um 12:51 AM schrieb Greg Ward:\n\n--\nDr.-Ing.
