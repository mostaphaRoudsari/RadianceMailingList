I ran some tests varying the -aa parameter while holding all other input parameters constant. To my surprise, the execution of a rendering with -aa 0 took 1.6 hours and the a rendering with -aa 0.01 has taken 15 hours and has only finished 28%.\n\nWhat is considered to be the most accurate rendering? One with no ambient interpolation (-aa 0) or a low error interpolation (-aa 0.01) ?\n\nOverall, what rpict input parameters that will produce the most accurate rendering? Currently, I'm using the following parameter settings, for my \"truth\" renderings that I'm assuming are as accurate as reasonably possible.\n\nGeneral Parameters: -lr 9 -lw 0.0005 -ps 4 -pt 0.05\nSpecular Parameters: -ss 2 -st 0 -as 256\nDirect Parameters: -dr 3 -dp 1024 -ds 0 -dt 0 -dc 1\nAmbient Parameters: -ab 11 -aa 0 -ar 256 -ad 2048\n\nPlease let me know if you think I'm missing some important parameters that affect the rendering accuracy.\n\nThank you for your input,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150806/4ceab425/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311", "datetime": "Thu, 6 Aug 2015 14:34:33 +0000"}
