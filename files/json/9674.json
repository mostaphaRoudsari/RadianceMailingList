That said, there is a table that discusses various rendering parameters and is a good place to start.  Unfortunately, it is badly in need of an update:\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/rpict_options.html\n\nThis same out-of-date text file sits in the ray/doc/notes directory of the standard distribution.\n\nThe main thing to be aware of is that changing the -aa setting alone is no guarantee of overall accuracy, since this parameter *only* controls the indirect irradiance interpolation accuracy.  If the indirect irradiance values themselves are wrong due to a too-low setting of the -ad parameter (for example), then improving the interpolation won't help you.  This goes for the other parameters as well.  You can think of each as a link in a chain.  It would be great to have an overall accuracy setting, but that would require a much more basic (and necessarily slower) calculation method, such as naive Monte Carlo, to work.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150806/b6f7a108/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<88079A360FAC7441AE93ECBF61998236274596E6@AMXExMb02.global.arup.com>", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Thu, 6 Aug 2015 09:24:44 -0700"}
