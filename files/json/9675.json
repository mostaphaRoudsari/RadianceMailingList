When you use a\nnon-zero -aa value, your ray paths that have gone through differing numbers\nof bounces to affect the ambient lighting calculation. Thus, it may not be\na fair comparison to use the same -lr and -lw values for comparing -aa 0 to\n-aa 0.01. Instead, you might need to choose a smaller -lw or possibly a\nlarger -lr for your -aa 0 simulation. I've tested a few scenes where I get\nsignificantly more illumination by using a non-zero -aa value, all other\nsettings being equal, and I generally believe the non-zero -aa simulations\nto give closer results to physically measured values.\n\nAlso, perhaps Greg can correct me on this, but I'm not sure if there's\nanything to be gained by setting -ab larger than -lr when -lr is positive.\n\nCheers,\n\nNathaniel\n\nOn Thu, Aug 6, 2015 at 12:24 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150807/9220497f/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "<A970E805-183F-4156-AAA2-688B163A021C@lmi.net>", "tags": [], "sender": "Nathaniel Jones", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Aug 2015 12:05:27 -0400"}
