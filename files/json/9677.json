I am asking\nthis because I want to add this feature to the plugin I am developing.\n\nWhat is the recommended method for modelling luminaires in Radiance? I\nintend to use IES files as input. Hopefully I would also have the geometry,\nbut I have to consider cases when this is not available.\n\nI know there is an IES2RAD program, but I am not quite sure how general it\nis. Also, I have heard about the use of illums (a sphere, for example) that\ncovers the entire luminaire....?\n\nI am kind of lost, so if someone could give me a hint, I would really\nappreciate it.\n\nAlso, if someone know where to find information about IES files and their\nformat, that would also be really helpful.\n\nTHANKS\n\nGerm?n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150807/37370cb5/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "=?UTF-8?Q?Germ=C3=A1n_Molina_Larrain?=", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Aug 2015 15:09:20 -0300"}
