Negative numbers in the file can be used to indicate if a dimension indicates a dimension of a round rather than rectangular shape. In manufacturer IES data the geometric information is often missing altogether, Z dimension is omitted for recessed luminaires, or the X and Y dimensions are in the wrong places in relation to the photometric distribution.\n\nIf you use the IES2RAD command it will produce a geometric definition of the luminaire based purely on the X Y Z dimension definition in the IES file. So it?s best to correct the dimensions by editing the IES file with a text editor prior to running IES2RAD. Otherwise once you run IES2RAD it?s easier to make a mistake if you scale the fixture geometry and scale the intensity accordingly after the conversion.\n\n-Chris\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150807/c14acb85/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminaire modelling using Radianc", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Fri, 7 Aug 2015 19:14:31 +0000"}
