The\nglow is transparent, so that the geometry can be seen, and direct\nillumination does not pass through the glow, so light can be used internal\nto the glow to give the luminaire a realistic look.\n\nThe glow geometry and description may be generated by ies2rad. IIRC only\nfour shapes are supported: sphere, rectangular, cuboid (box), and thin disc.\n\nIes2rad does not support eulumdat and again, IIRC, has not been updated to\nsupport the latest IES photometry standard, LM-63-02.\n\n--\nRandolph M.
