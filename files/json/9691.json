These are the \"mirror\" type you mention below, and photon-mapping, which is incorporated in the latest HEAD.\n\n\nYou need to know the reflectance of your glass, not the transmittance, in order to use the mirror type appropriately.  Then, you can give the original glass as the \"alternate\" type.  Most uncoated glass surfaces have a specular reflectance of between 4 and 8% depending on their transparency.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Irradiance ma", "tags": [], "sender": "Greg Ward", "datetime": "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 10:08:23 -0700"}
