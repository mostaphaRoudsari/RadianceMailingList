By default this is -st 0.15 if not otherwise defined, so a glass definition with specular reflectance less than 0.15 could be ignored. I suspect -st 0.01 is more desirable for most typical simulations unless there are many parallel specular planes where it's desirable to leave out more specular component calculations.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150810/cfebfeab/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Irradiance ma", "tags": [], "sender": "Christopher Rush", "datetime": "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:56:57 +0000"}
