So, Daysim (with its current old version Radiance binaries) can do that; isn't it? At the same time, one can still say that simulations are based on the powerful Radiance tools, does that sound right, too?\n\nSo far, I don't think I still need to use BSDF as there is no need for 3- nor 5-phase methods for such level of work!\n\nCan you please correct me if there is something wrong with my understanding/assumptions?\n\nBest regards\nIkrima\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: 11 August 2015 17:00\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\nradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n1.

These get stored in c:\\DAYSIM\\bin\\ after installation on Windows.\nUnfortunately the binaries are based on an older Radiance version, so you miss some options like using BSDF data. Still, Daysim is perfectly serviceable for most cases. I hope I understood your question.\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\nOn 8/11/2015 11:09 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150811/db767220/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\nEnd of Radiance-general Digest, Vol 138, Issue 22\n*************************************************\n\n\n\n\nThis message and any attachment are intended solely for the addressee\nand may contain confidential information.
