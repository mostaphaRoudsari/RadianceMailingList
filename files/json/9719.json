The artifacts look like a\nwhite, or sometimes half-black and half-white, patch at random locations.\nSee below for examples:\n\nhttp://minjung.ca/tmp/artifacts1.png\nhttp://minjung.ca/tmp/artifacts2.png\n\nI've tried (1) setting ad = 4096, as = 1024, and (2) setting aa = 0, ar =\n0, but neither of these two settings fixed the problem. Do you have any\nidea what might be happening? Here are some possibly relevant factors:\n\n- The object is completely Lambertian.\n- The only light source in the scene is a glow source that is positioned\nbehind the camera, and covers as much of the sky as possible.\n- I don't think I've ever encountered such artifacts with untextured\nstimuli.  I could be wrong, though.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nMJ\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20150817/829cd542/attachment.html>\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] strange artifacts in rendering", "tags": [], "sender": "Minjung Kim", "datetime": "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 17:30:37 -0400"}
