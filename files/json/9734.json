{"body": "\nHello.\n\nI have finally managed to modified the falsecolor script to produce\nlegends with \"round\" values instead of the default \"in between\"\nvalues. And while I was at it I also added an option to clip the\nmagenta background of full colour plots.\n\nThe script and example images are here:\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2\n\nIt is still a csh script so it's no use for Windows (although at some\npoint I considered rewriting the whole thing in Python. I am really\nnot a csh man ...)\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f1003231437oe2619dbq190053060fa87140@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Mar 23 14:37:36 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] falsecolor evolution"}
