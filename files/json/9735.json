{"body": "\nDear Alejandro,\nIt has been my experience that when creating interior partitions and pillars in Ecotect the intersecting planes can make some of your outside walls disappear. Making your model incomplete the fact that you are getting 100% in a closed box leads me to believe you are having a modeling issue and not a daysim issue. Check your visualize screen and make sure all your planes  are present\n\nRegards,\n\nTim Metcalfe\nKalwall Corporation\nDaylight Modeling Group\n1111 Candia Road\nManchester, N.H. 03105\n1(800)258-9777 X4483\nP  Please consider your environmental responsibility before printing this e-mail\n\n\n________________________________\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.
