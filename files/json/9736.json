{"body": "\nDear Alejandro,\n\n\n\nDaysim/Radiance does not distinguish between simple and simple geometries. (Of course, if a sensor is located  in a wall it should yield zero lighting unless your ambient accuracy value is set too high.) My suspicion is that you are reading in a wrong set of sensor points into Ecotect. Ecotect has no intrinsic way of making sure that a DA file actually goes with your current sensor grind. It is up to you to make sure that the two are consistent.\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\nSent: Tuesday, March 23, 2010 10:10 AM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHi all;\n\nI?m been using Daysim for a few weeks now and I?m getting some strange results that does?t make sence to me. I?m using ecotect from wicht I export to daysim and when it?s finish I import the results into ecotect again.\n\nI receiveng 0% DA near a window and 100% inside a close space with no windows. This seems to happen only when I create a grid inside a space with a lot of internal subdivisions  like walls and pillars. Also seems to happen only when the grid covers multiple orientations. When is only one (north, south, etc) this does?n happen either.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this using daysim true ecotect????\n\nAnyone knows the problem?\n\n--\nALEJANDRO CASTRO HERNANDEZ\nArchitect | Pontificia Universidad Cat?lica de Chile\nSantiago, Chile\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100323/88084f84/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] wrong results in Daysim", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF069897F0@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<75738c941003230710v792c9c3bp4f5bfabcc101cdc4@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar 23 07:39:29 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] wrong results in Daysim"}
