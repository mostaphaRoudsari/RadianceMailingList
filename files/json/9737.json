{"body": "\nHi all;\nI?m been using Daysim for a few weeks now and I?m getting some strange\nresults that does?t make sence to me. I?m using ecotect from wicht I export\nto daysim and when it?s finish I import the results into ecotect again.\nI receiveng 0% DA near a window and 100% inside a close space with no\nwindows. This seems to happen only when I create a grid inside a space with\na lot of internal subdivisions  like walls and pillars. Also seems to happen\nonly when the grid covers multiple orientations. When is only one (north,\nsouth, etc) this does?n happen either.\nDoes anyone else experience this using daysim true ecotect????\nAnyone knows the problem?\n\n--\nALEJANDRO CASTRO HERNANDEZ\nArchitect | Pontificia Universidad Cat?lica de Chile\nSantiago, Chile\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100323/b58386e6/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Alejandro Castro Hernandez", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<75738c941003230710v792c9c3bp4f5bfabcc101cdc4@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Tue Mar 23 07:10:00 2010", "email": "alejandro.c.energyarq at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] wrong results in Daysim"}
