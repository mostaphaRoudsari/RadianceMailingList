{"body": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI have a situation where I'm using ies2rad to bring files into\nradiance.  Only I want to attach the photometric info to illum surfaces\nsurrounding my detailed fixture geometry rather than to the default\ngeometry...  (pretty typical I think) However in order to do so, I have\nto add rectangles in order to \"seal\" my fixture.  I am concerned that\nthe addition of these rectangles will affect the magnitude of the\nphotometric information.\n\nI guess one way to not even deal with boxing the luminaire with illums\nis to attach a negative value to the lamp's glow material.  Then rays\nwon't \"sneak out\".  Of course the lamps won't add internal illumination\nin that case.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.  I will try and run some tests when\nI get a chance.\n\nThanks.\n\nMark\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040623/31f463cf/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Mark de la Fuente", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<s0d9b93a.064@wmtao.com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun 24 00:09:36 2004", "email": "MdelaFuente at wmtao.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES file manipulation"}
