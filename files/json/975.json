Try:\nls /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.*\n\nThe file is there on my OS X 10.3.6 machine and should be installed if\nyou have X11-support!\n\nOne more hint, you can perfectly remote-control linux- and other\nix-machines from your OS X laptop using ssh, even X11-windows can be\nredirected to your laptop. IMHO it's better to use \"real\" computers for\nlarge renderings, I don't like to overheat my laptop by having 100% cpu\nfor hours...\n\nI will make some 3.6 binaries and provide them on my binary-pages as\nsoon as I find the time.\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n", "isquestion": false, "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance within Mac OSX", "tags": [], "sender": "Lars O.
