{"body": "\nSorry, I plead ignorance to how X11 gets installed under various\nversions of Mac OS X.  Mine was pre-installed, I think.  There is a\nsymbolic link from /usr/lib/X11R6 to X11 (in the same directory) on my\nmachine, but I'm not sure how it got there.  There are only dynamic\nversions of the X11 libraries near as I can tell, so static linking\nfor the purposes of binary distribution isn't supported.\n\nRob G's suggestion to recompile yourself is probably best.  Sorry I'm\nnot more help.  Anyone else have a solution?\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 4.0 release", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<456045D8-B3C5-4CFC-A9A1-9B0D634F6493@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<1BA2D45C-215E-4900-B63D-285A412ACDA3@gmail.com>", "<B564F6CD0114A44E816C0D68AE8C6E69062A25B6@MKEXCHVS2.Mail.Fiserv.net>"], "datetime": "Wed Mar 17 21:18:56 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Radiance 4.0 release"}
