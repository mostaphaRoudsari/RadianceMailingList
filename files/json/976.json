Some years ago I had some vibrant\ndiscussion with Iebele Abel on this matter. I find it a rather frustrating\nidea to thrash spending much time and effort getting a physically accurate\nrendered image, and thrashing a tremendous amount of image fidelility to get\nthe image printed, there where it counts most. I've been able to get 16-bit\ndata images, but what I'm interested in is getting the full scope.\nThe relevant question indeed is what would be limiting output quality.\nIts quite likely paper of photographic means are only able to output so many\ncolours. I refer to physical limitations, rather than those implied by a\ndata format.\n\nIt seems that film industry has successfully overcome getting lack of colour\nfidelity, also thank to the openEXR format (basically a clumsy rip-off of\nthe radiance image format??) but mostly by actually being able to output the\nfull scope of the data.\n\nSo how would I get this done in print, its quite a concern to me.\n\nBest,\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris", "datetime": "Wed Dec  1 14:14:13 2004"}
