{"body": "\nHi Terrance,\n\nThis is the as-designed behavior for ranimate.  The basic assumption\nis that you have an NFS-shared filesystem or the like where user names\nare preserved.  Therefore, even if you are logging in as a different\nuser on the remote machine, it assumes you want to execute ranimate in\nthe originating user's home directory, and you have set up directory\nand file permissions accordingly.  I suppose I should add a check on\nthe remote directory, and if a full path is given, forego the cd to\nthe originating home directory.\n\nThe recommended workaround if this is not the case is to write your\nown remote ssh-replacement and do whatever custom things you want done\nwith that, assigning the RSH variable in the .ran file.\n\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate Host directive", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<8904822E-1206-4EB3-9874-80582102246D@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<4B9CA17D.3020300@curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar 15 14:29:30 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ranimate Host directive"}
