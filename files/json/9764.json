Records are stored in the file one per line. The\nlines can be of the format \"x y z value\" or \"x y z dx dy dz value\".\nYou can produce this output with the \"-oodv\" option for rtrace and a\nbit of rcalc:\n\ncat field.fld | rtrace -ab 4 ... -I -oodv scene.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3-1;$4=$4;$5=$5;$6=$6*-1;$7=($7*0.265+$8*0.67+$9*0.065)*179\n\nThe corrections for $3 and $6 is necessary because rtrace with -I\noption reports origin and direction differently.\n\n\nIf you prefer a shorter command line you can calculate only lux (or df\nor whatever) values in a separate file and then use rlam to combine\nthem:\n\nrlam field.fld field.lux > field_import.lux\n\n(that last one is untested).\n\n\nsu2rad doesn't offer an option to run Radiance from within SketchUp\n(yet). I do my programming on a Mac so things get developed and tested\non a Unix type system first and then I work on making them work on\nWindows. su2rad will also always export data in a format that can be\nused with the basic Radiance tools.\n\nCheers,\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] su2rad import numeric results", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f1003121449s3e135b49n3f3de67e60a3bce2@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4B9ABC0F.2090404@transsolar.com>"], "datetime": "Fri Mar 12 14:49:28 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] su2rad import numeric results"}
