{"body": "\nHi Terrance.\n\nSince I upgraded to Snow Leopard I had various problems with compiling\nmy own binaries. Luckily, Radiance's makeall script works fine,\nalthough I only use them on my machine.\n\nWith Snow Leopard Apple switched to gcc 4.2 and a few new core\ntechnologies under the hood.\n\nTo produce binaries that run on 10.4 you have to install the 10.4u SDK\ncomponent of Xcode. To use it you have to set the \"-isysroot\" option\nin gcc.\n\nYou have to use gcc 4.0 as compiler, not gcc 4.2. I think it also only\nworks if you produce 32bit binaries (which you would want to do\nanyway).\n\nPlus there are probably a number of other things. I recently found\nthat I couldn't run an application because OS X 10.5 needs to be at\nthe right patch level ...\n\nAll in all I now think that it is safest to compile on a 10.4 system.\nThis will run on 10.5 and 10.6 but is much less hassle to set up.\n\n\nJust my less-than-2c,\n\nThomas\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Hello Greg,", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<89355c0f1003090156j1ecc7727ma65ce5237bd7f64b@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<4B95D218.6050606@curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar  9 01:56:26 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Hello Greg,"}
