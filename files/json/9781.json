{"body": "\nHi Terrance,\n\nI remember having to deal with this a while back, but I do not recall\nexactly the solution. Nevertheless here are a couple of things to look at:\n\n1. ssh - you may need to set the environment for ssh, when used this\nway (eg ssh command_to_run) it does not use the PATH information\nfound for your standard login shell, you can set the correct PATH\nand RAYPATH. This is done in an \"environment\" file for ssh, check\nthe man page for ssh for further information.\n2. host specification\n1. explicit path in hosts specification- I think that you might\nwant try specifying an explicit path (rather than ~) to the\nlocation where the host needs to look for the animation\nrelated files. Not sure if it makes a difference, you may\nneed to try out the following as tests:\n1. relative to user home dir - ../../../path_to_render_dir\n2. path from root - /path_to_render_dir\n2. mount point - I seem to recall that the easiest thing to do\nis have the mount point and user be the same on master and\nslave nodes. So if you are mounting to /RENDER which is what\nyour slave (render host) nodes see then you should have this\nin your path on the master node. This way you can just cd to\n/RENDER on the master node and run  ranimate job.ranim and\nhave master and slave nodes seeing the same directory\nhierarchy. And this way you do not need to specify path or\nuser in the host specification, eg host= render-host 1\nrather than host= render-host 1 path_to_render_dir alt_user\n3. different users - wouldn't it be easier to just have the\nsame user replicated onto the slave nodes?\n3. samba - I am not sure about this, I have never really been clear\non the difference between the file locking protocols between samba\nand NFS, I guess I will be interested to hear if this works or\nnote, however you may end up needing to use NFS.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Jack\n\n--\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\nTerrance McMinn wrote:\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100308/07089ea0/attachment-0001.htm\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate Host directive", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4B95207A.7080902@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<BF35B0A4E2142940B9C69BB4D6E505A203C901@EXMS3.staff.ad.curtin.edu.au>"], "datetime": "Mon Mar  8 08:06:21 2010", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ranimate Host directive"}
