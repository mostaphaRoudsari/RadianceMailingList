{"body": "\nHi George,\n\nI can't think of anyone in the Chicago area off-hand, but others on\nthe list may be able to refer you (or suggest themselves).\n\nIt looks like the elements in your system are diffusing, which means\nyou could probably model them with standard Radiance using the mkillum\nprogram.  Most advanced users who apply Radiance to daylighting\nproblems should be familiar with this method, and could help you.  It\nwould require some scripting as Lars points out, but this is pretty\nstandard in the context of daylighting problems.\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] radiance programer in Chicago", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<26FF152E-8F54-4C00-89BE-2631C261488E@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<C7B684E9.2C57%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>", "<38D4CE00-F23E-4AF2-9A3C-4E16F1021F35@lmi.net>", "<002401cabd44$23081b00$69185100$@com>"], "datetime": "Sat Mar  6 08:38:40 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] radiance programer in Chicago"}
