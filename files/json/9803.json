{"body": "\nHi Thomas,\n\nI did specify a syncfile. Sorry I guess I left that out in my summary. There is a -F (syncfile) in the args too. The syncfile was simply created at the bash prompt with \"echo 1 8 > syncfile\", so it should not have any character or line ending issues. I will try leaving it all out there on the command line when I get in to the office today.\n\nThomas you mention that OSX is not case sensitive by default? I have never seen this behavior. How does one ensure that it is behaving in a case sensitive manner? Case insensitivity is kind of a problem with rpiece since there are -x and -X, -y and -Y options that are important!\n________________________________________\nSent: Friday, March 05, 2010 2:43 AM\nTo: Radiance general discussion\nOn Thu, Mar 4, 2010 at 9:04 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert\n<Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov> wrote:\n\nYou have not specified either the \"-X -Y\" resolution or an existing\nsyncfile that rpiece should use to coordinate the processes.
