{"body": "\nHi David,\n\nJohn mentioned that a half hour variance can create massive spikes in direct normal irradiance at sunset when calculated from horizontal irradiance data.   I think you have such a discrepancy at the root of your problem.\n\nIrradiance data in weather files is typically the average over the previous hour.  So the irradiance for 10:00 is actually the average irradiance from 9:00 to 10:00.   If this is true of your weather data, then you should subtract  a half hour from the time in the weather data for your gensky command.  That way you are using the average sun position over the hour rather than the ending sun position.\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Mar 2, 2010, at 4:05 PM, David Smith wrote:\n\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Annual illuminance simulation anomaly", "sender": "Andrew McNeil", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<D3256A83-6AB7-46A0-841D-FB852AFA6F3B@gmail.com>", "refs": ["<694e132c1003021605o2b27d2fbgbadb99571da24f07@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Mar  2 17:08:04 2010", "email": "mcneil.andrew at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Annual illuminance simulation anomaly"}
