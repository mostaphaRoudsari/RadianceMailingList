{"body": "\nDear Per,\n\n\n\nThis file is located under Daysim/bin not Daysim/lib. I have been testing the Daysim package under Windows only for a number of years and the program reportedly needs some tuning under Linux-type systems.\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\nSent: Monday, March 01, 2010 5:49 AM\nTo: Radiance Radiance\n\n\nDear users,\n\nJust downloaded and installed Daysim on my Ubuntu Linux machine.  Working my way through chapter 5 in the tutorial Daysim halts loading and converting the climate file for Ottawa for Ex5.1, cf. http://perhaugaard.blogspot.com/2010/03/blog-post.html\n\nWhen I close the daysim window I get the following message: java.io.FileNotFoundExeption: RecentlyOpenedDaysimProjects.dat (Permission denied)\n\nI have granted myself reading and writing permission to all the directories in the daysim library. Does anyone know what could be the problem?\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n\n/Per\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nBruger du Yahoo!?\nEr du tr?t af spam?
