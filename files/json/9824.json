{"body": "\nHi Carlos,\nHi Radiance group,\n\nwe are currently working on an update of photon mapping to the current\nRadiance version and fixing a bug with the -I option of the\nrtrace-version of photon-mapping.\nIn addition to this we are implementing photon-mapping into daysim.\n\nI will announce it as soon when it is available (photon-mapping within\nthe next 6 weeks, daysim-photon-mapping takes a little bit longer).\n\nJan\n\n\nCarlos Ochoa wrote:\n\n\n--\nDipl.-Ing.
