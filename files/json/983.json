{"body": "\n-John\n\nPS.  I'd welcome any reports of using SketchUp to model scenes for\nRadiance.\n\n\n\nI tried exporting a Sketchup model to Rad. It's been a while but I recall\nhaving problems going directly to Radiance with dxf2rad and strata2rad.? I\nexported dxf and then brought that into Infini-D. I also tried going through\nBryce.. and Hash Animation Master\n\nWhen finally got it into Radiance, there were too many unnecessary polygons\n- I ended up Re-modelling the house.\n\nBut now, playing with the 3ds2rad script, it seems to be a much more\nseamless process, not to mention maintaining material properties.\n\nAfter a quick try, Sketchup export to3ds, > 3ds2rad seems to work well.\n\nRob F\n\nPS - when you reply to a message, it directs to\nradiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org\nBut that does'nt seem to make it to the list. I'm always copy/pasting the\nadddress. Is it just my email client (MS Outlook)?\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20040624/3ff72821/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Fitzsimmons, Rob", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<7B2F6EA5E35E214882CB9828962BC3CF04D69544@corvallis>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Thu Jun 24 21:04:07 2004", "email": "Rob.Fitzsimmons at Summit.Fiserv.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] ConRAD / 3ds2rad converter - ArchiCAD -> Radiance"}
