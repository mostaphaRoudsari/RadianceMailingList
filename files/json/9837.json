{"body": "\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI would like to understand how ra_tiff and pcond work.\n\nI'm using pcond specifying contrast (-d) and max luminance (-u) of my\ndisplay. Then I transform my picture (.pic) with ra_tiff to obtain a tiff\npicture.\n\nDoes somebody know which function is applied in ra_tiff to transform a .pic\nin a .tif ? It seems that my picture in .tif has a mean luminance greater\nthan my .pic\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help,\n\n\n\nCoralie\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------\n\nCoralie Cauwerts\n\nFNRS Research Fellow | Ir Architect\n\nUniversite catholique de Louvain\n\nBelgium\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100407/de4c3389/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Coralie Cauwerts", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<003e01cad655$72c7c760$58575620$@cauwerts@uclouvain.be>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Apr  7 06:23:30 2010", "email": "coralie.cauwerts at uclouvain.be", "subject": "[Radiance-general] tone-mapping (pcond and ra_tiff)"}
