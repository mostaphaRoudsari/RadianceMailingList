{"body": "\nThe pcond command does not maintain the original values of the image,\nbut rather adjusts them according to a visual interpretation of what the\nimage should look like when printed or displayed on the screen. If you\nneed to do exposure adjustment but preserve original data try pfilt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\n\nI would like to understand how ra_tiff and pcond work.\n\nI'm using pcond specifying contrast (-d) and max luminance (-u) of my\ndisplay. Then I transform my picture (.pic) with ra_tiff to obtain a\ntiff picture.\n\nDoes somebody know which function is applied in ra_tiff to transform a\n.pic in a .tif ? It seems that my picture in .tif has a mean luminance\ngreater than my .pic\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100407/771a9bcf/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] tone-mapping (pcond and ra_tiff)", "sender": "Coralie Cauwert", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7073DD368@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>", "refs": ["<003e01cad655$72c7c760$58575620$@cauwerts@uclouvain.be>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr  7 06:32:54 2010", "email": "Coralie Cauwerts", "subject": "[Radiance-general] tone-mapping (pcond and ra_tiff)"}
