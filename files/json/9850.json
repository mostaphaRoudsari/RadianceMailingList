{"body": "\nDear Taylor,\n\n\n\nIn Daysim under the Building Tab you select under Shading Device either\n'static shading device (included in geometry)' or your pick one of the\ntwo dynamic blind option. The first case is equivalent to 'no blinds'.\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of\nTaylor Sharpe\nSent: Tuesday, April 13, 2010 8:49 PM\nTo: radiance-general@radiance-online.org\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\n\n\nI'm brand new to Radiance, and I'm using DAYSim with Google Sketchup.\n\n\n\nMy first question is simple: does the model always assume that there are\nblinds installed in the building?  Is there a way to tell the program\nthat there are no blinds?  How can I compare a model with blinds to a\nmodel without?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-Taylor Sharpe\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100414/d11443dc/attachment.html\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Blinds", "sender": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.or", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF06C381B3@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>", "refs": ["<g2geea676221004131748m4c3f9008n124d24baf0791fc0@mail.gmail.com>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 14 05:01:50 2010", "email": "radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Blinds"}
