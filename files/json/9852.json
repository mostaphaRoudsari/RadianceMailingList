{"body": "\nThere are currently two blind models in Daysim:\n\nSimple (quick and dirty): Just assumes that when the blinds are down\nthey are down for all openings in a building and block all direct\nsunlight and 75% of diffuse daylight.\n\nAdvanced (takes time to calculate): The user has to provide one or more\nadditional Radiance files with an explicit blind model (individual\nslats) in it. Two or more sets of daylight coefficients are then being\nexplicitly calculated with the base scene geometry plus the various\nblind settings.\n\nChristoph\n\n-----Original Message-----\n[mailto:radiance-general-bounces@radiance-online.org] On Behalf Of Lars\nO.
