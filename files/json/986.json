As\nalready mentioned, the best way today is to use those new fancy laser\nprinters which use rgb directly without color space conversion.\n\nApart from color fidelity, another question which might come into play\nis to apply a tonemapping process on the HDR image before converting it\nto rgb. The old Radiance had the pquish script, the newer versions have\nthe 'pcomp' program for that purpose. This applys a partially nonlinear\ncompression to preserve detail in the highlight/dark regions which\notherwise would be over/underexposed, in other words it allows to\ncompress the image to a contrast range fitting that of the output\nmachine (which definitely is the final limiting factor in the whole chain)\n\n-cb\n\n\n", "isquestion": true, "replyTo": "", "tags": [], "sender": "Carsten Bauer", "datetime": "Thu Dec  2 10:33:53 2004"}
