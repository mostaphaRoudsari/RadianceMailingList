{"body": "\nI am modeling a large amount of physical blinds in an office scene. I am\nreplicating a Warema blind that has an opaque surface (grey) on the convex\nside and a chrome surface (93% reflective) on the concave side. To minimize\nthe amount of geometry I was hoping there is an easy way to apply two\nmaterials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than\ndouble the geometry.\n\nI have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking\nfor. I hope there is an easy way to do this.\n\nFor instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side\nis the opaque material.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100421/7f0ce998/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Nick Hubof", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<002701cae16e$0d67a970$2836fc50$@com>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Wed Apr 21 09:21:58 2010", "email": "nhubof at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] two sided surface"}
