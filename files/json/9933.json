{"body": "\nHi Andy,\n\nIt is very easy to throw Linux on a Mac if you have vmfusion\n(www.vmware.com) or parallels\n(http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/). From my own usage of\nvmfusion, all you need to do is download the latest Ubuntu or Kubuntu\nlivecd (www.ubuntu.net - gnome desktop version or www.kubuntu.net for\nthe kde desktop version). Create a new virtual appliance, and set the cd\nto point to the iso download. No need to allocate any virtual disks -\nset memory to 1024 or better and go. (Best to have 2GB of memory or\nbetter in the host computer or it will be very slow.)\n\nOnce running, go to the software download area and download/install\nradiance from the repository or from the terminal use 'sudo apt-get\ninstall radiance radiance-doc radiance-materials' to download and\ninstall radiance.\n\nAlternative images with radiance pre-installed can be found at\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/ Learnix for Axel Jacob's version or my\nown under the Curtin link - many thanks to Axel for hosting this for me.\n\nBy the way vmplayer - a free download for Linux and Windows, allows\nLinux and Windows to run/create virtual appliances. This is how we teach\nRadiance at Curtin on PC's running Windows XP/Pro.\n\n*Terrance Mc Minn\n**Lecturer\n*School of Built Environment\nCurtin University of Technology\nPhone: +618 9266 7175\nFax: +618 9266 2711\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/attachments/20100501/1b096955/attachment.htm\n", "replyTo": "", "sender": "Terrance Mc Minn", "isquestion": true, "tags": [], "id": "<4BDBB925.5060209@curtin.edu.au>", "refs": [], "datetime": "Fri Apr 30 22:16:38 2010", "email": "t.mcminn at curtin.edu.au", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Re: trans dashboard widget"}
