{"body": "\nHi Nick,\n\nUnfortunately, you've hit upon the one case that Radiance doesn't\nreally handle properly:  curved, specular window coverings.  Your best\nhope at this point is to add some roughness to the specular side of\nyour surface and use mkillum to generate an output distribution.  If\nyou could measure a BTDF for the blinds and give it to mkillum that\nway, you'd be golden, but I don't expect that you have such a thing.\n\nEventually, we hope to create a tool that would allow you to model\nthis (and other types) complex fenestration, but we're a few months\naway from having that ready.\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] two sided surface", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<9F5FC7D2-7EA7-4B1D-A0D9-BF918BEFE8BB@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<0M093M-1NHYTe0IIe-00uuOS@mrelay.perfora.net>", "<002a01cae248$45484f90$cfd8eeb0$@com>", "<001701cae877$6fd87750$4f8965f0$@com>"], "datetime": "Fri Apr 30 08:52:05 2010", "email": "gregoryjward at gmail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] two sided surface"}
