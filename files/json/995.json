{"body": "\nHi Mark,\n\nThat should work -- set the three real illum arguments to zero, though,\nso it won't try to contribute to the output.\n\n-Greg\n\nGreg, in this case I'm looking at a 20' linear fluorescent\nIndirect/Direct pendant.? The IES file is for a 4' section and I would\narray it 5 times.? A sphere with 2' diameter would probably not work if\nthe suspension length were?less than 2' since this is a partially\nindirect pendant..? Also, not sure if having the pendant poking through\nthe illum sphere would work.\n?\nI thought of a different way of handling this.? Since the ies2rad\nprogram creates the top and bottom?rectangles in this case,?why not\njust use an illum material with a void modifier to create the edges of\nthe box?\n?\nThanks for the response.? It would certainly be faster to use the -i\noption.\n?\nMark\n?\n\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] IES file manipulation", "sender": "Greg Ward", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<6E06F5E8-C8DD-11D8-ABE9-00306540F848@lmi.net>", "refs": ["<s0da8fa5.049@wmtao.com>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 28 10:31:03 2004", "email": "gward at lmi.net", "subject": "[Radiance-general] IES file manipulation"}
