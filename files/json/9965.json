{"body": "\nHi Dan,\n\nThere have been questions and discussions on a material database. But I\nthink that given the quantity and variety of materials out there this\nquickly gets out of control. Consider glazing alone with something like\nOptics5  (a complete software package!) for dealing with this class of\nmaterials.\n\nPerhaps another way to consider the forest is by estimating an average\ntransmittance and then just using a trans material. One could even vary\nthis over some vertical dimension.\n\nBest,\n\n-Jack\n\n\nDan Glaser wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] advice for material modeling", "sender": "Jack de Valpine", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<4BD7227F.8080504@visarc.com>", "refs": ["<4BCDF70F.8060506@lightfoundryllc.com> <4BD5B9AE.108@visarc.com>", "<4BD71898.2030806@lightfoundryllc.com>"], "datetime": "Tue Apr 27 10:45:33 2010", "email": "jedev at visarc.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] advice for material modeling"}
