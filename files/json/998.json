A little ditty from a year or so ago?\nYou sent me this tip when I asked you how to get illuminance on a\nbuilding's curtain wall.  The first rtrace computes the intersection\npoint (which is fast) and the second rtrace does the illuminance\ncalculation.  Cool, yes?  Yes.\n\nNow, given this little tip, could he use trans as I described?\n\n----\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance calculation on a virtual surface?", "sender": "Rob Guglielmetti", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<40E06C00.5060407@rumblestrip.org>", "refs": ["<5.1.0.14.2.20040628092234.01fa90c0@pop.eif.ch>\t<40E0273D.2050504@rumblestrip.org>", "<C47BE7A4-C911-11D8-BFBB-00306540F848@lmi.net>"], "datetime": "Mon Jun 28 21:04:38 2004", "email": "rpg at rumblestrip.org", "subject": "[Radiance-general] Illuminance calculation on a virtual surface?"}
