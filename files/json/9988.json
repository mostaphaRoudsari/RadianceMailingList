{"body": "\nNick.\n\nIn Radiance geometry and material definition go hand in hand. You\ncould try evaluating the surface normal to chose the correct material\nin a custom expression but that would increase your render time\nsignificantly.\n\nAs an alternative you could use the same geometry with a small\nz-offset. If you have all the blinds in a separate *.rad file use the\n-m option of xform to give them a new modifier:\n\n!xform -m grey_mat blinds.rad\n!xform -m chrome -t 0 0 -0.001 blinds.rad\n\nThat will offset the blinds by 0.001 units down and use the material\n'chrome' for this 'side'.\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\nOn Wed, Apr 21, 2010 at 5:16 PM, Nick Hubof <nhubof@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n", "replyTo": "Subject: [Radiance-general] two sided surface", "sender": "Thomas Bleicher", "isquestion": false, "tags": [], "id": "<y2k89355c0f1004211421o8baf4f03wbaafad931ef8d13c@mail.gmail.com>", "refs": ["<002701cae16e$0d67a970$2836fc50$@com>"], "datetime": "Wed Apr 21 14:21:47 2010", "email": "tbleicher at googlemail.com", "subject": "[Radiance-general] two sided surface"}
