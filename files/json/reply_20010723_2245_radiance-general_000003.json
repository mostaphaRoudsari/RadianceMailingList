{"body": "Hi List!\n\n\nFinally, I've put my email address onto this list, nice to have\nradiance-online.org!\n\n\nAnd here's my first question:\n\n\nI am trying to render a quite complex model (imported from CAD, and\nthere are no\ninstances, so it takes a lot of memory). If I try to get better quality\nand higher\nresolution, rpict gives me an error:\n\n\n[...]rpict: 6581491 rays, 49,87% after... [...]\nrpict: consistency - address not found in avlmemi\nrad: error rendering view 1\n\n\nI did this on a netfinity with a lot of ram and two pIII-833. But in\nfact, the\nmachine is a fileserver... so is this error the result of insufficient\nmemory?\n\n\nI have installed 3r2p11. On Linux 2.4.4 (SuSE 7.0).\n\n\nBTW, as I know that Georg Mischler is on the list: dxf2rad is a great\nway to import\ndata from formZ!!! I wrote dxfr14 and translated it with dxf2rad, it\nworks perfectly!\nSo this is an alternative besides the obj-way and the\n3ds/mgf/rad-conversion.\n\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\n\nBTW: I just found patch 20, I never found it on the ftp. I will try\nthis, too.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000003.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
