I haven't been able due to a lot of problems - e.g. buggy\nversions of radiance, the fact that Rayfront doesn't run on alphas\n(and for the last months, I only had an alpha, no intel), my bad\nplanning... ;-)\n\n\n> > I have installed 3r2p11.

I already tried 3.2, but this time, I meant 3r1p11\n(the official download link). And p20 gives me the same.\n\n\n> Technically, this error points to corrupted ambient data.\n> Your problem will most likely go away when you try with 3R1p20.\n\n\nIt doesn't, and that seams to be a problem of memory. I can observe\nvery nice the free mem going down and the use of radiance going up\n... ;-)\n\n\nI just put the p20 source on my alpha, which has enough memory (512MB),\ncompiled it (I have put a new entry in makeall, containing some options\nlike -mcpu=ev56 etc for some speed ;-) and started the next try. At the\nmoment, I have rad saying 38%...\n\n\n> Cool!\n> Is there anything you need to set up correctly on the formZ side\n> for this to work?\n\n\nI will send some screenshots when I am at university. I am at my own\nmachine at the moment, and I don't have formZ here.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000005.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
