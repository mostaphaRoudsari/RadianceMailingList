{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nIt's me again... I had an error in my rif-file. The zone was wrong,\nas during the import, units changed from meters to centimeters.\nSo, I have a model of 1500 x 1500 x 1500, and the zone was\n15 x 15 x 15... maybe this caused errors. I just corrected it.\nI hope it works now...\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000008.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
