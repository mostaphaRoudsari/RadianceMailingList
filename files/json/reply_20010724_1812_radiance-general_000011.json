{"body": "With programs like 3DWin by Thomas Baier (PC-only), file conversion should \nnot really be a problem.\n\n\nWhat you say about polygonising everything is true. Only when using file \nformats that support other kinds of geometry (NURBS, Bezier-patches, \nCSG-constructs) then you'll be able to have the most economic conversion. \nThere is no \"general 3D-file format\" at the moment, so unless you can write \na plug-in for your software directly, you'll have to live with these \nlimitations...\n\n\nIf we could get the software-firms aware of the importance of Radiance, then \nthey could write export-plugins with a much better support of the \nradiance-primitives.\n\n\nRadiance is however capable of rendering files with a lot of polygons. It is \nnot the fastest way, but it'll get you there.\n\n\nI use the ConRAD-program from Ole Lemming and most models come through. It \nis not unlikely that these models generate octrees of more then 100MB, which \ntakes time... but the results are OK.\n\n\n--- stefkeB ---\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000011.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "stefke b", "created_at": "July 24, 2001 at 06:12PM", "created_by": "stefke_b", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000014", "id": "radiance-general_000011"}
