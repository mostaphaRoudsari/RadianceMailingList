{"body": "I don't know quite how to reply to a thread to get the subject right, so\nI entered this manually and it may end up in the wrong place.  (Help, Peter!)\n\n\nThe rpict error you are getting is due to a broken qsort() routine that\ninfiltrated the GNU library and keeps resufacing on various versions of\nLinux.  I'm not sure which ones have it and which ones don't, so the\nonly thing I can suggest is recompiling ambient.o using the following switch:\n\n\n\t-Dtracktime=0\n\n\nThis will turn off the ambient sorting optimization, which won't affect\nresults but will eliminate this problem.  The faulty zone in the .rif\nfile is not the problem.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000017.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 25, 2001 at 02:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000004", "id": "radiance-general_000017"}
