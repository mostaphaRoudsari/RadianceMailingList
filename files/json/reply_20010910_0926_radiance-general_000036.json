{"body": "You can get from Radiance to VRML via MGF, but not the reverse as far as\nI know.  To create an MGF file from a Radiance description, use rad2mgf.\n It won't translate textures, patterns, and some of the fancier\nmaterials, but it captures most of the rest of it.  Then, use mgf2inv to\nget to Inventor format, which is the same as VRML.  You need to use the\n-vrml switch to get the correct version header, but otherwise the output\nis identical.\n\n\nThe reason there's no translator from VRML to Radiance is because it's\nvery difficult (in my opinion) to support VRML, plus it's such a moving\ntarget...  It requires a parser library and I just never got around to\nimplementing it.  Volunteers are welcome, as always.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-September/000036.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 10, 2001 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000029", "id": "radiance-general_000036"}
