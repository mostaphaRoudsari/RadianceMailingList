{"body": "I am trying to simulate a cylinder made of solid acrylic material, lying on\nthe table by the window. I defined the sky as \"sunny sky with sun\". The\nsunlight is incident on the cylinder. I used the \"dielectric\" material\ndescription and the primitive \"cylinder\". \n\n\nYou can see on the picture, that the cylinder is transparent, but there is\nno any spot of the sunlight that comes through the material. I gues the\nreason is that the dielectric material is not a secondary light source. \n\n\nHas anybody an idea which other \"material\" should I use?\n\n\nBarbara.\n*****************************************************************\nF\u00f8rsteamanuensis Barbara Matusiak      Tel. dir.: +47 73 59 50 77\nDept. of Architectural Design          Tel. dept: +47 73 59 50 50\nFaculty of Architecture,      \t       Fax:       +47 73 59 53 88\n   Planning and Fine Arts              e-mail: \nNorwegian University of Science        barbara.matusiak@ark.ntnu.no \n   and Technology (NTNU)\nN-7491 Trondheim, NORWAY\n*****************************************************************\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-September/000044.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Barbara Matusiak", "created_at": "September 14, 2001 at 01:58PM", "created_by": "Barbara_Matusiak", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000046", "id": "radiance-general_000044"}
