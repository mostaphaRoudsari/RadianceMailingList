But you probably know that\nalready. The best thing would be to compare the colors of the\nreal object with those swatches *in the same lighting conditions*,\nand to only use the photographs for sanity checking the results.\n\n\nIf you *only* compare with the photos, then the use of any color\ncalibration system really sonds like a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-September/000049.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 17, 2001 at 11:37AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000043", "id": "radiance-general_000049"}
