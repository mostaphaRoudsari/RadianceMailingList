It has nothing\nto do with the CPU type of your system. If the OS runs fine on\nyour CPU, then so will Radiance.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-September/000053.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 20, 2001 at 11:28AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000051", "id": "radiance-general_000053"}
