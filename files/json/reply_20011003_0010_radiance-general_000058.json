{"body": "I began to learn Radiance today in order to be able to compute simple\noutdoor-lighting scenes, but did not succeed much with this powerful\nengine. \n\n\nPlease, could anybody give me an example of an input to give to rad? I\nmean, e.g, a row of ten luminaires with a given ies photometric data\n(<name>.ies or <name>.dat and <name>.rad, I've them for some producers)\nand 7 klm bulbs, 10 m above the asphalt road (7 m wide), 3 m from its\naxis, 50 m apart.\n\n\nMoreover, I need not only a view, but average luminance of the road and\n``uniformity ratios'' as well, from the view of a driver (1 m above the\nroad, 1 m from its axis). (I see, Chapter 7 of Rendering with Radiance\nwould say it, but it is not on-line and I've not the printed copy.)\n\n\ndark and peaceful skies,\nJenik Hollan\n\n\nPS.\n As an advocate of prevention of light pollution\n(http://www.astro.cz/darksky is a hint, most my texts are just in Czech\nhowever), I need to be able to compute the same things as lighting\nprofessionals, but with a free software, of course.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-October/000058.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Hollan", "created_at": "October 03, 2001 at 12:10AM", "created_by": "Jan_Hollan", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000059", "id": "radiance-general_000058"}
