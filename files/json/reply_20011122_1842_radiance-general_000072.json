In most cases,\nmappings will be applied to a group of primitives together,\neg. all the polygon segments of a curved wall. There's no\ngood way to automatically determine the axis of a cylindrical\nmapping without user interaction in such a case.\n\n\nI can only speak for myself, but enabling casual users to\nplace mappings without effort is not very high on my list of\npriorities. Neither your example file nor the very similar\ncyl.cal in the standard library require any deep mathematical\nunderstanding. And of course, Lars isn't really a casual user,\n(especially after buying a certain piece of software on Ebay)\nso I'm sure he'll eventually figure them out... ;)\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-November/000072.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 22, 2001 at 06:42PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000070", "id": "radiance-general_000072"}
