Did the sun\nactually hit the trans surfaces? In that case, what you're seeing\nmight be the expected result, even if you didn't expect it... ;)\n\n\nThe typical irradiance caused by direct solar impact is\napproximately ten times that of the completely unobstructed\ndiffuse sky, under most conditions during the day. If you have\nany area of the sky obstructed by other building parts from the\nview of the skylights, that do not also obstruct the sun, then a\nrelation of 400 to 30 sounds perfectly reasonable. Or do you have\nany more specific reasons to assume that the results for the\ncloudy sky should be higher?\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-December/000078.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 10, 2001 at 08:30PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000077", "id": "radiance-general_000078"}
