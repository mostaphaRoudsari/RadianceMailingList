{"body": "I have never been able to render final images better than the default\nview. If I try to set it to what seems a sensible next quantum leap up\nit dies the death of a gigabyte memory model on a megabyte machine.\n\n\nIs there some wierd cube law here? Is it actually not possible to do\nbetter than 512x512 images? 1024x1024 don't work for me.\n\n\n(the sizes are notional. Its been a while)\n\n\nAlso, some of the *wonderful* textures such as the finer woodgrains\nhave very odd effects on time to compute. Is there a FAQ like known\nset of textures to avoid for fast render?\n\n\nAlso Also wik: I did a kitchen with a mix of off-white and brushed steel\naluminimum surfaces. I found that the amount of colour picked up by\n'gloss' surfaces was increadibly high, but if I didn't select off-whites\nfor detailed surfaces like tongue-and-groove wood, I got huge brightspots\nwhich wiped out the image unless I wound back the lightbulbs to 5 watt\nrailway specials. I know that the chrome tap is reflecting part of a\nperfectly rendered image of the lightbulb onto every shiny surface within\na 40 foot radius, but now I'm over 40 I can't see those little images\nunless I stand real close. Does radiance have to render them? isn't\nthere some middle ground where it does high definition for some things\nbut not others?\n\n\n(I am not a professional. I do not depend on this software. If you do,\n and need it to remain pure, I don't disagree. I love this package and think\n its one of the neatest bits of s/w I have ever seen, its more critique\n than real comment/feature request)\n\n\ncheers\n\t-George\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-December/000080.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "George Michaelson", "created_at": "December 11, 2001 at 05:37PM", "created_by": "George_Michaelson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000081", "id": "radiance-general_000080"}
