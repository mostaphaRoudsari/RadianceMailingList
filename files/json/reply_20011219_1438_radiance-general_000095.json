{"body": "Georg,\n\n\nYou have eased my mind a whole heap.  After giving it a try for myself, i \nam now agreeing with you that the -i option of rpict does produce incident \nirradiance values.  I haven't yet tried this out on a visualisation \nincluding specular highlights, but have no reason to believe that the \nspecular highlights will appear and make the results meaningless.\n\n\nSeems that, without looking into the source code, i was mislead by the \n(all-too-brief) explanation in the Radiance manual.\n\n\nThanks again,\nPhil G.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-December/000095.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "December 19, 2001 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000077", "id": "radiance-general_000095"}
