Thanks!\n\n\n\n\nReality is often much less complicated than expected. ;)\n\n\n\n\nAh, but modeling and simulating reality is a different matter.  :-)\n\n\n\n\nYou give a luminous flux of 2900 lm for your type of 32W T8 (this\ncan vary with color/quality). Given the standard efficacy used by\nRadiance, this amounts to 16.2 W of light energy (which can't be\ndirectly determined from the electrical consumption!)\n\n\nThe tube has a circumference of approximately 81.7 mm and a\nluminous length of around 1.198 m. This results in a luminous\nsurface of 0.0979 m2.\n\n\nThe radiance of this tube is therefore:\n\n\n16.2W / (0.0979m2 * Pi) = 52.7 W/m2/sr\n\n\nThis is what the average rgb value of your glow material should\nbe based on. The luminance of the tube then amounts to 7684 cd/m2.\n\n\nBtw: If I feed the lampcolor program with those values, then I\nget very different results than you do:\n\n\n$> lampcolor\nProgram to compute lamp radiance. Enter '?' for help.\nEnter lamp type [WHITE]: daylight fluorescent\nEnter length unit [meter]:\nEnter lamp geometry [polygon]: cylinder\nCylinder length [1]: 1.198\nCylinder radius [0.1]: 0.013\nEnter total lamp lumens [0]: 2900\nLamp color (RGB) = 35.450659 48.609340 43.581585\n\n\n0.265*35.450659 + 0.670*48.609340 + 0.065*43.581585 = 44.8\n\n\nThis is 0.85 of the 52.7 above. Lampcolor has a depreciacion\nfactor for each lamp type, possibly accounting for aging (the\nactual purpose of the factor is not documented).\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\nThank you, Georg, for the excellent summary of the steps in modeling a lamp.  My only suggestion would be to consider modeling the lamp as \"WHITE\" if there is only going to be one type (color temperature) lamp in the scene.  This will avoid hassles with color balancing the image with pfilt.\n\n\nThe depreciation factor associated with each lamp type is defined in the lamp.tab file.  The depreciation factor is intended to account for the difference between the rated \"initial lumens\" of the lamp and the effective \"mean lumens\" that one would expect to get over the rated life of the lamp.
