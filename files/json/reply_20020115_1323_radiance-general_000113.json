{"body": "We have solved the problem.  I feel a little foolish since it was a problem not really related to ximage, radiance or Suse7.3, still though, it's good to know for\nanyone else who has the same setup.  I access our linux machines through a VNC viewer, part of VMware Workstation.  When we performed the upgrade from Suse 7.2 to\nSuse 7.3 it overwrote my VNC settings, include the color/display settings.  This changed the settings back to something like 8-bit which was not nearly enough to\nview my Radiance pics.  After changing this setting everything works fine.  Thanks Peter for your help!\n\n\nRegards,\nZack Rogers\n\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000113.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "January 15, 2002 at 01:23PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000112", "id": "radiance-general_000113"}
