{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nTo define trees in Radiance, you can either use an impostor as you do in \nyour CAD system, and apply a \"colorpict\" to it, or (as I prefer), model \nthe tree as detailed geometry and compile into an octree for the \n\"instance\" primitive.  This is very efficient, since a single tree model \nmay be duplicated throughout your scene without adding to associated \nscene memory.  You cannot easily get holes in a tree otherwise, as you \nwould have to use the \"mixdata\" type with \"void\" as one of the \nmodifiers, and translate your texture into a large, ASCII data file.  \nIt's doable, but the results won't look as nice as a real tree, and \nwon't be much faster to render, either.  Ray tracing is very fast at \nrendering complicated geometry -- much faster than a typical CAD program.\n\n\nThere is a pine tree in the standard Radiance distribution, but I never \ngot around to modeling anything more elaborate....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000115.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 26, 2002 at 06:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000114", "id": "radiance-general_000115"}
