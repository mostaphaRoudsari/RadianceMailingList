This would eliminate the need to\ntranslate anything into ASCII data, you just need to create a\nmask picture.  Of course, all the other things said so far remain\ntrue anyway.\n\n\nThe best advice is probably to exclude the tree geometry from the\nambient calculation as mentioned in another reply. Unfortunately\nthis is not yet directly supported by the Rayfront interface\n(which Lars is using), but you can still add the necessary\nparameters to the rif file manually. Rayfront will preserve those\nentries when reading the file, and correctly pass them to rpict\nand friends, even if it doesn't expose them in the GUI.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000118.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 28, 2002 at 09:43AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000114", "id": "radiance-general_000118"}
