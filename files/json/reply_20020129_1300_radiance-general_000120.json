{"body": "> Announcing:\n> \tLBNL Radiance 3.4 for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X)\n>\n> Release Date:\n> \tJanuary 28, 2002\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\n\nYou write that you need \"access\" to linux machines - what about ssh-access? \nOr do you need the machine in your office to create binaries? I have Linux \ninstallations on Sun Sparc, DEC Alpha and intel here.\n\n\nBTW, I am trying to get the new radiance compiled on alpha with compaq c and \ngnu c, I will tell you if I have success (the 3r1 was ok in this).\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000120.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
