Is there a way \nto make rayfront generate one octree per imported geometry (I used \nrad-geometries, but the dxf-import would be ok, too)? If I try to oconv all \nmy rad-files in one run, I get the famous oconv overflow ;-) So I created one \noct per \"object\" (in fact per color) and have a instance file \"model.rad\" \nwhere I put all my octs together.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000121.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
