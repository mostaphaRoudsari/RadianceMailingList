You can place octrees in the\n\"parts\" directory in the project, and include them with the marker\nsubstitution feature. This is slightly clumsy, and primarily interesting\nfor those parts of your model that contribute a lot to the complexity,\nbut probably won't change later. The details of the procedure are\nmore suitable for a different mailing list, though.\n\n\nFuture versions of Rayfront may offer to do this automatically.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000125.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 29, 2002 at 03:59PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000114", "id": "radiance-general_000125"}
