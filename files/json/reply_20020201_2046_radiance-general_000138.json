A vertical opening angle of\n180 degrees would result in an infinitesimally tall picture.\nThe first diagram (below the Rayfront screenshot) on this\npage illustrates the principle:\n http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/viewedit_v.html\n\n\nThe full mechanics of cylindrical views are explained here:\n http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/viewedit_c.html\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-February/000138.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 01, 2002 at 08:46PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000133", "id": "radiance-general_000138"}
