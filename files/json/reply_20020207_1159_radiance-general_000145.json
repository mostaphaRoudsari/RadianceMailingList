{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nDoes anybody know tools that might help in tuning chromaticity (color \ntemperature) adaptation for Radiance renderings? For example, if you define \na tungsten source (2856 K), the result is far too reddish to be plausible. \nThis question arises when mixing sources of different temperatures, such as \ndaylight and incandescent light. (When this is not the case, I suppose it \nis reasonable to use neutral source color, which in the Radiance RGB system \nis near 5500 K).\n\n\nIn pcond you have an opportunity to define, besides the RGB primaries, also \nthe white point, with the -d option. Does it include any \"color appearance \nmodel\" or something of a kind which could be useful? Any other ideas? In \nphotography there are filters defined in \"mired\" units, which mean \nreciprocals of megakelvins. They shift the overall color temperature range. \nSo, at least in the spectral domain a feasible transformation might be \nquite straightforward.\n\n\nRegards,\nMarkku N.\n\n\n\n\nMarkku_Norvasuo\nTechnical_Research_Centre_of_Finland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-February/000145.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 07, 2002 at 11:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000147", "id": "radiance-general_000145"}
