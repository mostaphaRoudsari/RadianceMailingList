{"body": "Thank you, this was very useful.\n\n\nMay I ask some related questions (sorry, they may be trivial but I did not \nfind answers from the documentation):\n\n\nSince Radiance has its own RGB definition, I tried to find out what is the \nRGB gamut produced by ra_tiff. Is it sRGB of something else? (pcond seems \nto produce sRGB as a default - am I right?). I am using the DOS/Windows \nexecutables. Is the resulting RGB gamut same for all systems?\n\n\nRegards, Markku\n\n\nAt 22:46 2002-02-09 -0800, you wrote:\n>The pcomb program provides for arbitrary color transforms, among other \n>things.
