This problem popped up on patchlevel 20. I circumvented it by\nsimply disabling the call to sortambvals() at line #230 in the ambient.c\nmodule:\n\n\n#if 0        \n   if (tracktime)                          /* sort to minimize thrashing\n*/             sortambvals(0);\n#endif\n\n\nRuns fine without it! Maybe Greg can shed some light on why\nsortambvals() is needed. As far as I can see this should be redundant on\nmodern VM systems.\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Life is too short for core dumps\"\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000163.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "March 07, 2002 at 03:34PM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000164", "id": "radiance-general_000163"}
