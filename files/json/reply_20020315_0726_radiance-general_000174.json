{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThe view types are not defined in the rview man page, but they are \ndescribed in the rpict one.  They are:\n\n\nv:\tperspective view\nl:\tparallel view\na:\tangular fisheye\nh:\themispherical fisheye\nc:\tcylindrical (panorama)\n\n\nThese along with the other view parameters are covered pretty well in \nthe rpict manual page, which you should probably read through at some \npoint, daunting as that is...\n\n\nIf you want to access the Radiance man pages from the command line, you \nshould set the MANPATH variable in your .cshrc file.  For example, if \nyou installed Radiance in /usr/local/share/ray, you could set the \nfollowing in your ~/.cshrc file:\n\n\nsetenv MANPATH /usr/local/share/ray/doc/man:${MANPATH}\n\n\nThen, typing \"man rpict\" on the command line should give you the rpict \nman page.  Unfortunately, OS X seems to wrap on the lines, totally \nscrewing up the format, and I haven't figured out how to fix that.  \nYou're probably better off with the HTML pages, except for new programs \nand ones that have changed.  You can find out how new the man pages are \nwith:\n\n\n% ls -lt /usr/local/share/ray/doc/man/man1\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000174.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 15, 2002 at 07:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000172", "id": "radiance-general_000174"}
