{"body": "Hello everyone,\n\n\nI've got a quick question regarding the \"view up\"-vector:\nas far as I understand, the -vd vector in  a view definition points\nalong the view direction (optical axis) of my virtual camera, whereas\nthe -vu points along the vertical (up) direction of my virtual camera.\nSo I guess they should be orthogonal. How does it affect\nmy view if I choose vu and vd such that they are not orthogonal\n(Radiance only complains if  vd and vu are exactly parallel)  ?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nVolker\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000179.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Volker Hilsenstein", "created_at": "March 19, 2002 at 01:21PM", "created_by": "Volker_Hilsenstein", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000180", "id": "radiance-general_000179"}
