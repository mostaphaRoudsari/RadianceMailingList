In all other cases vu will\nbe modified to lie within the projection plane, with vd being the\nplane's normal.\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Life is too short for core dumps\"\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000181.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "March 19, 2002 at 01:53PM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000180", "id": "radiance-general_000181"}
