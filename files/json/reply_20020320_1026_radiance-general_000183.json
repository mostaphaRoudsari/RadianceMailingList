{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI m planning to create an interactive walkthrough model of a building.\nTo improve the visual appearance I thought it might be a good idea to\ngenerate illuminated textures.\nI know people have done this using radiosity solutions getting quite good\nresults for example in games engines....\nI was wondering if anyone has done this using radiance ???\nMy idea was to use orthogonal cameras in front of every flat surface, render\nthe whole scene in radiance from that viewpoint\nand then apply the rendered image as a texture back to the surface.\nI know this would work only properly on view independent reflectance\nmaterials but anyway has anyone tried ?\n\n\nBernhard\n\n\nBernhard Spanlang,\nDepartment of Computer Science,\nUniversity College London,\nGower Street,\nLondon WC1E 6BT,\nemail: b.spanlang at cs.ucl.ac.uk\nurl: http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/b.spanlang\ntel: +44 (0)20 7679 3673\nfax: +44 (0)20 7387 1397\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000183.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernhard Spanlang", "created_at": "March 20, 2002 at 10:26AM", "created_by": "Bernhard_Spanlang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000195", "id": "radiance-general_000183"}
