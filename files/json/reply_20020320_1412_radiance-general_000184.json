{"body": "Bernhard\n\n\nI have done something similar although it was only a simple model as a test.\n\n\n\n\nI started as yourself with parallel images of each surface.  The model was a\n12' cube with one window in the south wall.  Once I had those six images I\nthen used the .jpg's and positioned them in a VRML environment such that I\ncould walk around the model.  I appreciate that does not solve the\nilluminated surfaces question but may offer an alternative.\n\n\nI plan to produce a more complex model but the issue is one of the time to\nset up each camera.  For example if you have drawn 6 columns, each made up\nof 8 facets then for the columns alone you would need 48 cameras.  Also\nanother problem although I have not yet put any thought to the solution\nwould be if you had say a sloped roof and therefore none rectangular\nsurfaces.  I think the ideal would be a C++ program which examined a .dxf\nfile and read in each surface and outputed a view file of all of the cameras\nneeded.  I think this is possible unfortunatly time is limited.  \n\n\nAn alternative may be a quicktime or similar panoramic.  There are some good\nexamples available but alas I do not have access to my favourites at the\nmoment.\n\n\nI hope that is of some help.\n\n\nAndrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000184.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "March 20, 2002 at 02:12PM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000195", "id": "radiance-general_000184"}
