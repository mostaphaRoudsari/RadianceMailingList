{"body": "Hi Bernhard !\n\n\nI don't know if I get your question right, so my answer may be to\nsimple: Do you want to have luminous images or surfaces ( like e.g.\nmodern billboards which are illuminated from the back) ? For these\nyou may apply a \"colorpict\" to a glow material and set the fourth glow\nparameter to -1. You then can place e.g. polygons out of this material\nin the room and adjust their brightness as you like (of course, they\nwon't illumante things nearby, but they're shining.)\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000188.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "March 22, 2002 at 12:29PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000195", "id": "radiance-general_000188"}
