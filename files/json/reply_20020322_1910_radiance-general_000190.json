{"body": "Hi Bernhard !\n\n\nOk, now I got it, you want to use the raytracer for a specific way of\nimage generation. In fact, I did this already, and it really works\nfine,  by \"playing \" around with cal-files and e.g semitransparent\nlayers you can get nice effects out of it, useable for 2D-Graphics and\nArt and the like. But there is no other way than the one you already\nhave in mind. By the way, (I dare to mention this here :) ) you\ncertainly have heard of POVRay already ? Its texture modelling\nfacilities are a lot more intuitive to handle, so perhaps for these\nsorts of visual effects it may better suit your needs. \n\n\n- cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000190.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "March 22, 2002 at 07:10PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000195", "id": "radiance-general_000190"}
