{"body": "Hi Peter !\n\n\nyou're right but let's spend my last cent on this -- not if the fourth\nparameter is -1 ?\n\n\nThere is of course a personal interest behind it. The reason, why I'm\nhacking on this is, that I spent some time thinking of other ways to\ndeal with broad area sources (for some design-case studies) . If you use\nglow sources in direct mode, you will see the effects of\nsource-subdivision on nearby objects illuminated by them (e.g. semi-\ntransparent layers. ) If you use glows in ambient mode, things are\nbetter, but for a nice look you need very high parameter settings,\n(although personally I'm still not satisfied ..). I got the assumption\nthat the hemisphere-sampling method works better in the \"far field\nrange\" than for near field illumination. (sorry, but it seems that I\nalways try to use tools for tasks they weren't intentionally made for...\n:) )  \n\n\nso long\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000192.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "March 23, 2002 at 12:40PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000195", "id": "radiance-general_000192"}
