Any thoughts on the best way to do this?\n\n\n\n\nUm, convert a picture of the stuff to the radiance format\nand apply it to your ground... Or did you have something\nmore elaborate in mind?\n\n\nIf you need to make sure that the reflectivity is correct,\nthen you can process the result with the normpat script,\nwhich unfortunately is only available for unix systems.\n\n\nIf I remember correctly, then I've had mixed results with\nthe filtering functions in normpat, but that probable depends\non the characteristics of your picture. Maybe you can\nprocess the original image with one of the common texture\neditor programs around so that it tiles nicely. Most people\nuse those for creating background for their desktops or web\npages, but they serve equally well for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000196.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 27, 2002 at 08:41PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000194", "id": "radiance-general_000196"}
