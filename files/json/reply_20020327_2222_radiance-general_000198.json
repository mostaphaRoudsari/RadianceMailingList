There's no\ntexpict modifier, so you'd have to go with data files.\nBut in general, textures work best for material structures\nthat have only limited deviation from the ideal surface.\nThe deep cavities in a gravel surface can't be modelled\nrealistically just by manipulating the normal vector.\nAt least I can't think of a good way to do so.\n\n\nThe other question is of course if you really need this\nlevel of detail. If you keep your view points away from\nthe floor, then some kind of random noise might already\nbe enough to say \"this is meant to be gravel\". And a\npattern image goes a long way from there.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000198.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 27, 2002 at 10:22PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000194", "id": "radiance-general_000198"}
