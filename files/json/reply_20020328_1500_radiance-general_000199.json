Pretty trivial, but looks good enuff. Unfortunately, the\nsource wound up somewhere in the Twilight Zone(tm). Hopefully I can dig\nit up, but it's really not that difficult to write from scratch.\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Life is too short for core dumps\"\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000199.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "March 28, 2002 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000194", "id": "radiance-general_000199"}
