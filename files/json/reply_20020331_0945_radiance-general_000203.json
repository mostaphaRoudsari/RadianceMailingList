{"body": "Hi Stephane,\n\n\nYou should generally ignore warning messages from the Radiance \ncompilations -- fatal errors and missing binaries are the real concern.  \nIn the case of Solaris, there is a problem with the \"install\" program \nused by the TIFF library, which I have not been able to manage to work \naround.  The reason that none of the picture processing tools got \ninstalled was because of the failure in the src/px directory to make \nra_tiff and normtiff, which depend on the TIFF library.\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is to change to the src/px/tiff/libtiff \ndirectory and run \"make install\", then manually move the libtiff.a \nprogram to the ../../lib directory like so:\n\n\n\tmv libtiff.a ../../lib\n\n\nThen, pop up to the px directory and rerun \"rmake install\" like so:\n\n\n\trmake install\n\n\nThat should install the picture filters.  I wish I knew how to fix the \nTIFF library, but the install script is horribly complicated and uses \nthe Bourne shell, which is something of a mystery to me....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000203.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 31, 2002 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000202", "id": "radiance-general_000203"}
