With 1.0.3, this actually\nworks for all other import types as well, such as views and\nmeasuring fields (sensor grids). The luminaire import module\nwill automatically transform IES data to metric, depending on\nthe units they are defined in.\n\n\nOther than that, the right list for this question would be this:\n\n\n http://lists.schorsch.com/mailman/listinfo/rayfront-support/\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-April/000211.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 09, 2002 at 11:41AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000209", "id": "radiance-general_000211"}
