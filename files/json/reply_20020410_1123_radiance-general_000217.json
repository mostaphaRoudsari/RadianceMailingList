{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nYour rpiece result with dark blocks is what I might expect if the output \nbuffer position gets off by one byte, though I would expect the colors \nto shift dramatically as well.  I might be able to give you some better \nhelp if you can compress the picture file and put it on a website \nsomewhere that I can retrieve it.  I looked at the rpiece code, and \nthere are plenty of places where NFS could screw up, or it may be that \nthere is a detail about the fcntl() file locking call I don't know, and \nit ends up modifying what I supposed was a read-only parameter.\n\n\nIt's also possible that there is a bug I fixed a long time ago in \nrpiece, and you just need the newer version.  Try downloading the latest \n(3.4) release of Radiance from http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance and do a \ndiff between the src/util/rpiece.c file there and the one in your code \ntree.  Send it to me.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-April/000217.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 10, 2002 at 11:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000210", "id": "radiance-general_000217"}
