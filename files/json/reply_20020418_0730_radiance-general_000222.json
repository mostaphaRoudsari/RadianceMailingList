{"body": "Hi Darren,\n\n\nThe man page for the \"calc\" program provides some basic information \nregarding the syntax of the .cal files, which is quite simple in \nessence.  (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/calc.1.html)  There \nare some good examples in Chapter 4 of \"Rendering with Radiance,\" which \nI naturally recommend to anyone who is using this system.  \n(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558604995/qid%3D1019140007/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F0%5F1/\n102-0825924-1038525)  You should also browse the initialization file in \nray/src/rt/rayinit.cal, which defines and describes the variables and \nfunctions you have access to within the ray tracer.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-April/000222.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 18, 2002 at 07:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000220", "id": "radiance-general_000222"}
