{"body": "Hi,\nIs there anybody (Greg?) who could help in the following problem:\n\n\nFor the mixture material type one has to define a weight coefficient \n[0...1] for the 'foreground' material. Respectively, this coefficient \nsubtracted from 1 is the weight for the 'background' material.\n\n\nI have used .cal functions based on cos(theta) of the incoming (eye) ray. \nFor this purpose, there is a special variable available, Rdot, which is the \ndot product of the eye ray and the surface normal and hence should be equal \nto cos(theta), if I have understood correctly. I have also supposed \nRadiance always flips the normal so that Rdot would get only positive \nvalues between 0 and 1. However, when I tested this, my functions gave \nwarnings that imply negative values of Rdot. Something seems to be wrong in \nmy reasoning.\n\n\nIs it ok to treat positive and negative Rdot values symmetrically in mix \nfunctions?\n\n\nI have not used surface textures, but the roughness values for trans \nmaterial are moderately big.\n\n\nRegards,\nMarkku\n\n\n\n\nMarkku_Norvasuo\nTechnical_Research_Centre_of_Finland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000225.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 03, 2002 at 04:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000227", "id": "radiance-general_000225"}
