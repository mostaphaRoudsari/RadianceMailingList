Your vastly different images sound like a too optimistic\napproximation in the direct calcs (dt, dc options- how many light\nsources are there ?), but most animation suffer from varying ambient\ncalculations. If it's only a walk-through animation with a fixed scene,\nit helps to pre-run along the path doing every n-th frame (n=2..10) with\na small resolution and fill an ambient file. \n\n\nVery probably rendering times will go up for artifacts to go down - You\nmay want to try the pinterp program to interpolate between frames,\nalthough it uses more diskspace and the controlling script/program gets\nmore complex (especially using multiple machines to render on).\nInterpolation breaks with reflecting/refracting surfaces too, but\notherwise speeds up animation quite a bit.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n> \n> Regards,\n> \n> Iebele\n> \n> (*)  Below are the settings I use for the rendering.
