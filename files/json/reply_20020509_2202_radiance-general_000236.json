{"body": "Hi lebele,\n\n\nI concur with Georg that you should use the -af option of rpict to save \nyour ambient values, both to accelerate your rendering and to reduce \ndifferences between adjacent frames.  The -ps 8 option you specify is \nalso going to aggravate sampling errors in your image.  I also think you \nshould use a larger value for -lr -- 1 is awfully limiting.\n\n\nIf you want to minimize sampling differences, you can explicitly turn \noff some of the randomness in Radiance with:\n\t-dj 0 -sj 0\nYou will lose penumbras and soft specular reflections in the process, \nunfortunately.\n\n\nI agree with Peter that pinterp will speed things up considerably, along \nwith the -af option. (INTERPOLATE=4 is a good starting value).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 09, 2002 at 10:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000229", "id": "radiance-general_000236"}
