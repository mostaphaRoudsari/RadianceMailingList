All the options are awful. However, not a single solution,\nboth efficient and general, is known that solves the underlying,\nfundamental light \"rendering equation\", without hand tweaking the\nalgorithms by specifying parameters. That's where technology stands now. \nTweaking simulation to do non-realistic images doesn't really help any\ndesigner in finding a solution that is actually realistic.\n...\n> Of course, Radiance is aimed very much at realistic image generation,\n> and it would be nice to have more \"artistic freedom\" in using it. This\n> is a totally different matter. ...\nI'm not quite certain that'll become a main-stream direction of Radiance\ndevelopment, as the physical quality is the prime motivation to use it.\n\n\nMy experiences with rayshade where excellent- Much easier, many more\nfeatures (motion blur built in, more powerful input format, easier\ntexture mapping). POVray is probably even more powerful and easier to\ncustomize. Both are in the public domain. There are many converters, or\nconverters could be build to go from one rendering systems to the other.\nThere's nothing wrong in using another package. There's nothing wrong in\nplaying with scenes and \"artistic freedom\" lighting in spaces. There\njust aren't convincing reasons why Radiance should leave the path of\nstrict physical correct simulation.\n\n\n-Peter\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000252.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "May 15, 2002 at 01:48AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000229", "id": "radiance-general_000252"}
