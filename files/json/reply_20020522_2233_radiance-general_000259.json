WHat is the proper syntax?\n\n\nthe position and orientation vectors are grabbed from standard input.\nFor example, grabbing them from a file would require:\n\n\nrtrace -h -I scene.oct < scene.pos\n\n\nFor your single measurement you'd use:\n\n\necho 60 60 30 0 0 1 | rtrace -h -I scene.oct\n\n\nAin't UNIX fun? :^)\n\n\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\"Life is too short for core dumps\"\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000259.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "May 22, 2002 at 10:33PM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000258", "id": "radiance-general_000259"}
