{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nDo you have rillum?  if you have rillum, it makes this process somewhat easier.\n\n\n1. create an input file with a pile of measuring points and positions, \nsimilar to your 60 60 30 0 0 1.  cnt and rcalc can help in the creation of \nthis file, but it can also be done in any text editor, or spreadsheet and \nexported as an ascii file.  use one line per measuring point.\n2. rillum [rtrace options] octree < infile > outfile\n\n\nthe output file then contains a column of illuminances corresponding to the \nmeasuring points and orientations defined in the input file.  if you wish, \nyou can then use lam to put the input and output files together in a table.\n\n\ngood luck!\nPhil Greenup.\n\n\nAt 03:58 pm 22/05/02 -0400, you wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "May 23, 2002 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000258", "id": "radiance-general_000260"}
