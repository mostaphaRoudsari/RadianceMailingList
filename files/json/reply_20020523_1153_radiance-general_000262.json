{"body": "Some more info:\n\n\nI just did a falsecolor image of my scene and it too shows \na totally dark room, with a single patch of direct sun.  THe \nrest of the space is < 1Lux.  So, that explains why the \ncnt/rcalc/rtrace/rcalc program is returning these zero \nvalues, but I don't understand why the lighting analysis \nand the pic files don't seem to agree on things at all.  It's \na simple room with a north-facing clerestory and an \nopening punched out of the south wall.  There is a scene \ndescription with a gensky command and the two \nhemispheres for sky/ground glow.  Several renderings of \nthe space show that it is indeed illuminated, and running \nit through pcond -h creates a nice looking image.  I've \nbeen using the rad program for now, so I think the \nparameters are in order, I have ambient=4 detail=high \nquality=medium.  \n\n\nSo, my photons are leaving the scene between the time I \ncreate the pic files and the time I run the ligting analysis.  \nDid I create my model over a black hole?  Hmmm...\n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti <rpg777@earthlink.net>\n    http://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000262.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 23, 2002 at 11:53AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000258", "id": "radiance-general_000262"}
