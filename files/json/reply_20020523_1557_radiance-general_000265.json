Sorry gang.  \nNow I see that rtrace needs to be told what to do just \nlike rpict, in terms of the myriad switches.  Sigh.  I guess \ncoming from the Lightscape/radiosity world I still can't \nshake the idea that once you wait a while for a calc, all \nthe data is there for the asking.  \n\n\nIs there a way to somehow tell rad to do some rtrace \nstuff and have rad control the options based on a .rif file, \nin the manner that rad controls rpict?\n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti <rpg777@earthlink.net>\n    http://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000265.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 23, 2002 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000258", "id": "radiance-general_000265"}
