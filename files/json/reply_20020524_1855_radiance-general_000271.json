In fact rlux is not exactly similar to rillum since it calls rtrace\nwith option -i+ instead of -I\n\n\nrlux is supposed to be used in conjunction with ximage to compute\nirradiance at locations in the scene selected from an already exsiting\npicture like this:\n\n\nximage picture.pic | rlux (rtrace options) octreefile\nwhere octreefile is the same that served for producing the picture\n\n\n>From ximage use command \"t\" to send the x,y,z,xdir,ydir,zdir values to rlux\nthat will then compute the illuminance reaching the first encountred\nsurface in this direction.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n\n\n__________________________________________________________\nRaphael Compagnon\nHES-SO Ecole d'ingenieurs et d'architectes de Fribourg\nBd. de Perolles 80, 1705 Fribourg  Switzerland\nTel:    +41 26 429 6666 or +41 26 429 6611 (secretariat)\nFax:    +41 26 429 6600\nE-Mail: Raphael.Compagnon@eif.ch    WWW: http://www.eif.ch\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000271.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rapha\u00ebl Compagnon", "created_at": "May 24, 2002 at 06:55PM", "created_by": "Rapha\u00ebl_Compagnon", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000258", "id": "radiance-general_000271"}
