As far as I can tell, rad runs \nan overture calc (at 64x64 pixels/view) for each view specified in \nthe .rif file, just before each specified view calculation.  What am \nI missing this time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Rob Guglielmetti\n            rpg777@earthlink.net\n      http://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n         \"That creep can roll, man.\"\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000273.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 26, 2002 at 08:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000272", "id": "radiance-general_000273"}
