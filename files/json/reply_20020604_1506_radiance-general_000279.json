I didn't know about those programs.  Seems \nto be a large collection of glazing definitions.  When you \nexport to radiance in Optics5, you get something like this:\n\n\n\n\nvoid  glass       GRAY_6_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.492     0.490     0.515\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    GRAY_6_front\n10\n      0.049     0.049     0.051\n      0.451     0.449     0.472\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    GRAY_6_back\n10\n      0.050     0.050     0.053\n      0.451     0.449     0.472\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nSo it appears to be defining a highly accurate material \ndefinition using BRTF.  Could some of the gurus comment? \n This could be a useful database for the novice Radiance \nuser with a skimpy materials library (me). \n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti <rpg777@earthlink.net>\n    http://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000279.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 04, 2002 at 03:06PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000277", "id": "radiance-general_000279"}
