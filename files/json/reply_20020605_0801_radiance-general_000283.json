{"body": "Hi Len,\n\n\nI'm sorry to hear you're still having compile problems.  For some \nreason, your version of the GNU-C headers doesn't include a definition \nof sys_errlist or sys_nerr, which causes the compile of error.c to fail \nin src/common, and subsequently the main Radiance library doesn't get \nbuilt.  The build all falls apart after that, as you noticed....\n\n\nYou will have to manually edit the src/common/error.c file with a plain \ntext editor and change the following lines near the top from:\n\n\n> #ifndef __GNUC__\n> extern char  *sys_errlist[];    /* system error list */\n> extern int  sys_nerr;           /* number of system errors */\n> #endif\n\n\nto:\n\n\n> extern char  *sys_errlist[];    /* system error list */\n> extern int  sys_nerr;           /* number of system errors */\n\n\n(I.e., take off the surrounding precompiler # statements.)  After saving \nthe file, rerun \"makeall install\".  I'm hoping the build will work after \nthat, assuming this was the only problem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000283.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2002 at 08:01AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000280", "id": "radiance-general_000283"}
