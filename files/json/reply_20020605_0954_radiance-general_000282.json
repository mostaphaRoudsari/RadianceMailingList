{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThese definitions are good and bad.  they allow you (or Optics5) to define \nboth the specular reflectance and specular transmittance of the glasses, \nbut they don't allow for any angular variation in either.  you may be \nbetter off just sticking with the glass primitive, using transmissivities \ncalculated from the transmittances delivered by Optics5.\n\n\nPhil.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000282.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "June 05, 2002 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000277", "id": "radiance-general_000282"}
