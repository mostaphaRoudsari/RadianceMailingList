As far as I understand\nthe documentation, sys_errlist and sys_nerr aren't really meant\nfor direct access by user code.  Or do we really still have to\ntake pre-ANSI implementations into account? If so, which ones?\n\n\nSpeaking more generally, I'd like to put in a strong vote for\nansifying Radiance completely. Even though this might look like a\nhighly tedious task (and probably is), I'd expect it to uncover\nand eliminate at least a one or two dozen subtle bugs throughout\nthe code. In the long run, it would make all future development a\nlot easier. Of course, if Radiance were to be put on public CVS\nlater this year, there's no reason why you would have to make\nthis conversion yourself...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000286.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "June 07, 2002 at 12:19PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000280", "id": "radiance-general_000286"}
