{"body": "An afterthought to my last message.  The process of ANSI-fication should \nprobably include a merge of the Desktop Radiance version, at least \ninsofar as supporting Windows compilation as well.  I don't know how \nmuch additional time this would take, as I'm not familiar with the \nchanges that were made to the code on that branch.  Some of them we \nmight want to include, but I don't know how long it would take to sort \nit all out.  Probably a couple of additional weeks and some good \ncommunication with the main Windows branch author(s).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000296.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 09, 2002 at 08:02AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000292", "id": "radiance-general_000296"}
