{"body": "Dear Robert,\n\n\nI 'm using frequently Optics software to get data for radiance window\nmodelling. You can also use WINDOW 4.1 instead. I think that the BRTDfunc\ndescription of the glazing gives values for transmittance (and reflectance)\ninstead of transmissivity (glass material). Naturally there are two\ndescriptions for front and back surfaces of the window since properties are\nquite different. The description in your example deals only with direct\nnormal transmittance hence it does not take into account the transmittance\nangular behavior of the glazing. This can be treated as follows: by using\nfor example  Window 4.1 you can calculate the transmittance in various\nincidence angles. By using a polynomiac interpolation you can create a\nfunction of transmittance versus angle of incidence (i.e. Rdot). In fact\nthis fucntion is a normalized function because each value is diveded by the\nnormal  transmittance. Thus is your BRTDfunc description you should add\nglazing.cal function with modified transmittance and reflectance\naccordingly.\nI hope that this might help.\n\n\nAris Tsangrassoulis\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000300.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris Tsangrassoulis", "created_at": "June 10, 2002 at 04:26PM", "created_by": "Aris_Tsangrassoulis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000277", "id": "radiance-general_000300"}
