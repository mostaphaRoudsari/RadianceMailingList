The\npre-1998 rshow, running only on IRIX-GL, had the animation spline\nfeature, but I haven't come around to add it back into the new Open-GL\nrshow. \nMeanwhile, one way would be to use rshow for writing a series of view\nfiles and do the interpolation externally.\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000304.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "June 12, 2002 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000302", "id": "radiance-general_000304"}
