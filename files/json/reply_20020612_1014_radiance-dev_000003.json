{"body": "A P.S. on my previous post.  When I did the grep for system \ndependencies, I was only looking for conditional compiles specific to \none system, and I sort of missed Georg's point, that the makeall script \ncontains a lot of system-specific stuff in it.  I agree, though I'm \ncontinually surprised by how few problems this actually has caused over \nthe years.  Still, I imagine a HAS_<feature>  approach could be better \nin the long run.\n\n\nBe that as it may, if you look at makeall, you will see that the things \nI test for are not the sorts of things that autoconf tests for.  For \nexample, whether the system qsort() routine works, or if the system \nmalloc() function can be overridden.  The other symbols I commonly \ndefine are BSD, for systems with good BSD library support, and DCL_ATOF, \nfor systems that don't declare atof() in the expected place.  I suspect \nI could eliminate DCL_ATOF by including stdlib.h at this point, but I \nwould have to make a few other changes to allow this.  If we could \neliminate the other 8 system defines I used, that would leave BSD as the \nonly remaining symbol of any consequence.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2002-June/000003.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 12, 2002 at 10:14AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000000", "id": "radiance-dev_000003"}
