Looks like I'll shy away from \nthese more complex materials until I have a real handle on them.  I'll look at \nglazing.cal too, so I understand what's going on there before I start using it. \n\n\nI don't recall seeing any tutorials or info on applying the BRTDfunc in \"Rendering \nwith Radiance\".  Is there a good tutorial available?\n\n\n       Rob Guglielmetti\n     rpg777@earthlink.net\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000307.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 12, 2002 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000277", "id": "radiance-general_000307"}
