Windows networking has a very robust file locking mechanism that is implemented in the public domain code called \"Samba\".  In an earlier version of Radiance for Windows built on top of Cygwin, we implemented the Samba file protocols into the Radiance ambient code and into rpiece.  They worked very well.  I could dig up the original contributor and his code very easily.  Since Samba is available for just about every unix platform, we could IFDEF a few lines of code that would allow the user to select which protocol to use.  In my use of samba-locking, I've never encountered the kinds of problems I've experienced with NFS lock manager.  One of the nastiest is that NFS locking is implemented differently on different operating systems.  One can not, for example, render an image on a heterogenous network of SGI's and Linux boxes.\n-Chas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign-up for Video Highlights of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n--0-1910699007-1023914273=:70722\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<P>&nbsp;...and a P.S. to my previous post.&nbsp; Windows networking&nbsp;has a very robust file locking mechanism that is implemented in the public domain code called \"Samba\".&nbsp; In an earlier version of Radiance for Windows built on top of Cygwin, we implemented the Samba file protocols into the Radiance ambient code and into rpiece.&nbsp; They worked very well.&nbsp; I could dig up the original contributor and his code very easily.&nbsp; Since Samba is available for just about every unix platform, we could IFDEF a few lines of code that would allow the user to select which protocol to use.&nbsp; In my use of samba-locking, I've never encountered the kinds of problems I've experienced with NFS lock manager.&nbsp; One of the nastiest is that NFS locking is implemented differently on different operating systems.&nbsp; One can not, for example, render an image on a heterogenous network of SGI's and Linux boxes.\n<P>-Chas</P><p><br><hr size=1><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br>\n<a href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/welcome/*http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/fc/en/spl\">Sign-up for Video Highlights</a> of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n--0-1910699007-1023914273=:70722--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2002-June/000005.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "June 12, 2002 at 01:37PM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000000", "id": "radiance-dev_000005"}
