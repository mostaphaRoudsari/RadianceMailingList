Therefore if you =\nchange these functions in glazing.cal you can model \"anything?\".\nI'm sure that you are aware that we are dealing with the whole system =\n(i.e. triple glazing). An alternative way is to modify the winxmit.cal =\nfile but this has the disadvantage that you have to translate =\ntransmissimity to transmitance in the glass type description. I havn;t =\ntested but I suspect that the formula that relates the above variables =\nis not valid for oblique angles of incidence (it -of course- depended on =\nglazing type as well).\n\n\nRegards,\nAris Tsangrassoulis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=20\n\n\n------=_NextPart_000_002D_01C21233.DB494780\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=\"iso-8859-7\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\n<HTML><HEAD>\n<META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D\"text/html; =\ncharset=3Diso-8859-7\">\n<META content=3D\"MSHTML 5.50.4807.2300\" name=3DGENERATOR>\n<STYLE></STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Dear Robert,</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>the difference between different =\nglazing types is=20\nactually the difference between the fitting functions (transmittance =\nversus=20\nangle of incidence, reflectance versus angle of incidence).
