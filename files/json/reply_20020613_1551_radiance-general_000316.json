{"body": "After trying to run rshow with a 70MB octree created in Radiance, rshow\nfailed with the following message: \"out of tree space memory in gettree\". A\nsmaller octree of an order of magnitude smaller posed no problem for rshow.\nA processor on our SGI system has a 1 GB of memory. Is this a problem we can\nfix or does it require a change in gettree?\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000316.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Seebohm", "created_at": "June 13, 2002 at 03:51PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Seebohm", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000302", "id": "radiance-general_000316"}
