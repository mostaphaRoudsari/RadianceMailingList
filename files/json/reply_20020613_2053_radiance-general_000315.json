{"body": "Martin,\n\n\ntwo errors in your gendaylit command line:\n1. You mixed up direct and diffuse radiation\n2. Gendaylit uses the full spectrum irradiation as input! It's the \ndefault output which is in the visible range. The Perez model (and \ngendaylit) calculates the luminous efficacy (W -> lm) according the \nactual sky state.\nHow can you measure irradiantion in the visible range only?\n\n\nConcerning the reliability, I can underline the statement from \nChristoph. Besides these mentioned validations, we did additional \nvalidations (measurements of direct and diffuse irradiation and \nhorizontal and 4 vertical illuminance) years ago with 10sec data for a \ndataset of one year and found a good match between measurements and the \nmodel.\nOf course, for extrem low sun position, the model could have some \nproblems - but also the correct measurements of these flat sun positions \nis often critical. And be careful if you have mean values and not actual \nvalues (e.g. 1 value for an interval of an hour or 15 min)! This can \nlead also to problems at sunset/sunrise!\n\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   o -          \n  | \\            Jan Wienold\n                 Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\n                 SOLAR BUILDING DESIGN GROUP - DAYLIGHTING\n                 Heidenhofstr. 2\n                 79110 Freiburg\n                 GERMANY\n\n\n                 Phone: ++49 - (0) 761 - 4588 -5- 133\n                 Fax:   ++49 - (0) 761 - 4588 -9- 133\n                 Email: jan.wienold@ise.fhg.de\n\n\n                 Internet:\n                 http://www.ise.fhg.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000315.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "June 13, 2002 at 08:53PM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000309", "id": "radiance-general_000315"}
