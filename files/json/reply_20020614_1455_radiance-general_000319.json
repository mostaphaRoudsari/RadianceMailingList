{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nYes, that is clear enough and it is essentially what I had in a C shell script. I\nhave now added a ten second wait after the first invocation as you suggest. The\nscript file is run like this\nmrpiece n\nwhere n + 1 is the number of invocations\nand args2 is a file with all the arguments for rpiece.\n\n\nHere is  the script I wrote (I am a beginner) to save invoking up to 16\nprocesses:\n\n\n#!/bin/csh -f\n#\n# script to execute rpiece $1 + 1 times\n#\nif ($#argv != 1)then#Script needs exactly one argument\n echo \"Incorrect number of arguments\"\nexit 1\nendif\nsleep 10\nrpiece -v @args2 &\nset end=$1\n@ x=0\nwhile ($x < $end)\n @ x=$x + 1\n      rpiece -v @args2 &\n      echo $x\nend\n\n\nIn the future I will add more arguments to provide more flexibility.\n\n\nThomas\np.s. a 70MB octree took less than two minutes to render at 1024 x1024 resolution,\nmedium quality and two bounces of indirect lighting using 11 processors.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000319.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Seebohm", "created_at": "June 14, 2002 at 02:55PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Seebohm", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000314", "id": "radiance-general_000319"}
