{"body": "Ooops, I slipped up in the C shell script I posted in the previous message\non this subject. The \"sleep 10\" line should be moved down one line after the\nfirst invocation of  rpiece (it works this way but not as efficiently).\nThanks Greg.\n\n\nFor those interested in the system I am running rpiece on: It is a 16\nprocessor SGI Onyx2 IR3 with R12000, 400Mhz processors (not directly\ncomparable to PC Mhz) and 1GB memory each.  In the reported run I was not\nusing 11 of the processors because another user was running on the remaining\nones. We are also setting up an 8 processor Linux cluster and will make\ncomparisons of how Radiance runs on it versus the SGI system.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000321.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Seebohm", "created_at": "June 15, 2002 at 05:59PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Seebohm", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000314", "id": "radiance-general_000321"}
