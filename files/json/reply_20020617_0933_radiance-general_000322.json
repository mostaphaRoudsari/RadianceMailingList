{"body": "<html>\nHi Martin,<br>\n<br>\nYou are right that the irradiance data fed to gensky should be treated\nwith caution.&nbsp; The reason for this, however, is Radiance's use of a\nconstant luminous efficacy of 179 lm/W.&nbsp; If you want accurate\ninterior daylight levels using gensky, you should use illuminance data if\nyou have it, rather than irradiance data.&nbsp; simply take the\nilluminance data and divide it by 179 lm/W to get 'pseudo-irradiances' to\nfeed to gensky.&nbsp; it is highly likely that this will not equal\nmeasured irradiance data as realistic sky luminous efficacies are between\n90 &amp; 150 lm/W.&nbsp; if you have irradiance data only, that should be\nfirst multiplied by a reasonable luminous efficacy (refer for example,\nLam, J.C. and Li, D.H.W. (1996), <i>Luminous Efficacy of Daylight under\nDifferent Sky Conditions, </i>Energy Conservation and Management<i>,</i>\n37 (12), 1703-1711) to get illuminance data.&nbsp; then follow the same\nprocess to get your 'pseudo-irradiances' for input to gensky.<br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\nPhil Greenup.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote type=cite cite>The important difference between gendaylit and\ngensky is the input of irradiance data. If those data given to gensky -B\n-R are integrated over the full spectrum, not just the visible range,\ninterior daylight levels will double! Gensky wants W/m^2 in the visible\nrange only, whereas gendaylit uses the actual irradiance data from\nweather stations, which are approx. twice as high. <br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nMartin</blockquote></html>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000322.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "June 17, 2002 at 09:33AM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000309", "id": "radiance-general_000322"}
