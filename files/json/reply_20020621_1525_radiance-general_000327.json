{"body": "Zack:\n\n\nThanks for the follow-up.I understand your glazing\ndefinitions. I also know a  variety of ways to\ngenerate a pattern whether dots or lines, this gets at\nthe appearance of the frit when viewed close up.\n\n\nBased on the data that I have seen available from\nmanufacturers of glazing sytems, the measured\nperformance data are for the composite glazing system\n(with the frit applied). What are your assumptions\nabout the fritting material itself? How do you go\nabout determining the frit definition as a trans? Can\nyou walk through your process in greater detail for\nthe trans material?\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n---- radiance-general@radiance-online.org wrote:\n> Hello,\n> \n> I just recently tackled fritted glass for a project\nwith a huge central\n> atrium covered by a huge glass spire roof.
