If trans is not a\nsuitable fit, use BRTDfunc with you own model: Functions which\nempirically model the underlying physics of the material (e.g. extruded)\nand steered with few variables (2-6 approx.) fit best (german\ndescription found at http://www.pab-opto.de/apian/phd/phd.html).\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000328.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "June 22, 2002 at 07:52AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000326", "id": "radiance-general_000328"}
