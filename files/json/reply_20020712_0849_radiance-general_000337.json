{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI found the error causing the bounces within solids.\n\n\nThe model had been created in formZ with the different materials on\ndifferent layers, then exported as separate rad files.  Normally not a\nproblem, but as a result of this modeling technique at the bottom of\nsolid shapes where they are sitting on another shape, like the floor of\na room, the bottom of the solid was coincidental with the top surface of\nthe other shape.  Radiance sees the shape below and is sampleing that\nsurface into the base of the solid shape.  By moving the bottom face of\nthe solid off the surface of the floor, the problem went away and no\nlight is propagating within the solid.  The next step will be to cut\naway the floor at these intersections so that Radiance cannot 'see' into\nthe base of a solid shape.\n\n\nRobert Westling\nsteinerwestling\n--__--__--\n\n\nMessage: 1\nDate: Thu, 11 Jul 2002 14:14:32 -0400\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000337.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robert Westling", "created_at": "July 12, 2002 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "Robert_Westling", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000334", "id": "radiance-general_000337"}
