{"body": "Hi Robert,\n\n\nSometimes, depending on the method used to build the model, you can get\nlight leakage where planes meet: very small floating point errors can cause\notherwise unnoticeable gaps, especially when the number of nodes (defined\npoints) on one plane edge doesn't equal the number of nodes on the adjoining\nedge. (Although this may just be a problem with the geometry builder I use.)\n\n\nNick L.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000340.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicholas Lander", "created_at": "July 12, 2002 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Nicholas_Lander", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000334", "id": "radiance-general_000340"}
