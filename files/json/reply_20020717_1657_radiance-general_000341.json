{"body": "hi everybody !!!!\n\n\nmy name is pillo. i m not new on this NG...\n\n\nnow i m in trouble with glare analysis, in fact it happens that DGI < 0...(daylight\nscene whit perez sky and simple glass primitive)\n\n\ni think it means that DGI is very low (quite 0) (uniformity of luminance\nin the scene and little glare sources dimensions..) BUT i m not sure..\n\n\nif anybody does know anything about .....\n\n\nor he has some trick to analyze glare with radiance....\n\n\ni need your help,\n\n\ntanks\n\n\npillo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000341.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 17, 2002 at 04:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_000341"}
