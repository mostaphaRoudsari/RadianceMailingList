{"body": "I believe the BRS (British Research Station) glare index is designed\nfor large areas, like windows.  The time I tried to use the BRS glare\ncalc, though, my then boss, GZ Brown, felt that my prediction of the\nindex, derived from a Radiance simulation, was too high.  I did not,\nunfortunately, have time to really research the matter when that\nturned up; we went with Brown's preferred method of calculating the\nindex.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nRef: *Daylighting* R. G.
