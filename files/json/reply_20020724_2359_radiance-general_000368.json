Only recommended if your viewpoint is the same order of\nmagnitude as the hole pattern. Further away, use trans to model the\naverage transmittance. If both is needed on one surface, you may want to\nuse mixfunc to blend between the two by view distance.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000368.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "July 24, 2002 at 11:59PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000367", "id": "radiance-general_000368"}
