{"body": "Hi Jerome,\n\n\nIt's generally a bad idea to attempt to do any file i/o when evaluating \nthe expressions in a .cal file, as this would incur a cost at every ray \ncomputation.  It's better to read and parse a file once, then deal with \nit in memory.\n\n\nCertain types of materials can use the .dat file format to handle \ninterpolated tables, but not prism or prism2.  For these, you may use \nthe tabfunc program to generate 1-dimensional tables for you, with \noptional interpolation, and include the output as part of your .cal file.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000374.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 28, 2002 at 02:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000220", "id": "radiance-general_000374"}
