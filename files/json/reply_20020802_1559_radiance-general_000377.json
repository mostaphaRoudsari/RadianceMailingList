Plus variants like \"polished\" \"slightly\npolished\" etc. One may supply photographs of the real thing, but I'm not\nsure that's good enough.\nSecondly, measuring materials (spectral and/or angular) is, even with\nautomated and fast machinery, some work, data processing and modeling\nare too, especially for an easily increasing number of materials, such\nas in a catalogue.  \n\n\nIt'll be very valuable to get feedback from users how they would use any\nform of catalogue - education or project work, for filling in data when\nno materials are given in a project or for matching a given material in\na project ?\n\n\nI had the idea of compiling a reference sample catalogue, around 8-12\nmaterial samples (e.g. 3x6cm) initially, plus their measurement data and\nfitted Radiance model. Would be quite handy for projects and feasible\ntoo, using my 12 year old, still used and fully automated\ngonio-photometer at FhG-ISE or a newer one, but I doubted there'll be\nenough interest. \n\n\nAny comments welcomed\n-Peter\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000377.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "August 02, 2002 at 03:59PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000376", "id": "radiance-general_000377"}
