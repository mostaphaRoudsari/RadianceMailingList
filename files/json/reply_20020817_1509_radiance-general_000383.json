I am working with radiance for university projects \nhere. On the other hand, I have my little collection of marble surfaces that \nI got from my current work.\n\n\nBTW, while not really fitting to the subject line, do you have a MacOS X \nversion of rshow? A friend of mine started with radiance on OS X, and there \nis a nice previewer missing ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000383.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
