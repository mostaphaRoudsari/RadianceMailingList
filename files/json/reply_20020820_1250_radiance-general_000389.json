{"body": "Hello Mark and all\n\n\nYou can use barycentric coordinates on triangular polygons to handle the\nnormals and other info. I use this in ConRad to preserve the uv info from\n3ds files and to allow for smoothing, by interpolating the 3 normals. Both\nneeds a special cal file.\n(The smoothing is not available to the public yet).\nWith this method it should be possible to do, what you're looking for.\n\n\nKind Regards\nOle Lemming\nwww.openentry.dk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000389.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ole Lemming", "created_at": "August 20, 2002 at 12:50PM", "created_by": "Ole_Lemming", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000387", "id": "radiance-general_000389"}
