It's a new\nidea and there isn't yet an end-user version.\n\n\n-John Mardaljevic\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000398.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "August 22, 2002 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000395", "id": "radiance-general_000398"}
