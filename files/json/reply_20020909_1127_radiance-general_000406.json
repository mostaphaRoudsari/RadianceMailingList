Coming from Lightscape, I'm quite used to \nbeing able to create renderings that have invisible backfaces, as you \nhave shown in Figure 4 of this new tech note.  It's a useful technique \nin certain situations, and now I know I can apply it to Radiance \nrenderings as well.  Thanks John, and to Greg for supplying the brain.  =8-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-September/000406.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 09, 2002 at 11:27AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000405", "id": "radiance-general_000406"}
