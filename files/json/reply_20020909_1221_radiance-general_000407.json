The thing that caused\nme to push it into the long term queue was that I found no really\nelegant way to emulate the pixel sampling and jittering of rpict,\nshort of actually modifying it.\n\n\nNonetheless, I think that the concept as such is the right way to\ngo. I'm just waiting for one or both of \"-vcm <modifier>\" and\n\"-vco <octree>\" to be implemented directly in rpict, which would\npreserve all the functionality...  ;)\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-September/000407.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 09, 2002 at 12:21PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000405", "id": "radiance-general_000407"}
