{"body": "Hi Roland !\n\n\nWhat is rpict_random ?? Never heard of it, maybe I missed something.\n(probably a normal rpict compiled with -DMC ??)...\n\n\nFor the compiling issue: If you already have the sources, then just\nstart the normal installation script (follow the README). You will be\nasked for a directory, where to put the new executives in. Specify a new\none for that, separate from the one in which your precompiled binaries\nare residing. So you won't spoil them no matter what happens during the\ncompiling of the new ones. Later, you can move them to the place you\nwant.\n\n\nConcerning the -Dtracktime=0 switch: You can set this in the rmake\nscript, as you already know. Just put it among the other -D's at the top\nof the file. The ominous rmake resides in the directory where all the\nRadiance executives can be found, i.e. the one you specified for putting\nthe executives in during the installation procedure. During installation\nyou will be asked if you want to edit the rmake script, this is a good\nchance to put in the critical switch, too.\n\n\nThere is one pitfall when you do recompilings later, (without the\ninstallation script): Then the rmake will be searched in the directories\nspecified by the 'path' environment variable, like every other\nexecutive. So if you gave a 'dummy' directory during installation, you\nhave to copy the rmake into your ray/radbin_lnx directory, too.\n\n\nHaving done this, you can do recompilngs of just what module you want by \nentering the source subdirectory and typing - example:\n\n\n(in ray/src/rt:)\n$> rmake rpict\n\n\n\n\nGood luck !\n\n\nCarsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-September/000418.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "September 25, 2002 at 10:14AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000417", "id": "radiance-general_000418"}
