{"body": "Hi Anton,\n\n\nWhat you describe sounds a bit like a bug, so I looked into it.\nHowever, my tests indicate that version 3.4 (at least) of\nRadiance is working correctly for the glass type.  What\nversion/platform are you using?  Are you certain it is not\nan exposure issue -- that your level is set so that everything\nis clamped to white no matter what the actual color is?\n(You can use pfilt or the ximage '=' command to change\nthe exposure.)\n\n\nUsing mkillum may actually average the window contribution\nto white if you do not use the correct options, but just a\nregular glass window should work without mkillum, really.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000423.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2002 at 09:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000420", "id": "radiance-general_000423"}
