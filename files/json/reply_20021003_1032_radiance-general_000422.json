The whole\nexercise seems a bit exotic, what's your reason not to use rpict ?\n\n\nShould you'll be looking for converting from a pic file (rendered by\nrpict or rview) to PPM, use ra_ppm .\n\n\nregards\nPeter\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000422.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "October 03, 2002 at 10:32AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000421", "id": "radiance-general_000422"}
