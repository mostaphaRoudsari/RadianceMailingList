{"body": "Dear all (especially Dr. Peter),\nFirst of all , thank you very much for giving me timely help.\n\n\nI am trying to practice the method you told me, but it seems that the\nscaling is not working very well. Actually, my point is to render a\nregion on the image plane pixel by pixel. As long as I can get the\nradiance values, I can organize then into a picture (file). So could you\nplease tell me how to form a radiance picture file (unf or pic) or\nsomething like that from the floating point values produced from\n\"rtrace\"? It is really urgent for me!\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\nQing Xu \n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n   1.
