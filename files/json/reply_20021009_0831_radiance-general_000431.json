{"body": "Hello Qing,\n\n\nThere are many options for getting the output of rtrace and converting \nit to an image.  I would first echo Peter's question, which is why you \nare not using rpict?  If it is because you cannot generate the image \nyou want, be sure you have explored all of the view types (-vt?) and \noptions rpict has to offer from the man page.  If you do not have the \nman pages installed on your system, you can always get them from the \nonline versions (slightly out of date) at LBNL:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/index.html#cat2\n\n\nIf you want to create a Radiance picture from rtrace, the simplest \nmethod is to specify the horizontal and vertical resolutions on the \nrtrace command line, and use the -fac output option, like so:\n\n\n\t% rtrace -ov -fac -x $xsiz -y $ysiz $octree < $input_rays > $output_pic\n\n\nwhere the variables xsiz, ysiz, octree, input_rays, and output_pic are \nset appropriately.  The second option is to output the standard \nfloating point values, and convert the result with the pvalue program, \nlike so\n\n\n\t% rtrace -ov $octree < $input_rays | pvalue -r -y $yres +x $xres -d > \n$output_pic\n\n\nThere is no real advantage to using this method, however.  And as I \nsaid, there is no real advantage to using rtrace over rpict, either, \nunless you absolutely cannot generate the view you want with rpict.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000431.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 09, 2002 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000421", "id": "radiance-general_000431"}
