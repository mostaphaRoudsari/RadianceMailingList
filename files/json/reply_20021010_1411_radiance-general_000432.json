{"body": "Hi Greg,\nThank you for your suggestion at first!\n\n\nFor this moment, I think I should tell you my real situation. From the requirement\nof our project, I could not use the Radiance in the form of command line and I\nmust change some codes to form our own APIs (making use of static library). Also,\nI couldn't use system calls. We can get the required image using API altered from\n\"rpict\", and then our real problem is to specify a region (or even a single pixel)\non the image plane to get the radiance value and the picture of that region. In my\nopinion, \"rpict\" can specify the exact position on an image plane. So, I use the\nchanged \"rtrace\" to render the region to obtain their radiance values (r, g, b)\nand then I want to transform them into a suitable file form to obtain the picture.\nI know I can get the answer through looking into the source codes, but I do not\nhave so much time for that. I have tried the method Dr. Peter told me. However,\nthat method sometimes works well and sometimes not. Now, I want to take advantage\nthe Radiance picture directly. Could you please tell me the suggestion? From your\nopinion, what is the better solution for my problem?\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\nQing\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000432.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Qing Xu", "created_at": "October 10, 2002 at 02:11PM", "created_by": "Qing_Xu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000433", "id": "radiance-general_000432"}
