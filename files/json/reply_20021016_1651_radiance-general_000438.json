{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nI use a makefile to create a lot of frozen octrees using colorpict modifiers \n(via aliases). These octrees are than used as instances to build a part of a\nbuilding, which is than transformed into a frozen octree. So  I want to get \nfrozen octrees for all major parts of my scene which should be useable on \ntheir own, without dependencies on other files.\n\n\nMy makefile than runs rpict on the octree, and I get a nice image.... but I \ndon't see any image mappings.... I also don't get any error or warnings (I \nwas used to get \"image xxx uses yyy kB\" when I used image map patterns so \nfar).\n\n\nAre the image maps included in a frozen octree? Do I need any special switch \nin rpict to make colorpicts visible (I use just vp vd at the moment)? Is \nthere anything special when using alias-modifiers in instances (i get my \ngeometry from dxf2rad, so for each object, I define a file object.mat which \ncontains just the aliases refering to material definitions in a global file \nproject.mat).\n\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000438.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
