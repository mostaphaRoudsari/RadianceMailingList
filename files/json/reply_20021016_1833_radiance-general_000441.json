{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nSo it is better to avoid any \"cd\"-command in Makefile, and specify all paths \nrelative to the Makefile's directory? Even in the material file (which is not \nin the same dir as the Makefile)?\n\n\nSo far I have been thinking that the path is relative to the file where it \nappears, but in fact, relative to the process' starting dir makes much more \nsense.\n\n\nThank you, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
