After all, It\njust generates the appropriate xform commands or instance primitives\nin the output.\n\n\nDid you verify that a single tile shows the pattern when viewed\neg. with objview? Just to eliminate simple mistakes like mapping\nto the wrong side of it etc...\n\n\nAs another remark: For very simple objects like this, instances\ncreate more overhead than they are worth. Consider using the -x\nargument with the scene file instead of -i with the octree.\nOh, and I hope you're not using the -m parameter to replmarks...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000443.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 17, 2002 at 10:19AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000440", "id": "radiance-general_000443"}
