I have a floor build of tiles. A tile here is an \ninstance, refering to an octree which is made from a rad-file describing the \ngeometry at 0;0;0 with a colorpict modifier (which also defaults to 0;0;0). I \nuse these instances with replmarks, so I should get the tiles with their \npattern transformed to the points defined by the markers? Or will replmarks \ntransform only the geometry to the triangle marker's position, not it's \ncolorpict modifier?\n\n\nIn fact, I simply wonder why I don't get any patterns if I render my scene \n(and no error messages).\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n\nHere is my material-definition (as you see, the geometry is from dxf2rad ;-):\n\n\nvoid colorpict porphyr_pattern\n9 clip clip clip 13_36a_map_porphyr.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 3\n0\n1 2\n\n\nporphyr_pattern plastic porphyr\n0\n0\n5 .11 .11 .08 .05 0\n\n\nvoid alias l_floor_green_stripes porphyr\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000442.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
