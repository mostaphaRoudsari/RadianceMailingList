These files are much smaller than \"pure\" radiance primitives.\nTo include the mgf files use \"!mgf2rad car.mgf | xform ... \" in your *.rad \nfiles.\n\n\nTo create the mgf file use \"3ds2mgf\" or write your own exporter. I did\none for Blender a year ago. It's simple if you can access the vertex\nnormals.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\nThomas Bleicher\nt.bleicher@tu-bs.de\n...................................................................\nThere is no room for smalltalk in a big universe.\n        -- Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000446.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 17, 2002 at 07:35PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000425", "id": "radiance-general_000446"}
