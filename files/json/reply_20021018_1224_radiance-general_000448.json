{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nI rewrote my Makefile, so I store all geometry in dxf, pic in tif (that's \nwhat the rest of the team gives me), and make than converts everything into a \nwork directory. Here I use oconv and co, and in the makefile, I set the \nRAYPATH=$RAYPATH:./ . That works fine in general, but if I use material \naliases, the pictures are not mapped. That's quite funny... I always used a \nmapping-file containing only aliases to the material definitons which I hold \nin a seperate file, as dxf2rad uses layer names to set modifiers, and I was \nable to simply correct the mapping without interfering with the rest of the \nscene if one object changed. Are there any special issues concerning \ncolorpict and aliases???\n\n\nSo, with\noconv material.mat mapping.mat object.rad sky.rad > object.oct\nI have no visible mappings, with\noconv material.mat object.rad sky.rad > object.oct\neverything is fine.....if I set the modifiers in the object.rad file itself.\n\n\nThank you, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000448.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
