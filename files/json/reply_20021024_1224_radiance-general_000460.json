{"body": "Hi Alex !\n\n\nTo some extent, there is the possibility of having invisible glows. In\nmy workshop contribution (available from the workshop page on\nradiance-online) there are patches to the standard Radiance version\nproviding some further features. One of them is the possibility to\nassign a so called \"secondary ambient material\" (currently only to\nplastic, metal and trans). This was originally implemented to save\ncalculation time in case of complicated mathematical textures applied to\nthe object, but it can be used for other purposes, too.\n\n\nSo, if for example you provide a blue plastic box and give a yellow glow\nmaterial for the secondary ambient mat., you will see the blue box and\nthe yellow shining on surfaces nearby stemming from the glow. (rather\nfreaky, though, but - why not??) This of course affects only the\nindirect calculation, so the fourth glow parameter has to be zero, and\nself-evidently there will be no direct contribution from this glow.\n\n\nA real invisible glow comparable to the illum which works with the\ndirect calculation, too, should be not too difficult to implement as a\nnew primitive (\"glow-illum\"), at least I think so ... \n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000460.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 24, 2002 at 12:24PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000461", "id": "radiance-general_000460"}
