{"body": "Hi Schorsch and Alex !\n\n\nIndependent of what Alex really wants large area sources are a\nproblematic case for the direct calculation in the region near to the\nsource, as then the simplification of the inverse square law is not\nvalid anymore. Of course, they can be subdivided with -ds/dj, but if you\nhave objects very close to the source, especially transparent stuff\ncovering the source, you see the subdivision effect. So it can make\nsense to treat a large area source with the indirect calculation only,\nand so there might be the need of an invisible indirect source material\njust as there's an invisible direct source material (illum). It's a\nrather exceptional case though. And it all sounds pretty much of\ncheating and faking, but for image generation, this is allowed :).\n\n\nI have to admit, however, that the secondary ambient hack which I have\nmentioned doesn't seem to work correctly for this purpose, you see the\neffect of the glow but not with the correct illumination levels. But as\nthis hack wasn't meant to be used in this way (I just tried to 'abuse'\nit for fun after reading Alex's mail) I don't have to feel guilty about\nit... \n\n\n:-).\n\n\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000462.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 24, 2002 at 02:06PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000461", "id": "radiance-general_000462"}
