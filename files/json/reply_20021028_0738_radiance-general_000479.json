{"body": "Sorry for the many errors in my e-mail on gensky.  I was trying to beat \nmy record for the most mistakes in the fewest words, which was already \nquite good.  I should have known that gendaylit was by Msr. Delaunay, \nbut at some point years ago, I got him confused with Msr. Brange.  The \nconfusion between Fribourg and Freiburg was more recent, and that was \nall in my fingers -- I just got too used to typing \"Fribourg\" for the \nworkshop.  I know the ISE is in Germany, not Switzerland.  (It is in \nGermany, right?)  Anyway, the german-speaking Swiss spell their \nFreiburg the same way on the other side of the river, so it's even more \nconfusing....\n\n\nThat said, I would like a copy of the CIE intermediate sky standard.  \nIf Francesco could e-mail me an electronic or scanned copy, that would \nbe great.  Otherwise, my regular mail address is:\n\n\n1200 Dartmouth St., #C\nAlbany, CA  94706\nU.S.A.\n\n\n(Not to be confused with Albany, New York.)\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000479.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 28, 2002 at 07:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000455", "id": "radiance-general_000479"}
