The sampling irregularity is due to the \nuse of polar coordinates, which causes a convergence of sample areas at \nthe normal (pole).  I should have adopted a different sampling strategy \nto maintain area aspect ratios, but this would have made the gradient \ncalculation impossible.\n\n\nMore excuses as I am able to think them up.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000480.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 28, 2002 at 07:43AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000467", "id": "radiance-general_000480"}
