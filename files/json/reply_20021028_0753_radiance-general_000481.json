If you \nare mixing the surface material with nothing (as in a ghostly object), \nyou would mix the material with the \"void\" placeholder.  If you want to \nmix a pattern with nothing, then do the same but with the pattern \nrather than the material.\n\n\nvoid mixpict alpha_mix\n7 my_material void green alpha.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v\n0\n0\n\n\nI use the \"green\" function above rather than \"grey\" because it arrives \nat the same value with less computation for a grayscale picture.  \nObviously, you should replace the \"picture.cal\" and \"pic_u\" and \"pic_v\" \nfile and variables with whatever matches your original pattern in order \nto get them to match.\n\n\nCorrections to follow, no doubt.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000481.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 28, 2002 at 07:53AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000474", "id": "radiance-general_000481"}
