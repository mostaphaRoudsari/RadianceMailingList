{"body": "Hi List!\n\n\nI am playing around with the vt-settings of rpict. I have the panotools\ninstalled, and as I had some cylindrical projection renderings (rpict -vtc ), I\nwas quite happy with the results when viewing them in ptviewer. However, I\ndon't know which projection type is needed to get the sphere-projection that\nptviewer seams to support as well. Using -vta gives strange results, and the\nfisheye limits me to 180 degrees, so I won't be able to turn around?\n\n\nI wonder if there are others using ptviewer with radiance pictures, maybe\nthe answer is too simple to find ;-) If not, I will have to investigate this\ndeeper - I am quite new to panoramas and I am using them only as a tool to get\nan overview of the scenes I am currently building.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n\nBTW, do you know about good ressources on using make to do rendering? I know\nthe example files from radsite, and I know the gnu-make documentation, but\nis there anybody who has done some more work on this? I am developing my own\nmakefile templates at the moment, but I have still lots of problems as some\naspects of radiance differ from the standard build process.\n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nNEU: Mit GMX ins Internet.
