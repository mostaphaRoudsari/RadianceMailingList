First, only using rad would not be \nsufficient, as I build documentation (from docbook), convert the model \n(dxf2rad) and mappings (ra_tiff, normpat), build octrees that are used as \ninstances etc with make. And shell scripts tend to get more and more \ncomplicated if you add objects and \"features\" later, what is what we are \ncurrently doing here. With make, you add simply one more target. And it does \ncheck a lot of requirements for me, e.g. I don't have to run octree if I do a \n\"make doc\".\n\n\nBesides, I was simply curious in using some of the well known tools in this \ncontext, make is one example ;-)\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-November/000494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
