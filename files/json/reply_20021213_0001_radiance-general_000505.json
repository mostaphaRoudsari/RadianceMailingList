{"body": "Hi Charles !\n\n\nI haven't examined the matter in full detail, but I think I may give a\nfirst hint:\n\n\nIn rpict, an extra \"source-drawing\" function is called for tiny sources,\n(resp. those appearing tiny) and this is done (most probably) for the\nfollowing reason: If an object is very small and far away, it may not be\nhit by a view ray at all. That wouldn't matter much for normal stuff,\nbut for sources, this might be confusing. So this \"drawsources\" function\nassures that at least a bright spot appears. \nI've tested it the other way, if the routine is disabled, a tiny source\nbecomes invisible when the distance is too big or the solid angle too\nsmall, (ressembling the disappearing of your illuminated objects). I\nnoticed the effect already at solid angles of 1e-5 steradian, of course\nit depends strongly on the absolute pixel resolution of the image. \n\n\nAs said, I haven't examined this \"drawsources\" routine, but probably it\ndoesn't perform an exact calculation as its purpose is just to create an\nimpression of the source being there far away as tiny spot. This could\nexplain the deviations observed by you. Although, I am wondering about\nthis, too, as just displaying the original luminance would be no\nproblem. Hmm?!?\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000505.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "December 13, 2002 at 12:01AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000502", "id": "radiance-general_000505"}
