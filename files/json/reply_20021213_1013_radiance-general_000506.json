{"body": "Hi again,\n\n\njust one more short contemplation on the matter: In order for something\nto appear in an image, obviously the minimum drawing size is a pixel.\nThis means if far away tiny sources are to be drawn in the image to\ngenerate a vivid impression, they have to be spread out over a larger\narea, say, e.g from a quarter of a pixel to a full pixel. In order not\nto exaggerate, it makes sense to reduce the luminance accordingly. Now,\nthe necessary amout of \"spreading out\" increases proportional to the\nsquare of the distance, so the luminance has to decrease accordingly,\nwhich would explain your observations.\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000506.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "December 13, 2002 at 10:13AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000502", "id": "radiance-general_000506"}
