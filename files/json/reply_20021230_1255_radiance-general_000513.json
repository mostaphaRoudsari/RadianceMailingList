Thanks Greg, Pillo, Carsten and Iebele, for the info. \nIebele, for the record, your tip would not help me because what I am \nlooking to do is to put my laptop in a bag and take it to/from work. \nWhen you close the lid, it automatically goes to sleep.  So I was really \ninterested in seeing what affect sleep mode has on an ongoing \ncalculation, not so much  how to avoid causing my computer to go to \nsleep.  Thanks for the info though!\n\n\nP.S.\nI'm approaching my one year anniversary with my PowerBook, and I'm still \nvery much in love.  OSX is really an amazing OS (which is to say, UNIX \nis amazing).  Coming from the underpriviledged world ruled by Bill \nGates, I'm constantly amazed by the depth of UNIX; that Apple was able \nto build UNIX into a more user-friendly OS is indeed a godsend for \npeople like me.\n\n\nHappy New Year, to all the photon wranglers on the Radiance-General list!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000513.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 30, 2002 at 12:55PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000508", "id": "radiance-general_000513"}
