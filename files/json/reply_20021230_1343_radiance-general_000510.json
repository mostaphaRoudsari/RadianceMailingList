{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nif all else fails, read the instructions :). OK, I haven't done this\nmyself, but once I had at least a quick glimpse on them, and I remember\nthat rpict has a recovery-option (-r or -ro ??) which checks an\nunfinished picture and resumes calculation at the point where it\nstopped. Maybe this suits your needs, (haven't tried it myself so far),\nso check the manpage to find out more.\n\n\n- Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000510.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "December 30, 2002 at 01:43PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000508", "id": "radiance-general_000510"}
