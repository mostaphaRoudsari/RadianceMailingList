{"body": "ok\nhere pillo from his little (1 feet) ibook.. ;-))\nif i understood well your question:\n\"may i use radiance in apple systems and putting them to sleep... what \nhappens???\"\n\n\nand my bad english summary is right the answer is:\n\n\n1) YES you can run radiance, putting the mac to sleep (SLEEP and not \nSHUT DOWN) and then wake it up to continue the calculation without any \nproblem (i usually do it when i come back home from work).\n\n\n2) if you want to logout or to quit the terminal you ca use the command \n'nohup' followed by the command task not to be suspended (exemple:  \nnohup rpict -ad 1231212......)\n\n\n3) if radiance quits (as my friend Carsten said - potato factor expert \n!!!)  you can recover your pict by recovery option (i tried it and it \nworks, also on apple...!!)\n\n\ni hope this helps.\n\n\n\n\nnice holidays to all\n\n\npillothebeginner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, December 29, 2002, at 11:13 PM, Rob Guglielmetti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000511.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pillo Pillo", "created_at": "December 30, 2002 at 03:53PM", "created_by": "Pillo_Pillo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000508", "id": "radiance-general_000511"}
