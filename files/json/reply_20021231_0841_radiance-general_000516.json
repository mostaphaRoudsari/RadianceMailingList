{"body": "Well, since LBNL is shut down for the week, there doesn't seem much \nhope in getting the Radiance website back up immediately.  It's stupid \nnot to be able to grab the distribution now that it's Open Source, so \nfor the time being, I've hung it off my own website at:\n\n\n\thttp://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/gwlarson/pickup/\n\n\nI don't have the patches for the 3.4 distribution, so be sure to go to \nthe Radiance website to pick those up before you use ies2rad, which has \nsome problems in this release....\n\n\nWhile you're at my website, feel free to download the latest version of \nPhotophile, the image browser I've been working on for Mac OS X.  (I \ndon't have any other operating systems available at this time -- sorry!)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000516.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 31, 2002 at 08:41AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000515", "id": "radiance-general_000516"}
