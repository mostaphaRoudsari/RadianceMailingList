{"body": "Hi Peter, Lars, Carsten, et al.,\n\n\nThanks so much for all the information.  As usual I am humbled by the \ndepth of your collective wisdom.\n\n\nIt occurred to me shortly after I posted this (and was perusing the \nrpiece man page) that rpiece really only helps rpict processes, where I \nam primarily doing lots and lots of rtraces right now.  I will look \nfurther at Carsten's PVM-ified Radiance, and mosix, but in the meantime \nI think this next machine will be a single CPU box.  Shoot, even one \n2Ghz Athlon will be an improvement over my current Radiance setup, a \nwimpy PIII 450.\n\n\nScene complexity and image resolution are not my problems, it's simply \nthe sheer number of rtrace calculations (with lots of ambient bounces) \nwe are doing that piqued my interest in building the Fastest Computer \nAvailable.  But it sounds like my investment in a dual cpu box will not \nnecessarily be returned immediately, since the bulk of my work lies in \nrtrace(s).  Maybe down the road I'll get another single, and then I \n*will* have dual fast cpu's chewing on Radiance calculations, and by \nhaving two separate boxes I gain a little redundancy to boot.\n\n\nThanks again for the info.  Have good weekends, all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-January/000522.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 17, 2003 at 10:23AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000518", "id": "radiance-general_000522"}
