It only feeds each of them the right patches of the picture.\nThe ambient file sharing is done completely between the actual\nsimulation processes, whether those run rpict, rtrace, or rview,\nor any combination thereof.\n\n\nWhat this means is that you *can* use a dual CPU machine to its\nfull potential, without any further tools necessary. The only\nthing that you need to do is split up your vector sets into two,\nand start a seperate rtrace process with each half. If all\npreprocessing (mkillum etc) is already done, then they will\nhappily share their ambient file, which accelerates both of them.\nAs long as you stay on the same box, you'll also definitively\nhave no locking problems.\n\n\n\n\n> I will look further at Carsten's PVM-ified Radiance,\n\n\nI didn't check: Is PVM also available for Windows?\nCarsten, can you tell a bit more about this, particularly\nyour ambient sharing code (maybe in the dev list)?\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-January/000523.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 17, 2003 at 10:55AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000518", "id": "radiance-general_000523"}
