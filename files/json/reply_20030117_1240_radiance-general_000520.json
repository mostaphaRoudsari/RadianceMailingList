{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI still didn't manage to try it wirh radiance, but (open)mosix might be a \ngreat addition, as it represents a cluster as a smp-machine, so you don't \nneed rsh and co., and it has an included file system that gives you access to \nall clustered filesystems. So the nfs issue might belong to the past in \nmosix-environments.\n\n\nRegarding the original question: I didn't need more than on processor working \non a scene so far. Current machines usually render one picture in a time to \nshort to make me think about using rpiece, if I need more than one picture, I \nusually start two rendering processes (I had some very large renderings with \n5000x5000 pixel on a 4way-Sun 880, that was one case that I had more than one \nrendering process at a time). Of course, the memory might become a problem if \nyou do so.\n\n\nI still want to try mosix, but at the moment, I simply don't have the time ;-)\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-January/000520.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
