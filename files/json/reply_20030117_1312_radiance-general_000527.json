Again, that's only the actual functionality. Any higher\nlevel coordination between the jobs should be handled by other tools.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-January/000527.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 17, 2003 at 01:12PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000518", "id": "radiance-general_000527"}
