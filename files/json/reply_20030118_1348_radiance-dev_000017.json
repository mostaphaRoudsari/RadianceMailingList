{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\njust a quick crude reply right now, have to leave soon, maybe more next\nweek..\n\n\nOK, I didn't really promote my PVM stuff vigourously. In 2001, I had a\nshort email-contact with Charles, I offered the stuff for publication.\n(Some small bugs had been in it at that time, and the parallel rview was\nmuch too slow, it's the problem of the rview-style itself which makes\nparallel rview rather impossible/inefficient, so I abandoend it\nfinally).\n\n\nBut the rpict mode works fine and reliable, esp after some later\nimprovement.\n\n\nOn all occasions of my mentioning it later, I had the impression that\nthe interest in it was rather limited, besides, I concentrated on other\nwork (direct cache), so I kept my mouth shut on it.. :-) This isn't\nmeant as a complaint, really not. It's just a self-evident fact that\nthere are several 'philosophies' concerning the future Radiance\ndevelopment, so there will always be more ideas then final (official)\nrealisations.\n\n\nAdditionally, I know nothing about Windows or OS X, so that platform\nindependent PVM Version would be something for a team to be built, if at\nall. I'm currently just a single bozo (who by the way learned\nC-programming by exploring the Radiance-code) so I did experiment a lot\nbut mainly persued personal preferences (additionally receiving no\nfunding, too, which I have to consider, such is the hard reality of\nlife). If the stuff is of public interest, however, I'm of course all\nears and willing to join in some cooperative effort.\n\n\nSo long for now\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000017.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "January 18, 2003 at 01:48PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000017"}
