It was developed for cygwin.  The modifications were very minor.  Shall I try to dig up these mods and post them here?\nThe LBNL multiprocessor version is built around MPI.  There is a version for the Cray T3E and a version for the SGI Onyx 2000.  Apparently MPI is not terribly cross-platform.  I do not speak for LBNL, but I would expect this version to be Open Source along with the rest of the kettle.\nHas anyone played around with Greg's multiprocessor client/server model?  He developed \"rholo\" (as in holodeck) while working at SGI.  It has some fancy ray-caching mechanisms for near real-time walkthroughs, and also has a back-end that effectively manages the resources of 64 processors or more.  I don't know what procedure mechanism he uses.  Knowing him, he probably started from scratch.  \n-Chas\n\n\n--0-1498359771-1043390401=:87663\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<P>Hi,\n<P>There is already an implementation of the ambient file sharing/locking and rpiece (I think) using Samba.&nbsp; It was developed for cygwin.&nbsp; The modifications were very minor.&nbsp; Shall I try to dig up these mods and post them here?\n<P>The LBNL multiprocessor version is built around MPI.&nbsp; There is a version for the Cray T3E and a version for the SGI Onyx 2000.&nbsp; Apparently MPI is not terribly cross-platform.&nbsp; I do not speak for LBNL, but I would expect this version to be Open Source along with the rest of the kettle.\n<P>Has anyone played around with Greg's multiprocessor client/server model?&nbsp; He developed \"rholo\" (as in holodeck) while working at SGI.&nbsp; It has some fancy ray-caching mechanisms for near real-time walkthroughs, and also has a back-end that effectively manages the resources of 64 processors or more.&nbsp; I don't know what procedure mechanism he uses.&nbsp; Knowing him, he probably&nbsp;started from scratch.&nbsp; \n<P>-Chas</P>\n--0-1498359771-1043390401=:87663--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "January 23, 2003 at 10:40PM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000019"}
