{"body": "MPI *is* cross-platform, as far as I know.  There's a free version of \nMPI 1.2 (MPICH) which runs on many Unices, Mac OS X and Windows NT, \n2000, and XP.  MPI-2 is only available in commercial implementations, \nas far as I know, though MPICH is planned to support it.\n\n\nI have real doubts about the performance of SMB (on which Samba is \nbased) and, if Microsoft modifies the underlying protocols, it may no \nlonger be widely available--it isn't readily available on most unix \nsystems, though there are implementations that will run on most of them.\n\n\nI think this may be an area that best performance and ease of use will \nbe achieved either by supporting  multiple standards or, alternatively, \nby doing some protocol design.  For what Radiance does with its ambient \ndata, MPI is may be overkill.  Or maybe not; I'm not a parallel systems \nexpert.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nMPI links:\n   MPICH\t\thttp://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/\n   MPICH for XP http://www.lfbs.rwth-aachen.de/mp-mpich/\n   MPI forum\thttp://www.mpi-forum.org/\n\t\t\tStandards documents annoying distributed in PostScript.\n   There are various commercial implementations as well.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000022.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "January 24, 2003 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000022"}
