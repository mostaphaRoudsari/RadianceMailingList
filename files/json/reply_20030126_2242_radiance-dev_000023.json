{"body": "--0-1216286439-1043649759=:13474\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n\n\nSorry Randolph.  My experience, both direct and indirect, is opposite just about every point you make.  I have no experience with MPICH, but when I oversaw the programming of LBNL's \"LDRD\" version of Radiance, the programmer had to re-write his code for two different SGI platforms.  So much for portability.  Perhaps this says more about the skill of the programmer (I don't think so), or of the SGI implementation(s) of MPI....?\nIn the experiments that I ran with the CynWin version of rpiece, SMB/Samba has proven to be very responsive and reliable.  And to address one of Greg's concerns, the Samba extensions for Unix are quite easy to install.  For the Windows version of Radiance, no additional libraries would need to be installed (of course.)\nThe LDRD version of Radiance required the use of a robust interface such as MPI in order for the code to scale up to hundreds of processors without serious degradation, according to the programmer.  It was running on 250 processors on the Cray T3E with about 80% utilization of the processors.\n-Chas\n Randolph Fritz <randolph@panix.com> wrote:MPI *is* cross-platform, as far as I know.
