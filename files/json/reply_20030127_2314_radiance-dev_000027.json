Sourceforge wouldn't be the first \"free\"\nservice sliding senselessly ugly over time.\n\n\nMaybe it's time for a little background info to all: Radiance-online.org\nis a machine donated by me and located at \"Fraunhofer Institute for\nsolar Energysystems\" (http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de). Since both me and\nthey are engaged in Radiance, there's a solid interest in keeping the\nthing running and extending it.\nFurthermore, setting up a mirrored system between this site and LBNL's\nradsite server would provide redundant access, although that is not\nsorted out yet.\n\n\nTechnically I don't see a compile farm as big advantage: Who's going to\ncheck the binaries (e.g. an ximage AIX version) in a productive\nenvironment ? Checking for compile errors and include files is step 1,\nas I'm sure you experienced too.\nIMHO, porting to a new platform is most easily and effectively done by\nsomeone with access to and experience of that platform. And if a larger\ncompany is just dying to get a binary for a certain architecture that\nnone of us has access to, they very likely donate hardware to Greg.\n\n\nIf anyone \"hears voices\" urging him to participate in\nradiance-online.org, e.g. by contributing examples, demo or organizing\nfeatures, he/she is warmly welcomed.\n\n\ncheers\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000027.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "January 27, 2003 at 11:14PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000027"}
