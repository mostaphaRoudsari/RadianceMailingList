Of course my stuff\ndepends completely on PVM. Unfortunately, right now I cannot spend much\ntime on Radinace-realted issues, due to various reasons, so I better not\nengage too much in this discussion.\n\n\nI don't understand the whole business anyway. As already mentioned,\ncomplex renderings of big pictures needing the power of several machines\nare no everyday task, so this shouldn't determine the requirements for a\nbasic version. Moreover, using a complete PP Library just for sharing\nambient values my indeed be judged as overkill, and as the 'gurus' (like\nRob uses to say) already have other things to offer, e.g. Sockets or\nSamba, why not try this out.\n\n\nAdditionally, for a moment I was fond of combining Windows and Linux and\neverything else, but I've made up my mind on this, who wants to\nimplement all the upcoming changes of every OS again and again and\nagain? From Windows 2000 to Windows X to Windows Me to Windows You to\nWindows YouNoWho etc, etc. And furthermore, who is paying for that?\n\n\nSo I remembered Gregs words, posted several months ago - cit:\n>Ewww.  Can't we just say that if you want to do parallel rendering, you \n>need to install Unix?\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000028.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "January 28, 2003 at 10:44PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000028"}
