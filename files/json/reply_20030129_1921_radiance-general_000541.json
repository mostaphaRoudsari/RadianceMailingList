Never did trust gcc. Also have some apalling memories\nof its early C++ handling. I prefer the native compilers, if they're\navailable, because it also tests your code for portability. I assume\nTom's Onyx runs IRIX 6.5 which requires a license for the compiler, in\nwhich case gcc becomes an attractive option after all.\n\n\n> There you go.
