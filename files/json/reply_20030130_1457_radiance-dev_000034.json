The server\nreceives data via UDP from the various renderers, and adds it to the\nfile.  (Is conflicting data an issue?  How best for the server to\nresolve it?)  Every time the renderers read the file they check to\nmake sure the items they sent are in it; if they're not, they resend\nthem.\n\n\nError handling & network management:\n\n\n  - I recommend that renderers keep a timer, and if the server does\n    not see ambient file updates in some operator-determined period of\n    time, raise an alarm.  (The operator-determined time because it\n    depends on network and filesystem latency.)\n\n\n  - I believe the ambient updater itself could be best organized as a\n    monitor and an updater process; if the updater fails, the monitor\n    can restart it and if several attempts at restarting fail quickly,\n    the monitor can raise an alarm.  In a large MP environment it\n    might be best to have the monitor and updater on separate systems.\n    (The monitor process might also start and stop renderers.)\n\n\n  - The updater can publish its UDP port and a 64-bit random magic\n    number via a file, which is protected (or not) via the file\n    permissions system.  The updater only accepts ambient value\n    packets which have a valid magic number.  This provides a measure\n    of security.  It would perhaps be best for the random magic number\n    to be updated every few minutes.\n\n\nI like this proposal, but I am not a Radiance expert.  What do you-all\nthink?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000034.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "January 30, 2003 at 02:57PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000034"}
