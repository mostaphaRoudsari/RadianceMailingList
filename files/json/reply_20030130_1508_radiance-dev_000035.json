I don't think\na single app could ever really manage 1024 simultaneous TCP\nconnections on most systems, except for the big IBM servers.\n\n\n> \n> There's no theoretical limit on the number of clients, even if we\n> may rarely see more than a few dozen (eg. for rendering a walk\n> through animation).
