I'd prefer to keep the tricky parts\nconcentrated on the server side, so that the clients are only\nconfronted with new data when they explicitly ask for it.\n\n\nThe other thing is that broadcasts are only possible with UDP,\nwhich doesn't garantee that the data is actually received by\nanyone. If we want to make sure that all processes really have\nthe full set at any time, then there's no way around TCP.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000031.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 30, 2003 at 03:34PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000031"}
