On my box, this is\ncurrently at 1024, and I think it could be reconfigured if\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n> How many clients are we talking about, and how much data?\n\n\nThere's no theoretical limit on the number of clients, even if we\nmay rarely see more than a few dozen (eg. for rendering a walk\nthrough animation). Typical numbers will be 2 to 5. A full set of\nambient data for one simulation can exceed 100 MB, more common\nsizes are in the range between 5-30 MB. Not really something you\nwant to broadcast repeatedly when there are cheaper alternatives.\nYou'd also unnecessarily flood all the channels of your switch\nfor hours at a time.\n\n\nWith the TCP approach, the full data will be transferred to each\nclient exactly once, and all the clients will send the full set\nto the server once collectively. This is the same amount of\nnetwork traffic that is generated now, when you have the ambient\nfile sitting on a NFS mounted volume.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000033.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 30, 2003 at 05:42PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000033"}
