If, due to network latency, the value is sent twice, the\nserver can simply ignore it, without any harm done.\n\n\n> \n> >   - I recommend that renderers keep a timer, and if the server does\n> >     not see ambient file updates in some operator-determined period of\n> >     time, raise an alarm.

Meant \"renderer,\" not server.  A check to make sure the\nrenderer's ambient values are actually getting into the shared ambient\nfile.  If this isn't happenning, operator attention is needed.\n\n\n> \n> >   - I believe the ambient updater itself could be best organized as a\n> >     monitor and an updater process;\n> \n> I don't think that job management concepts are within the\n> functional scope of core Radiance.\n>\n\n\nI suppose.  But that would be my preferred solution in a Unix\nenvironment; the ambient value update server has to be incredibly\nreliable, or we'll be hearing complaints about it forever.  It may not\nbe life-critical, but it sure can be career-critical!\n\n\n> \n> >   - The updater can publish its UDP port and a 64-bit random magic\n> \n> Let's worry about security once the functionality as such works.\n\n\nPublishing the port solves the problem of communicating the IP address\nand port number of the ambient file update server to the clients\nwithout assigning an arbitrary port number, which is not reliable,\nsince only services listed in RFC whatever are assured of getting\ntheir assigned ports.  One gets the slightly greater security of the\nmagic number for very little extra effort.\n\n\nYou're just not devious enough.\n\n\n> It will be trivial to have the server only accept packets from\n> the local IP range, and you should have a firewall in front of\n> your network in any case.\n\n\nWithin a large network, one is likely to have at security problems\nfrom inside the firewall; it's best to address them early on.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-January/000040.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "January 31, 2003 at 03:36PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000016", "id": "radiance-dev_000040"}
