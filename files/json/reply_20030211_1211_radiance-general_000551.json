Imagemagick can do it as well as convert \nbetween image formats (it even reads radiance pictures). A very powerful tool \nto encode or convert video is ffmpeg, it has support for a lot of file \nformats (e.g. avi, mpg, mpg4, and images) and really lots of codecs (e.g. \nmpg, mpg4 / \"divx\", ...). You should really take a look at this!\n\n\n> Also , i want to simulate a fish eye lens , i want to place the camera with\n> fish eye lens on the ceiling so that i can get the view of the whole room\n> which later i want to do some image processing on it .\n> so if u could send me the details abt fish eye lens , it would be of great\n> help\n\n\nThat's how I used the projection:\n\n\nrpict -vta -vh 360 -vv 360 -vp 0 0 1.6 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf\n\n\nThe result will be not a fisheye, but a view to every angle, 360 degrees \nvertically as well as horizontally. So you might try:\n\n\nrpict -vta -vh 360 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 3 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf\n(angular fisheye)\n\n\nrpict -vth -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 3 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf\n(hemispherical fisheye)\n\n\nBut, I think you should simply try what you need, using the different \nprojections (that's how I do this ;-) And use man rpict - there is a lot of \ninfo...\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-February/000551.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
