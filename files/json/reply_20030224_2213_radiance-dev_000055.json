I know what criteria \nI would apply to such a decision, namely:\n\n\n1) The modification should not adversely affect calculations it has \nnothing to do with.\n2) The modification should be deemed an improvement by a majority of \nusers.\n3) The modification should compile readily on all supported platforms \nwithout requiring third-party libraries.\n4) The modification should do what it claims to do, and should converge \nto the correct solution.\n5) The modification should have minimal impact on standard Radiance \nfile formats.\n\n\nIn the past, I put the things into Radiance based on user requests and \nmy own aesthetics. Now that we are opening up the source tree to \ndevelopment, we need to come up with a process for including \nenhancements. One idea is to offer modified versions for download, and \nsolicit feedback from users who try it as to what worked and what \ndidn't work about it. This is sort of what we have now, but without a \nformal feedback channel. Getting others to validate new methods would \nbe best of all, but this usually takes time. Provided the changes \naren't too extensive or obnoxious, we could release new versions with \nthe modifications in as conditional-compiles, and take away each \ncondition once there is general agreement that the new calculation is \ndoing the right thing.\n\n\nI'm posting this to the Radiance developer's group, since that seems to \nbe the proper forum for it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-February/000055.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "February 24, 2003 at 10:13PM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000054", "id": "radiance-dev_000055"}
