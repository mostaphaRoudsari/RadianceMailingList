{"body": "--0-638891907-1046467129=:61292\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n\n\nTwo thoughts.  Firstly, whatever approach (TMESH or subdivision surfaces) will be a fantastic improvement.  I remember our work on the SFO Air Traffic Control tower and the inordinate amount of work I had to go through to simplify the USGS DEM geometry just to fit it into the model.\nSecondly, back when I first requested this feature twelve years ago, I never realized that it was the ray intersection algorithm causing the problem.  Although my suggestion sounds like throwing the baby out with the bath water, would it be reasonable to overhaul the entire ray intersection algorithm and use path tracing instead?  I'm sure path tracing will have different requirements upon the implementation of a complex surface mesh primitive, and considering that path tracing has already been implemented, this might be a good excuse to take a look at it and see how it works.\n-Chas\n\n\n--0-638891907-1046467129=:61292\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<P>Two thoughts.&nbsp; Firstly, whatever approach (TMESH or subdivision surfaces) will be a fantastic improvement.&nbsp; I remember our work on the SFO Air Traffic Control tower and the inordinate amount of work I had to go through to simplify the USGS DEM geometry just to fit it into the model.\n<P>Secondly, back when I first requested this feature twelve years ago, I never realized that it was the ray intersection algorithm causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although my suggestion sounds like throwing the baby out with the bath water,&nbsp;would&nbsp;it be&nbsp;reasonable to overhaul the&nbsp;entire ray intersection algorithm and use path tracing instead?&nbsp; I'm sure path tracing will have different requirements upon the implementation of a complex surface mesh primitive, and considering that path tracing has already been implemented, this might be a good excuse to take a look at it and see how it works.\n<P>-Chas</P>\n--0-638891907-1046467129=:61292--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-February/000057.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "February 28, 2003 at 01:18PM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000056", "id": "radiance-dev_000057"}
