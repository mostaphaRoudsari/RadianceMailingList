We could consider moving to a path tracing \nsolution, but that would involve rewriting the renderer from scratch, \nand probably wouldn't improve accuracy or efficiency in the end.  Path \ntracing works very well for a particular subset of problems, and has \nthe nice property of being \"unbiased,\" which means it always gets the \nright answer on average, only the noise gets quite high when it's \nhaving trouble.  In certain cases, you can't get rid of the noise no \nmatter how many paths you trace -- secondary light sources are a key \nexample where this occurs.  We'd no doubt end up building back in many \nof the features that have evolved in Radiance over the years, perhaps \neven ending up with something similar to what we have today.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-February/000058.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 28, 2003 at 02:17PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000056", "id": "radiance-dev_000058"}
