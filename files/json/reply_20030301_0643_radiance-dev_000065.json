Neither of those seems very\nobvious for the moment in the context of face grouping. Investing\na lot of thinking and coding into another 20 or 30% after we\nalready raised the bar by more than an order of magnitude doesn't\nsound like a priority task to me...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 01, 2003 at 06:43AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000056", "id": "radiance-dev_000065"}
