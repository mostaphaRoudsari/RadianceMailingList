Of course, using a texfunc per polygon is technically not\ncompact, but it works (see below).  But VRML is typically not as\npolygon-intense as other CAD formats, so my view is limited.\nI wonder whether someone on the general list actually experienced memory\nlimits with smooth surfaces, to back up the memory argument.\n\n\nMuch more annoying than memory consumption is the dysfunctionality of\ntexfuncs with glass and trans. Introducing a new \"smooth\" primitive without\nworking support for all materials would be sad, as smooth objects will\nlikely include reflectors and transparent surfaces. (despite that normal\ninterpolation is slightly off for mirror reflections).\n\n\nIf it wasn't Greg to mentioned it, I'd pointed out that the limited number\nof primitives is a major advantage of Radiance in terms of extensions and\nvalidation.\nIs a translator really out of question ? If we're faced with CAD generated,\ncumbersome huge vertex sets for tessellated surfaces, maybe it pays to\nimplement one of the common vertex-reorganizing programs used for scanned\ngeometry into the translator and boil it down.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "March 01, 2003 at 10:43AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000056", "id": "radiance-dev_000064"}
