{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nIf the question is what packages output Wavefront .obj format, then one \nwould be Rhino from Robert McNeel & Associates (www.rhino3d.com). We \nhave used Rhino succesfully in the past for dealing with complex curved \nsurface modeling and conversion with obj2rad. The resulting octrees do \ntend to be large. It would certainly great to be able to do more \nsophisticated texturing on this kind of geometry. I am not sure whether \n3DS Max or Viz export .obj?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n[snip out most of the important stuff ;->]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000066.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 03, 2003 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000056", "id": "radiance-dev_000066"}
