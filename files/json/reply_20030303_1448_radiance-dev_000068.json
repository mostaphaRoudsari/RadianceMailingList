(Don't take that \ntoo literally.)  If memory weren't an issue, there'd be no real reason \nto implement a mesh primitive.  The problems that Peter A-B mentions \nregarding certain material types not working properly with interpolated \nnormals is an embarrassment.  In fact, I don't know why this bug stood \nfor so long -- I had a look at the relevant code, and the solution was \nquite simple.  It should be fixed in the upcoming release, due out very \nshortly!\n\n\nMy main purpose for implementing meshes is to provide support for very \nlarge, complicated geometries, as one might obtain from a laser range \nscanner, for example.  Scanned meshes are required for many \narcheological reconstructions and other scenes captured from real \ngeometry, and each mesh may contain hundreds of thousands or even \nmillions of triangles.  Memory and its influence on virtual memory \nperformance are the main rendering challenges.  If I give up on local \nvertex references in faces, which I may have to unless I can resolve \nsome sticky problems, the memory use doesn't go up by 30% -- it \ntriples!  Pointers take the majority of space in a standard mesh \nrepresentation, and I would like to minimize these expenses any way I \ncan.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000068.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 03, 2003 at 02:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000056", "id": "radiance-dev_000068"}
