{"body": "Hi List!\n\n\nI am currently trying to do some first steps in animation with radiance. I\ndid some search in the list's archives, as well as older radiance digests and\nsome basic descriptions about camera path interpolation in general. What I\nfound to be useable (I am not a maths expert;-) was the method described by\nGreg Ward using rcalc, spline.cal and cnt to generate a view file from key\npoint.\n\n\nSo I defined a list containing 15 key points and directions, processed this\nwith rcalc and spline.cal, made 150 views out of this and was quite happy to\nsee all this was working (after having some trouble with the format-files\nused by rcalc first). Than, I used rpict to render my 150 frames, and I was\nquite happy with the speed on my old machine (the use of an ambient file shows\nit's benefits here).\n\n\nHowever, I didn't really get the camera path I expected to result from the\nkey points. I know that there are lots of parameters that define a path, not\nonly the key points. The problem here is that the interpolation let me to a\npath that doesn't even come close to the points. So I need a method to bind the\nspline generated by spline.cal closer to the defined points, making the\nspline less smooth. How can I do this? Should I define more or less points? And\nis there a parameter in spline.cal that can be used here?\n\n\nThank you, CU, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
