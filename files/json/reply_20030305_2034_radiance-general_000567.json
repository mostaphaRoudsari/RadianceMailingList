{"body": "Hi Greg!\n\n\n> This is puzzling, as the Catmull-Rolm spline used in spline.cal is \n> designed to pass exactly through the key frame positions.\n\n\nHmm.. that makes it easy to check.\n\n\n> Are you sure everything is working properly?\n\n\nNot any more ;-)\n\n\n> Each select call has the same number of arguments, corresponding to the \n> number of keyframes you entered, and the Nth argument of each should \n> correspond to your Nth keyframe value for that variable.\n\n\nYes, everything seams to be ok here. I still might have used the cal file in\na wrong way in the last step when I generated the views. I will repeat the\nprocedure with fewer key frames and frames to check this last step. Is it ok\nto specify one spline with lots of control points in general, or should I use\nmultiple splines? I am not sure if my 15 points are already too many controls\nto generate a path as I expected?\n\n\nThe really important information for me is that the spline is to go through\nthe points I define, I didn't know that before and will be able to try some\nmore paths now. Thank you!\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
