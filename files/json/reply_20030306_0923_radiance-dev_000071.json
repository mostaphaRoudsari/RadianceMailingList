{"body": "Hi Greg,\n(quote of first message added, I'll post this to the dev list)\n\n\n     there wouldn't be a chance to change the handling of alias in\n     3.5 ?\n     Like adding 'alias' as a primitive, so rview etc. can display\n     the\n     material name as it was before aliasing ?\n     It means changing stuff at some places, but would help quite a\n     bit\n     during material editing or selection.\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n> Are you sure this is the behavior most people would want?

These names are not necessarily user\ndefinable, or if they are, the user has chosen different names (wall_mat1,\nwall_mat2, ....) which will get mapped to the same Radiance material. Both\nis true in my case.  I would imagine the second could be easily true for\nAutoCAD. Other CAD exporters may be even weirder in their choice of\nmaterial names.\nAs you said, material names used in the exported geometry have to be\nmapped to descriptive names of Radiance materials, which are typically\nstored in some sort of library, and this mapping could be a list of dozen\nmaterials for one scene. Alias definitions glue the two together, with\nmultiple CAD material names mapped to the same Radiance materials.\nCurrently, alias defines are lost in frozen octrees. One way to get them\nis by adding an \"OBJECT oalias;\" to the OBJREC structure, which is a waste\nof memory and breaks with frozen octrees. Reading the alias file\nexplicitly doesn't ensure that the alias file and the octree are\ncongruent, and would work only with rshow.\nIt'll be useful to have access to both the original name and the aliased\nmaterial: The orginal name may be out of reach at that moment, but the\nmapping is. To change that I'd need the original name displayed  in\nrview/rtrace/rshow.\nany other experiences and views on this matter much appreciated-\n\n\n -Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000071.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "March 06, 2003 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000071"}
