{"body": "Hi Greg and Peter,\n\n\nLooking back at the earlier messages on the topic, I may be confused \nmyself. Anyhow, check out the following:\n\n\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\n\nvoid alias box.mat white\n\n\n!genbox box.mat box 1 1 1\n\n\nIf we trace the top of the box in rview, we get the material \"box.mat\" \nand the geometry \"box.6457\", we do not get that the material \"box.mat\" \nis really the material \"white\".\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n\n\n>\n> I checked the code, and it seems I was confused about the current \n> behavior -- rview actually does record and report the ID of the alias, \n> rather than the alias target.
