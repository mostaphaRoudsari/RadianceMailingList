{"body": "Maybe we should put it to a vote.  It seems straightforward, but it's \nactually a fair bit of coding to promote aliases to first class \ncitizens in the object array.  I guess I'd end up sticking the target \nID in a string argument and do a lookup each time the object function \nwas evaluated.  This would result in some overhead that isn't currently \nthere, both in terms of memory (negligible) and execution speed (more \nsignificant -- see the lastmod() call).  I might be able to get around \nthe execution overhead using the OBJREC os pointer, but I generally \ndon't use this for tiny bits of memory like object references.  Is it \nworth it to be able to trace the list of modifiers in applications like \nrshow?\n\n\nJack's suggestion can be implemented using the current alias handling \nas well as an OBJREC structure.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000079.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 06, 2003 at 02:26PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000079"}
