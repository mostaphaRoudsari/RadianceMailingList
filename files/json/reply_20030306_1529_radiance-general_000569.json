{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> This is puzzling, as the Catmull-Rolm spline used in spline.cal is\n> designed to pass exactly through the key frame positions. \n\n\nThat was the most important information to me, as I was able to search for \nthe error. The cal-file was ok, I had made an error in the last step, \n(generating the frames' views with cnt and rclac) where I had a wrong time \nsum. The path is nice and smooth now, and it all isn't that difficult ;-)))\n\n\nThank you, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000569.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
