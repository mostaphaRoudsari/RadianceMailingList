We just jumped into the middle of an\nongoing discussion here. Peter, could you give a short and\ncomplete outline for everybody?\n\n\nWhat I seem to understand so far, is a wish that more information\nabout the modifier tree is preserved when compiling/loading an\noctree, so that for the above example, the user could learn that\nthe box with the modifier \"box.mat\" actually makes reference to\nthe material \"white\". While this trivial example makes that look\nstraihtforward, let's look at a real life use of modifiers, as\nany Rayfront user might create with a few clicks of the mouse.\nThe following is a glass surface with 1cm wide horizontal strips\nof frosting, where the materials frosted_glass and floatglass are\ndefined in another file:\n\n\n\n\nvoid mixfunc l_v1-wpane-m+++x+++stripes\n4 l_v1-wpane-m+++f l_v1-wpane-m+++b Pz*0.01 .\n0\n0\n\n\nvoid    alias  l_v1-wpane-m+++b      frosted_glass\nvoid    alias  l_v1-wpane-m+++f      floatglass\nvoid    alias  l_v1-wpane-m          l_v1-wpane-m+++x+++stripes\n!xform scene/l_glasswall.rad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich modifier name exactly do want to see when you run a trace\non this geometry in rview?  It's still a fairly simple example,\nand you already have a choice of 7 names, two of which are\nmaterials (the most desirable choice). Or would you like to spit\nout the whole tree?\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000077.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 06, 2003 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000077"}
