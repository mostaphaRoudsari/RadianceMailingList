They only make it possible to provide more complete\ndiagnostics to people who lost track of their scene structure,\npossibly because they have to use a stupid CAD translator that\ndoesn't generate unique identifiers.\n\n\nWhether such diagnostics are critical enough to change the octree\nfile format, to increase the complexity of the code, and to\npossibly slow down the simulations, is an entierly different\nquestion. I can't say that I'm completely convinced at this\npoint.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 07, 2003 at 05:51AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000085"}
