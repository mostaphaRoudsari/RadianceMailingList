They will become a\n*new* special case now, because the additional lookups they\ngenerate need to be short circuited as efficiently as possible.\n\n\nGreg mentioned something how this could be done with almost no\nperformance penalties. I didn't understand the details, so I\ncan't say anything smart about that aspect. The ultimate\nverification will come through running tests anyway. Isn't that\nwhat CVS branching was invented for? ;)\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000087.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 08, 2003 at 07:57PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000087"}
