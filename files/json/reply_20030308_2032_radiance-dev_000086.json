They allow verification of any octree, regardless whether generated\nby makefiles or by GUI driven interfaces for individuals who don't  know\n(neither they need to, nor do they want to) what's in their octrees, and who\nnever get an octree from someone else who uses a different generating\nmechanism.\n\n\n> Whether such diagnostics are critical enough to change the octree\n> file format, to increase the complexity of the code, and to\n> possibly slow down the simulations, is an entierly different\n> question.

Treating it as true primitive\nmay actually synchronize this with the general flow of logic. If the method\nproposed earlier is valid, measured slowdown will be very, very low.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000086.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "March 08, 2003 at 08:32PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000086"}
