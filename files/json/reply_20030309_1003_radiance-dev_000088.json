The rad file syntax of \"alias\" will remain irregular. We're probably stuck\nwith that until an all-new grammar for the rad file is founded. With the little\nuse MGF has seen yet (sadly), I don't bet on that happening soon. Maybe I'm wrong\nconcerning MGF, I just haven't heard of it lately.\nThe internal processing of \"alias\" wouldn't be special, it is what happens when\nthe chain of modifiers is followed during  mixfunc  and texture/pattern\nprocessing. The difference being that \"alias\" wouldn't do any calculations.  The\ncost of mixfunc/textures/patterns results from the processing they do, not from\nfollowing the modifier chain.\n\n\n> ...\n> Greg mentioned something how this could be done with almost no\n> performance penalties.

Assuming that a branch is expensive in terms of coordination\namongst developpers,  developpers-users and amongst users, maybe the \"big\"\nchanges like photon-map or Christoph's energy calculations set the bar for\nbranching.\n\n\na nice weekend to all\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "March 09, 2003 at 10:03AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000072", "id": "radiance-dev_000088"}
