{"body": "I just checked in my change to Radiance alias handling, which also \nfixed that memory bug I mentioned in freeobjects().  The new module, \nrt/m_alias.c does the runtime handling, which is essentially free for \naliased materials that have the same modifier as the original (either \nby coincidence or using the explicit \"inherit\" keyword).  The change \ntouched a few other files besides the obvious ones -- it even cleaned \nup the code a bit in gen/xform.c.\n\n\nI also checked in the documentation in ray/doc -- the reference manual \nand man pages.  I figure we should start tracking changes on those \nagain as well.  I don't think we need to bother about recovering the \nSCCS revisions, so I won't even ask Peter for that.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000093.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 11, 2003 at 11:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000081", "id": "radiance-dev_000093"}
