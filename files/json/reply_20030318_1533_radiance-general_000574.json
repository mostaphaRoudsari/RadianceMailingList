{"body": "Hi Terry!\n\n\nI am a research fellow at the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL and \nhave come across your post regarding the \"Hard Drive-less Radiance for PC\". \nI think it is a god send and I wanted to try it out over here. I have \ndownloaded the iso image and burnt a disc. I am running into problems \nbooting into the iso image because of missing user info: I have not found \n(or missed spotting) any documentation regarding the specific login info \nrequired. Is there a root password for the bootable cd or a set of standard \nusers in the iso image?\n\n\nMany Thanks for your help and for making this iso image available to the \nradiance community!\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nStefan Kueppers\nMArch.
