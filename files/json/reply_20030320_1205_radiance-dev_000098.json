Thanks goes also to Peter \nA-B, who pretested a lot of this stuff under Linux.  I missed the \nproblem in rad.c, but it will be fixed for the final release.\n\n\n> I also compiled glrad and 3ds2mgf, but I have to do it manually (like \n> in\n> the previous radiance releases):\n> 1) to compile glrad:\n> I cd to src/common and do a \"rmake ogl\" and then cd to src/util and\n> type \"rmake glrad\" (also in this case I had to comment the extern \n> function\n> declaration at line 97).\n> 2) to compile 3ds2mgf:\n> I simply cd to src/cv/mgflib and type \"make 3ds2mgf\".\n\n\nYes, well...  I should probably enable the \"ogl\" special compile under \nLinux, but I'm not sure how widely supported OpenGL is -- can anyone \ntell me if there are cases where it is not?  You can add this yourself \nto the rmake script (under the SPECIAL= variable) and avoid the trouble \nof compiling glrad manually.  You also should go into the ray/src/hd \ndirectory and run \"rmake ogl\" to get the extra rholo drivers.\n\n\nAs for 3ds2mgf, I have concerns that it won't compile everywhere, which \nis why I don't generally include it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000098.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 20, 2003 at 12:05PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000096", "id": "radiance-dev_000098"}
