Yes, if you have radbin_osx you're \npretty close:\n\n\nCopy the binaries to /usr/local/bin/ray (permissions should be set \nalready, but if you get \"permission denied\" errors when you try to run \nthings, run \"chmod -R a+rx /usr/local/bin/ray\", sans quotes, from the \ncommand line).\n\n\n From the source distribution, copy the /ray/lib folder to: \n/usr/local/lib/ray\n\n\nAdd the radiance directory to your search path, by adding this line:\n\n\nset path=(/usr/local/bin/ray $path)\n\n\n... to your .cshrc file (which is in your home directory).\n\n\nI think that was all I had to do to get things going on OS X.  And do \nhave a look at the various documentation and sample files in the source \nfolder.\n\n\nGood luck!  Have fun!  Enough shouting!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000582.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 20, 2003 at 04:34PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000575", "id": "radiance-general_000582"}
