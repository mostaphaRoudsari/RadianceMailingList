We could prepare a DEB distribution, too ...\n>\nGreg got a bit optimistic there, ... I could test Slackware and Debian \nLinux, but since Slackware's community is very small, Debian's deb files \nare probably much more interesting. If you like to generate this, please \ngo ahead and let me know where to get them, so it gets linked at  \nRadiance-Online. I'm fairly busy until next week, including annual \nupdates of some software on the Radiance webserver. Greg suggested \ntrying to use as much static libs as possible for a \"static\" release. \nI'll give it a try.\nAnyone with a current RedHat system, please step forward and supply an \nrpm file. My try at this would be building rpm on a Slackware machine, \nwhcih may have other lib versions.\n\n\n>Is there any plan to include photon mapping in a short time in the main \n>radiance distribution?\n>\nMy guts feeling would be to test R3.5 \"classic\" first. With all the ANSI \nchanges it would be comforting to know it still works as before.  Photon \nMap is quite substantial and might be a good candidate for creating a \nCVS \"branch\".\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "March 20, 2003 at 09:07PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000096", "id": "radiance-dev_000099"}
