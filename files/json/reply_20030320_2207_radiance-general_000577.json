There is something\n\"preconfigured\" that you don't want. Do a ./makeall clean first. If that doesn't\nhelp (the makeall should ask you about your system / environment, e.g.\nLinux, Solaris, AIX, BSD...), touch the makeall script (afaik, if the script has\nbeen \"modified\", e.g. by setting the modification time, it will go through the\nwhole configuration procedure - else it will just recompile).\n\n\n> I get lots of errors\n> radogl.h:10: header file 'GL/glu.h' not found\n> radogl.h:28: undefined type, found `GLfloat'\n\n\nOf course, that's not for your Linux box.\n\n\nI hope you will get a working radiance soon. I wonder if we will see a\nstandard installation for radiance one day (make config, make, make test, make\ninstall, or even a configure script).\n\n\nBTW: if you have successfully installed radiance for the first time, the\nnext might be to try some optimizations with gcc (e.g. -O3 -ffast-math\n-mcpu=YourCpu)... But that will be the next step...\n\n\nGood luck, CU, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
