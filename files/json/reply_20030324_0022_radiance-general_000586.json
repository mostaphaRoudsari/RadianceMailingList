{"body": "Hi!  \n\n\nWhile building binaries, I did some testing on the new release with some of\nmy  \nbigger scenes. I find that the new oconv from 3.5 takes really much memory,\nin  \nfact, more than I have installed in my poor old k6-2 (96MB). So I cannot\nbuild  \nan octree from a scene that was fine with 3.4.1.  \n\n\nIs this only a result of changes in the -n and -r defaults? Or ist the new\noconv  \nmore memory-hungry then older releases in general? I hope to get my scene \nbuilt with the new 3.5 soon on x86,  as I will be able to tar a binary\ndistribution \nthan. \n\n\nCU, Lars. \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
