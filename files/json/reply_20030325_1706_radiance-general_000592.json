I think that Mandrake RPM's will work within RedHat too; for Mandrake uses RedHat's package manager. But I'm assuming that, and would want to test it/have it tested prior to 'official' release.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000592.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "March 25, 2003 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000589", "id": "radiance-general_000592"}
