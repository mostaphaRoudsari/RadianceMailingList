{"body": "Hi Ada,\n\n\nI think there's no way to do this correctly without understanding and \nhacking the source code in src/rt/normal.c.  That's what I had to do to \ngenerate this image in the first place.  If you just want a copy of the \nimage, I would be happy to provide one.  You won't be able to get this \nresult by altering the command line options or the material parameters \nalone.  If your specular surface(s) has zero roughness, you might be \nable to get close by rendering pictures of your scene with and without \nthe specular component(s), and subracting the resulting pictures.  As \nfor separating the interreflected component, the same picture \nsubtraction should work between one rendered with -ab 1 -av [whatever] \nand -ab 0 -av 0 0 0.\n\n\nTo subtract two images:\n\n\n\tpcomb img1.pic -s -1 img2.pic > img1-img2.pic\n\n\nThe images must be rendered at the same size and resolution, setting \nthe rpict parameters -pj 0 and -ps 1.  You can pass the result through \npfilt to improve the final appearance, but I don't recommend doing it \nbefore.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\nAda Fraser <adafraser@yahoo.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000594.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 26, 2003 at 02:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000593", "id": "radiance-general_000594"}
