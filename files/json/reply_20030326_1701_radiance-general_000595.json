{"body": "Hello. Thank you for the answer Greg. It is very\nhelpful. I have one follow up question: When I set the\nrendering parameters -ab 0 -av 0 0 0, I am eliminating\nthe interreflected component. But I still see some\nreflection of the interior surfaces on my window\nglazing. Since there is no interreflection, why is\nthis happening?\n\n\nThanks again.\nAda\n\n\n--- Greg Ward <gward@lmi.net> wrote:\n> Hi Ada,\n> \n> I think there's no way to do this correctly without\n> understanding and \n> hacking the source code in src/rt/normal.c.
