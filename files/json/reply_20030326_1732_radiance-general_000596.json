{"body": "Hi Ada,\n\n\nI should have been more specific -- setting -ab 0 -av 0 0 0 eliminates \n_diffuse_ interreflections in the calculation -- specular reflections \nwill still be present.  The only way to get rid of specular reflections \n(reliably) is to eliminate specular components from your materials.  In \nthe case of a glass surface, you would have to substitute trans with a \nzero reflected component.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nAda Fraser <adafraser@yahoo.com> writes:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000596.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 26, 2003 at 05:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000593", "id": "radiance-general_000596"}
