I included the rest of the Cygwin stuff because I was not sure if the Samba additions depended upon it.  You seem to confirm my suspicions, and so, Samba file locking really hasn't been implemented in rpiece.c independent from Cygwin, right?  If so, then I agree, it is of little value.\n-Chas\n\n\n--0-2089804629-1048794254=:56596\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<P>George Mischler wrote:<BR><BR>&gt; Advantages:<BR>&gt; - works transparently together with unix NFS locks, even if the<BR>&gt; file is actually accessed through a Samba mount.<BR>&gt; - no code changes required<BR><BR>&gt; Disadvantages:<BR>&gt; - requires the Cygwin libraries, which makes commercial<BR>&gt; redistribution potentially difficult/expensive.<BR>&gt; - NFS locks still seem to be unreliable on some unix systems.<BR>&gt; - I'm not sure if Cygwin can lock files on both unix and Windows<BR>&gt; based filesystems this way.<BR><BR><BR>====\n<P>Georg,\n<P>Just to confirm, you looked at the revised code in rpiece.c written by Tony Kay?&nbsp; I included the rest of the Cygwin stuff because I was not sure if the Samba additions depended upon it.&nbsp; You seem to confirm my suspicions, and so, Samba file locking really hasn't been implemented in rpiece.c independent from Cygwin, right?&nbsp; If so, then I agree, it is of little value.\n<P>-Chas</P>\n--0-2089804629-1048794254=:56596--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000107.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "March 27, 2003 at 11:44AM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000102", "id": "radiance-dev_000107"}
