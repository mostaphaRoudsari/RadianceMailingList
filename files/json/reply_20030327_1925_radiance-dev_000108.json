The actual changes in rpiece.c involve\nreplacing the MSDOS preprocessor symbol by CYGWIN for conditional\ncompiles, and some code to work around a Cygwin bug with fdopen().\nThe locking mechanism is unchanged from standard unix Radiance,\nand can't work without Cygwin on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000108.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 27, 2003 at 07:25PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000102", "id": "radiance-dev_000108"}
