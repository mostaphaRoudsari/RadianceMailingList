You type \"calc /path/to/trans.cal\" at the comand line, and feed \nit your transmission values (tn), and it spits out a transmissivity value:\n\n\n% calc trans.cal (or full pathname if not in a PATH location)\ntn(.88)\n$1=0.958415435\ntn(.57)\n$2=0.621392084\n\n\nJust keep on feedin' it values and recording the output, and hit \ncontrol+D to quit when you're done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000604.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 28, 2003 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000602", "id": "radiance-general_000604"}
