{"body": "Dear Mr.Ward, \n\n\nI am student of architecture working an a daylight simulation with \nradiance, still dealing with several problems. \nI want to generate indoor illuminance values in Lux for a validation \nwith measured values of an office room. \nI am working with the Perez all-weather skymodell in oder to \ncalculate with a sky which is equivalent to the measured outdoor \nconditions.  \nFor input in gendaylit I use the measured direct-normal and diffuse-\nhorizontal- illuminance [W/m\u00b2]. \n\n\n# gendaylit 1 11 12.00 -a 51.30 -o -7.28 -m -15 +s -W 154 93 \n# Ground ambient level: 11.1 \n\n\nvoid light solar \n0 \n0 \n3 9.684e+005 9.684e+005 9.684e+005 \n\n\nsolar source sun \n0 \n0 \n4 0.156133 -0.946576 0.282165 0.533000 \n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc \n2 skybright perezlum.cal \n0 \n10 2.411e+001 3.396e+000 -1.254300 -0.605648 10.900086 -\n3.202346  0.012553 0.156133 -0.946576 0.282165  \n\n\nThen I add the sky description from gensky by preparing the octree \n\n\nskyfunc glow sky_glow \n0 \n0 \n4 1 1 1  0 \nsky_glow source sky \n0 \n0 \n4 0 0 1 180 \n\n\nrtrace is running with the option -I and  the following parameters  \n-ab 4 -av 0.10 0.10 0.10 -ds 0.15 -aa 0.15 -ad 512 -ar 128 -as 256 -\ndc 0.50  \n-dj 0.7  -dp 512 -dr 3 -dt 0.05 -lr 8 -lw 0.002 -sj 1 -st 0.15 \n\n\nTo obtain results for illuminance I execute rcalc for the coordinates \nof the real  measured points using a function I found in the mailing \narchive \n\n\nrcalc -e '$1=47.435*$1+119.93*$2+11.635*$3'  \n\n\nUnfortunatly I don't obtain reasonable results, neither for clear sky \nnor for  overcast conditions. \nThe generated values for the outdoor illuminance at clear sky \nconditions are  approximately 25% lower and at overcast \nconditions 40 % higher than in reality. \nThe generated values for the outdoor illuminance are converse and \nalso  definitive non equivalent in their progression. \n\n\nIt would be kind if You could help me. \n\n\nRegards, Jorg Escher \n\n\nUniversity of Dortmund  \nChair for Environmental Architecture \n0049.231.755.54.25 \nescher@climate.bauwesen.uni-dortmund.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000601.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 28, 2003 at 07:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000605", "id": "radiance-general_000601"}
