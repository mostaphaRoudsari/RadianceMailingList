Infact, I'm pretty sure it was\navailable from his website, but maybe that's changed now. Anyway, if\nJoerg can't find it, I've got it.\n\n\nOther than that, I really can't think of any useful validation\nreferences either. My eggs-perience[tm] was that, once you're in\nRealLife[tm] territory... you're on your own, mate! There is no compass,\nand don't rely on your intuition either. I chucked mine overboard early\non when I embarked on this voyage.\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
