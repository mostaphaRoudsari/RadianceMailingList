It's the best way to solve the problem, and /opt/radiance is also the \nplace where I have my radiance tree. I think I'll study more the FHS documents \nand the debian policy. \nAnd tomorrow I'll update the radiance deb and rpm packages.\n\n\nWhat about adding Radiance to the debian distribution?\n\n\n\n\ning.
