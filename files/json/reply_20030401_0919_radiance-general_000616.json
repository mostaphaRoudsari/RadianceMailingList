{"body": ">> The bigger one is this: \n>   the \"vim\" package also has a \"rview\" executable:\n\n\nI ran into this same problem on Mandrake 9.0.\n\n\n>   On different systems it may not be a problem, for instance on my\n>   linux Mandrake 9.0 box rview from the vim package is put \n> inside /bin/,\n>   so no overwrite occurs and apparently everything goes smoothly,\n>   but the system will always execute the vim rview binary, unless\n>   somebody erases or rename it, or changes the PATH variable.\n\n\nI simply changed the PATH for my user login; so that if I'm logged\nin as anything else rview calls VIM. I hope this doesn't raise any\nproblems, in that my login now paths to Radiance first, and VIM\nsecond. But so far I haven't noticed any problems.\n\n\nYou might want to include in the README of your RPM package\nabout this issue, so that newbies, like myself, can have a hope\nto sort it out.\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000616.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "April 01, 2003 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000610", "id": "radiance-general_000616"}
