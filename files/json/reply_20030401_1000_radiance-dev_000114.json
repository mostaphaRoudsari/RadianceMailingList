{"body": "> csh and tcsh should be avoided as scripting languages.\n\n\nWriting this into an OS policy is condescending at best, and\narrogant at worst. If Debian wants to claim posix compliance,\nthen a csh variant must be present, which means users may use it\nfor whatever purpose they please. Some people think that [t]csh\ndoesn't have all the features they would like to have in a\nscripting language, and there are good arguments for that. But\nclaiming that others may not use it for that reason is nonsense.\n\n\nFortunately, they were decent enough to use the word \"should\".\nThat makes it a recommendation that you're not bound to in any way.\n\n\n\n\n> [if a] package comes with csh scripts\n> then you must make sure that they start with #!/bin/csh and\n> make your package depend on the c-shell virtual package.\n\n\nThat's a requirement of the package manager, and probably worth\nadhering to. Note that Radiance currently also includes scripts\nthat depend on a specific (and rather old) version of tcl/tk.\nI'm not sure if making the package dependent on that would be an\nequally good idea, though.\n\n\n\n\n> Any scripts which create files in world-writeable directories (e.g., in /tmp)\n> must use a mechanism which will fail if a file with the same name already\n> exists.\n\n\nThis is certainly good practise, but not critical for Radiance,\nand not in your hands as a package builder anyway. Or are they\nonly talking about scripts that are used while *installing* the\npackage?\n\n\n\n\n> No environment variables should be used:\n\n\nAnother \"should\" that is not really up to the OS folks to decide\nabout. It may still be a good idea for practical reasons, though.\nNote that my suggestion for Radiance to search its libraries in\ncertain locations relative to its binaries would bring us into\ncompliance with this point as a side effect.\n\n\n\n\n> I think I'll update the packages when I'll have received an answer ...\n\n\nI'd say ignore the \"should\"s at will. Nothing a user can do with\nyour Radiance package will threaten the integrity of their\nsystem, not even on Debian.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-April/000114.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 01, 2003 at 10:00AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000112", "id": "radiance-dev_000114"}
