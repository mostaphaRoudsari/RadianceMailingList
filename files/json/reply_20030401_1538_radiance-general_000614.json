{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n\n\nThere was a short discussion on Intertactive Radiance on this list recently\nwith the subject \"Radiance and VR\".\nBasically you have two options:\n1. Use the Holodeck rholo tools that come with Radiance 3.4+\nAdvantage:\nyou get all the reflectance effects that you would get when rendering a\nsingle image.\n\n\nDisadvantage:\nYou can only view the scenes with the rholo tools.\nLevel of interactivity depends on the preprocessing time.\n\n\n2. Write your own tool that exports VRML with textures or vertex colours\nfrom Radiance:\nI worked on that problem a bit last year and gave a presentation at the\nRadiance workshop.\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Spanlang/index.html\nBasically the  system uses Radiance to create texture maps (lightmaps) for\nall surfaces in the scene. The texture maps\nare then converted to jpeg to be interactively rendered in a VRML browser.\nIn its current state it is only usable by me.\nIf I had time to implement it again I would probably use the rad2mgf and\nmgf2inv tools to convert the\ngeometry from Radiance to VRML (Inventor).\nTo avoid texture memory problems it may be better to generate vertex colours\ninstead of texture maps.\n\n\nAdvantage:\nYou can view it in any VRML browser and convert it to other formats for\ninteractive viewing.\n\n\nDisadvantage:\nOnly works properly with perfectly diffuse reflecting materials.\nWill require some development efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernhard\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000614.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernhard Spanlang", "created_at": "April 01, 2003 at 03:38PM", "created_by": "Bernhard_Spanlang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000613", "id": "radiance-general_000614"}
