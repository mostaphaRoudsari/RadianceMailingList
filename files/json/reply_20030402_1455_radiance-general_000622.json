I just upgraded to Beta3, and the cabin scene is twirling \naround on my Power Book right now.\n\n\nIt is fascinating to watch the image refine interractively like this. \nIt's really instructive; in a way it helps me understand how the whole \nray tracing process works, much in the same manner as watching \nLightscape process a radiosity solution helps one understand the \nradiosity method.  For example, it's interesting to see how after you \nzoom in on an already refined area, the diffuse materials get to reuse a \nlot of the samples, whereas the specular ones have to start over. \nWatching the subtle shading effects we have become accustomed to seeing \nin Radiance images slowly bubble up from what is initially a crude, \npointillistic rendering, is truly fascinating to observe.\n\n\nWell, I find it interesting. =8-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000622.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 02, 2003 at 02:55PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000611", "id": "radiance-general_000622"}
