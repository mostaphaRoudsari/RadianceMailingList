{"body": "Hi! \n\n\nTherefore it's not always a bad idea to have those programs \nthat are not part of the distribution in their own directories \nunder /opt/Program-Name. If you install software that is not \nfrom the distribution, you will NEVER know if there is some \nconflict hidden... so I prefer not to put the app in my \ndistribution's paths. I can still set PATH and RAYPATH for \nspecific users (e.g. create a radiance user account), or \nuse a simple script to do these settings before you start \nrendering. \n\n\nOk, to be honest... on my private box, I put all that radiance \nstuff into the standard path (/usr/local/bin here) - but I know \nthat I never had problems with that, while a user on a shared \nmachine might get into trouble if he NEED vi - and can't \ncorrect the conflicts. \n\n\nCU, Lars ;-) \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
