On Linux, this is acheived either through the X11 server\nor directly through the mesa library.\n\n\nThe XFree86 driver status page claims that there is accelerated\nsupport for several Rage Mobility varieties in the current version:\n  http://www.xfree86.org/current/Status6.html\nYou'll have to check if your card is among those listed.\nIf 3d acceleration is not supported with your card, then OpenGL\ngraphics will be rendered in software mode, which shouldn't be a\nproblem either.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000633.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 03, 2003 at 10:01PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000632", "id": "radiance-general_000633"}
