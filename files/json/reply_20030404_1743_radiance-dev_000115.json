{"body": "My Radiance linux/i386 packages page has been updated:\n\n\nhttp://dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/packages/\n\n\nHere you will find the following versions of Radiance\nRadiance 3.5.0\nRadiance 3.5.0 static\nRadiance 3.4.1 pmap \n(patched with the photon mapping extension by Roland Schregle)\n\n\nI have decided to prepare 4 kinds of packages: tar.gz, tar.bz2, deb and rpm.\n\n\nThe tar.gz and tar.bz2 packages can be considered add-on packages, so\nthe suggested installation location is /opt/radiance.\n\n\nThe deb and rpm packages behave this way:\n\n\nthe binaries are installed into -> /usr/lib/radiance/bin\nthe radiance library is installed into  -> /usr/share/radiance/lib\nthe examples are installed into -> /usr/share/radiance/obj\nthe documentation is installed into -> /usr/share/doc/radiance\nthe man pages are installed into -> /usr/share/man\n\n\nAfter the package installation, the user only has to add /usr/lib/radiance/bin\nto the PATH environment variable, since I have added /usr/share/radiance/lib\nto the default library search path in the source code (src/common/paths.h).\n\n\nGeorg Mischler wrote:\n> I'd say ignore the \"should\"s at will. Nothing a user can do with\n> your Radiance package will threaten the integrity of their\n> system, not even on Debian.\n\n\nI finally decided to use these locations because making a debian package\nmeans contributing to the debian distribution, that has his own policy that\nmust be respected. \nI also tried to use the /opt/radiance path, but the debian packaging system \ndidn't behave very well in this case, so I followed the advices that came \nfrom the Debian side. Of course I ignored the \"csh scripts\nproblem\" and resolved the \"environment variable problem\" by adding  \n/usr/share/radiance/lib to the default library search path in the source code \n(src/common/paths.h), as I already said.\n\n\nThe rpm packages are derived from the deb ones using alien.\n\n\nHere are a few notes about the packages (for more info, just check the page):\n1) when compiling the \"static version\" I had some problems with unresolved \nsymbols inside libGL.a and libGLU.a coming from the Mesa distribution. I even \ncompiled by myself the Mesa libs, but this didn't solved the problem. \nUnfortunately I don't much have time to go deeper, so the static version has \nno OpenGL related stuff.\n2) I never managed in compiling the pmap patched code together with\nthe holodeck files, so the pmap package has no holodeck executables.\nIf anybody wants to help me, I can share my stderr.\n\n\nMany thanks to Georg Mischler and to Peter Apian-Bennewitz for their\nhelp and comments.\n\n\nI hope that these packages can be useful ...\n\n\n\n\ning.
