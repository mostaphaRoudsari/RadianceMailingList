{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nI wish there was some way to manually set the size of rview and rholo \nwindows. I believe both of these programs scales to fill the monitor, \nwich is just fine on my 768 pixel high Powerbook. However, my \ndual-monitor G4/500 desktop is not very responsive when rholo launches \na 2500 pixel wide window across both monitors. Similarly, 1200 pixel \nrview windows takes some time to render, and feels \"less interactive\" \non the large-screen desktop.\n\n\nOr is it just me who have overlooked something obvious?\n\n\nRegards,\nReidarR,\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reidar Andreas Richardsen", "created_at": "April 04, 2003 at 07:18PM", "created_by": "Reidar_Andreas_Richardsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000637", "id": "radiance-general_000636"}
