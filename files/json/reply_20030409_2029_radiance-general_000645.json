I commented out the line in the configure script \nand everything appeared to compile - including ra_tiff and friends. It \nappears that oconv and rpict and rview seem to work, but I'm still left \nwith a nonworking ximage. Time to fiddle around a little more :)\n\n\nThank you for the help,\n\n\ntom\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000645.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "tom", "created_at": "April 09, 2003 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "tom", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000643", "id": "radiance-general_000645"}
