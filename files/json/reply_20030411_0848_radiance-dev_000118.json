{"body": "It's true that there's still some flotsam in the 3.5 distribution -- \nmostly things that don't get built but I haven't looked at the source \ncode to decide if it needs to be thrown out or not.  The X11 stuff is \nall up-to-date as far as I know.  The X10 and VGA drivers could easily \nbe thrown out, and probably should be at some point.\n\n\nI have never used autoconf and don't plan to, as I don't see the need \nfor it.  There are very few conditional compiles in Radiance, and as we \nhave discussed in previous posts, most of the ones that remain can be \neliminated with a little effort.  I would rather see us spend time on \nthat than tailoring compiles based on an autoconf approach, which would \nbe tedous and probably less reliable in the end.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-April/000118.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 11, 2003 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000117", "id": "radiance-dev_000118"}
