HP-UX 11.00 manpages don't show it neither. Maybe some (quiet \nold) Starbase (HP's ancient graphic lib) had something with that name.\nI've just tried compiling Radiance 3R5 on HP-UX 10.0, that worked except \nan error in 'x11twind.c' . That could probably be fixed if you're really \ninterested. On HPUX 11 I don't know.\nMy personal thought If you have PA-RiSC (HP's \"Precision Architektur\" \nCPU)  hardware to use, but no compelling reasons to run HP-UX,  Debian \nLinux offers a more standardized system, and it runs fairly well on \nnon-Intel CPUs. Although the XFree server is not supported on all models \nand HP graphic cards ( = use PA-RISC for calculation).\n\n\nregards\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000649.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "April 11, 2003 at 05:24PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000648", "id": "radiance-general_000649"}
