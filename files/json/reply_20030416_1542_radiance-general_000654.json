{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nYou need to look into the \"rad\" program, which will help you to set \nappropriate parameters for your environment.  When you have indirect \nillumination like this and you use the default rendering parameters, \nyou get the kind of disappointing results you're seeing.  The rad tool \nwill help you avoid these.  Also, the compamb script is probably \nfailing because you are giving it your Radiance scene file(s) rather \nthan the rad input file (usually .rif) that it expects.\n\n\nA reasonable introduction to rad is included at the end of the first \nchapter in \"Rendering with Radiance,\" which is distributed as a PDF in \nthe file \"ray/doc/pdf/RwR01.pdf\" included with the 3.5 release.  If you \ndon't have that, get it from the Radiance website:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/ch1/ch1.pdf\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000654.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 16, 2003 at 03:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000652", "id": "radiance-general_000654"}
