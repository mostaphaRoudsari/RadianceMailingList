{"body": "Hi! \n\n\nAs far as I remember you can use 3ds and obj output with Archicad, \nI did this some time ago. The problem with Archicad is that it \ntends to give you VERY detailed models, as every single element \n(a door, a window, ..) consists of lots of geometry. \n\n\nMaybe you should try it if you have a small project, with \nlarger ones, I would try to reduce the scene geometry. \n\n\nGood luck, CU, Lars. \n\n\n(BTW: You can export obj and 3ds when you are in the 3d-window...) \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
