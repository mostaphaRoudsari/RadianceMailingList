{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI've looked at my old projects... the one I exported from Archicad\nwas written as 3ds, then converted to mgf and from there to rad. As\nyou get triangles with 3ds, and as Archicad produces a lot of\ngeometry (that's because it follows an approach using building\nelements, which are predefined with all details and then modified).\nI got quite large scene files (my geometry in radiance format .rad\ntook about 50MB). I am not sure if the detail settings you can do\nin Archicad just change the view or also the geometry that is\nexported. You might try to import your 3ds into a pure modeller\nand reduce details here (I love to use formZ for radiance scenes,\nyou can even export dxf then and import your simplified scene\nas dxf than with dxf2rad).\n\n\nAs you see, you must decide wether you want to do some extra\nwork and get some \"optimized\" model into radiance, e.g. if you will\ndo a lot of rendering later, or if you simply want some nice images\nand use the \"brute force\" method simply importing the geometry\nfrom Archicad, and using a fast machine with lots of memory... I\nalways do some work on geometry before I import into radiance\njust because I have a 128MB laptop here, so maybe all this is\nno problem for you.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000657.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
