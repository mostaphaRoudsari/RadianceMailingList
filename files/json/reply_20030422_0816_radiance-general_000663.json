{"body": "Hi Kryzysztof,\n\n\nIs it possible that there is some error causing all of your polygons to \nlie on top of each other?  Try viewing them with \"objline\" -- you can \nuse \"objline model.rad | meta2tga -x 1024 -y 1024 > model.tga\" then \nview the output with an image viewer that recognizes Targa files, or \nconvert the Targa image to Radiance with \"ra_t8 -r model.tga > \nmodel.pic\".  This will show you what your model looks like without \nhaving to run it through oconv, first.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000663.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 22, 2003 at 08:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000660", "id": "radiance-general_000663"}
