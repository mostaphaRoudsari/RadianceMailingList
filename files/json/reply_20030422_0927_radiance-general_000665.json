{"body": "This is informative -- it looks to me like the density of polygons goes \nup dramatically near the center, and I suspect this is why oconv is \nunable to resolve your model.  Oconv has an upper limit to the number \nof polygons it will put in an octree voxel, and you are running into \nthis limit with lower values of -r and running out of memory as it \ntries to resolve the mesh with larger values of -r.  The best solution \nwould be to reduce the number of polygons you have in the center of \nyour reflector, perhaps by going to a more sophisticated grid \narrangement that what you have, which appears to be a uniform division \nof the polar coordinates.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000665.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 22, 2003 at 09:27AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000660", "id": "radiance-general_000665"}
