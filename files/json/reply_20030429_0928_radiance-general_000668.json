{"body": "Hi Jon,\n\n\nFocal length is specified with the -vh and -vv options of rpict, which \nalso controls the image aspect ratio.  Knowing one from the other \nrequires a specific image (film) size and format.  For 35mm film, the \nformula is:\n\n\nfocal_length = 35/2 / tan(vv_angle/2)\n\n\nWhere vv_angle is the vertical view angle for a landscape picture.  The \nhorizontal angle is then given by:\n\n\nhh_angle = 2 * atan(vv_angle/2 * 3/2)\n\n\nTo check your calcs, a 50mm lens in 35mm photography is equivalent to a \nRadiance view specification of:\n\n\n-vh 49.6 -vv 35.3\n\n\n(Remember that many trigonometric libraries including those used by \nRadiance's \"calc\" program deal in radians, and you need to convert this \nusing 180/PI.)\n\n\nI hope the above exercise makes it clear why I didn't choose focal \nlength in definining views in rpict -- they don't make a lot of sense.\n\n\nThere are also Radiance library routines you can access from C-code.  \nCheck out the viewloc() function in src/common/image.c and some of the \nother routines there.\n\n\nGood luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000668.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 29, 2003 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000667", "id": "radiance-general_000668"}
