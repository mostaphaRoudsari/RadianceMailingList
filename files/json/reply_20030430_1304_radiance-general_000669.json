{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI've just made oconv process with success. First I tried to reduce number of\npolygons without success. There is no way. The most important problem are\npolygons in the center of my reflector. There are 360 triangles with common\nvertex in optical axis which make a part of sphere with very small diameter\n(1 cm). When I delete only these 360 triangles I can make oconv process.\n\n\nThe second notice is that there is no way to make oconv process with -r\nbigger than 262144. I tried to make calculation with -r 393216 when I got\n\"set overflow in addobject\" but then I've got \"out of memory in emalloc\" or\n\"system out of octree space\". I the other words if it was not possible to\nmake calculation with -r 262144 it would no way to do it at all.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nKrzysztof.\n\n\n\n\nKrzysztof Wandachowicz\nhttp://lumen.iee.put.poznan.pl/kw/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000669.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Krzysztof Wandachowicz", "created_at": "April 30, 2003 at 01:04PM", "created_by": "Krzysztof_Wandachowicz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000660", "id": "radiance-general_000669"}
