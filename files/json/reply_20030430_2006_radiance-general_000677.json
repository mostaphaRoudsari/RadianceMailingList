Hope it helps!\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000677.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "April 30, 2003 at 08:06PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000672", "id": "radiance-general_000677"}
