{"body": "Thanks Rob and Randolph for your help.\n\n\nFirst off, de-triangulating the illums did the trick; no more aiming problems.  I'm curious to know how inaccurate the calculations are when there are aiming errors.\n\n\nSecondly, while I had searched the Harvard libraries for Rendering with Radiance, I hadn't searched the MIT libraries.  Low and behold, MIT has a copy, which I quickly snatched up.  And unfortunately, it seems as if Rendering with Radiance is no longer in print.  I found a used copy of it on sale at Amazon for about $150 (I haven't ordered it).  I really do want a copy of my own for future reference, so if anyone finds out more about the availability of Rendering with Radiance, please keep me (and us, I assume) informed.\n\n\nNow, to my next question.  I've flipped through Rendering with Randiance the last 30 minutes, and haven't found what I needed.  I will be reading through it more carefully, but I haven't seen anything regarding setting up a reference grid.  In Desktop Radiance, there is an option to create a reference grid.\n\n\nSo, how does one go about setting up a reference grid or reference point in the \"regular\" Radiance?\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn An\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000679.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John An", "created_at": "May 01, 2003 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "John_An", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000672", "id": "radiance-general_000679"}
