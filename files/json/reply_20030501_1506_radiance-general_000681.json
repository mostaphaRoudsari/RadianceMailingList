What to do if \nyou have a warped plane that is a skylight?  I mean, I can draw it as a \nwarped parallelogram, but Radout is gonna split it into two long thin \ntriangles, and I'll get the aiming failure.  Do you use LOTS of \ntriangles to approximate the warp, or is there some other way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000681.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 01, 2003 at 03:06PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000672", "id": "radiance-general_000681"}
