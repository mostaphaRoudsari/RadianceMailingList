In such a case, you probably want to add an extra\npolygon below the window, eg. around the lower outline of the\nframe of the skylight. This surface then gets treated by mkillum\ninstead of the actual window.\n\n\nIf the resulting shape is still very long and thin, then consider\ndividing it into two or more sections that are closer to a\nsquare. Otherwise, the source subdivision may result in a very\nsuboptimal set of virtual light sources (their location is\ndetermined on a regular grid within the bounding rectangle of the\npolygon).\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000682.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "May 01, 2003 at 03:51PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000672", "id": "radiance-general_000682"}
