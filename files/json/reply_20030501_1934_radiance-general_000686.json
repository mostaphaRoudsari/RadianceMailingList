At first I didn't care and just modeled it as \na warped plane.  But now I wanna generate some prettier renderings and \nI can see that the mkillum process really helps in that regard.  I \nguess I'll \"straighten it out\".\n\n\nAbout half the planes in my model need to get fixed, but even with all \nthe aiming failures, the renderings generated with illums on all the \nwindows are much nicer.  But I can see some artifacts that indicate to \nme that the accuracy is being compromised here.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000686.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 01, 2003 at 07:34PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000672", "id": "radiance-general_000686"}
