Gurneet\n\n\nTo configure the mouse with X windows, you need to determine the manner in\nwhich the mouse is connected to the computer. See also pages 53 and 59 of\nthe study guide:\ni) USB mouse, use the /dev/input/mice\nii) The PS/2 mouse has a small round 6- pin DIN connector. Use /dev/psaux\niii) A serial mouse has a 9 or 25 pin connector and can be connected on com\nport 1. Use /dev/ttyS0\niv) A serial mouse has either a 9 or 25 pin connector and can be connected\non com port 2. Use /dev/ttyS1\n\n\nHint: If the rest of your X configuration is working, you can modify the\nsetup via xreset's 'Complex - text mode' scripts from the console. See from\npage 65 onwards in the study guide.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn \nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design \nCurtin University of Technology \nGPO Box U 1987 \nPerth 6845 \nWestern Australia \nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au \nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000689.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance Mc Minn", "created_at": "May 02, 2003 at 09:20PM", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000568", "id": "radiance-general_000689"}
