I usually have one material\nper layer, so that I can write one simple mapping file to map the layer\nnames that will be written by dxf2rad to my material lib. I also have to use\nthe -s .01 setting of dxf2rad, but that depends on the units you are using\nin formZ.\n\n\nAll in all, it works great, and I also choose my views in formZ (in formZ,\nif you use the Strg-E on Windows or Apple-E on Mac, you can define your\nviews, and the resulting view angle settings as well as the position and\ndirection can be used in radiance).\n\n\nI didn't use obj as it gives some problems with your coordinate system, and\ndxf simply works well.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
