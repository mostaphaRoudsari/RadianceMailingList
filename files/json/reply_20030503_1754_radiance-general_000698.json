{"body": "Hi again,\n\n\nBTW, if you are using the Windows version of formZ, which\nis able to export 3ds, you get the colors imported (they are\nugly, not real radiance material definitions, but allow you togenerate\na quick preview to check geometry and material mapping), and\nyou might even be able to generate a simple animation as you\ncan get the geometry for all the frames in 3ds-animations if you\nuse 3ds2mgf. However, I never tried the animation stuff with 3ds.\n\n\nSo, I use dxf, and I only export geometry, the materials are defined\nin one library file here.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
