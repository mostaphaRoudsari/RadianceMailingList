{"body": "Hi DAI-crew,\n\n\nthe artifacts stem most likely from a special random generator  used for all \nkinds of ray jittering applied in the process of penumbra generation. I don't \nreally know why this is done, because pictures often look rather strange with \nthese patterns. \n\n\nLuckily, however, Radiance provides a way to switch this off, just recompile \nthe whole stuff with the compiler flag -DMC, and the penumbras will look much \nbetter.\n\n\nYou might experience problems in compiling with -DMC, at least I did (with \nLinux). I had to change the following:\n\n\nin ray/src/common/random.h :\n\n\nput line 71 in #ifndef MC exclusion:\n\n\n#ifndef MC                               /*  <--- inserted */                                                                                                             \nextern int      initurand(int size);                                                                                    \n#endif                                     /* <---- inserted  */\n\n\nin ray/src/rt/raycalls.c\n\n\nthe same with line 171ff:\n\n\n#ifndef MC                              /* <--- inserted   */                                                                                                            \n                                        /* initialize urand */                                                           \nif (urperm == NULL)                                                                                             \n                initurand(2048);                                                                                        \n#endif                                    /* <-----inserted */\n\n\nApart from this general treatment really strong artifacts may also appear due \nsome geometry error in the scene file (for example if a light source is \npartly cut by some object).\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000702.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 04, 2003 at 11:17PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000699", "id": "radiance-general_000702"}
