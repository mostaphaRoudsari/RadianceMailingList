{"body": "I forgot to mention that there is a convenient way for dealing with\nmaterial colors when exporting to Radiance by way of obj files and the\nobj2rad translator. Before exporting make sure that, in the export\noptions dialogue for obj, the material option is set to \"wrapped\" rather\nthan \"off\". This will produce a materials file (.mtl extension) which\ncontains parameters for each surface style (=material) in formZ. This\nfiles is exported with the .obj file. If you name the surface styles you\nactually use in formZ (rather than leaving them as style_1, style_2\netc.), you can easily identify the surface styles that you will need in\nthe Radiance material file. The red, green, blue values for each\nmaterial are the three numbers after the kd parameter for a material in\nthe .mtl file. These can be used directly in the Radiance material file\nand will produce colors that correspond closely to those that appeared\nin formZ renderings (barring differences in monitor calibration).\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000708.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Seebohm", "created_at": "May 05, 2003 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Seebohm", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000695", "id": "radiance-general_000708"}
