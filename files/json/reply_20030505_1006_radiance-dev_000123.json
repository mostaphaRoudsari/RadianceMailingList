{"body": "Hi,\nadditionally to the general posting a few seconds ago: Reflections off \nspecular surfaces showing patterns. - my two thoughts:\nThe visible patterns result from correlation between the sequence used \nin stratifying random numbers and the image width.\nEither the stratification's sequence is enhanced (two orders of magn. \nlonger ?) or substituted by something without a sequence.\nOr (and more likely) the sequence is de-correlated with image width. A \nsequence in one line is ok, a sequence slightly one or two pixels off \neach line is (of course) visible.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-May/000123.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "May 05, 2003 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000124", "id": "radiance-dev_000123"}
