And I cannot confirm at \nall the mentioned strong effect on necessary picture size before downsampling \nIf the relevant parameters are set correctly, I've made very good experiences \nwith the -DMC version. For printing, one can even get along with \ndownfiltering by a factor less than two, provided the image itself is big \nenough in absolute pixels. But adequate parameter setting is of course vital.\n\n\nHowever, penumbra generation is something which affords a bit thinking in \nterms of simulation, how to achieve the effect, not just putting 1:1 RealLife \nto SimLife corresponding geometry into the machine and press return (apology \nto Roland for using his terms without license :-) )\n\n\nAdditionally, when considering PCs becoming faster and faster, I wonder if \nthere's a reasonable way to overcome the MonteCarlo mess completey and \nestablish a completey different, 'deterministic'  treatment of the problem \n???\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000706.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 05, 2003 at 11:55AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000704", "id": "radiance-general_000706"}
