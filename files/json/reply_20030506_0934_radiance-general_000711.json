All\n\n\nAren't you already talking about SimLife[tm] here? In RealLife[tm] almost \neverything is something smooth and integrable and discretization is \nintroduced deliberately to allow a numerical calculation. So your idea of \nlooking at the characteristics of the underlying physical processes to find a \nsuitable form of discretization sounds straightforward and is the way to go, \nI believe.  \n\n\nBut, oh well, just one more academic playing around with some thoughts which \nwon't get realized due to the usual reasons ...\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000711.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 06, 2003 at 09:34AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000704", "id": "radiance-general_000711"}
