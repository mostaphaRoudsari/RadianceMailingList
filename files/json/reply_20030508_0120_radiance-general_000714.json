{"body": "Dear RADIANCE users\n\n\nThank you for your assistance with my previous request.\n\n\nI have been attempting to combine two useful rendering features of\nRADIANCE: phong smoothing and UV bitmap mapping at face level.\n\n\nThe techniques at achieving either have been established, but I\nhave attempted to bring them both together to refine the quality of RADIANCE\nrenders.  I generally use RADIANCE for architectural illustration work and I\nam attempting to derive the most out its material rendering capabilities.\n\n\nPlease visit the following hyperlink on my Internet site to view a gallery\nof my rendering attempts and the problem discussed in greater detail.\n(Previous problems with my Internet site have been corrected).\n\n\nwww.daiservices.btinternet.co.uk/Radiance/Radiance_v3_5_UNIX/Phong_shading_a\nnd_bitmap_textures/Phong_shading_and_bitmap_textures.htm\n\n\nAssistance from users is most appreciated.\n\n\nKind regards\n\n\nJohn MacKenzie Graham\nDigital Architectural Illustration Services\ndaiservices@btinternet.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000714.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Digital Architectural Illustration Services", "created_at": "May 08, 2003 at 01:20AM", "created_by": "Digital_Architectural_Illustration_Services", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000715", "id": "radiance-general_000714"}
