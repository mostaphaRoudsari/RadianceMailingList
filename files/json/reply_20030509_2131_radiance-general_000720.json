(In the RWR book, there's a short section about how to \ndetermin the correct -av for a specific scene)\n\n\nBut for your extraordinary conditions try again with setting -av 0 0 0.(BTW: I \nI do that often, the pictures look better...) You'll introduce some error \nthen, too, of course, but in your example with only 1% transmittance and sun \ndirecly overhead most light will stem from direct contribution, so completely \nneglecting ambient light from the third bounce level onwards should produce \nno significant error anymore.\n\n\nMaybe it helps. Maybe not... :-)\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000720.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 09, 2003 at 09:31PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000719", "id": "radiance-general_000720"}
