If you don't set \nit, it doesn't get used.  that's why my ambient areas are always \nsplotchy in my renderings.  Dunno.  I may be wrong.  All I know is I \nhave never set the av explicitly yet.  Soon, I guess.\n\n\nHey, Brenda & I are going to London & Bath next month!  I can't believe \nit took me 32 years to get to Europe, and now (after next month) I'll \nhave been there three times in three years!  I guess we never know what \nour future schedule holds...\n\n\nI hope all is well.  Thanks for sharing your Radiance insights with me. \n  Are you using it at all nowadays?\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000723.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 11, 2003 at 10:53PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000719", "id": "radiance-general_000723"}
