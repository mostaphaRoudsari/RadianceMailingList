{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no translator routine for Wavefront material \nfiles, which I only became aware of recently, myself.  It might be \npossible to write such a translator, but the description used by \nWavefront don't really correspond to physical materials, which makes \ntranslation problematic.  However, it's not too difficult to use this \ninformation yourself using some intelligent guesses and simple rules.  \nGiven the following sample material:\n\n\nnewmtl mat_1\n         Ns 32\n         d 1\n         illum 2\n         Kd 1 1 1\n         Ks 0 0 0\n         Ka 0.25 0.25 0.25\n         map_Kd -s 40 14 1 mat_1.bmp\n\n\nOne could convert the file \"mat_1.bmp\" to a Radiance picture file \nsomehow (you'll need Photoshop or GraphicConverter to get it to TIFF \nthen use ra_tiff with the -r option foor example).  Your Radiance \nmaterial would look something like so:\n\n\nvoid colorpict mat_1_pat\n7 red green blue mat_1.pic . frac(Lu*40) frac(Lv*14)\n0\n0\n\n\nmat_1_pat plastic mat_1\n0\n0\n5 0.25 0.25 0.25 0 0\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000727.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 12, 2003 at 03:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000718", "id": "radiance-general_000727"}
