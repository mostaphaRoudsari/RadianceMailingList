{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nCarsten is right about the ambient (-av) settings, but I don't think \nthat's your problem.  My guess is that you're running up against the \nray weight limit Radiance imploys to trim its calculation, which is \ncontrolled by the -lw parameter.  You should reset this to -lw 0 in \nyour tests, or something very small such as -lw 1e-8 if -lw 0 takes too \nlong.\n\n\nTry it.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000728.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 12, 2003 at 04:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000719", "id": "radiance-general_000728"}
