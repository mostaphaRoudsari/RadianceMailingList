You use rad to create an octree \nfile, but not for controlling all the other aspects of the calculation? \n  This overture calculation Greg mentions above is done automatically \nfor you if you use rad to do everything.  Yes, you get finer control of \nthe rendering parameters if you call rpict manually, but you can \noverride any switch you want in the .rif file. rad makes intelligent \nguesses about what the rpict parameters need to be based on how you \nanswer three questions: Quality, Variability and Detail.  And if you add \nthe line OPTFILE=parameters.txt to the rif file, all the choices that \nrad made are saved to a text file called parameters.txt so you can view \nthem at your convenience.  You can reuse the settings too, like so:\n# rtrace @parameters.txt octree...\n\n\nEven if you want to stick with the manual method, playing with the rad \nsettings and observing what rad does to the parameters is instructive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000731.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 13, 2003 at 10:10AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000724", "id": "radiance-general_000731"}
