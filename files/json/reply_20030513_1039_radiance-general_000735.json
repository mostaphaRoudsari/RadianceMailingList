{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nIt is difficult to compare Radiance picture resolution to traditional \ninteger images as understood by Photoshop.  Radiance uses a 32-bit RGBE \nfloating-point format, which is described in an article I wrote for \nGraphics Gems II, but some information may also be found in the \nfollowing text file distributed with the system:\n\n\n\tray/doc/notes/picture.format\n\n\nI recently added an option to the pvalue program to output raw \n16-bit/primary files which may be imported into Photoshop using the \n\"raw\" type.  Use the following command:\n\n\n\tpvalue -dw image.pic > image.raw\n\n\nThen, import it in Photoshop as a \"raw\" 16-bit interleaved image with \nheader.  You'll have to tell it the resolution, and ask Photoshop to \nguess the header length, which you can have it preserve in case you \never want to get back into Radiance format with a reverse conversion.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000735.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 13, 2003 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000734", "id": "radiance-general_000735"}
