{"body": "Dear Greg\n\n\nThank you for your assistance with my request concerning smoothing using the\nOBJ2MESH utility.\n\n\nAfter applying your recommended materials, I successfully rendered a mesh\nwith both UV mapping and smoothing using the OBJ2MESH utility, with good\nresults.  I considered this issue of importance since there is currently\nlittle discussion on the Internet about using this utility, and also because\nphong rendering curvilinear surfaces with textures applied can greatly\nenhance the realism and quality of RADIANCE renders, especially in my field\nof architectural illustration.\n\n\nI have just updated my web page again with a final comparison between the\nsmoothed / texture mapped results of OBJ2MESH against the results of ConRAD\nsoftware, which is very similar. The results may be worth looking at, since\nthe tests seem to have revealed minor distortions in the UV mapping\nco-ordinates exported by OBJ2MESH.  A more detailed discussion of these\nissues can be found at:\n\n\nwww.daiservices.btinternet.co.uk/Radiance/Radiance_v3_5_UNIX/Phong_shading_a\nnd_bitmap_textures/Phong_shading_and_bitmap_textures.htm\n\n\nI will leave this web page active for the benefit of any RADIANCE users\nwanting to learn from the tests I conducted.\n\n\nKind regards\n\n\nJohn MacKenzie Graham\nDigital Architectural Illustration Services\ndaiservices@btinternet.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000740.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Digital Architectural Illustration Services", "created_at": "May 14, 2003 at 02:31AM", "created_by": "Digital_Architectural_Illustration_Services", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000718", "id": "radiance-general_000740"}
