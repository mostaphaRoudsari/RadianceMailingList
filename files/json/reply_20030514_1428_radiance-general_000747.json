For the shades, I'm estimating the reflectance \nand transmittance.  We're trying to determine how dense the shades need \nto be to achieve a certain light level.  The theory being that once we \nknow what they need to be, we can specify that, and then measure actual \nsamples to further validate the whole mess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000747.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 14, 2003 at 02:28PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000733", "id": "radiance-general_000747"}
