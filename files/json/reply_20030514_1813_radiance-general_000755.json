Here is a \nbit of the materials, as defined in my spreadsheet I created \nspecifically to apply Chas' formulae from RwR.  I make assumptions in \nthe left column (Cr, Cg, Cb, Rs, Sr, Td, Ts), and the spreadsheet does \nthe math to generate A1-A7.\n\n\nMaterial Name: \t\t\t\tshade.10\nAssumptions\t\t\t\t\t\tTrans Parameters\nDiffuse reflectance, RED\t\tCr\t0.3000\tA1\t0.400000\nDiffuse reflectance, GRN\t\tCg\t0.3000\tA2\t0.400000\nDiffuse reflectance, BLU\t\tCb\t0.3000\tA3\t0.400000\nReflected Specularity\t\t\tRs\t0.0000\tA4\t0.000000\nSurface Roughness\t\t\tSr\t0.0000\tA5\t0.000000\nDiffuse Transmissivity\t\t\tTd\t0.0050\tA6\t0.250000\nTransmitted Specularity\t\t\tTs\t0.0950\tA7\t0.950000\nPhotopic Average refl.

Rd is in the equation for A6.  It \nmakes a difference.  Shoot.  Shoulda looked there in the first place.\n\n\n> I hope that I have done all my calcs correctly here.

I will be interested to hear.\n\n\nI will test it out tomorrow, for sure.  Methinks that -ab 5, -av 0 0 0 \nand all the shades having the same reflectance will generate numbers \nthat make a lot more sense.  I hope so, anyway.\n\n\n> Also, I am quite interested in hearing about your methodology and \n> experience measuring the glazing materials.\n\n\nNot until you tell me all the parameters you used to make this \n(http://www.visarc.com/visarc/projects/images/bu_ab03.jpg) in fifteen \nminutes!  =8-)\n\n\nSeriously tho, I'm about to blast outta here for the evening, but \ntomorrow I will try and piece together a cohesive explanation of what we \ndid to measure the glass.  Something more detailed than \"asked Greg for \nhelp\", that is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000755.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 14, 2003 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000733", "id": "radiance-general_000755"}
