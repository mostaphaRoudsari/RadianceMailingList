This so\ncalled \"print protection\" is just a friendly hint within the\nfile, that the original Acrobat Reader respects, but any other\nsoftware will easily ignore.\n\n\nOf course, that may or may not matter to you. If nobody wants to\nget rich off the potential print-on-demand proceeds, then it's\nprobably irrelevant whether the same thing is also available in\ndigital form for free. Ordering a demand printed copy will still\nbe a lot cheaper than printing it at home for most people, let\nalone binding (or glueing) the resulting heap of paper together.\nBut I don't know about the exact situation with the rights, so\nyou better check that out in detail before deciding anything.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000762.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "May 15, 2003 at 07:11AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000724", "id": "radiance-general_000762"}
