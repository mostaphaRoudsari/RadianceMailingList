{"body": "Well, I don't know that I'm as close as I'd like to be, but I am getting \nbetter results now, even with the denser shades.\n\n\nIn short, what I did was roll all the suggestions into a new set of \nsimulations.  Specifically, I added:\n\n\nrender= -lw 1e-8 -av 0 0 0\n\n\n... to my rif file, increased the ambient bounces to five, and \nnormalized all my shade relfectances (20%).  Here's what I got:\n\n\nTest20 (no shade)\t\t82,356\t249.82\t\t\t\nTest21 (10% shade)\t\t82,350\t30.89\t10.00%\t12.36%\t24%\nTest22 (05% shade)\t\t82,343\t16.32\t5.00%\t6.53%\t31%\nTest23 (01% shade)\t\t82,346\t1.38\t1.00%\t0.55%\t-45%\nTest24 (10% + 05% shades)\t82,338\t0.80\t0.50%\t0.32%\t-36%\nTest25 (10% + 01% shades)\t82,354\t0.35\t0.10%\t0.14%\t40%\nTest26 (01% + 01% shades)\t82,348\t0.01\t0.01%\t0.00%\t-60%\n\n\nData is as follows:\nColumn 1 - Exterior horizontal diffuse illuminance (Lux)\nColumn 2 - Interior horizontal diffuse illuminance (Lux)\nColumn 3 - \"expected\" light reduction from test 20 (no shade)\nColumn 4 - actual light reduction from test 20 (no shade)\nColumn 5 - \"error\".  I'm certainly no statistician though, and maybe \nthis value is being unfairly computed (COL4/COL3)-1.  (?)\n\n\nAs you can see, there is still some wild fluctuation, but not nearly as \nbad as the original tests.  I am confused as to why the accuracy of the \n10% and 05% shades has suffered; in earlier tests they were very close, \n04% and 08% \"accurate\" respectively.\n\n\nOK, so then I tried Alex's trick of increasing the exterior illumination \n  by a factor of ten, in hopes that the higher light levels that would \nnow result in the interior space would be more accurately evaluated:\n\n\n(HDI x 10)\nTest20 (no shade)\t\t832,317\t2,528.67\t\t\t\nTest21 (10% shade)\t\t832,319\t361.96\t10.00%\t14.31%\t43%\nTest22 (05% shade)\t\t832,322\t222.05\t5.00%\t8.78%\t76%\nTest23 (01% shade)\t\t832,315\t23.48\t1.00%\t0.93%\t-7%\nTest24 (10% + 05% shades)\t832,297\t17.45\t0.50%\t0.69%\t38%\nTest25 (10% + 01% shades)\t832,314\t2.98\t0.10%\t0.12%\t18%\nTest26 (01% + 01% shades)\t832,304\t0.37\t0.01%\t0.01%\t46%\n\n\n~8-/\n\n\nNow my 05% shade is the least accurate of the lot!  I double checked the \nparamaters, and even re-ran the calc using five points in an array \naround the intitial calc point, but it averages to within .5 lux of this \ncalc.  I did a rendering of the 05% shade too, everything looks OK.\n\n\nHmmm. Even at these higher light levels, the 01% + 01% shade seems \nsuspect.  This combo had the greatest \"swing\" from the first simulation \nto the second (60% under-prediction to a 46% over prediction).\n\n\nMy co-worker & I have been thinking that maybe we should test the model \nwith more transmissive shades, and simply apply a factor to those \nilluminance values to figure out what the shades should be, for this \nlast gallery.  It feels a lot like giving up, but I'm not sure I want to \ntrust these numbers based on this test.\n\n\nEither way we go, this has been very educational and I thank everyone \nwho contributed to this thread.\n\n\n-- OK, seconds before I was to press send, Carsten Bauer sent me an \nemail.  He's been doing some testing of his own with this model, with \nmuch better results.  It seems that if we set -lw to zero, and not a \nreally-really low number, you get results that match the math.  The \nother big difference between his process and mine is that he's getting \nhis values from a rendering (rpict) and I'm just rtracing values.  So \nperhaps there's the missing link(s).\n\n\nMaybe I won't give up just yet...  Seems like there's just no way to \nknow all there is to know about Radiance!\n\n\nTo be continued (?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000767.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 15, 2003 at 04:59PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000768", "id": "radiance-general_000767"}
