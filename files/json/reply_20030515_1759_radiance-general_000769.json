I'd be happy to send you an image \noff-list, there's only one at the moment, because yeah I'm primarily \nworking with numbers.  It's just a gray room, with a diffuse skylight, \nvery boring looking.  But I'll send it to ya.\n\n\nI'm testing out Carsten & Georg's suggestions overnight here (-lw 0 and \ndo a fisheye rendering to seed the ambient file *before* running \nrtrace), I'll post results tomorrow.  Carsten got some very agreeable \nresults just extracting values from a .pic file, when -lw 0 was used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000769.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 15, 2003 at 05:59PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000768", "id": "radiance-general_000769"}
