{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nI hope you aren't doing what I think you might be doing -- trying to \npick luminance values off the falsecolor output using ximage or \nsuchlike.  The falsecolor image has already converted the luminances to \na \"false color\" display, and the original luminances are lost in the \nprocess -- converted to this other (visual) representation.  If you \nwant to get point luminance values, you'll need to run ximage on the \noriginal image, not on the falsecolor output.  (You can have falsecolor \nadd point values for the extrema if you like using the -e option.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000780.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 18, 2003 at 10:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000776", "id": "radiance-general_000780"}
