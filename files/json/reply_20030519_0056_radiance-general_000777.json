Usually you need illuminance-pictures \nrendered with rpict's -i parameter (if you want to know the amount of light \nthat hits the surface).\n\n\nGood luck, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000777.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
