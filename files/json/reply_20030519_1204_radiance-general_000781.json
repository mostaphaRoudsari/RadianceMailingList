Listen To Greg, which \nis always good advice.  Another way to look at things is this:  think \nof a raw, unfiltered image fresh from rpict as a collection of \n\"intelligent pixels\".  That is, the value of each pixel is the radiance \nof that point, as you know.  But any *filtered* version of that image, \nwhile still containing that depth of information about each pixel, has \nbeen filtered, so the info no longer has any basis in reality.  I \nlearned this rather quickly when I tried doing a falsecolor image of an \nimage that had already been filtered with pcond -h.  Oops.  It's a good \nargument for always saving the original image, as you never know when \nyou might want to extract more info from the image in the form of a \nfalsecolor, or whatever.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000781.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 19, 2003 at 12:04PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000776", "id": "radiance-general_000781"}
