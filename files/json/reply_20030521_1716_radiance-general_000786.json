{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nThe only files I know of that are byte-order dependent in Radiance are \nthe depth files produced by the -z option of rpict, which are raw dumps \nof the 32-bit floating point numbers with no header.  Holodecks should \nbe completely portable between systems -- even more so than octrees, \nwhich have some system-dependent integer sizes which prevent them from \nbeing ported between some 32-bit and 64-bit processor architectures.\n\n\nAre you having some problems sharing holodecks across machines?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000786.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 21, 2003 at 05:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000785", "id": "radiance-general_000786"}
