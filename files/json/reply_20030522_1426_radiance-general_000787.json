{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for your reply. I start to get some bettter results, but still I\nhave some questions:\n\n\n\n\nQ1.\n\n\nI experimented  with texture cordinates in the tmesh.cal parameters.\nInstead of u and v I used  :\nmod(u,max(1,1))  mod(u,max(1,1))\nI don't know what this really means, but I tried to tile the texture,\nlike in picture.cal (tile_u tile_v)\nI get good results for only one part of my model ( the trunk of the tree\n) but other parts (the leaves) act very strange.\nDo you have a suggestions? And where can I find some documentation about\nmod, frac, tri etc... (It is not explained in the book, is it?)\n\n\n\n\nQ2.\n\n\nWhen using tmesh2rad I specify a picture (-p). But what if I need a\ntranparant texture?\nFollowing your suggestion somewhere else in this discussion I create a\ntransparant picture like the example below.\nThese do not have texture coordinates like above, but as you will\nunderstand, I cannot write such for each triangle of a leave (more as\n20.000 in a tree).\nDo you have a tip or workaround for this?\n\n\n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n________________\n#my transparant picture example\n\n\nvoid colorpict AL05lef 15 red green blue\n/disk12/_3DLIB/bomen/AL05_Aesculus_hippocastanum_Horse_Chestnut/AL05lef.pic\n\n\npicture.cal\ntile_u tile_v\n-s 1\n-rx  0\n-ry  0\n-rz  0\n0 1 1\n\n\nAL05lef plastic AL05lef_map\n0 0 5\n1 1 1\n0 0\n\n\nvoid mixpict  leaf_col_leaf2\n11  AL05lef_map  void green\n/disk12/_3DLIB/bomen/AL05_Aesculus_hippocastanum_Horse_Chestnut/AL05lef-alpha.pic\n\n\npicture.cal tile_u tile_v -s 1.0 -rz 0\n0\n0\n\n\n______________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000787.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "May 22, 2003 at 02:26PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000771", "id": "radiance-general_000787"}
