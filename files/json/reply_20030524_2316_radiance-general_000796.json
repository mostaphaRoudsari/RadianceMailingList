{"body": "Well, I spent a couple of hours on this, and I did find a bug for some \nvertical cylinders, but apparently this isn't the bug causing all the \nproblems -- at least on my Mac OS X X11 server (Apple's public beta).  \nI still get out-of-place cylinders, and when I look a bit closer and \nisolate the problem cases, they render just fine.  It's only when \nthere's a whole bunch of geometry that the glu* routines in OpenGL seem \nto go whacky.  I've given up at this point.  If the bug is mine, I have \nno idea where it is or how it's coming about.  I'm reluctant to cop out \nand call it an OpenGL bug, but I don't think the quadric rendering \nroutines are all that well tested, so it's a distinct possibility.  In \nany case, I'm giving up on it.  The glrad program also seems to be \nbroken under OS X, and I have no idea why.  I wish there were some \ndebugging tools for OpenGL, but it's all trial and error and too much \nerror for me at this point.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000796.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 24, 2003 at 11:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000791", "id": "radiance-general_000796"}
