{"body": "I am recieving an error when running both RAD and RPICT on KNOPPIX Linux. \nThis flavor of Linux is based on Debian Linux and is run on my computer via \na boot CD. When running rpict or rad the following error message occurs:\n\n\nrpict: system - cannot open header file \"/usr/tmp/rtDjYQSQ\": No such file or \ndirectory\n\n\nI have run rpict on KNOPPIX many times and I have never recieved this error. \nNow all of a sudden, I cant run anything. This is why it is so frustrating \nbecause I can not ever diagnose what the problem is. To let you know, I have \nset the path of RAYPATH and this does not seem to help. I have run the same \nfiles on the Windows version of Radaince and I have recieved no such errors.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus D.
