Is it ok to create a sphere with a radius of 2 \nfeet for a 4 feet long luminaire, and then just leave it alone?\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000805.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John An", "created_at": "May 26, 2003 at 10:14AM", "created_by": "John_An", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000806", "id": "radiance-general_000805"}
