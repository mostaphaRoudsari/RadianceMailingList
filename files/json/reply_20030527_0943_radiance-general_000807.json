The method was specifically designed to address linear sources.  It is also the method employed in the luminaire editor in Desktop Radiance. Is it still true that the \"lboxcorr\" function automatically corrects for the surface area of the emitter?  If not, then we have a major re-write on our hands for the new edition. -Chas\n\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\nDate: Mon, 26 May 2003 09:02:47 -0700\nSubject: Re: [Radiance-general] Re: direct/indirect photometric\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000807.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "May 27, 2003 at 09:43AM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000806", "id": "radiance-general_000807"}
