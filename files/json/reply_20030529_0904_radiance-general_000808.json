{"body": "Hi Chas,\n\n\nYou are right -- I had forgotten this feature of lboxcorr (and \nboxcorr).  There is a caveat, though, which is using the -i value of \n0.56419 requires that you be working in meters, and likewise the box \ndimensions must also be specified in meters for the units to work out \ncorrectly.  In this case, the A1 parameter gets set to 1 by ies2rad and \nthe lboxcorr applies the correction.  (Remember that the box must be \ncentered at the origin for lboxcorr to work properly.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000808.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 29, 2003 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000806", "id": "radiance-general_000808"}
