{"body": "Dear Group\n\n\nI am in the evaluation phase in my quest to purchase a new computer. From \nwhat I have been told, the Motorola G4 processor is far superior in \nscientific calculations as compared to x-86 based processors (i.e. \nIntel/AMD). If it weren't for the existing investment that I have in PC \nbased software (particularly software that utilizes a dongle which will not \nwork on a Mac even with virtual PC), I would probably purchase one. But \nbecause of the existing investment that I do have in PC based software, I am \ntrying to do a cost versus benifit analysis for purchasing a Mac. Has anyone \nhere been able to do a rough estimate as to the decrease in rendering time \nwhen using a Mac as compared to x-86 based processors. I was considering in \nlieu of purchasing a Mac, I would purchase a dual Pentium 4 Zeon and compile \nit on Linux. If I am correct, the GNU C compiler has a SSE2 optimization \noption. Also I have l have looked at puchasing a AMDs 64 bit Opteron based \nworkstation. I do believe there can be some performance gains achieved if it \ncan be used in conjunction with a 64 bit Operating System. Anyway, you all \ncan see that i am very confused as to which direction I should take so any \nadvice is very much appreciated.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus D.
