{"body": "I gave SketchUp a try as it has a free demo for OS X, and it seems \nfairly capable.  It's certainly simple enough, and it outputs .3ds \nformat, which you can convert to MGF using 3ds2mgf and then to Radiance \nwith mgf2rad.  It's material model is by layers, but that should work \nfor most basic applications.  I'm really not a CAD user, but watching \nthe short online tutorial was enough that I was able to create simple \nshapes and join them up right away.  If you're a casual as opposed to a \nserious CAD user, it seems like a good way to go for simple models.  \nThe fact that they give you a fully functional demo that lasts for 8 \nhours of use is nice as well.  The license cost is around $700.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000821.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 30, 2003 at 08:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000813", "id": "radiance-general_000821"}
