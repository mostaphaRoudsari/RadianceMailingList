{"body": "Hi! \n\n\nFirst, I have just ordered my 12\" Powerbook ;-) Second: my \nexperience is that rendering speed depends on memory (nothing \nis as stupid as a rendering process on a fast machine waiting \nfor data from the swap!!!), cpu frequency and - that is really \nimportant - the optimization of the compiler you are using! \n\n\nI couldn't find great imporvements with radiance on 64bit so far. \n\n\nHowever, one thing to mention - a stable 800MHz machine doing three \nrenderings over night is much more performant than a 3200MHz \nmachine which crashes three timer per rendering ;-) In my personal \nexperience, the \"rendering speed\" is not the critical point any more \nin our days, much more is the stability of machines. I put 90% into \nthe preparation of a rendering, and only 10% in the actual render \nprocess ;-) \n\n\nSo, these were some thoughts of someone who prefers to render his \npics on an old AMD K6-2 300 ;-) CU Lars. \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
