{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nis there snow on the mountain top? Can you go skiing over there?\n\n\nExcluding objects form the ambient calculation is done by setting the -ae \nparameter to the objects material name (-ae mat_name or -aE \nfile_with_matnames). So excluding the mountains is no problem, the drawback \nis, that Radiance determines the resolution of its ambient cache (-ar \nsetting) dependent on the scene bounding cube. So a HUUUGE bounding cube \nresults in values spaced so far apart that probably only one falls into your \nroom. (Unless you set up -ar extremely high, if everything outside is \nexcluded, this might even work ...)\n\n\nBut why not tread an intermediate path: set up a 3D landscape model and render \nsome pictures with it from your viewing point.  They contain the exact \nradiance values, so in a second step you can map them with colorpict to a \nplane made of  glow with fourth param set to zero, and put this plane 100 or \n200 m apart from your scene. This will keep the blowing up of the scene \nreasonable and still deliver correct results. Do some checking if the \nsettings are right, i.e compare the landsscape rendering with your fake \nlandscape rendering, one never knows ...)\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000823.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 31, 2003 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000823"}
