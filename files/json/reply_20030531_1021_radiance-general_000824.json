{"body": "Hi Rob,\njust one further remark: self-evidently, you have to be shure that the part of \nthe hemisphere visible form the window of your scene is completely covered by \nthe image/light maps. So rendering a fisheye view of the outside landscape \nand mapping this on a sphere is the preferrable way. Look throug the lib \ndirectory, I think there (or in one of the contributions availabel on the \nradsite) is a .cal file included which does this spherical mapping.\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000824.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 31, 2003 at 10:21AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000824"}
