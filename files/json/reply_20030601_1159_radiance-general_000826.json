{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nYou can certainly exclude any geometry you like from the ambient \ncalculation using the -ae option.   Each -ae value adds a material to \nexclude from ambient calculations.  Named materials will get the -av \nvalue rather than incurring any new interreflection calculations.  This \nmeans that the mountains will have a rather flat appearance, and the \nshadows will be too dark if you don't choose a reasonable outdoor value \nfor -av, which in turn could be too bright for your interior.  (It's a \nproblem.)\n\n\nAnother option is to capture (using HDR photography) or render the \nscenery using a fisheye lens in a separate step, then apply the results \nto the window as a luminance distribution using a fisheye perspective \nmapping.  The Radiance ray/lib/fisheye.cal does a lookup on a 180 \ndegree angular fisheye image (-vta -vh 180 -vv 180).  I recommend using \ntwo pictures -- a high-resolution for the view out the window and a \nlow-resolution for the light distribution.  You can compute the low \nfrom the high using pfilt with the -1 option:\n\n\npfilt -1 -x 32 -y 32 -r 1 window_hires.pic > window_lores.pic\n\n\nThe scene specification for a west-facing window might look like so:\n\n\nvoid colorpict window_pict_hires\n9 red green blue window_hires.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rz 90\n0\n0\n\n\nwindow_pict_hires glow window_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\nvoid colorpict window_pict_lores\n9 red green blue window_lores.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rz 90\n0\n0\n\n\nwindow_pict_lores illum window_illum\n1 window_glow\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nwindow_illum polygon window\n0\n0\n12\n\twindow_with_inward_normal\n\n\n\n\nI haven't tried this, so I can't say for sure if it will work.  I \nstarted this e-mail before I saw Carsten's, but didn't get a chance to \nfinish it until today.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000826.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 01, 2003 at 11:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000826"}
