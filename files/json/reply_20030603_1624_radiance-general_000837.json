Now, if one made a grave error in the -av \nsetting, the erroneous \"seeding\" would still be kept to a minimum if one \nstill used lots of ambient bounces, since each bounce is another \nfacoring down of the -av, yes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000837.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 03, 2003 at 04:24PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000836", "id": "radiance-general_000837"}
