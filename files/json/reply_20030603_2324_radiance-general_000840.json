Somehow, for me this seems to be the most\n>natural solution.\n>\nMapping to a source works like mapping to a polygon, except that the\nimage u,v coordinates in the cal file depend on the view direction\nvector Dx,Dy,Dz rather than on position coordinates Px,Py,Pz . The\nformular depends on the type of lense used to take the image, either\nfisheye (similar to an -vta image) or perspective wideangle.\nWith mapping to source, parallax error increases with nearby objects.\nSpecially when moving inside a room the outside looks a bit 'frozen' if\nmodelled as a source mapped image only. See\nhttp://www.pab-opto.de/pers/animation/film2.html for an example of\nsource mapping and animation made in 1994.\nTheoretical extra note: Imaging an image mapped to the window polygon\nwith u,v coordinates depending on position _/and_/ view direction. The\nresult would be indistinguishable from a 'real' view towards the\noutside. Eh voila - that would be a 'lightfield' as used as core idea in\nGreg's rholo.\nIn pratice,for architectural simulation of one building, map the far\nsurroundings (sky-line, etc) to the source, model the nearby buildings\nas 'bricks' and map photos onto their faces. There's an 1999 example of\nthis at http://www.ise.fhg.de/alt-aber-aktiv/radiance/animation/ ,\nthough we had not pushed the idea as far as I would had liked, then.\n\n\n>I hope all this makes any sense. \n>\nit does. :-)\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000840.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "June 03, 2003 at 11:24PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000840"}
