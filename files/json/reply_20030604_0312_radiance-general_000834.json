{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nI am very interested in this topic, but I`m not sure if I understood\ncorrectly, I must admit I`m still starting to understand Radiance.\n\n\nBasically, as I understand, Carsten`s and Greg`s methods differ in that the\nfirst maps the image in a plane situated outside the window and the second\n(through an 'ad hoc' function) directly on the window plane. My question is\nthis:\n\n\n- If one maps the image in a plane outside the window there will be some\nparalax error (though minimum) which can be reduced with distance\n- And if the plane is on the window this should be noticeable\n- Or does it work like mkillum? would sun patches appear inside the room?\n- Or else: is there any way to map a HDR image in a source, something in the\nway skies are generated (maybe replacing the skyfunc?) and then use it as\nany other sky and/or ground? Somehow, for me this seems to be the most\nnatural solution.\n\n\nI hope all this makes any sense. Thank you for your help. Best,\n\n\nSantiago.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000834.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "June 04, 2003 at 03:12AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000834"}
