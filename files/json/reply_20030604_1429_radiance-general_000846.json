{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nYes, I've noticed that. I'm finally sitting on a dual-processor\nbox here at work, though I have insufficient RAM here to render\nthe kinds of scenes that I want. The image for SIGGRAPH this\nyear will probably take up 1.5 GB of RAM once the ambient cache\nbecomes fully populated. I'm shooting for a final resolution of\n28800x14400 pixels.\n\n\nA year or two ago, someone submitted a speed test for the\nsame scene, Paul's bench2, using a dual-processor box and\nrad/rpiece. See note 8 on my bechmark page. The author found\na 1.6 speedup for dual processors using 20-25 divisions in\nrad/rpiece.\n\n\nIs there no newer gcc for OSX than 3.1?\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Wed, 4 Jun 2003, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000846.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "June 04, 2003 at 02:29PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000844", "id": "radiance-general_000846"}
