{"body": "OK, even I got it now ... :-)\n\n\nthe whole problem is quite a nice example in terms of understanding. In fact, \nthe spheremap nonsense is simply the projection of the fisheye view onto an \nobject. (the latter certainly unnecessary in this case)\n\n\nwhen it comes to picture mapping, one quickly thinks of putting a texture or \nsomething onto an object, in the current case this would be like hanging a \nphoto of the view outside in front of the window ( or a windowless wall to \ncheat the people..) this of course works only from one point of view.\n\n\nThe procedure outlined in Gregs example differs form this, in the way that the \ncolorpict is used to modifiy - or in fact to create the *angular*  \ndistribution of a lightsource which is put in place of the window pane \n(comparable to the luminous intensity distribution data delivered by \nluminaire manufacturers). This angular distribution then is of course \nindependent from the point of view, as it should be. \n\n\nOK, this all is self evident and not worth to be mentioned at all for the \nexperienced scientists, but  - - -  \n\n\nCarsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000849.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "June 04, 2003 at 10:30PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000849"}
