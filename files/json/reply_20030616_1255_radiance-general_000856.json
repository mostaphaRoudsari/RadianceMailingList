{"body": "Hello again,\n\n\nI`ve been trying more, and the mapping now works fine, so the sky finally\nlooks like the original picture. However, I still have problems with the\nilluminance values. I am defining it like this:\n\n\nvoid colorpict skyfunc\n7 noop noop noop sky_orig.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 180\n0\n1 1\n\n\nAnd then using skyfunc normally, like from gensky. The \"mapped\" sky gives me\nan illuminance 5 to 7 times lower than the original sky (although the\ndistribution is the same). I could define the sky source seven times\nstronger to compensate, but I`m sure there must be an explanation for this\nand a correct solution. Please, what am I doing wrong?\n\n\nAnother problem is when I apply the sky to a scene with a room and a window.\nIf I follow Greg`s method to define the window, it works perfect, however if\nI use the mapping to define a sky and then define a window as I would do\nwith a \"gensky`d\" sky, there seems to be no direct sunlight in the room.\nAgain, what am I doing wrong?\n\n\nI assumed that the mapping to source could replace gensky more or less\ndirectly, but it seems I am missing something. Sorry for bothering again and\nthanks in advance for your help,\n\n\nSantiago.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000856.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "June 16, 2003 at 12:55PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000856"}
