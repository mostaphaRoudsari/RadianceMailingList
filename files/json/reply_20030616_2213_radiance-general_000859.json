But \nyou can fine-tune all parameters, so can use it as a simple \nrenderer. If you are concerned about performance, take a look \nat the ambient parameters, they have the biggest impact on \nrendering time. Excluding most materials from ambient calculation \nand setting good av-values might help. \n\n\nOf course, radiance is not an easy renderer, but you get lots \nof very powerful tools for cad-import, image processing, previews \nand scripting tools. \n\n\nGood luck, cu Lars. \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
