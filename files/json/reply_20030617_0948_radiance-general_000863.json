{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nI could make some guesses as to what's going on with your model, but \nunless I see the actual files involved, I'm not going to be able to \nfigure it out.  Can you put together a gzip'ped tar file and mail it to \nmy account directly <gward@lmi.net>.  I'll have a look.  Be sure to \ninclude the list of commands you've been using, what you expected, and \nwhat you got.\n\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000863.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 17, 2003 at 09:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000818", "id": "radiance-general_000863"}
