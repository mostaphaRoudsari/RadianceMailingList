{"body": "Hi Bruce,\n\n\nplease give some more info on the process, e.g. error messages thrown at you \nduring the makeall install run, these are necessary for finding out what's \ngoing on. Have the libraries got compiled sucessfully? ( check into \n../ray/src/lib for librt.a and libradiance.a ). Differnet locations of X \nheaders may cause trouble. You probably need options like\n -L/usr/X11R6/lib  -I/usr/include/X11\n(or similar with your correct paths for the cygwin installation) in your\nrmake file. Put them within the \"MACH= .. \" line.\nWhen errors during compiling appear, in the end the few sucessful compiled \nexecutives don't get moved to the instdir, but remain in the production dir \n(probably you might alreday have a rpict or so in ../ray/src/rt., who knows \n...)\n\n\nBe patient, often it's just some minor thing which causes trouble ...\n\n\n-Carsten\n\n\nPS: I must admit that I talk about the general Linux/Unix installation, I \ndon't know anything about cygwin, so I cannot assure if there isn't a \nfundamental problem or so..\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000865.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "June 18, 2003 at 06:48PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000864", "id": "radiance-general_000865"}
