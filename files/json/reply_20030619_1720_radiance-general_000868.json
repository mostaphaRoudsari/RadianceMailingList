{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nIn your paper to the 2002 Eutographics Workshop on Rendering, you \ncompare sRGB and Sharp RGB renderings against a multi-spectral rendering \nat 69 evenly-spaced spectral samples from 380 to 720 nm.  I am curious \nhow you made that multi-spectral rendering.  Did you divide the 69 \nwavelengths into groups of three and run rpict(1) 23 times?  Or did you \nrun rpict(1) 69 times with proportional R, G, and B values?  Or did you \nhack rpict(1) from a 3-band renderer to a 69-band one?\n\n\nIn the first case, wouldn\u00b4t there have been issues with gradient \ninterpolation, which is calculated using the CIE definition of \nbrightness from R, G, and B?  Also adaptive shadow testing?  I am \ncurrently wrestling with these issues as I have to perform \nmulti-spectral renderings of many more than 69 bands from 380 nm to 14 \nmicrons, so the CIE definition of brightness won't do.\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Bettison\nAcacia Research Pty Ltd\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000868.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bettison", "created_at": "June 19, 2003 at 05:20PM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bettison", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000869", "id": "radiance-general_000868"}
