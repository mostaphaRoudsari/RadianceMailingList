{"body": "Dear Group\n\n\nLately, I have been attempting to simulate the bumpiness of a carpet \ntexture. While seaching on the web, I ran across a site that listed a cal \nfile called bwave.cal with the following description:\n\n\n\"this file creates the waves of the pinboard and carpet \"\n\n\nDoes anyone have a copy of this file. Also, does anyone have any cal files \nthat can simulate the subtle bumpiness of carpet. I may try experimenting \nwith weave .cal to see if I can achieve good results.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nMarcus D. Jacobs\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
