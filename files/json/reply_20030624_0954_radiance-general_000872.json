{"body": "Fellow Radiance users,\n\n\nI recently completed a large image (1.4 GB .pic file, 16k\nby 24k pixels), and it appears like there are two obvious\nhorizontal bands of incorrect values (one 30% from the top,\nthe other ~80% from the top). I pfilt'd the image down to\n5% of it's original size to make the image below:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/p21c_fish_take_3/redo_smooth_6/timg10_1_tw.jpg\n\n\nThe commands that I ran were:\n\n\nrpict -x 16000 -y 24000 -vta -vp 0.2 0.2 -0.01 -vd 0.454 0.891 -0.08\n-vu 0 0 1 -vh 58.66667 -vv 88 -ab 1 -aa 0 -ad 16 -as 0 -dv -ds 0.1\n-dj 1.0 -t 600 -o img10_1.pic real.oct\n\n\npfilt -1 -x /10 -y /10 -r 0.4 img10_1.pic > timg10_1_t.pic\npfilt -1 -e +3 -x /2 -y /2 timg10_1_t.pic | ra_ppm | cjpeg -q 95 > timg10_1_tw.jpg\n\n\nDoes anyone know where these artifacts originate, or how to\nprevent them from appearing? I'm running the same image at\nreduced resolution right now, but final print quality is\nnot going to be as I'd hoped.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000872.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "June 24, 2003 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000874", "id": "radiance-general_000872"}
