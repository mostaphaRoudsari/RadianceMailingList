You may want to play with the ambient\nresolution as well if you do this, to keep the size of that\nfile under control.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000873.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "June 24, 2003 at 10:34AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000874", "id": "radiance-general_000873"}
