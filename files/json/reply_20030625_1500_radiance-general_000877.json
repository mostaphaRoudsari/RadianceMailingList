{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nAssuming it's the long integer wrapping as I suspect, you should  \ndownload top-of-trunk and recompile to see if this is fixed.  Go to  \nwww.radiance-online.org and click on the \"download Radiance\" link under  \nsoftware.  Then, grab the \"current experimental/bug-fixed version\"  \ncalled radiance-HEAD.tgz.  Rerun \"rmake install\" in src/common and  \nsrc/rt and that should update rpict, rtrace, and rview.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000877.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 25, 2003 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000874", "id": "radiance-general_000877"}
