{"body": "The process ran straight through, with no pauses or restarts.\n\n\nAnother process (another third of the final image), which did\nrequire a few restarts, is here:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/p21c_fish_take_3/redo_smooth_6/timg10_2_tw.jpg\n\n\nThis one contains the same horizontal bands, one at ~35% of the way\ndown, but a pair at about 85%.\n\n\nBut there's also a weird slightly-darker band 20% of the way down,\nand on the center vertical tube.\n\n\nI'm also noticing thin dark lines on some of the tubes. I marked\nthem in the following image:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/p21c_fish_take_3/redo_smooth_6/timg10_2_twm.jpg\n\n\nSorry about the long URLs. I'd move it to a more root-ward directory,\nbut stuff has been rendering constantly for 2+ weeks.\n\n\n\n\nGeorg writes:\nYou appear to have plenty of disk space, so I'd recommend to\nuse an ambient file. You may want to play with the ambient\nresolution as well if you do this, to keep the size of that\nfile under control.\n\n\n\n\nThat's the way I would have done it in the first place, but\nonce the scene and the ambient file got up to 1.3 GB in RAM\n(where I have only 1 GB), it started to thrash, and I'd only\nmade it to the 4k x 2k version by then. Plus, there were\nstill splotches from the not-completely-resolved ambient\ndistribution. Ultimately, with -aa 0, I get a smoother final\nrendering, at the cost of a more speckled pre-filtered\nrendering.\n\n\nI'm trying a lower-resolution run right now. Thanks for\nthe input.\n\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 24 Jun 2003, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000876.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "June 25, 2003 at 05:38PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000874", "id": "radiance-general_000876"}
