{"body": "Hi Ondrej,\n\n\nChas is right -- I am going to politely decline your offer.  Actually, \nI was about to be rude, because I'm in a pissy mood this morning....\n\n\nI have not seen much benefit to the autoconf approach, as it tends to \nmake a mess of the code with a lot of HAS_THIS and HAS_THAT kinds of \nmacros.  I'm suspicious that Georg Mischler is trying to push the code \nin this direction already, and this is a very dangerous direction to \nhead.  The whole reason the code is as solid as it is and has lasted as \nlong as it has is because I've tread a very careful path along what I \nperceive as the \"lowest common denominator\" of all operating systems, \nthus avoiding most system-specific features.  As things change, and \nthey always change, I prefer to readjust the code to use common \nfeatures rather than splitting with #ifdef's along different paths \nsimultaneously, the approach that autoconf favors.  The result of that \npath is sloppy, unreadable, and unreliable code.  I won't be convinced \notherwise, so you may as well not try.\n\n\nAs for the faulty CHECK() macro, this was fixed shortly after the 3.5 \nrelease, and you'd do well to download the latest experimental \nbug-fixed version following the \"download Radiance\" link on \n<www.radiance-online.org>.  If you still find problems, please forward \nthem to the radiance-dev list or to me directly and we'll take care of \nit.  Currently only three individuals have CVS access, Peter A-B, \nGeorg, and myself, and we're going to keep it that way for a while.\n\n\nBut thanks for your offer.  Who knows, I may get outvoted and we'll \ntake you up on it later.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000134.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 02, 2003 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000132", "id": "radiance-dev_000134"}
