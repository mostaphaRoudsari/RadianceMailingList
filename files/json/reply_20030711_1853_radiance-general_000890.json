[...] This\n   mesh may be included in a RADIANCE scene description via the\n   mesh primitive, thus:\n\n\n         mod mesh id\n         1+ output.rtm [xform args]\n         0\n         0\n\n\n\n\nA compiled mesh file is not a normal Radiance scene file,\nso you can't feed it directly into oconv. Use a mesh\nprimitive as explained in the man page and make sure\nthat it points to the right file. Then let oconv process\nthe file containing the mesh primitive.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000890.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "July 11, 2003 at 06:53PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000889", "id": "radiance-general_000890"}
