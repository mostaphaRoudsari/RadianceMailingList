{"body": "I can't seem to get obj2mesh to recognize\nmaterials.  From the man page it seems as though\nit should.  It says:\n\n\n\"Any RADIANCE material descriptions included via one\n or more -a options will be compiled and stored in the mesh\n as well.\"\n\n\nIt doesn't specify the format of the -a material descriptions.  Is it a rad\nfile with normal material defintions in it?   I tried that and it didn't \nseem\nto work. \n\n\nHere's the output I get from obj2mesh on a .obj file\nwith a dozen materials.  It seems as though it doesn't\nrecognize them. \n\n\nMesh statistics:\n    0 materials\n    16 patches (0.08 MBytes)\n    3879 vertices (0.0% w/ normals, 0.0% w/ uv)\n    7742 triangles (78.5% local, 20.6% joiner)\n    8289 leaves in octree (34.3% empty, 6.84 avg. set size)\n\n\nAre there any examples on how to do this?\n\n\n- Bob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000892.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bob Coyne", "created_at": "July 13, 2003 at 11:39PM", "created_by": "Bob_Coyne", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000894", "id": "radiance-general_000892"}
