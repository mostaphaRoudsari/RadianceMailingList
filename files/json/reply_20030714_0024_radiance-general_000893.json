{"body": "I figured out the problem...I put the \"-a <materialfile>\" option\nafter the input .obj file rather than before it.   It didn't complain, \nand I didn't\nnotice.\n\n\nI switched them around and it works.  Sorry for the false alarm.\n\n\nOne other question.  Is there a way to override the values\nof materials on individual groups in meshes?  I'd like to override\nthem individually from the outside so separate instances can have\ndifferent attributes.  I don't want to have to create new meshes just\nto change some materials on groups. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nbob coyne wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000893.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bob Coyne", "created_at": "July 14, 2003 at 12:24AM", "created_by": "Bob_Coyne", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000894", "id": "radiance-general_000893"}
