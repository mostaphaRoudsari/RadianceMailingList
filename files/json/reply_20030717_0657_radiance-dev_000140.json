{"body": "Thank you for the quick reply. I had previously tried the \nradiance-HEAD.tgz with the same resulting error. I believe the problem \nlies in the makeall script, something incorrect with a path designation \nor a loop that is incorrect. If someone will attempt to correct the \ninstaller I would be happy to test it and report the results. There are \nseveral people here who want to run Radiance on OSX and a working \ninstaller would really help. Have you considered putting Radiance in \nthe Fink Project? (http://fink.sourceforge.net/) They have a great \ninstaller integrated with CVS making for easy installs and updates.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nChris Jessee\njessee@virginia.edu\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 17, 2003, at 03:17 AM, Peter Apian-Bennewitz wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000140.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Jessee", "created_at": "July 17, 2003 at 06:57AM", "created_by": "Chris_Jessee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000138", "id": "radiance-dev_000140"}
