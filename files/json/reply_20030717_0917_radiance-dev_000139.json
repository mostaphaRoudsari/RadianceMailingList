Although I'm not sure wether this \nfixes your problem, it is better to download  /radiance-HEAD.tgz/  \ninstead of  /radiance-rad3R5.tgz/ - quite a few bug fixes with a very \nminor chance for troublesome changes.  Labeling it \"current \nexperimental/bug-fixed version\" may not sound attractive enough,- sorry \nfor that.\nFor those with limited bandwidth to the Internet, there's also a \ncumulative patch available on radiance-online which contains the \ndifferences between all files in rad3R5 and HEAD.\nBtw: It's called HEAD because the software revision control system (CVS) \nlabels the most recent versions with a tag 'HEAD' . The HEAD files are \ngenerated nightly and since Greg and Schorsch are  actively fixing and \nextending the source, it makes HEAD a good choice.\n\n\nWhile we're at it and because someone asked for CVS access lately:  \nRealtime read access to the CVS system and the history of changes and \nlog messages for each file is offered by a web interface at  \nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/ .\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000139.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "July 17, 2003 at 09:17AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000138", "id": "radiance-dev_000139"}
