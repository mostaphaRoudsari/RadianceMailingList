I was baffled by Chris' error, and \nrad3R5 installed just fine on my OSX machine.  I *am* still unable to \ncompile 3.5 on my RHL8 box, but alas, no time to investigate.\n\n\n>> some of the renders\n>> http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/london/model/gallery1/index.html \n> \n> These are very cool -- how did you build your model?\n\n\nYes, please, Chris.  Details!  How'd ya build it?  How many ambient \nbounces?  Render times?  They are really very nice.  Are you excluding \nheavily?  The render with the sky full of cumulus clouds, was that a \nPhotoshop trick, or did you use colorpict?  They look great.  Are you \nextracting quantitative data from these renderings as well?\n\n\n> Fink is nice in that it has the downloads all done for you automagically \n> via wget commands or something like it.

A taste, perhaps, yes.  Of course, I'm the \nguy who typed \n/usr/rpg/stuff/nested/deep/down/in/the/tree/downloads/radiance/current/makeall \ninstall, the first few times I attempted installing Radiance.  Learning \nabout the magical dot was a watershed moment!  Sigh.  It's an uphill \nbattle learning Radiance, and if you have to learn UNIX at the same \ntime, it's pretty daunting.  Too bad Fink is funky.  \"Automatic\" \ninstallers can help newbies a great deal.  But there is a pretty wide \narray of binaries available for Radiance, so I guess it's really not \nthat big a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000142.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 17, 2003 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000138", "id": "radiance-dev_000142"}
