{"body": "Hello all,\n\n\nThank you all for the tips and suggestions regarding OSX install  \nissues. Its good to know others have had success on a similar system,  \nI'll try a clean install on another machine using tar rather than  \nstuffit to unpack files and take greater care in setting up my path  \nstatements. Admittedly my limited knowledge of unix may be the real  \nproblem.\n\n\nOn a previous attempt at using FINK I also encountered serious problems  \nrequiring a complete reinstall of the system. Thank goodness for CCC  \n(http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html) The latest version of Fink  \ncombined with FINK commander (http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/)  \nactually works and avoids the pile of unneeded apps. Although on my  \nnext install of Radiance I'll skip any prior install of FINK to  \neliminate it as possible problem source.\n\n\nMore information about the Crystal Palace model is available here.\nhttp://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/london/model/\n\n\nIn broad strokes, Will Rourk (will@virginia.edu)and I built the model  \nin FormZ and used objtorad to move it to Radiance. Will also built a  \nnice VRML version using Cosmo. I setup a master .rif file and materials  \nfile and ran the initial tests. Some of these were rendered at SDSC on  \nBig machines. Ying Yao (yy8b@virginia.edu) is currently attempting to  \nrender the entire model in Radiance. She has only been able to render  \nabout 1/3 of the model at a time due to the large amount of geometry.  \nOur aging Sun server doesn't seem to be up to the task. Here are a few  \nnotes from Ying's rendering efforts:\n\n\nTo generate an octree file for one section (Center or East or West) of\nthe Crystal Palace, usually takes about 5 hours or so.\nAfter the octree is generated, to render the image with medium quality,\nit takes about 5 hours to render the first 360x360 image.\nWith the previous ambient file ready for 360x360 image, it takes  \nadditional\n4 to 8 hours to render 2880x2880 image, which depends on how much  \ngeometry\noverlap between the two images.\n\n\nHigh quality images take a little longer:\n\n\nto render 360*360 image, takes 3.5 day;\nto render 2880*2880 image with the ambient file from 360*360 image,  \ntakes 1.6 days;\nto render 2880*2880 image without any ambient file, it takes 5.5 days.\n\n\nWe get the following error when attempting to render all three sections  \nof the building at once.\n\n\noconv: system - out of octree space\nrad: error generating octree\n\n\nAny suggestions on this front would be most welcome.\n\n\nThe image with the clouds is a composite done in Photoshop. The clouds  \nwere generated in Alias Power Animator, several years ago.\n(http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/london/model/gallery1/source/ \nimage18.html)\nThe horizon line is kind of screwy, guess I should fix that. I have a  \nnumber of those old sky images. If anyone wants to use them just drop  \nme a note.\n\n\nTake care,\n\n\nChris Jessee\njessee@virginia.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000144.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Jessee", "created_at": "July 17, 2003 at 05:01PM", "created_by": "Chris_Jessee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000138", "id": "radiance-dev_000144"}
