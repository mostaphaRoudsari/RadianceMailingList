{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI am not a Mac guy nor do I know that much about OSX other than it is a \n*nix variant/flavor. But one question that occurs to me in looking at \nyour install log is what userid are you installing as and does this user \nhave permission to create directories in /usr/local/lib and install \nfiles in /usr/local/bin. Typically root has write permissions for these \ndirectories not other users. Another thought is to wonder whether the \ncorrect path information is configured for the userid doing the install, \nfor example it looks like some X11 header files are not being found \ncorrectly. Or is the X11 stuff installed in a non typical location or \nname. I am not sure what shell you are using, but you could try \n'printenv' to see what the shell variables such as PATH are set to. This \ncould also be helpful information in diagnosing the problem further.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nChris Jessee wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 18, 2003 at 11:09AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000145", "id": "radiance-dev_000146"}
