{"body": "Most of your problems stem from the build of the OpenGL utilities in \nsrc/common failing, which then causes the rest of the build to fail \nbecause the main library doesn't get installed in src/lib/librt.a.\n\n\nApparently, I assumed in makeall that the X11 headers were installed, \nwhich they are not on the default system.  Even folks who download the \nX11 server from Apple do not get these headers by default I believe, so \nI should not count on their presence in makeall.  Unfortunately, \nwithout them you end up with a very hobbled version of Radiance, so \nthere's no really good solution other than installing from the OS X \nbinaries from the website, or preinstalling the X11 headers, which are \nfreely downloadable from a number of places.  Including them with \nRadiance would be a breach of good programming practice, however.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000149.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 18, 2003 at 02:28PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000145", "id": "radiance-dev_000149"}
