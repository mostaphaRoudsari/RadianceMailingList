ACIS solids\n   are only supported by the version included with Rayfront (note\n   that DR only converts a very limited subset of of ACIS, Rayfront\n   does the full thing).\n\n\n\n\n  http://www.schorsch.com/download/dxf2rad/\n\n\n   Standalone application available for several platforms. No ACIS\n   support at all, since that would require the use of expensive 3rd\n   party libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000900.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "July 22, 2003 at 01:33PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000899", "id": "radiance-general_000900"}
