{"body": "Hi Jeffrey,\n\n\nI guess we really need a FAQ...  I would have gotten to this earlier, \nbut I was off for a little vacation.  I'm surprised no one else fielded \nit.\n\n\nYou need to set the RAYPATH variable to include . and whatever \ndirectory you've used for the Radiance libraries.  Also, there is a \nproblem when you install from binaries, which is that certain .cal \nfiles (such as rayinit.cal) are considered \"source\" files and are not \nincluded when you download the distribution and run \"makeall library\".  \nI have fixed this for the next release, but in the meantime, you need \nto run the following command from the ray/ directory:\n\n\n\tcp -f src/*/*.{cal,tab,hex} /usr/local/lib/ray\n\n\nThis assumes that you are using /usr/local/lib/ray to hold your \nRadiance libraries, in which case you should add the following to your \n.cshrc file:\n\n\n\tsetenv RAYPATH .:/usr/local/lib/ray\n\n\nI hope that fixes it.  Again, I apologize for the frustration and the \ndelay.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000902.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 24, 2003 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000898", "id": "radiance-general_000902"}
