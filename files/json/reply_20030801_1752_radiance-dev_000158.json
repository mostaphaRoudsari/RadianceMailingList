MS is being cared for by Schorsch. \nPeople have packaged Debian et al distributions for Linux end-users, \nMacOS is being cared for by Greg himself. Someone with a SUN has either \ncompile experience him/herself or an admin closeby. dito IRIX/HPUX/AIX.  \nThe makeall script is not the premium solution, but it works.\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000158.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "August 01, 2003 at 05:52PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000151", "id": "radiance-dev_000158"}
