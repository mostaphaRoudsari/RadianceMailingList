Hunh?\n\n\n> The makeall script is not the premium solution, but it works.\n\n\nThe problems I see are:\n\n\n1. There is no way to write portable Rmakefiles which separate build \nand install and work with the current makeall script.\n\n\n2. There is no platform-independent way to automatically include \nheader-file dependencies in  Rmakefile's.\n\n\nDo you see any way around these?  Or regard them as minor?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "August 01, 2003 at 11:20PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000151", "id": "radiance-dev_000159"}
