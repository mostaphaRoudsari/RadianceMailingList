Incidently, Greg has already created a seperate\n\"installib\" module some time ago. It probably wouldn't hurt to\ncontinue into that direction and modularize makeall even further.\nCreating seperate files with the default settings for each known\nplatform might be a good start, as it would make it much easier\nto add new platforms in the future.\n\n\n\n\n> 2.

The dependencies only need to be generated when they\nactually change, which means on Gregs system or mine. There\nshould be no need for anyone else to bother with that.\n\n\nThat implies that we'll only include dependencies to our own\nheaders. A platform independent procedure would only be necessary\nif we were to generate dependencies for system headers as well,\nwhich I consider bad practise. The development environment should\ntake care of those without any intervention from our side.\n\n\nActually, I'm not sure if the dependency generation really needs\nto be automatic, although it would certainly be nice.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000160.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "August 02, 2003 at 07:48AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000151", "id": "radiance-dev_000160"}
