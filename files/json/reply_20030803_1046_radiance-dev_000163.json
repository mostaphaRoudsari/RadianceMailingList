{"body": "We could write some own scripts that automatically generate the\nmakefiles, we could call it automake or autoconf or so ;-)\n\n\nOK just kidding, but i think ppl should do what they are best in , the\nradiance ppl are best in writing code that does\nrendering/raytracing/etc. Let other ppl make the gui toolkits like\nGtk/Qt/Motif and yet others configuration tools like autoconf etc. \n\n\nIt always seems that writing yer own keeps things simpler in the\nbeginning until you project grows and than you hit the same problems\nother ppl already had and solved. \n\n\nAnother advantage of using wel known tools is that ppl have written\nbooks about them , there are loads ppl that know those tools, and they\nare kept up to date. \n\n\nJust my 2 cents, which i know are going to be ignored cause making own\nthings is cool.\n\n\n- Erwin \n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, 2003-08-02 at 21:11, Randolph Fritz wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000163.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Rol", "created_at": "August 03, 2003 at 10:46AM", "created_by": "Erwin_Rol", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000151", "id": "radiance-dev_000163"}
