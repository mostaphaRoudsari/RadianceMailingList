{"body": "I have been silent during this discussion not from lack of interest or \nrelevant comments, but because I was off at SIGGRAPH in San Diego last \nweek and unable to respond to (or comfortably read) e-mail.\n\n\nIn general, I am opposed to \"enhancements\" to the distribution that \nrequire people to compile other packages, unless they are freely \navailable and supported on all platforms and provide a substantial \nbenefit to a majority of people (or developers for the build system).  \nIn the case of SCons, which I know nothing about, it sounds like it is \nfree and depends on Python, which is preinstalled on many systems and \nprobably easy to install on most others.  This leaves only the second \nrequirement -- that SCons provide such an improvement to the system \nthat it is worth the added effort....\n\n\nSchorsch has suggested (more than once) that the current C-shell \nscripts that are part of Radiance should be rewritten, either as C \nprograms or Python/Perl scripts.  I tend to agree, if only because \nthese languages are better supported on non-Unix systems than C-shell.  \nIf they are rewritten as Python scripts, then SCons would be no added \neffort over the default system.  If it would also provide some benefit \nin maintenance or ease of compilation, then I would favor it.\n\n\nThese are the questions I have about it:\n\n\n1) Is Python available precompiled or easily built on all systems we \nsupport?\n\n\n2) Is SCons sufficiently stable that we don't have to be updating our \nbuild input to keep compatibility with different SCons releases?  This \ncan be a nightmare for deployment.\n\n\n3) What benefit does SCons offer over our current script-builds-rmake \nsystem, which is quite simple when compared with almost any other build \nsystem I've seen?  The rmake command is intelligible, the Rmakefile's \nare intelligible, and even the makeall command is pretty easy to \nfollow.  Take a quick peek at any of the files in a typical autoconf \nbuild system for comparison.  I'd like to see what SCons expects as \ninput.\n\n\nIn the following e-mail, I will address some of the more specific \ncompile issues brought up last week.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000168.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 04, 2003 at 11:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000164", "id": "radiance-dev_000168"}
