{"body": "> Hi all!\n> \n> I've successfully compiled Radiance using Cygwin on\n> Windows XP.\n\n\nHoly Crap! Thank you so much! This is wonderful.\n\n\nThis allows me to run Radiance at work without\ndual-booting, which means that I can set up\nRadiance jobs to run in the background while\nI continue to do CAD work in Windows.\n\n\nAlso I'm generating a workflow for using Radiance\nwith AutoDesk Revit; this will make it much easier\nfor other non-Linux savvy Architects to get their\nfeet wet with the Shell & Radiance.\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000906.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "August 05, 2003 at 09:51AM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000904", "id": "radiance-general_000906"}
