HOE's offer two possibilities:\n\n\n\n\nHi Frank,\n\n\nRadiance doesn't provide enough spectral information, which makes\nit nearly impossible to realistically simulate the coloring\neffects you're after You already know how to simulate the\nquantitative effects of those elements, of course.\n\n\nIf I understand you correctly, then you can't get the results\nyou'd like to see right now in an efficient manner with Radiance\nalone at all.  Ideally, you'd have a forward raytracer (photon\nmapping), and a much finer spectral granularity than the RGB\ncolor spaces offers.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000908.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "August 06, 2003 at 06:50AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000905", "id": "radiance-general_000908"}
