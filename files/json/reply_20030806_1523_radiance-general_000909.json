Meanwhile, you could ask Roland \nabout support for prism/prism2 materials, which would give an \napproximation of one HOE type (whose core advantage is of course to be \nmuch more flexible than prisms). Or model a diffractive structure with \nan approximative equivalent BRTF using dielectric and try to use this \nHartmann constant (if photon-map supports it) to get the wavelength \ndependancy (ugly as sin to model HOE using diffraction). Not \nstraight-forward, but rather cumbersome workarounds. Do you have a \nspecific HOE to model or do you want to show the principle ?\nIf three color channels are not sufficient and the project is worth the \nextra work, run Radiance multiple times with different channels .\n-Peter\n\n\nPS: Radiance-online's mailinglist archiver doesn't handle email \nattachements well, so they won't show up in the archives.\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000909.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "August 06, 2003 at 03:23PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000905", "id": "radiance-general_000909"}
