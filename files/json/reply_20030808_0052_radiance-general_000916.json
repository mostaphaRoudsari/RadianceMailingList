And while dielectric is supported, it \ndoes not use the Hartmann constant. Pmap was originally intended to \nsupport only simple, frequently used primitives. This isn't likely to \nchange in the near future: lacking time, funding, and (above all) \nmotivation, I will no longer be adding features to the photon map. I \nwill make bugfixes to the existing code when necessary, but only for a \nlimited time since the addon sees limited use anyway.\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
