{"body": "Hi Pillo,\n\n\nI know that I shouldn't have disabled these options, but what can I do now.\nI went through the exercise of compiling rtrace_dc (modified rtrace) with\nGenevieve Lucet last October. Apparently, she managed to compile rtrace_dc\nunder macox. Genevieve, could you maybe send pillo (and myself) a copy of\nthe binary? \n\n\nPillo, in case that does not work, we can communicate offline and try to get\nthis sorted out. In the meantime, I will forward you a copy of my email\ncommunication with Genevieve. Let me know how it goes.\n\n\nChristoph \n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000918.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "August 08, 2003 at 08:52AM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000913", "id": "radiance-general_000918"}
