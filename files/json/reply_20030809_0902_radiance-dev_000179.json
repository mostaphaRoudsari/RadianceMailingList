{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nThis looks pretty cool.  I have the following comments:\n\n\n1) The overall SConstruct file doesn't look that much smaller than \nmakeall, though it is better organized.  It's missing some things, like \nthe license agreement, which must be added, and the ability to edit the \nbuild options.  Once you add these, assuming you can, it will probably \nbe about the same size as makeall, which is OK.\n\n\n2) However, I'm wondering if it's even possible with this system to \nallow the people doing the compiles to mess with the options without \nediting the SConstruct script, and therefore understanding it.  I \nwouldn't feel comfortable editing this myself, as Python is a whole \nnew, foreign environment to me.\n\n\n3) If you added a way to change the build options, would SCons then \nrebuild all the *.o files automatically?  What's the \"clean\" process?  \nMakeall has a little test to see if the rmake script has been updated \nand does a clean if it has.  Can we include such functionality with \nSCons?\n\n\n4) Since SCons is figuring out all the dependencies for us, which by \nthe way is unnecessary for end users, who build the whole system from \nscratch and that's about all they do, I'm wondering how these \ndependencies are worked out?  Does it look in all the source files \nevery time to find the headers?  Seems a bit time consuming if all \nyou're doing is rebuilding after a single change, but I haven't seen it \nwork so I don't actually know if it slows down the process or not.\n\n\n5) Personally, I like the process we currently have of building the \nrmake script, which is just a call to make with a bunch of options, and \nbuilding separately.  Does combining the two with a whole environment \nof passed variables means you can only recompile at the top level, or \nis there some way to build in a subdirectory only?  If it was wasteful \nto refigure the dependencies in just one directory, refiguring them \nover the entire system each time you compile a small change has GOT to \nbe a factor, doesn't it?\n\n\nWell, those are my concerns for now.  I really appreciate you and Fritz \nlooking into this.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000179.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 09, 2003 at 09:02AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000176", "id": "radiance-dev_000179"}
