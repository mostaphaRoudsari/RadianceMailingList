The Python\nbuilder is autoconf, which will try to build on any *nix version.

They write, \"We ensure that today's\nfunctionality isn't broken by tomorrow's release through rigorous use\nof a development methodology that adds incrementally to an extensive\nset of regression tests: non-comment lines of test code outnumber\nlines of production code by more than 2.5 to 1.\"  Serious QA\ncommitment there.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nWeb sites:\n  http://scons.sourceforge.net/\n  http://www.python.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000182.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "August 11, 2003 at 06:31PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000164", "id": "radiance-dev_000182"}
