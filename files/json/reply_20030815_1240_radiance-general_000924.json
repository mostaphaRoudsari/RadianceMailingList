{"body": "Hi gang,\n\n\nTHanks for the swift replies, both on and offlist.  I have tried your \nsuggestions, but now I have a new problem: my screen is totally black.  \n;-)\n\n\nThe suggested PATH problem is not the cause, I don't believe, because I \ncompiled to the same locations as I had 3.4.  Everything is where is \nwas before.  So, I grabbed the .rpm installer that Mr. Anselmo set up, \nand was about 98% done with that when the power went out in my NYC \noffice.  Thanks for the tip on how to save the STDERR, Georg, I would \nreally like to compile the source rather than using the precompiled \nbinaries, so I will try your suggestions when the electrons begin \nflowing once again.\n\n\nP.S.\nIt took my wife & I nine and a half hours to get home last night.  But, \nwith no electricity in the office even today, I get a free day off.  \n=8-)  And since about 80% of the people in Manhattan that were trying \nto get to New Jersey were all located at a single ferry terminal at \n39th Street, the chances were good that I should run into a friend I \nused to work with at a bike shop ten years ago, which is exactly what \nhappened.  As an added bonus, I had several hours to kill, so we got \nall caught up on things.  =8-)\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000924.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 15, 2003 at 12:40PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000921", "id": "radiance-general_000924"}
