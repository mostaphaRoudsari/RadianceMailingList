Sorry for the confusion.\n\n\nI think you announced your port already some time ago, but I\ndidn't look at it in detail back then. Would it be possible\nfor you to create a patch file with just the relevant changes?\nThis would enable us to adapt those into the original sources\nso that they will then compile on cygwin out of the box.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000185.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "August 16, 2003 at 03:24PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000183", "id": "radiance-dev_000185"}
