It's like shooting with a camera, you can't expect \nthe same f-stop and shutter speed to work in your basement as in your \nback yard.\n\n\nAn ambient level close to what is recommended in the gensky output is \nappropriate.  Your output recommends 13.1, so add a line \"render= -av \n13.1 13.1 13.1\" to your rad input file for outdoor views.  The exposure \nlevel corresponding to this is 0.5/13.1, or EXPOS=0.04.\n\n\nGive it a try.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000935.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 20, 2003 at 08:57AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000927", "id": "radiance-general_000935"}
