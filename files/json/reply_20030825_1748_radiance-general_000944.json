{"body": "Some of you may remember about a week ago I tuned with news of a broken \nRadiance installation, broken because I was trying to upgrade to 3.5 so \nI could begin experimenting with ies2rad.  Well, my machine is fixed \n(the HEAD release compiled just fine, thanks for the advice Francesco), \nso I am playing around with this ies2rad business, and naturally, I'm \nshowing up here once again scratching my head.  I'd like to be able to \nuse ies2rad to build a luminaire library of frozen octrees, and then use \nreplmarks to rapidly get CAD layouts into my Radiance models.\n\n\nI did this:\n\n\n$ ies2rad -di -t default -u white -m (various) -o dl Dla216.ies\n\n\n$ oconv -f  dl.rad > dl.oct\n\n\n$ replmarks -i dl.oct room_llights room_llights.tmp > lights.rad\n\n\n$ oconv mats.rad *.rad > room.oct\n\n\nThen I looked at the octree in rview.  There are glowing discs where the \nfixtures are, and the intensity of them changes accordingly when you try \ndifferent multipliers (-m) in ies2rad.  Problem is, the room is totally \ndark.  A quick look at the scene files in objview reveals everything to \nbe in order, but when lit with my new lights, I got me one black room. \nAll points in the room are 0L, except for the fixture's luminous \naperture. The ies file is just your basic run-of-the-mill Edison Price \n6\" downlight, fresh off the internet.  Ian Ashdown's IES file parser \ndoesn't have any beefs with the file, and indeed it looks fine upon \nvisual inspection.\n\n\nWhat the heck am I missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000944.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 25, 2003 at 05:48PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000946", "id": "radiance-general_000944"}
