I'll have a look at this tomorrow. Man, what \nflexibility Radiance users have!  Even though you can't instance light \nsources, you can separate the geometry from the emitter if you want to, \nin the case of a complex luminaire, to get the best of both worlds.   \nThat's great.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000947.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 25, 2003 at 11:54PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000946", "id": "radiance-general_000947"}
