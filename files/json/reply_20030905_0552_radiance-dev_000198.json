The purpose of the ambient and\ndirect calculations is ultimately the same, to determine how much\nlight arrives at a given point from a set of given directions.\nThe fact that direct sources are treated seperately is mostly a\nconsequence of practical considerations, because the ambient\ncalculation is not good at finding small sources.\n\n\n From a photometric/radiometric point of view, those two methods\nof calculation are equivalent, which means they can be treated\nthe same way in this context as well.\n\n\n\n\n> Furthermore, specular reflections aren't considered at all with this\n> treatment.\n\n\nOn the final bounce (resp. the first when counting from the eye),\nthe goal is to eliminate the effects of reflection completely.\nWe're only interested in the incoming light (= irradiance) here.\nSetting the lambertian reflectivity to Pi is a technical trick to\nreach this goal, in order to avoid a more complicated special\ncase treatment in the code.\n\n\nOn all further bounces, both diffuse and specular reflections are\nhandled normally.\n\n\n\n\n> So, from this point of view, -i in its current form has some considerable\n> limitations additionally to your mentionings...\n\n\nThe -i parameter does exactly what it promises to do (besides the\nantimatter bug, which should probably be fixed).\n\n\nThe question about transparent materials on the first bounce is\nmore difficult, I don't have a final opinion on that one yet.\nMaybe another parameter to select the desired behaviour would be\nmost appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-September/000198.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 05, 2003 at 05:52AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000191", "id": "radiance-dev_000198"}
