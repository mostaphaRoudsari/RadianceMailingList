{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nnow the time has come for me to ask one of those (probably stuuupid) questions\nwhich are hovering around in my mind for a loooong time:\n\n\nIn irradiance runs (rpict -i ...) all surface materials are replaced by the\nmysterious \"Lambertian\" material with the reflectance set to PI. \n\n\nThis is obvious for a surface lit by a direct source (in Radiance terms), setting\nrefl=PI makes the caculated radiance equal to the irradiance by the classical formula.\n(at least for the approximation of purely lambertian surfaces)\nBut as soon as ambient light is considered, i.e. the light reflected (diffusely) via\nseveral bounces in the scene, isn't  there an error introduced by setting ALL materials'\nreflectivity equal to PI regardless of their real properties? \n\n\nFurthermore, specular reflections aren't considered at all with this treatment.\n\n\nSo, from this point of view, -i in its current form has some considerable limitations\nadditionally to your mentionings...\n\n\nHmmm ??!!  \n\n\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-September/000197.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "September 05, 2003 at 10:19AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000191", "id": "radiance-dev_000197"}
