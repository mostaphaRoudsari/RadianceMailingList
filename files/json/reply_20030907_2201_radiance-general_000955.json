I've prepared some complex  .cal -files for \nmathematical color and/or surface-normal -pattern generation. I admit \nthat this all is a bit awkward, as there are a lot of cryptic \nparameters. On the other hand, this complexity allows the realistic \nmodelling of a lot of common building materials (including, a.o., rough \nwall textures)\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000955.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "September 07, 2003 at 10:01PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000954", "id": "radiance-general_000955"}
