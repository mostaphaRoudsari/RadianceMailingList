You need to make sure that source rays \ncan't sneak past this geometry, which is why you want it to make a \ntight seal around your luminaire system.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000965.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 09, 2003 at 10:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000963", "id": "radiance-general_000965"}
