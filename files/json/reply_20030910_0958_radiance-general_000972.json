{"body": "Hi Jeffrey,\n\n\nPfilt, like many Radiance commands, sends its output to stdout, which \ngoes to the terminal if you don't redirect it.  It sounds to me like \nyou're running it so:\n\n\n\t% pfilt [options] input.pic\n\n\nWhen you should be running it like this:\n\n\n\t% pfilt [options] input.pic > output.pic\n\n\nThe redireciton to output.pic with the '>' syntax is critical.  Without \nit, the binary picture that's produced goes to the terminal, resulting \nin a lot of garbage on your screen.\n\n\nI admit that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to send binary \ninformation to stdout, but this is the way things work best in Unix, \nsince you can easily create piped commands, such as sending pfilt \noutput to ra_* picture conversion programs, etc., using the '|' syntax.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000972.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 10, 2003 at 09:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000970", "id": "radiance-general_000972"}
