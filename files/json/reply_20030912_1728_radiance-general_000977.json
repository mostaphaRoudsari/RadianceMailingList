But your\npictures really remind me of that old weirdness, so it could be\nworth to do some research about what really happens there.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000977.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 12, 2003 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000963", "id": "radiance-general_000977"}
