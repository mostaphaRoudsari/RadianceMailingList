And I recall that a specific parameter combination was\nrequired to trigger it. I think that this usually prevents\nit from appearing in rview, which makes it tricky to catch.\n\n\nProbably the vaguest bug description I've ever submitted, eh? ;)\n\n\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if we were able to finally\nchase it down with a little experimentation. Maybe Rob can\nstrip down his scene until only the offending polygons\n(and maybe a surrounding box) are left. By relaxing the\nsimulation parameters one by one we should then be able\nto narrow it down to the real culprits.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000980.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 13, 2003 at 07:15PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000963", "id": "radiance-general_000980"}
