What a welcome diversion.  I was in the midst of doing \njust that, as I am re-creating my radiance scene description after a \nvery abrupt lesson in the whims of gzip (don't ask).  \n\n\nI am building a separate model of one coffer, for the mkillum \nprocess.  It would be trivial to place it in a small box room for \nfurther study.  I would be happy to give you the files when they are \nready, which is likely to be sometime tomorrow because a show \nabout the Reno Air Races is airing on TV soon.  =8-)\n\n\nAs for the bug's relation to my current woes, well, I don't know.  \nThe renderings that exhibited this problem are old.  The latest \nrenderings (the ones at the end of my web page on all this) do not \nhave any of these artifacts.  The problems I'm currently having with \nthe rendering of the coffers is more of an uneven illumination inside \nthe coffers; there are no strange artifacts. But if my model can help \nyou guys analyze this elusive bug, I'd be happy to send it to you.  \nLet me know. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000981.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 13, 2003 at 07:35PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000963", "id": "radiance-general_000981"}
