Even less than 12 minutes.  Yes, it's because of mkillum. \nIf you think of mkillum as a tool to generate an \"ies file\" for a \ncomplex bit of geometry, it makes a lot of sense (to me).  You move the \ncoffer's contribution to the room illuminance from the indirect \ncalculation to the direct one, which is much faster.\n\n\nSo now I have a great looking room, but a bad-looking coffer.  The illum \nbug that Georg & Greg have been discussing also seems to have shown up \nfor a visit in my current renderings.  =8-\\\n\n\nBefore I can use Greg's tip about excluding the coffer materials, I need \nto learn a bit about coming up with a valid -av number.  But, to be \nhonest, this already gives a good impression of the space.  The whole \npoint of the rendering was to see how bad the glare would be from the \ncoffers (answer: bad), which can be judged just fine from the direct \ncomponent of the glows.\n\n\nThat said, I would still like to get the coffers looking better. I will \nhave to revisit this problem when I have time...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000985.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 15, 2003 at 05:01PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000984", "id": "radiance-general_000985"}
