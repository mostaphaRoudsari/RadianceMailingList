The photon map tool was part \nof Roland's PhD, and AFAIK it's sort-of \"stalled\" right now, he's doing \nsome validations and the like.  Also, I believe it *is* stable.  You \nmight also wanna check out Francesco Anselmo's compiled source \npackages; you have the option of downloading the Radiance release with \nthe photon map module, precompiled, in a variety of formats (.rpm, \netc...)  As far as future development, you'll have to talk to Roland...\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000992.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 24, 2003 at 10:47PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000990", "id": "radiance-general_000992"}
