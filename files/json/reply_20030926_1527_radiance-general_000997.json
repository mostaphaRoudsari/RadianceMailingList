For testing and comparing my \"off\" results i had to remove the sunshading device in SCRIBE but it's not an easy way. The results of my invisible materialsimulation are different from the one after i had removed the sunshading device in SCRIBE. The differences are not large.\n\n\nthanks in advance again\nWaldo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000997.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "WA Bont", "created_at": "September 26, 2003 at 03:27PM", "created_by": "WA_Bont", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000995", "id": "radiance-general_000997"}
