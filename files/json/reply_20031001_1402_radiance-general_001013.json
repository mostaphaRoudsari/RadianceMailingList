{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nI generally don't use the -2 option of pfilt for computing the \nexposure, even though it's the default.  I generally know the exposure \ncorrection for my scene by the time I reach the filtering stage, so I \njust set it explicitly with the -1 and -e options.  This is what rad \ndoes as well when you specify an EXPOSURE= value (as you should).\n\n\nIn either case, the exposure that's set by pfilt is completely \nreversible and doesn't affect the time taken or output produced by \npcond.  As a side note, using pcond without the -h option is pretty \nmuch the same as displaying the image with ximage -e auto.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001013.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 01, 2003 at 02:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001011", "id": "radiance-general_001013"}
