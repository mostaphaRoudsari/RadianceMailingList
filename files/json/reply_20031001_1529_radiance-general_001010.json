Any help would be useful.\n\n\nAs I understand it*, pfilt is primarily for image scaling and exposure \nadjustment (handled automatically if you use rad), whereas pcond is more \nof an image tweaker, manipulating the pixels in the image to make up for \ndynamic range shortcomings in various media, or color correction.\n\n\nWhat are you interested in doing with your images?  As I mentioned, rad \nis pretty good at getting the image exposed & scaled properly.  I \nusually just run my images through pcond -h after that, and end up with \na satisfactory image.  But as with most aspects of Radiance, there is \nfantastic option complexity, if desired.\n\n\n\n\n*Still learning, statements could be rubbish!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001010.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 01, 2003 at 03:29PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001011", "id": "radiance-general_001010"}
