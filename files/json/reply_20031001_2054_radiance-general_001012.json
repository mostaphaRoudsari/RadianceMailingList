{"body": "Thanks for the info Rob and Greg\n\n\nOne thing that I have questioned though is whether it would be better to use \npfilt only for anti-aliasing and filtering and leave exposure adjustment \nonly to pcond if I am dealing with a high dynamic range scene. The way I \nunderstand it* is that pfilt uses a 2 pass method (by default) to properly \nexpose the image. The way I am reading into this is that pfilt in a way \ncorrects the exposure of the picture output by rpict. To use pcond after \npfilt essentially rexposes the exposed picture. Would it be better to use a \nfiltered but unexposed picture as an imput to pcond?\n\n\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* I am only a layman (higher than a newbie but not an expert) so take this \nstatement with a grain of salt :>)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001012.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "October 01, 2003 at 08:54PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001011", "id": "radiance-general_001012"}
