{"body": "Vote YES!!!! for ISO image for 2003 Radiance Workshop CDROM to be available\nonline.\n\n\nMany of the readers of the valuable Radiance On-line forum were\nunfortunately not able to attend the workshop. I for one would like to keep\na copy of the CDROM so that I can view/read the material whilst\noff-line/remote from the internet.\n\n\nOn another issue, I see new prints of the Rendering with Radiance book were\nbeing distributed to the participants of the workshop. Are there any plans\nfor a reprint being made for wider distribution?\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn \nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design \nCurtin University of Technology \nGPO Box U 1987 \nPerth 6845 \nWestern Australia \nEmail: T.Mcminn@curtin.edu.au \nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001014.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance Mc Minn", "created_at": "October 02, 2003 at 10:01AM", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001006", "id": "radiance-general_001014"}
