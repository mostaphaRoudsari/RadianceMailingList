{"body": "I suppose we should appeal to Peter A-B to make the ISO image of the CD \navailable online.  I don't know if there are bandwidth issues -- Peter?\n\n\nFor my part, I have put some snapshots from the workshop up on my \nwebsite, for those who are interested.  The URL is:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/workshops/radiance03.html\n\n\nAlso, for those who downloaded Photosphere recently and are \nexperiencing crashes, there is a new version that fixes this problem \nalso on my website:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/photosphere.tar.gz\n\n\nThe command-line tool for building HDR images is also available, but I \nhave only compiled it on the Mac for the moment.  I should get around \nto compiling it under Linux \"real soon now\".  (Photosphere won't be \navailable on other platforms until someone volunteers to rewrite the \nGUI.)\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/hdrgen.tar.gz\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001018.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 02, 2003 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001006", "id": "radiance-general_001018"}
