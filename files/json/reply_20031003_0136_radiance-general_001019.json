{"body": "Dear Group\n\n\nI am having an issue with OCONV and Radiance 3.5 (I think that I had the \nsame issue with V. 3.4 too). Although I am currently using binaries compiled \nfor Cygwin, I have experienced the same issue with binaries that I have \ncompiled for Linux. Usually, I use the I use binaries compiled for Desktop \nRadiance but in this situation, I would like to use the new OBJ2MESH \nutility.\n\n\n\n\nIt was my understanding that as a method of combining a scene containing \nmany individual *.rad files, we could use one single file that calls xform \nin a manner such as this:\n\n\n\n\n!xform -n (name1) file1.rad\n!xform -n (name2) file2.rad\n!xform -n (name3) file3.rad\n\n\n\n\nI have not encountered any issues with the Desktop Radiance binaries with \nthis approach but when using Radiance 3.5 (compiled for Windows or Linux), I \ncontantly get error messages that usually look like this:\n\n\n\n\nxform: cannot find file \"file1.rad\"\noconv: warning - (!xform -n name1 file1.rad): empty file\n\n\nCan anyone tell me what's going wrong here?\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus D.
