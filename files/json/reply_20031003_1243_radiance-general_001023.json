{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nI don't use BASH myself, but I think you add the following to your \n$HOME/.profile or $HOME/.bash_login file:\n\n\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray\nexport RAYPATH\n\n\nThis of course applies only if your Radiance library files are \ninstalled in /usr/local/lib/ray.  They might be somewhere else on your \nsystem.  Someone must have set the RAYPATH environment variable \nsomewhere, so you should check that setting and change it there.  If it \nhasn't been set, then I'm puzzled by this error since the default value \nincludes \".\" as the first entry.  Did you recompile from the source \nfiles, or install the precompiled binaries?  (Maybe we should take this \ndiscussion off-list.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001023.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2003 at 12:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001021", "id": "radiance-general_001023"}
