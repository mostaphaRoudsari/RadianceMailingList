{"body": "Alias, in its basic mode, creates an additional name for a material.\nI often use materials descriptions written in French. Without changing \nthe original file ids, I simply add a line:\n\n\n!xform  French_mat_file.rad\n\n\nvoid      alias      red      rouge  \n# modifier  alias  additional_id  original_id\n\n\nThe function has additional benefits. If the alias command is modified,\nonly the new identifier acquires these modifier properties.  I use this\nmethod as a convenient way to combine picture data from a colorpict\ndescription with a predefined material.\n\n\n!xform   picture_descriptions.rad\n!xform   paint_surfaces.rad\n\n\npicturedata  alias  painting   canvas\n\n\nOf course there are other ways to achieve the same end, but when working\nwith several large material description libraries, I find that alias\nprovides the most convenient method.\n\n\n-Rob Shakespeare\n Indiana University\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001034.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Shakespeare", "created_at": "October 07, 2003 at 01:14PM", "created_by": "Rob_Shakespeare", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001033", "id": "radiance-general_001034"}
