{"body": "hi Greg, Ben,\n\n\nI don't believe windows 5 can output colored materials for Radiance, \nmaybe you are thinking of Optics 5?  There's an option in Optics5 to \nexport a radfile of whatever glazing you chose.  You can get Optics5 here.\n\n\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/default.htm\n\n\nYou want to compare the glazing types from looking from outside?\nIn that case I think you'll have to use the BRTDfunc \"front\" material. \n\n\nhope that helps...\n.\njudy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001040.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "judy lai", "created_at": "October 09, 2003 at 03:17PM", "created_by": "judy_lai", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001038", "id": "radiance-general_001040"}
