The luminance of the sky (clear and overcast) is not \nfactored in until the indirect calculation.\n\n\nI believe this explains why with -ab 0 you don't get satisfactory \nresults with overcast skies.  So, I don't know if it's possible to \ndetermine \"direct component\" of sky brightness.  But if anyone knows a \nworkaround, you're sure to find out here...\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001042.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 09, 2003 at 10:20PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001041", "id": "radiance-general_001042"}
