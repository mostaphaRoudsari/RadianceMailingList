So, for accurate color rendition from the outside, use the \"back\" material. \n\n\nI haven't looked at the output for a while, but I think there is also a skeletal material definition for a BRTDfunc version of the glazing.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thu, 09 Oct 2003 15:17:57 -0700\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001045.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "October 10, 2003 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001038", "id": "radiance-general_001045"}
