{"body": "First off, that you so very much in your clear\nexplanation of this. It was a great help!\n\n\nNow I've got one other question, and then I\npromise to leave everyone alone for a while\nwith my basic ignorance. :)\n\n\nWhen using RAD to generate Radiance .pic\nfiles, I have experimented with the various\noptions and understand them on a basic level;\nall but the difference between the\n'Medium' and the 'High' quality settings.\nI know that these change what options\nare passed onto rpict, which I'm in the\nprocess of learning more about, however\nI'm unable to find documentation that\nexplicitly lists what options are changed\nwhen one goes from the 'Medium' setting to\nthe 'high' setting. Seeing that I tend to\nget awful artifacts and spotting whenever\nI use the 'high' setting, things I feel I\ncould get rid of if I understood what's getting\npassed onto rpict better, I would love if someone\ncould point me to a resource that outlines\nthis, or sell me a copy of the Radiance\nbook :) (that I can't seem to find to\nsave my life).\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\nJeffrey\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001046.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "October 10, 2003 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001033", "id": "radiance-general_001046"}
