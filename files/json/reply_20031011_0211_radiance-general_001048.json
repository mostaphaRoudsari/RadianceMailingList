{"body": ">\n>\n>Hi Jeffrey,\n>\n\n\nI probably posted this advice already  a long time ago on this list, \nanyway, again:\n\n\nPeter has published an interesting comparison study which -amongst other \ndetails - contains a section on (especially ambient) parameter settings \nwhich is quite helpful for beginners, its available from his website:\n\n\nhttp://www.pab-opto.de/radiance/render_vergleich/report.en.pdf\n\n\nThe Rendering with Radiance book is of course a valuable resource (yeah, \nthis book really exists, I'm\none of the few who has one ..), but the manpages e.g. contain lots of \ninfos, too, about the meaning of\nevery parameter. Don't be 'afraid' of messing with the parameters, the \nsooner you leave the overall Quality/Variability etc.. settings and \nstart experimenting with the different parameters directly, the quicker \nyou will gain an understanding of the program.\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001048.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 11, 2003 at 02:11AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001033", "id": "radiance-general_001048"}
