{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nGurneet and I figured out the problem with falsecolor.  There was a \ndeclaration of errno in ev.c that has been deprecated, which was \ncausing a run-time error with the following message on some systems:\n\n\n\tIncorrectly built binary which accesses errno, h_errno or _res \ndirectly. Needs to be fixed\n\n\nTragically, this message was being spat to stdout rather than stderr, \nwhich then got passed to psign rather than being visible to the user.  \n(Those whacky GNU compiler guys -- what a fun bunch they are!)\n\n\nThe solution is to take out the line \"extern int errno;\" from \nray/src/cal/ev.c and run \"rmake install\" in the ray/src/cal directory.  \nThe source tree has been updated as well.\n\n\nSorry for the trouble!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001054.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 14, 2003 at 09:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001051", "id": "radiance-general_001054"}
