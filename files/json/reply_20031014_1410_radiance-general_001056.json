You can \nspecify the sun radiance, however.  Others can probably give better info \non these options, as I tend to use the lat/long/timezone/TOD method.\n\n\n> 2.

When you use skyfunc as a modifier \nright after the inline !gensky command, the sky glow is modeled using \nyour input parameters from that gensky command.\n\n\n> 3.

The color is totally arbitrary, \nhowever this is very important, the weighted average RGB must add up to \n1!  If you pick values that give you a pleasing sky color but add up to \ngreater or less than 1, your sky luminance will be incorrect.  It will \nbe factored by the deviation from 1 in your average.  And, .9 .9 1 \n(which is used as an example blue sky on the gensky manpage) is just \nsuch a combination!  I mentioned this to Greg a little while ago, and I \nthink it got fixed in the distribution, but the radiance website still \nhas the error:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000789.html\n\n\n(hmm, Schorsch, yours still has this error as well: \nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/htmlman/gensky.html)\n\n\n\n\n> 4. Similarly while defining the ground, what is the best way to determine what \n> the ground values for RGB should be \u2013 I have been contemplating between using \n> one of the following case but what should I base the decision on?

Use a color \nthat makes sense and don't over saturate it, and make sure its weighted \naverage equals 1.  As for ground reflectance, just make sure you specify \nthe average ground reflectance in your gensky command with the -g \nparameter.  When skyfunc sees the negative z component to your ground \nhemisphere it will modify the reflectance of that glow by whatever \nfactor you used in -g. When you use this feature, as long as the -g \nreflectance matches whatever material you use for your local ground \nplane, you will get a very good match (except at certain shallow viewing \nangles) between the local plane and the distant horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001056.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 14, 2003 at 02:10PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001055", "id": "radiance-general_001056"}
