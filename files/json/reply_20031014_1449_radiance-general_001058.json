They can just\nset the sky/ground color with the standard Rayfront color selector,\nand the software will normalize the values to a weighted average\nof 1 internally. The original deviation is remembered though,\nso that you won't get confused too much when you reopen the same\ndialog later.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001058.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 14, 2003 at 02:49PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001055", "id": "radiance-general_001058"}
