{"body": "Thank you all. This was extremely helpful.\n\n\nThanks Rob, for all the detail answers for so many of my questions.\n\n\nGreg, I was using 120/179 multiplying factor for both sky and sun brightness \nvalues.  Hence, will switch to what you mentioned, which is seperate for the \nsky and sun brightness.  \n\n\nRegarding the Direct normal radiation - I found that this value was specified \nas the amount of solar radiation received within a 5.7\u00b0 field of view centered \non the sun (during the 60 minutes preceding the hour indicated), would I still \nbe dividing by 5.98e-5 as you mentioned to get the -r? or is this a different \nvalue all together?\n\n\nThanks very much.\n\n\nbest regards,\nAmarpreet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuoting Greg Ward <gward@lmi.net>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001060.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 14, 2003 at 02:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001055", "id": "radiance-general_001060"}
