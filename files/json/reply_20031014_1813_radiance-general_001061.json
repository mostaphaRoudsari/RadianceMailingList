I suspect that using any\nspecific conversion doesn't make much sense, unless you know\nexactly under what conditions your measurements were taken.\nOr are the above figures widely accepted to be \"close enough\"?\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001061.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 14, 2003 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001055", "id": "radiance-general_001061"}
