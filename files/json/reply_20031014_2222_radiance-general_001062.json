{"body": "Hi Amarpreet,\n\n\nThe fact that the direct normal measurement covers a 5.7 degree field \nof view doesn't change the actual angular size of the sun.  There \nshould probably be some small correction added for the circumsolar that \nis included by the measurement, but it would vary so much with \natmospheric turbidity, that the errors associated with such a \ncorrection would probably be so large as to make it a next to pointless \nfudge factor.  I wouldn't bother with it, myself.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001062.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 14, 2003 at 10:22PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001055", "id": "radiance-general_001062"}
