{"body": "Hi Zack,\n\n\nIt was great to meet you at the workshop, and I really enjoyed your \npresentation.\n\n\nI think you're making trouble for yourself by trying to adjust the \nturbidity factor in gensky.  If you have the horizontal and diffuse \nirradiance, or facsimilies thereof, you should be giving those to \ngensky directly using the -B or -b and -R or -r options as we have been \ndiscussing.\n\n\nJust to clarify, gensky ALWAYS produces an accurate CIE sky \ndistribution.  Adjusting the turbidity or these other factors only \naffects the absolute levels and the ratio between solar and sky \ncomponents.  It does not change the distribution of skylight.\n\n\nThis is not to say that the CIE sky model is the best.  It is just an \nagreed upon standard, and therefore serves as a reasonable point for \ncomparison.  The Perez sky is probably a better approximation to actual \nskies, particularly for the intermediate case.\n\n\nAs I said in the bit of e-mail you so aptly quoted, the absolute values \nproduced by gensky with the default settings are unreliable because \nthey are not based on weather data for your area.  If you have such \nmeasurements, by all means use them, but don't adjust the turbidity -- \ngo straight for the horizontal and diffuse specifications to gensky.  \nThis overrides the turbidity approximation and makes it irrelevant.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I got an e-mail from Martin Moeck on the related topic of solar \nefficacy, and include it here for discussion.  I don't know the right \nanswer, but I'm sure someone out there does...\n\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001066.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 16, 2003 at 08:02AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001063", "id": "radiance-general_001066"}
