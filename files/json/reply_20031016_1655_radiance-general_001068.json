{"body": "Gidday Greg, Zack & others...\n\n\nJust to chip in about measurement and efficacies -\n\n\nPaul Littlefair wrote a great review paper on sky efficacies, with overall \nresults:\n144+-7 lm/W clear skys\n115+-8 lm/W overcast skies\n\n\nLittlefair, PJ Measurement of the Luminous Efficacy, Light. Res & Tech, \n1988 4:p177-188\n\n\nThis might also be of interest\nFontoynont, M, Perceived Performance of Daylighting Systems: Lighting \nEfficacy and Agreeableness, Solar Energy 2002 73(2) p83-94\n\n\nAnd it should be remembered that measurements are often not of the actual \nsky spectral power distribution but are taken with equipment calibrated to \nIlluminant A with 160 lm/W.\n\n\nAnd if calibrated to D65 then efficacy is 203 lm/W.\n\n\nhopefully all this doesn't make things even more 'hazy' :)\n\n\ncheers\nalex\n\n\n*******************************************************\nA.
