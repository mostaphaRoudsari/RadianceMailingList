{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nI've been buzzing with thoughts of Image Based Rendering and HDR \ndisplays ever since the conference, I've been showing Greg's Siggraph \nanimation and your studies to all my colleagues.  I am very interested \nin getting into both of these in my daylighting design work.\n\n\nYeah, the IES recommends 94.2 lm/watt for direct beam --  IES is my \nmaster, but google does reign supreme;-) -- but I don't know how they \nthink they can be so accurate when everyone else reports these \nrelatively large ranges.\n\n\nI plan on looking into the Perez sky model in more detail.  So you found \nit gave better correlation than the CIE model in your studies?  Is \ngendaylit available in any windows form yet?  If not I have I do have \naccess to linux machines.\n\n\nGeorg, are there any plans to implement the Perez sky model (gendaylit) \nin Rayfront?\n\n\nThanks for the info!\nZack\n\n\nPS I will send the elevation study separately as i think it will just \nturn binary here.\nPPS but i need your e-mail address.  I can't seem to get it from the \nsite.
