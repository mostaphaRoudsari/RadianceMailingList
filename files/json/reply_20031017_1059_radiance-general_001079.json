{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nMy first mail to this list since a long time... I have moved (I am \nstudying in Turkey now for one year) and internet access is not that \neasy for me at the moment ;-)\n\n\nI have a model with lots of mapings here. I have set it up now by \ncreating instances of its parts as octrees. I was told that with simple \ngeometry it is more efficient not to use octrees for istances because \nof the overhead. However, I was thinking that with a large image map \nattached to this geometry, I will save memory by doing this. Am I right \nwith this assumption?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001079.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
