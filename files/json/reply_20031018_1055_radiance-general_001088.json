{"body": "Thank you Francesco for summarizing so nicely how gensky generates skies. I\nagree that it would be useful to have a method that allows one to pick sky\nmodels via .cal files\n\n\nThis might be particularly interesting since the CIE recently approved a new\n\"Standard General Sky\" Model that replaces all previous CIE Overcast and\nClear Standard Sky definitions. It is generalized from the old CIE Clear Sky\nformula (Kittler) and consists of 15 sky types of various luminance\ngradations and scattering characteristics - one of them being the new\nStandard Overcast Sky, and two others representing the new Standard Clear\nSkies (one for low luminance turbidity, one for polluted atmospheres).\n\n\nI have listed a few links below, if anyone is interested .....\n\n\nhttp://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s011.html announcement of new 2003 standard\nhttp://www.cie-usnc.org/images/CIE%20DS011_2.pdf copy of the draft standard\n(I could not find the final version online - if anyone does please let me\nknow)\nhttp://www.esim.ca/2002/documents/Proceedings/other2.pdf presentation by\nKittler with information on General Sky Standard (Esim 2002)\n\n\n\n\n- Karen\n\n\n_________________\nKaren Carrier\nM.ARCH\nUC Berkeley\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Karen Carrier", "created_at": "October 18, 2003 at 10:55AM", "created_by": "Karen_Carrier", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001063", "id": "radiance-general_001088"}
