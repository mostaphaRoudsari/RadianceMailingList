{"body": "Hi again,\n\n\n> I've been buzzing with thoughts of Image Based Rendering and HDR\nI`m happy to hear you found it interesting.

I should\nhave been more clear perhaps.\nI haven`t tried the sky model (nor gendaylit), but I plan to compare results\nbetween models in the future. If anyone knows of such studies, I would\nreally appreciate letting me know.\nThe efficacy model is a bit awkward, but all the input can be derived from\nquite simple weather data (when they don`t include illuminances)\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nSantiago.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001084.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "October 18, 2003 at 04:55PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001063", "id": "radiance-general_001084"}
