I think it`s closer\nduring southern summer, and only a little bit, that`s why the compensation\nfactor is so small (0.034). Extraterrestrial illuminance is the illuminance\nmeasured outside the atmosphere, so it`s the same for all the world at any\ngiven time. The solar illumination constant is probably the average value.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "October 18, 2003 at 07:39PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001063", "id": "radiance-general_001085"}
