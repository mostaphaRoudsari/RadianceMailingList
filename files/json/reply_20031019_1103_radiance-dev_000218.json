{"body": "A postscript to my last message...\n\n\nIt's not actually my declaration of lseek() \"rtio.h\" that's wrong; it's \nthe fact that lseek() gets \"redirected\" to lseek64() in the new version \nof the GNU C libraries.  (I swear, those guys just make my life \nmiserable.)  Here is the ever so clever declaration with \n-D__USE_FILE_OFFSET64 set in <unistd.h>:\n\n\nextern __off64_t lseek (int __fd, __off64_t __offset, int __whence) \n__asm__ (\"\" \"lseek64\");\n\n\nThe funny __asm__ business at the end apparently causes any call to \nlseek() to be redirected to the function lseek64(), which is not \nofficially part of the UNIX/C library interface.\n\n\nThe solution is still, as I stated, to include \"platform.h\" wherever \nlseek() is required, because I'm not about to include this sort of \ndeclaration nonsense in a Radiance header.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000218.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 19, 2003 at 11:03AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000216", "id": "radiance-dev_000218"}
