{"body": "Dear Group\n\n\nI have a question concerning the simulation of varous cameras in Radiance.\n\n\n>From the book, \"Rendering with Radiance\", in order to simulate a particular \nfocal length on 35mm photography, the following formulas should be emplyed:\n\n\nh35 = 114.6*atan(17/f)\nv35 = 114.6*atan(11.5/f)\n\n\nwhere h35 and v35 are the horizonal and vertical view angle respectively (in \nthe book, they are actually switched but I think this is an error).\n\n\nEarlier this year, someone sent a question to this group about the same \nsubject and Greg responded with the following:\n\n\n\"Focal length is specified with the -vh and -vv options of rpict, which\nalso controls the image aspect ratio.  Knowing one from the other\nrequires a specific image (film) size and format.  For 35mm film, the\nformula is:\n\n\nfocal_length = 35/2 / tan(vv_angle/2)\n\n\nWhere vv_angle is the vertical view angle for a landscape picture.  The\nhorizontal angle is then given by:\n\n\nhh_angle = 2 * atan(vv_angle/2 * 3/2)\n\n\nTo check your calcs, a 50mm lens in 35mm photography is equivalent to a\nRadiance view specification of:\n\n\n-vh 49.6 -vv 35.3\"\n\n\nWhat I have found is that these are different formulas that produce \ndifferent results. Could someone tell me which is correct? Also, could \nsomeone give a formula(s) for producing views in other film formats (i.e. 6 \nx 7, 6 x 4.5, etc.).\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nEnjoy MSN 8 patented spam control and more with MSN 8 Dial-up Internet \nService.
