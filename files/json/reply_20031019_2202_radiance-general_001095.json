{"body": "Slight correction to my last post.  I don't think solar efficacy is a \nfunction of eccentricity, only the extraterrestrial solar irradiation \nand illumination constants, since a vacuum does not change the efficacy \nof radiation.  But a change in the distance to the sun does change \nextraterrestrial irradiance and illuminance.  Is this correct?\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nStaff Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nwww.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001095.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "October 19, 2003 at 10:02PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001063", "id": "radiance-general_001095"}
