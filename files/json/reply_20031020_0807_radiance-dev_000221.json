{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nI'm sorry.  I misinterpreted events.  When I uploaded and unpacked the  \ndistribution on radiance-online.org, these files were somehow missing,  \nor so I thought.  I just went through what I did again, and discovered  \nwhat went wrong.  You see, I neglected to add the supplementary files  \non top of the distribution after unpacking it and before running  \nmakeall, which attempted to install files in ray/lib without first  \ncreating the directory.  (It was always there before.)  When it hit the  \nfollowing point in the build:\n\n\ncd /home/greg/ray/lib ; rm -f tmesh.cal\n/bin/sh: line 1: cd: /home/greg/ray/lib: No such file or directory\ncp tmesh.cal /home/greg/ray/lib\ncp: cannot stat `tmesh.cal': No such file or directory\nmake: *** [install] Error 1\n\n\nIt wasn't able to change to the library directory, then inappropriately  \nremoved tmesh.cal.  So, when I went to look at it later, I was too  \nhasty in deciding that it was never there to begin with.\n\n\nI will modify the installib script to create the ray/lib directory if  \nit doesn't already exist, and this will fix the problem for others who  \nmake the same mistake.\n\n\nSorry for the false alarm.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000221.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 20, 2003 at 08:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000220", "id": "radiance-dev_000221"}
