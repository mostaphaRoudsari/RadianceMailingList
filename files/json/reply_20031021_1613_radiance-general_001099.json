{"body": "hi everybody!\nI am playing with textfunc and mixfunc... just to create some changing\ncolor-normal materials....\nwhat I would like to do is to change the color according to the perturbated\nnormal ...\nto do that I think to use the variable RdotP (perturbated dot product)....\nbut radiance doesn't seem to recognize it... (probably it works only with\nbrtdf?)\nof course if I use Rdot... the normal is always the same and\ndeformation-color are not changing together.... \n\n\n\n\nI would like to do something like:\n\n\nid1 mixfunc id2\n4 idA idB f(RdotP) .\n0\n0\n\n\nwhere idA and idB have same deformations but different color-specularity and\nf(RdotP) is a function of Rdot-Perturbated\n\n\nany idea?\n\n\nthanks\ngiulio\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "October 21, 2003 at 04:13PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001100", "id": "radiance-general_001099"}
