It's the \"last official release\":  rad3R5.  And, no, you're right I\nhaven't tried compiling the HEAD release.\n\n\n> I bet that some of these corrections were made subsequent to the \n> official 3.5 release.

I'll download it and give today's HEAD a try.\n\n\nHow far away is a new official release?  Even if the problem is fixed, I\nthink most users, like me, are somewhat uncomfortable running something\nlabeled \"experimental\" and really uncomfortable running a random nightly\nbuild.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Kipp\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000227.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kipp C Cannon", "created_at": "October 21, 2003 at 09:33PM", "created_by": "Kipp_C_Cannon", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000226", "id": "radiance-dev_000227"}
