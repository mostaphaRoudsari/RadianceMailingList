{"body": "The Standard Sky Luminance Distribution algorithm, to model the current CIE standard skies, is now available from the Radiance-online web site.  The cal file and a pdf describing its use can be downloaded from www.radiance-online.org/patches/ssld/SSLD algorithm with PDF.zip.  Thanks heaps to Peter for your help getting that uploaded.\n\n\nThe SSLD became the new CIE standard in Feb this year - Spatial Distribution of Daylight - CIE Standard General Sky, S011/E:2003.  To find out more about the skies, follow the link to the paper by Kittler, Perez and Darula.  to see a pile of different sky models, go to Geoff Roy's SDF client web site.  both of these sites are listed in the pdf attached to the algorithm.\n\n\nI hope someone finds it useful!\nPhil.\n\n\n_______________________________\nPhillip Greenup\nSpecialist Engineer\nArup Australasia\nLevel 10, 201 Kent St\nSydney NSW 2000\nPh (02) 9320 9426\nFax (02) 9320 9321\n\n\n\n\n>>> anselmo@dream.unipa.it 21/10/2003 1:46:58 am >>>\nHi Phillip and all!\n\n\n> The cal file is not ideal, as it takes a few\n> calculations and a bit of stuffing around to create the models.  the\n> difficulty is in setting the relative intensities of sky and sun.  but, it\n> does the trick.\n\n\nThat's the power of Radiance: \nif you give me a proper .cal file then I'll solve my problem! ;-)\n\n\nThanks for sharing it!\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general@radiance-online.org \nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001103.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "October 22, 2003 at 08:54AM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001063", "id": "radiance-general_001103"}
