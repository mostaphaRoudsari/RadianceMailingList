As people like Georg Mischler and me work on the code, we\nstumble into it and get all confused.  If I ever have time again\n(sigh), I'll try writing some comments that explain these areas.\n\n\nOnce the Grand ANSI Unification project is complete, it might be\ninteresting to develop an experimental version in some mix of Python\nand C++; things like this make me hope it might actually be a\nrelatively simple project.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000231.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "October 22, 2003 at 01:06PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000224", "id": "radiance-dev_000231"}
