{"body": "Hi Amarpreet,\n\n\nWhat do you see when you look at the blinds with rview?  Are they in \nthe right place?  What is the description of your window polygon?\n\n\nUsing mkillum with blinds is a bit tricky, as the most efficient \ncalculation looks at only a small polygon in the middle of the window, \nthen applies the computed distribution to the whole window.  There \nreally shoul be a script to do this for you for some common blinds \nconfigurations, but I never got around to writing one.  Any volunteers?\n\n\nI don't see how 58.29 is a sensible value for the number of slats.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001111.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 23, 2003 at 08:53PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001110", "id": "radiance-general_001111"}
