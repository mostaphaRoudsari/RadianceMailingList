The results have been published in:\n\n\nReinhart C F, Walkenhorst O, \"Dynamic RADIANCE-based daylight simulations\nfor a full-scale test office with outer venetian blinds.\" Energy &\nBuildings, 33:7 pp. 683-697, 2001.\n\n\nThe results show that RADIANCE can accurately model blinds. The main\ndifficulties are:\n- you have to characterize the surface properties of the blinds with a very\nhigh accuracy\n- you have to make sure that the slat angle of the simulated blinds exactly\ncorresponds to the measured blinds\n- for ceiling sensors you have to also carefully model the exterior of your\ntest room\n- you have to set your simulation parameters sufficiently high.
