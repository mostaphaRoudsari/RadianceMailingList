{"body": "Hi Barbara,\n\n\nYou could use a smaller polygon for a light shelf, but there is less \nbenefit from doing so.  You get a more efficient calculation in the \ncase of blinds simply because you don't have to compute and place as \nmany ambient values if you restrict mkillum to a smaller area, yet the \nresult (provided there is no nearby exterior geometry) will be just the \nsame.\n\n\nI am attaching my reply to Amarpreet below for those who are interested.\n\n\nIn the case of your lightshelf, you probably don't need mkillum if the \nshelf is purely specular (i.e., a mirror), but you should definitely \nuse the \"mirror\" primitive type for its material and set -vr 1 (or \nhigher).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001118.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 29, 2003 at 12:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001110", "id": "radiance-general_001118"}
