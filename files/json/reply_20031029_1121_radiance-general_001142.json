{"body": "Thanks Greg for all your programming!\nI have not yet used Photosphere for HDRI creation, but I use it regularly to\nkeep track of my Radiance pics.\nI like how it keeps records of the rpict options\nSomeday I'll try the mirrored globe approach - after I buy my first digital\ncamera :-P\nSo much quicker than when I was converting to 48 bit Photoshop files. The\nAuto exposure is great!\n\n\nKeep up the good work\n\n\nRob Fitzsimmons\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001142.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Fitzsimmons", "created_at": "October 29, 2003 at 11:21AM", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001114", "id": "radiance-general_001142"}
