{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI new to this but I had the same problem with the 3.5 HEAD version on\nlinux.\nThe problem is not the directory (lib) creation but the source. In 3.5\nHEAD version source tree the lib directory is missing. I copied the lib\nform 3.5 source dir into the 3.5 HEAD version tree.\n\n\nI hope this will help u.\n\n\nCheers,\nFrancisco Pereira\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001132.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francisco Pereira", "created_at": "October 29, 2003 at 05:26PM", "created_by": "Francisco_Pereira", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001127", "id": "radiance-general_001132"}
