{"body": "Hi Georg,\n\n\nThanks for doing all this work on the Windows port -- great progress!  \nI'm a little confused as to the benefit(s) of separating the objects \ninto so many libraries.  Is this just to help reduce memory \nrequirements for dynamic linking?  On Unix at least, it complicates the \nbuilds considerably, as you need to know the correct link order for the \nlibraries or you get undefined symbol errors at load time.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000238.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 29, 2003 at 05:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000237", "id": "radiance-dev_000238"}
