{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nYou made the same mistake I made last time I installed from HEAD -- you \nforgot to download the rad3R5sup.tar.gz file and overlay it on the \ndistribution prior to installation.\n\n\nI made a correction to the \"installib\" script so it doesn't screw up \nlike this next time.  It's very confusing the way it is, because you \nhave no idea from the message that it's ray/lib that's missing rather \nthan /usr/local/lib/ray.\n\n\nLet me know if it works!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 30, 2003 at 07:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001123", "id": "radiance-general_001159"}
