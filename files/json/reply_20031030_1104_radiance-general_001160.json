You guys were right about my initial problem; \noverlaying the support files got the sctipt to get further along \n(thanks), but the compile process is still having some problems.  It's \nspewing tons of errors, and only about half the programs are getting built.\n\n\nThings start going haywire when the process looks for this file: GL/glu.h\n\n\n... and things fall apart from there.  I have a copy of the output from \nthe build process if anyone wants to peek at it.  Maybe it's just the \nway I \"overliad\" the support folders on the HEAD distro.  What is the \npreferred method for that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001160.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 30, 2003 at 11:04AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001123", "id": "radiance-general_001160"}
