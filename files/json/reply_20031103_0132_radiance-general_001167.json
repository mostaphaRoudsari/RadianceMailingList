Default for rpict is 4.\nYou might also wanna reduce -aa, and increase -ar and -ad. There's some \nsplotches on the walls, possibly due to caustics from the appliances.\n\n\n> As a side note, the reflections of the light sources on the floor do not \n> seem right.

AFAIK these sources are immune to -dj \nand -ds anyway. Maybe a Fully Licensed Guru[tm] here can tell you more.\n\n\nBtw, that's a big-ass microwave! :^)\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
