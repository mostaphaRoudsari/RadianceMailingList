{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nin pic room1_default5a you probably miss the reflection of the big \nlight-source rectangle on the floor. This is the classical backward ray \ntracing problem, with photon-map things would look differently.\n\n\nconcerning the metal reflections:  high jittering parameters can be \ntricky, a good way to find out what's happening is to start with very \nlow settings for both material and rendering params (i.e. almost smooth, \npolished surfaces and the default -dj -dc -dt -sj -st vals) and raise \nthem in little steps subsequently to grasp the point when the modelling \ndiffers from the expectations.\n\n\nthe latter should not be too high, either, many special surface \nproperties of custom materials can not be modeled adequately with the \nstandard Radiance models. This is understandable as things become really \ndifficult when looking at the details. sometimes it helps to add an \nextra normal perturbing texture modifier to the specification, as one \noften has to deal with \"roughness structures\" which are too big to fit \ninto the microscopic roughness models employed by plastic(2)/metal(2) \nmaterials\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001169.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "November 03, 2003 at 10:51AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001179", "id": "radiance-general_001169"}
