{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\u00a0\nThanks for the reply. To give more details, the room\nmeasures 8x12 meters, with a ceiling height of 2.70 meters.\nThe window is 8x1.70m (placed on the 8m side).\n\n\nThe materials: ceiling: brushed aluminium (r=80%), walls:\nbeige (r=65%) and floor: blue (r=20%). These reflectances\nwere taken from recommendations from literature. \n\n\nThe light shelf has a length of 1m and is also made from\nbrushed aluminium and is placed 2.1 meters from the floor.\n(half is inside the room and half outside).\n\n\nI have already tried to include more ambient bounces, but\nto no avail. But I will also check the contrast of the\nimages and check the sources of glare.\n\n\nI hope this information can be useful!\n\n\nCarlos\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nInformaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y Am\u00e9rica Latina, en Yahoo!
