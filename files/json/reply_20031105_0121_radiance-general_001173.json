What are the reflectances and specularities of the lightshelf, floor,\nwalls and ceiling? It will also depend on the geometry of the room. You can\ntry with more ambient bounces to make sure the walls are getting all the\nlight they`re supposed to get...\n\n\nAlso, have you tried looking at the images? You can try reading the\nluminances in the image and checking the contrast in the two cases. You can\nalso check the output from findglare, where there are listed all the glare\nsources, against the images.\nI`m sorry if I cannot be of much help, I`ve used glarendx only a few times.\nHope to be of some help, though.\nGood luck and regards,\n\n\nSantiago.\n\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001173.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "November 05, 2003 at 01:21AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001168", "id": "radiance-general_001173"}
