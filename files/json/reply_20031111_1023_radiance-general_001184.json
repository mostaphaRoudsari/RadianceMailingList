{"body": "Hi Jeffrey,\n\n\nI have used a tool called Xfrog to generate trees and plants. With Xfrog\nyou can order different cd's containing sets of pre-modelled trees. I\nhave translated some of these into OBJ format, and converted them into\nRadiance.\nThe trees are really nice.\n\n\nNow the good and the bad news:\n\n\nThe good news is that within Radiance I have rendered about 3000 trees\nin a scene without troubles ( expect quite long rendering times).\n\n\nThe bad news is that Xfrog - OBJ conversion is not very easy because of\nso called \"bad vertices\" and invalid normals that are generated by\nXfrog, and Radiance does not accept both bad vertices and invalid\nnormals.\nTherefore I edited the 100MB+ obj files virtually by hand ( using search\nand replace in vi, a text editor), to remove all errors: very much work!\n\n\nThere is also Bad News II : I did not succed in getting the mapping of\nthe bark and leaves right.\n\n\nIf there is anyone in this list who can help you (and me!) to make the\nconversion between Xfrog-obj files and Radiance smoother, you will have\na very nice tools with Xfrog.\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001184.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "November 11, 2003 at 10:23AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001183", "id": "radiance-general_001184"}
