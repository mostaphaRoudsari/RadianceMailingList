{"body": "OK, now we need to determine if it's the writing of RGBE or the reading \nthat's to blame.\n\n\nSee if you can display one of the included images and if it looks OK.  \nThere are a number of *.pic files in the ray/lib overlay.  Do these \nlook alright?  What are you displaying them with?  Does ximage work?\n\n\nIf so, then take one of these images and pass it through ra_rgbe and \npfilt.  Do the outputs look OK?\n\n\nWe should probably take this discussion offline, unless someone else \npipes in and says they're interested.  Debugging can be tedious, but \nwithout access to your machine, there's no other way I can think to do \nthis.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/000248.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 12, 2003 at 10:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000246", "id": "radiance-dev_000248"}
