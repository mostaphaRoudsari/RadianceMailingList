{"body": "Hi Matan,\n\n\nThe first three arguments to the \"mist\" material type are the extension \ncoefficients with respect to distance.  In other words, you can plug \nthese values into a mist volume directly, like so:\n\n\nvoid mist avocado_canopy_mist\n0\n0\n3 .5 .5 .5\n\n\n!genbox avocado_canopy_mist avocado_canopy 50 50 6 | xform -t 0 0 10\n\n\nThe above would place a 10-meter thick canopy that is 50x50 into your \nscene.  I have no idea what you actually want, but hopefully this will \nset you in the right direction.  If you want to see light scattered \nfrom this canopy, you need to add the names of the sources as string \narguments to the mist material.
