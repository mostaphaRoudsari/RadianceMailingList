{"body": "Gidday Bruce,\n\n\nOk this is bit of a punt - and hopefully it won't end up looking like a  \ndog's breakfast.\n\n\nif you don't mind flat shading of the surrounding surfaces and loosing  \nthe light spill you could treat them as glow surfaces (with low RGBs to  \nproduce something equivalent to the slightly darker areas of the land  \nor sea) and set the 4th parameter maxrad -ve so they don't contribute  \nto scene illumination.\n\n\nEffectively it should be a way of killing off the ambient calculation  \nin those areas while still producing at least the presence of a  \ncoloured surface. Vertical surfaces might need their own lower glow  \ndefinition to make a contrast.\n\n\nThe abstractness might help indicate the 'extent' of the lighting  \nrendering, but if the flatness of the shading ends up being an  \naesthetic problem, then a Brightfunc could be written to modify the  \nglows and slowly fade them out with distance from the project.\n\n\nhope this helps\ncheers\nalex\n\n\n*******************************************************\nA.
