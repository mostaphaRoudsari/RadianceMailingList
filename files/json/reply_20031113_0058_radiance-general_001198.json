Now that's resourceful!\nI'll bet a lotta fellas around here would rather model veggies and fruit \nthan some bloody big buildings... :^)\n\n\n> does any one have experince or know how to turn an extinction formula\n>  ( i.e. I=Io*exp(-0.5x)    x being the distance) into mist parameters?\n\n\nIn this case 0.5 would correspond to the coefficient of extinction \nspecified with the MIST primitive or with the -me option.\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
