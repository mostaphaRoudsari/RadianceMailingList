If you're getting noise from \nspecular reflections off your cool microwaves 'n' stuff, you're looking \nat so-called *caustics*. RADIANCE is conceptually a backward raytracer, \ntracing rays from the viewer via surfaces to the light sources. This \nparadigm, even coupled with importance sampling, will inevitably result \nin noticeable noise when you're dealing with specular reflections. \nAccording to MC theory, variance will *gradually* drop with increasing \nnumber of samples, but you'll soon wind up with astronomical rendering \ntimes.\n\n\nThe more efficient way to handle this is a forward raytracer, tracing \nrays from the light sources via surfaces towards the viewer. This \nparadigm is the method of choice for renderings caustics, and it's \nsituations like the one you decribe that motivated the development of \nthe photon map add-on for RADIANCE (see the URL in my signature). \nUnfortunately, the RADIANCE photon map is based on the (somewhat buggy) \nofficial 3.5 release, and you'll have to BYO (build your own). To my \nknowledge there are no current binaries available for download. \n(Volunteers, anyone?)\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
