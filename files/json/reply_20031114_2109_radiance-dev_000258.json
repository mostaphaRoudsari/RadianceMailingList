As it \ngets compressed elsewhere and than moved to the web directory, there \nshould be a consistent compressed tar ball at any given time t on the \nserver. It is advertised by the server as content-type \n\"application/x-tar\" and content-encoding \"x-gzip\", so some clever \nbrowser may do an uncompress-on-the-fly while downloading.\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/000258.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "November 14, 2003 at 09:09PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000259", "id": "radiance-dev_000258"}
