{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nthe trick is to use (frozen) octrees as instances and exclude these \nobjects from the ambient calculation. Usually you don't need their \nambient contribution. I did this with urban design models and LOTS OF \ntrees (go to www.3dcafe.com ;-)\n\n\nOk, I am sure that you have been told about that. I would like to add \nthat the easy way to do is to use markers in your cad-model. You place \ntriangles on one layer per object-type (e.g. one layer car_ferrari, one \nlayer tree_oak, ...). After you converted from cad to rad, you can use \nradiance to replace the markers with instances. That's the nicest way \nto place objects I know about - just click the triangles in your CAD \nwhere the objects are to appear later.\n\n\nIf you really want to do everything the gui-way... Georg Mischler's \nrayfront (www.schorsch.com) handles the triangle-marker replacement.\n\n\nCU and good luck, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nLars O.
