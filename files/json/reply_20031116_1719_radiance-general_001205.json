{"body": "Hi Carlos,\n\n\nGlare calculations are quite tricky, because they are sensitive to the \nexact view you choose to calculate them, and there are a number of \nchoices for glare indices as well, none of them terribly well-suited to \ndaylight.  (Not in glarendx, at least.)\n\n\nIt is impossible to determine anything from your description of your \nsituation.  Are you giving fisheye views to findglare?  What do these \nimages look like?  Are you giving findglare an octree so that it may \ncall rtrace?\n\n\nAnd for the group, has anyone determined that findglare works correctly \nin Desktop Radiance?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001205.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 16, 2003 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001204", "id": "radiance-general_001205"}
