{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThe pictures were generated using the fish-eye view, they\nare looking from the middle of one of the long walls of the\nroom to the other (the expected position of the user). So I\nhave the window on one side of the picture and the bottom\nof the room on the other.\n\n\nI give the findglare both the octree and the picture name,\nbut I get the same results just as if specifying only the\npicture. By the way, just giving findglare the octree and\ndirection of the view gives an error message in DR 2.0. I\nhave also increased the number of ambient bounces, but it\ndoesn't change, either.\n\n\nCarlos\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nInformaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y Am\u00e9rica Latina, en Yahoo!
