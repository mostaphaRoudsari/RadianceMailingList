Lightpipes are a \nshowcase application for forward raytracing, as you'll see on the \nwebpage. Check out the lightpipe scene in the egg samples; that should \nget you started. Lemme know how the addon works for you.\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
