{"body": "Hello, Radiance-general.\n\n\n\n\nFor making material, \u001b$B!F!G\u001b(BPicture Perfect RGB Rendering Using Prefiltering \nand Sharp Color Primaries\u001b$B!G!G\u001b(B is very helpful for me.\n\n\nNow I have another problem.\n\n\nI\u001b$B!G\u001b(Bd like to make sky dome that material depend on sky distribution \nmeasured 145 points. These 145 points relate to CIE IDMP. I think the best \nway is to make it by using \u001b$B!H\u001b(Bbrightfunc\u001b$B!I\u001b(B and \u001b$B!H\u001b(Bsource\u001b$B!I\u001b(B which has o \ndistance. But this is very difficult way for me. \nThen I made it by using square*145 by \u001b$B!H\u001b(Bpolygon\u001b$B!I\u001b(B. I know this way give sky \ndistance. Maybe distance between room and sky is important. \n\n\nWhen the radius of sky dome was changed so that indoor (1.5m * 1.2*1.3m) \nilluminance by rtrace might become suitable, the almost same value as an \nactual measurement was acquired in the radius of 200m.But rendered picture \nis not good.\nGiving sky material ;\n\n\nvoid glow sky_1\n0\n0\n4\tluminance/179  luminance/179  luminance/179  0\n\n\n\u001b$B!D\u001b(B*145.\n\n\nI have some questions.\n1: When I make sky dome, is to use \u001b$B!H\u001b(Bpolygon\u001b$B!I\u001b(Bthat have distance suitable? \n2: Supposing that is right, is there any suitable radius to sky dome?\n3;And for material of sun,is \"lumiance/179\" suitable??\n\n\nI\u001b$B!G\u001b(Bm confusing\u001b$B!D\u001b(BPlease give advice.\n\n\nKouichi kobayashi\nTokyo University of Science\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\u001b$B$\"$J$?$N\u001b(BPC\u001b$B$r<i$k$?$a$KDj4|E*$J%;%-%e%j%F%#BP:v$r!#%^%$%/%m%=%U%H\u001b(B \u001b$B%;%-%e%j\u001b(B\n\u001b$B%F%#>pJs%;%s%?!<\u001b(B http://www.microsoft.com/japan/protect/hm.asp\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001208.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kouichi kobayashi", "created_at": "November 19, 2003 at 12:05AM", "created_by": "Kouichi_kobayashi", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001209", "id": "radiance-general_001208"}
