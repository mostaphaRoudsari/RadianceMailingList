{"body": "Hello Kouichi,\n\n\nI think the best way is using Brightdata or Colordata. I know these take a\ndata file as input, but I`ve never tried them myself.\n\n\nanother problem is the value measured at sun`s position. As I understood\nyour method, you`d be modeling the sun with a polygon of greater area than\nthe real sun, but with the same luminance, which will produce excessive\nilluminance. One solution could be to use an average value over the surface\n(difficult to calculate) so you`d get correct illuminance but wrong\nluminances... or am I missing something? Probably someone with more\nexperience can correct me here.\n\n\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001211.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "November 19, 2003 at 01:38AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001209", "id": "radiance-general_001211"}
