{"body": "Hi Carlos,\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to play around with this \nright now.  It looks on first glance that your ceiling is highly \nspecular -- is it made of metal?  I can't understand these sorts of \nreflections off any standard painted surface.\n\n\nAs for the bug in glarendx, I have fixed it for tomorrow's HEAD, but I \ndon't think this is your problem as you only use a 180 degree field of \nview in your fisheye image, leaving findglare unable to fully \ncharacterize the window.  I would think it better if you increased your \nfield of view.  Also, I'm not sure that the various glare index \ncalculations are stable for sources that are at right angles to the \nview direction.  I recommend that you use the -ga option to findglare \nto generate vertical illuminances at several angles, then use these in \nglarendx to get a function of glare with respect to view direction.  \nThis way, you'll be able to see how sensitive the calculation is to \nviewing direction.  It will only work with a wider view, however, so \nyou will need to use the view type -vta rather than -vth.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001217.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 19, 2003 at 08:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001204", "id": "radiance-general_001217"}
