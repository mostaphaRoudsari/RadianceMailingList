It looks like you don't have the \ndevelopment tools installed, so the X11 libraries are missing.  is this \nyour personal PC, or something in a school's lab?  You said you're using \nRHL8, yeah?  I use that here, and I installed all the development stuff, \nand the Radiance HEAD release compiled just fine.  So, all you need to \ndo is add in the dev stuff, or get the school's admin to do it in the \ncase of a school computer, and try again.\n\n\nGood luck!  If you have any more trouble, report back here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001221.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 19, 2003 at 01:44PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001218", "id": "radiance-general_001221"}
