{"body": "Dear Group\n\n\nThanks for all of the advise with my problem with noisy reflections.\n\n\nI have done some experimenting in finding a solution. One solution to the \nproblem iI found is increasing the render resolution. The following picture \nwas rendered at 8500 x 8500 prior to filtering to 500 x 500:\n\n\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2d_camera4_DMC_sse_xlarge.jpg&.view=t\n\n\nAs you can see here, just about all of the noise is gone. What noise is \nremaining can easily be smoothed by using the -m option with pfilt. Although \nI got the results that I wanted, The render time is quite large (hey, life \nis a compromise). One way that I have considered to increase quality while \nminimizing the render time penalty is to render the portions of the scene \nthat would benefit from the increased sampling at the high resolutions while \nrendering the remainder of the scene at lower resolutions. From the above \npicture, you can see that only a small portion of the scene has problem \nareas as far as specular sampling is concerned (the appliances). The \nremainder of the scene doesn't need to be rendered at such a high resolution \n(the walls, windows, ceiling and floor). It would be much more efficient to \njust render the appliances at the higher resolution.\n\n\nFor this, I have been looking in to altering the source code to rpiece to \nallow me to render specific parts of the scene. HDRShop has a selection tool \nthat allows for a user to precisely specify the boundaries of a selection \nwindow. I could pass these parameters to the altered rpiece program and have \nit render those portions of the scene. I would subsequently use pcompos to \nstich the scene back together. There is one primary concern for this \napproach. This issue would be the how seamless would each of the separate \nrenders would blend together given that they are originally rendered at \ndifferent resolutions. To explore this, I basically used HDRShop to cut and \npaste two separate renders of my test scene to see if there are any \nnoticable seams in the image. The following picture shows the results:\n\n\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=merge_complete.jpg&.view=t&.done=http%3a//f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/lst%3f%26.dir=/RadiancePics%26.src=ph%26.view=t\n\n\nThe above picture is consist of two separate renders done at 1500 x 1500 and \n6000 x 6000. The picture actually is consist of 2 rows each with 5 \nalternating columns taken from both renders (Sort of like a brick wall). \nHDRShop was used to cut individual columns from each render.  Pcompos was \nused to stitch each of the colums and rows together. As you can see, the \nonly seams that are visable are at the appliances. The while looking at the \nwalls and floors, one can not detect that the image is actually a composite. \nI do believe that this may be a viable option.\n\n\nThe other approach that could be used to reduce the noise in the reflection \n(I think) is by increasing the number of specular samples taken at each \npixel. I do understand that convergence occurs at a sub-linear pace while \ndoing Monte Carlo sampling. But if I am correct, couldn't the error be \nreduced by half by taking 4 times as many samples? If I am correct, does \nRadiance take only one sample probalistically if the material has a \nroughness is non-zero. If only one sample is taken, would it be terribly \nexpensive to take four? I am curious to take this approach. Unfortunately, \nmy background in such subjects as Monte Carlo raytracing and random \nfunctions is not very strong. I know that there has to be additional source \ncode changes that would involve quite a bit of math (not that I am scared) \nin order to do what I am trying to accomplish. Any help and insight as to \nall that is involved on this would be most helpful.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\nBTW, I know that we Americans like to eat a lot but the appliances that are \nmistaken for microwave ovens are actually just normal convection ovens. \nNormally they would be placed in a wall cabinet. I just brought them out so \nI could study the reflections.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/000260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "November 21, 2003 at 02:57AM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000250", "id": "radiance-dev_000260"}
