{"body": "Hi all,\nAs promised, I am posting the last results I got with image based lighting,\nespecially about illuminance values under a mapped sky. All the explanation\nis a bit too long to write it here, so I`ve put it in a page for those who\nare interested. The address is:\n\n\nhttp://home.att.ne.jp/banana/tiago/radiance/IBL.htm\n\n\nI`m not sure if the explanation is clear enough, so please ask me if it`s\nnot.\nNext, I`ll be trying to include the sun in the simulations, so I hope to\nhave more news in the future about this.\nRegards,\n\n\nSantiago.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001230.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "November 24, 2003 at 06:57PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001231", "id": "radiance-general_001230"}
