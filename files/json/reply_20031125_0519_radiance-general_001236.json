{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nMy camera takes 5 exposures, from +2 to -2, so the result would be the same\nonly with fewer pictures (which can be an advantage) The problem is that the\nmid exposure is calculated from the whole scene light. Additionally, you can\nset the under/over-exposure option to offset all the bracketing (in my\ncamera up to 2 stops), so you can get for example from 0 to +/-5.\n\n\nStill I found situations where this was not enough. Not only daylight,\ndirect sun and so on, but even in a relatively dark room with only one\nbright lamp, the lamp can be out of range. I use the colormeter in osx to\nmake sure that the brightest zones are below 255 in the darkest picture, and\nthe darkest above 0 in the brightest. This can be really bad if for instance\nyou had gone to a remote place to take some images and then back at home you\nfind out that they`re no good... (I know why I`m saying this)\n\n\nThe best thing would be to test the camera`s latitude (the difference in\nf-stops between the minimum and maximum registerable values) so you can\nmeter the exposure in the highlights and shadows and find out if\nauto-bracketing is enough.\nHope this helps. All this is not so complicated, but it`s tricky to explain\nin writing (at least for me)\nRegards,\n\n\nSantiago.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "November 25, 2003 at 05:19AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001231", "id": "radiance-general_001236"}
