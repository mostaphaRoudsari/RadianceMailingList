Although at the moment I am not sure \nthat I can think of the cause(s). Here are some things to look at:\n\n\n    * are you using a persist file (-PP) -  if it is left over some\n      reason from something else then this can cause problems\n    * is there an rpict process hanging around - this is also going to\n      be associated with -PP, this can occur if a rpiece job dies\n      unexpectedly or is killed and not cleaned up, clean up may need to\n      occur by hand\n    * are you using rpiece on something that runs really really fast - I\n      have noticed that if your run rpiece on a scene that runs super\n      fast or on a very small image that runs very fast  then things can\n      get confused and die which I believe results in this kind of error\n      as well.\n\n\nIf you can send further diagnostic information then it may help jar my \nmemory further on the topic.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001245.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 26, 2003 at 02:43PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001244", "id": "radiance-general_001245"}
