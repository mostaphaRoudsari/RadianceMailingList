{"body": "This problem has existed for far too long. The simple and intelligent\nfix is to rename the Radiance rview program in the source and makefiles\nto radview or some such and be done with it. \n\n\nComplaining about vi, vim, and standard Unix applications is not a solution,\nit is just a band-aid approach. If there are other Radiance tools with\nname clashes, then these tools should also be renamed. Radiance is a very \nspecialized tool used by a very, very. very small number of computer users.\nLinux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Cygwin, and other Unix or unix-like systems\nare used by thousands of more users. If you want to make radiance more\naccessible and useable by others, then one of solutions is to fix these\nminor problems.\n\n\nRegards,\n-Steve\n\n\nSteven Baker                      \nmsbaker@cs.uoregon.edu\n\n\nRoland Schregle writes:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001248.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Steven Baker", "created_at": "November 26, 2003 at 03:36PM", "created_by": "Mark_Steven_Baker", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001227", "id": "radiance-general_001248"}
