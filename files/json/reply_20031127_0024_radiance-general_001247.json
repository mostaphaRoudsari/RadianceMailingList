I \nimmediately obliterated the damn alias and vi(m) with it. It ranks down \nthere in my bottom 10 braindead editors of all time (DOS edlin also \ncomes to mind). I've always preferred joe; it's compact and powerful \nenuff for my purposes. I can't imagine for the life of me why anybody'd \ncall vi their editor of choice, but I know for a fact some individuals \nat Fraunhofer ISE swear by it.\n\n\nSorry for the off-topic stuff, hope that won't start an editor feud. But \nsince we're on about editors: emacs sucks. :^)\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
