{"body": "Actually, I think there is an easier solution. If rview is renamed, then\nthere`s the backwards compatibility problem. But it should be possible to\nuse the enemie`s weapons;) as they say, every problem includes it`s own\nsolution. If an alias is defined, for example \"rvi\" (pun intended!) pointing\nto radiance`s rview (it`s even two letters less to type) This could be\nincluded in the main distribution to be used in case rview colides with vi,\nand without compatibility problems. Unfortunately I don`t know how to do\nthis, or even if it is possible at all, but I hope it makes sense.\n\n\nSantiago.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001250.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "November 27, 2003 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001227", "id": "radiance-general_001250"}
