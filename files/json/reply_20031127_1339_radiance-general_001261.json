{"body": "Hi Andrew,\n\n\n From your error message, it looks like rpict is dying before it ever \ngets going.  The partial error message \"rpict: signal - \" is \nparticularly telling.  Rpict apparently dies before it even finishes \nits error message!  The \"rpiece: resolution mismatch from rpict\" is \nproduced by rpiece after rpict dies - it's not part of the same \nmessage.\n\n\nMy guess is that rpict is using more memory than it's allowed on your \nnode(s).  In csh/tcsh, the command:\n\n\n\t% limit\n\n\nTells you your current resource limit settings for individual \nprocesses.  If \"datasize\" or \"memoryuse\" are anything besides \n\"unlimited,\" try typing:\n\n\n\t% unlimit datasize\n\t% unlimit memoryuse\n\n\nThere are some limits that may be imposed by the system administrator, \nI think, and you may not be able to increase past a certain size, but \nthe above commands should give you the maximum values for each.  While \nyou're at it, do the same for the \"cputime\" variable.  I recommend \nadding the above lines to your script, so you don't have to remember to \ndo it each time you start the script.  Alternatively, you could add the \nabove to your .cshrc file if you are running the C-shell, which is NOT \nthe default shell under Linux.  (I don't know how to control limits in \nthe other shells -- I assume you can, though.)\n\n\nIf the resource limit settings are not the problem, it may be that you \nare running out of swap space on your nodes, and you'll need to \nincrease your swap partition or add another swap device/file to get it \nto run at all.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001261.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 27, 2003 at 01:39PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001244", "id": "radiance-general_001261"}
