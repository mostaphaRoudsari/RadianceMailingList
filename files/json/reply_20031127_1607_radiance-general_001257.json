{"body": "Hi \n\n\nWe have tried a few things here to resolve this but with no luck as yet.  We\nhave compiled the latest HEAD distribution.  When we run rpiece it waits\nabout 3 minutes before it comes up with the error, but no files are created\nand no other information is written to the command line.  We have just taken\na step back and run an older model on the cluster and this ran fine with\nrpiece etc.  \n\n\nThe model .oct we are trying to run is ~300MB in size, we created it in 7\nstages with the -i switch.  we do have different -r settings for each .oct\nfile.  Rpeice runs fine with the model on the Linux server machine.\n\n\nAlmost all of the cluster machines are running Linux SuSE 8.1 with a few\nrunning Linux Red Hat 9.0.  All have the latest official release and the\nserver and a few others have today's HEAD distribution.\n\n\nYour help is appreciated\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\nWe are going to rebuild the .oct tonight just in case.\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001257.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "November 27, 2003 at 04:07PM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001244", "id": "radiance-general_001257"}
