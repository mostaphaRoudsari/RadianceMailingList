{"body": "Many thanks for all of the replies, \n\n\nThe 'top' command is indeed top, never knew that existed and it proved to be\na great help in solving this problem.  The limits for data and infact most\nsettings were already 'unlimited' when we checked so we were left with\nwatching 'top' to see what happened.\n\n\nThe machines we were running on generally had 64MB of RAM with 128MB swap\npartitions, we added a couple of machines that had 128MB RAM with 1.2GB\nswap, anyway when we ran rpeice on the higher spec machines with 'top'\nrunning we saw that rpict peaked at 640MB of RAM use and rpiece / rpict\ncompleted without failing.  When we ran rpiece on the lower spec machines\nthe error 'mismatch resolution etc' occurred exactly as we ran out of RAM\nand SWAP space.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that a ~300MB .oct requires 640MB or RAM and SWAP\nspace.\n\n\nOnce again thanks for the help, it's good to have found out more about Linux\nas well as Radiance.  The only problem we have now is rebuilding our cluster\nmachines to increase the SWAP space.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001266.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "November 28, 2003 at 11:55AM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001244", "id": "radiance-general_001266"}
