(More importantly i needed to \nget the raypath to be set properly in X11).\n\n\nKey thing seems to be that while .bash_profile may work for terminal (a \nnod to Rob here), for Xwindows all those settings need to be put in \n.bashrc  (well at least that was all that would work for me - it seems \nto ignore .bash_profile .login .profile  etc.etc.).\n\n\nIn .bashrc put:\n\n\nPATH=.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin/ray:$PATH\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray\nalias rvw='/usr/local/bin/ray/rview'\nexport PATH RAYPATH\n\n\nJust to clarify - i find it better to install Radiance binaries in \nusr/local/bin/ray - and so keep them distinct from the other binaries i \nhave in bin.\nThose who use he default location would have:\nalias rvw='/usr/local/bin/rview'\n\n\nBut anyway the alias trick seems to work fine with 'rvw' or 'rvi' or \nwhatever.\nIt's certainly useful for a reducing the typing on other commands as \nwell.\n\n\nI guess another one of those things that would be useful in a single \npoint guideline for installing into Panther.\n\n\ncheers\nalex\n\n\nOn 27 Nov 2003, at 12:07 am, Santiago Torres wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001269.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "alex Summerfield", "created_at": "November 28, 2003 at 07:25PM", "created_by": "alex_Summerfield", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001227", "id": "radiance-general_001269"}
