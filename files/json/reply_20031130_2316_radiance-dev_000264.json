I recently had a short look at the code, and\nthe integration is rather straightforward from a coding point of\nview (even if more of his code could be moved to seperate files).\nSo in theory, we could do the integration now, and just not tell\nanyone except for the die-hards explicitly asking for it...\n\n\nI previously thought that we should wait until we have cleaned\nup Radiance itself a bit more, but I don't think that's really\nnecessary anymore. As you said, it would just make more work for\neverybody to synchronize the two code bases again later. Rolands\npatches conditionally compile using a PHOTON_MAP macro, so the\ndefault could still be a classic compile. While we're still\ntrying to get rid of more preprocessor conditionals, I'd be\nwilling to ad this one to our collection.\n\n\n\n\n> It would help me to hear from users who have successfully applied the\n> photon map.

Otherwise, the requirement\nfor testing results before we make a final commitment might end\nup as a hen and egg problem. Many of the possible candidates will\nshy away from any third party modifications because they don't feel\ncomfortable applying patches or combining binaries from different\nsources. I also assume that this could motivate Roland to invest\nsome more work eg. in those materials that aren't supported yet.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000264.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 30, 2003 at 11:16PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000263", "id": "radiance-dev_000264"}
