{"body": "--0-2112030479-1070303512=:38438\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\n\nThis thread caught my eye.  I think I saw a demo of Roland's code at SG2000.  It was rendering a medium complexity scene at near real time on a pentium laptop.\n\n\nI have two concerns about a pair of limitations that Roland mentioned:\n\n\n-- the Glow primitive acts like a standard light source with the photon \nmap. There are no restricitions I'm aware of as far as sources are \nconcerned. All types are supported, including light source modifiers to \nsimulate goniometric diagrams such as IES and EULUMDAT files.\n\n\n-- virtual light sources are ignored; caustics is what the photon map is \nall about.\n\n\nIs the \"illum\" type considered one of the \"virtual light source\" types and is therefore ignored?  These two limitations have an interesting implication for some expert users.  The \"glow\" primitive is frequently used with zero radius of influence inside \"illum\" spheres to accurately model the appearance of luminaires without affecting the distribution of the luminaire described with the IES distribution.   If the radius of effect of the glow is ignored, or if \"glow\" primitives inside \"illum\" spheres are not ignored (for shadow testing and for the ambient calculation), then there will definately be a modeling compatibility problem. \n\n\nOther times the \"glow\" primitive is set with a non-zero radius of influence to optimize renderings in complex scenes.  For example, if you have downlights on every floor of a multi-floor building, the radius can be set to just shy of two floor-to-floor heights so that beyond this distance, the shadow testing is avoided.  This can have a profound impact on rendering speed with \"Radiance Classic.\"  This limitation is not as important if the photon mapping code deals with such optimizations automatically.\n\n\n\n\n-- light sources must be enclosed in bubbles in order to delineate \nparticipating media and obtain volume photons. This is an inconvenience, \nbut bear in mind that RADIANCE Classic doesn't take any indirect \nillumination into account in participating media.\n\n\n\n\nNow this sounds like a fantastic benefit of the new code.  Any plans to validate these results?  I presume this would be very useful for nighttime outdoor light pollution analysis, no?\n\n\nThere is another \"chicken and egg\" problem WRT the validation of new and experimental code in Radiance.  If the new code is not part of the standard release, the average and even many advenuresome Radiance users will never have the opportunity to exercise the experimental parts of the code.  This means that you get much less volume of feedback regarding the usefulness of the new code segments.\n\n\nWasn't someone working on a test suite?  What is the status of this effort?\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n--0-2112030479-1070303512=:38438\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<DIV>This thread caught my eye.&nbsp; I think I saw a demo of Roland's code at SG2000.&nbsp; It was rendering a medium complexity scene at near real time on a pentium laptop.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>I have two concerns about a pair of limitations that Roland mentioned:</DIV>\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=replbq style=\"PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid\">\n<P>-- the Glow primitive acts like a standard light source with the photon <BR>map.
