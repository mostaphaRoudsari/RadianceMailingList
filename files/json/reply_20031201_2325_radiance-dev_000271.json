These are \nbasically redundant with photon map and therefore disabled when using \nthis rendering technique.\n\n\nI just took a look at marksources() again. Glows with zero radius are \nignored. Consequently, pmap should ignore them too. Illums are treated \nas light sources, I believe, and should therefore act as the actual \nemitter in lieu of the Glow during photon distribution. As such, there \nshouldn't be a problem. This is admittedly just a vague line of \nreasoning; I honestly have never considered such a scenario. Should give \nthis a shot.\n\n\n>     -- light sources must be enclosed in bubbles in order to delineate\n>     participating media and obtain volume photons.

This was \nconsidered pretty much peripheral at ISE, and I just put it in for \ncompleteness and \"because I could\" once I perused Wann Jensen's papers \non volume rendering. Of course I'm sure there's people out there who \ndon't merely regard this as a gimmick, but find it downright useful. As \nsuch I agree this feature should be checked for accuracy. This is the \nkind of feedback I'm really looking forward to. My experience with \nvolume rendering is very limited, and I only had the formulae to go by, \nbut I think I got it right the third time around or so. :^)\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
