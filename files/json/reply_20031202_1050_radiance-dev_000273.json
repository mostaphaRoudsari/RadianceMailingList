If they work on a ray-by-ray (bundle-by-bundle) basis, perhaps a version of mkillum could be developed that uses the photon map routines instead of \"Radiance Classic\" routines.  I presume that mkillum would be much faster with photon mapping since mkillum uses a low resolution sampling of its environment.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--0-627216716-1070391013=:3741\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>Do the photon map routines work inside of rtrace, or are they strictly for the renderers?&nbsp; If they work on a ray-by-ray (bundle-by-bundle)&nbsp;basis, perhaps a version of mkillum could be developed that uses the photon map routines instead of \"Radiance Classic\" routines.&nbsp; I presume that mkillum would be much faster with photon mapping since mkillum uses a low resolution sampling of its environment.<BR></DIV>\n<DIV>-Chas</DIV>\n<DIV><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>\n--0-627216716-1070391013=:3741--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000273.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "December 02, 2003 at 10:50AM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000263", "id": "radiance-dev_000273"}
