One are the window openings, and the other are the\nview points and other sensor points. Collecting light from the\nsky and the environment to the window openings is best solved by\nbackwards raytracing (mkillum+rtrace). Distributing light from\nthe window openings (plus any artificial sources) into the\ninterior spaces is best solved by photon mapping. And collecting\nlight from interior spaces to the viewpoints and sensors is again\nbest handled by backwards raytracing (rpict/rview/rtrace).\n\n\nThis is why we're discussing how the output of mkillum (or a\nsimilar program) could be used as input into the photon map\nalgorithm, instead of the other way round.\n\n\nThat's the global picture, anyway. As you see from the remaining\ndiscussion, there are still a few problems to be solved at the\ntransfer points between the different methods.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000276.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 02, 2003 at 03:09PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000263", "id": "radiance-dev_000276"}
