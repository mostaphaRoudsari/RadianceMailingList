On the other hand,\nI think I understand the problems involved a little better now.\n\n\nOne point to note is that the xxxfunc and xxxdata primitives only\nperform their magic with light that is contributed by direct\nsources. For reflected input they seem to behave like standard\nplastic/metal/trans. Could the \"abysmal performance\" you cited\nearlier for scanning the outgoing hemisphere be more tolerable\nwhen restricted to brand new photons on their first hop?\n\n\nIn general, abysmal performance looks still better to me than\nmissing functionality. I can live with telling people those\nmaterials don't perform well with pmap, but would hate to have to\ntell them they simply don't work.\n\n\nWell, at least until we find a better solution...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000277.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 02, 2003 at 04:01PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000263", "id": "radiance-dev_000277"}
