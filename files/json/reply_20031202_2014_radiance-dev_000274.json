The number of photons actually *emitted* depends on your \ngeometry and is impossible to predict a priori. It's a non-trivial \ntechnicality, but we should be able to provide a more general interface \nif the need arises.\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
