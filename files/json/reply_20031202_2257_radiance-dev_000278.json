I'm \nalso aware of RADIANCE Classic's shortcut with these materials (it's \nbasically the same problem, just the other way round), and if pmap were \nto recitfy this, I agree with you that it should do so fully (but don't \nask me how).\n\n\n> In general, abysmal performance looks still better to me than\n> missing functionality.

Again, I felt it'd be just a half baked \nsolution no one would be really happy with.\n\n\n> Well, at least until we find a better solution...\n\n\nAlas, not any day soon as far as I'm concerned. Currently I've shelved \nthe code and am wrapping up my thesis, so I'm not actively poring over a \nsolution.\n\n\nUh... is anybody actually still *reading* this thread? :^)\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
