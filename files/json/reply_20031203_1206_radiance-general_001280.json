{"body": "Hi Rob F,\n\n\nI was cleaning out my inbox here, and read my own post to the list about \nyour question.  I should do that more often; I found an error.\n\n\nLast night I said:\n\"Make sure your illum= line includes sufficent -ab, and -ad, and -ar,\nand -as to ensure that the mkillum process is aggressively calculated.\"\n\n\nWhat I should have said was:\n\"Make sure your .rif file has -- *in addition to the illum= line* -- a \nmkillum= line, which includes sufficent -ab, and -ad, and -ar,\nand -as to ensure that the mkillum process is aggressively calculated.\"\n\n\nSo, you tell rad which polygons you want to convert to light sources \nwith the illum= line, then tell rad to use specific settings \n(independent of the rif file's Q V D settings) for the mkillum process \nwith a mkillum= line like so:\n\n\nscene= window_mullions.rad (etc...)\nillum= window_glass.rad\nmkillum= -ab 2 -ad 512 -as 256 -aa .1\n\n\nSorry for any confusion there...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001280.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 03, 2003 at 12:06PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001277", "id": "radiance-general_001280"}
