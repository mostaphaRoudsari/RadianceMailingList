It's more \nstraightforward than his papers (although HWJ's papers generally read \nmuch better than some others I've pored over). Speaking of which, I'm \nporing over a few right now as references for my thesis. Totally mind \nnumbing stuff... sometimes I really wonder who the hell reads this crap, \nand for that matter, who the hell's gonna read my thesis! :^)\n\n\nSee ya!\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
