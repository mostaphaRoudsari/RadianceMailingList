It should be a brightfunc referencing\nillum.cal, but I don't have an example sitting around either.\n\n\n\n\n> I assume when using rad, it is somewhat automated.\n> but If I were to manually use mkillum, does it alter the windows.rad file to\n> use the illum.dat files?\n\n\nThe \"il000949\" (or whatever name it will get on the next run)\nis the altered version of windows.rad.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001282.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 03, 2003 at 02:37PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001277", "id": "radiance-general_001282"}
