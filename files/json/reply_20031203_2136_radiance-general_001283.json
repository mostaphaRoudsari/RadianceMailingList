{"body": "Hi Karen,\n\n\nNo one ever responded to your query, so I thought I'd offer some \ngeneral ideas, since I've never done this myself.\n\n\nOne thing you could try is creating a mask in Photoshop by drawing into \na separate alpha layer over the area you want to average and saving the \nlayer out as a grayscale TIFF.  (Start in Photoshop from the \nfull-resolution original converted to TIFF using ra_tiff.)  Reverse \nthis through ra_tiff to get a Radiance picture you can then feed to \npcomb, like so:\n\n\n% ra_tiff -r mask.tif mask.pic\n% pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)*li(2)' -o orig.pic mask.pic | pvalue -d -b -h -H | \ntotal\n\n\nTake this result, which will be a single number, and divide it by the \nsum over the mask:\n\n\n% pvalue -d -b -h -H mask.pic | total\n\n\nThis is your area average.  I'm assuming that you have made the mask \nwhite where you want it to average, and black everywhere else.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001283.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 03, 2003 at 09:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001259", "id": "radiance-general_001283"}
