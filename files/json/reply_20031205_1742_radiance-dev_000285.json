{"body": "Hi Ignacio,\n\n\nI'm not sure it's worthwhile to attempt to understand the code at this \nlevel of detail, but the numbers are just an integer approximation of \nthe following quincunx (diamond) step size formulas:\n\n\nhorizontal_step = sample_spacing*sqrt(2)\nvertical_step = sample_spacing*sqrt(2)/2\n\n\nThere's no reason, really, not to do this calculation in floating point \nas it's only done once at the beginning, but I chose to do it using \ninteger math all the same.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000285.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 05, 2003 at 05:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000282", "id": "radiance-dev_000285"}
