Work in progress, thats what software is about!\n\n\nHear, hear... there's a good point: if the code's not disseminated on \nthe grounds that it's allegedly dodgy or half baked, nobody else (aside \nfrom the developer) will test it, consequently it'll *never* mature to \nthe point where it's ready for business (potentially in every sense of \nthe word).\n\n\n> So the real question is, is there a will to continue the development as a team effort, inevitably including code writen by someone else?

Not a real alternative, I think...\n\n\nThere *are* political issues which need ironing out, and I think that's \nimperative in order to secure further development (dare I say, \nsurvival?) of RADIANCE, not just in the case of pmap, but for other \ncontributions from the community in general. There are potentially \nhundreds of addons (well ok, maybe dozens... a handful... one???), \nscreaming: \"WE WANT IN!\" :^)\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
