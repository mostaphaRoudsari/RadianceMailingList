(thank you, Autode$k.)\nG)  After screams die down, market your pseudo-physically-based renderer \nto the massive-yet-uninformed architectural community.

Why or why not?\n\n\nNo, mainly because I feel like I'm still learning Radiance Classic. \nThat said, this latest round of discussion about the photon map module \nreally has piqued my curiosity.\n\n\n> Q2:    Would you try the photon map if it were added to the HEAD release?\n\n\nProbably, yes.\n\n\n> Q3:    If the photon map were added to the next official release, would it:\n>     A) Encourage you to upgrade?\n>     B) Discourage you from upgrading?\n>     B) Make you want to wait and see what others thought of it, first?\n>     C) Make no difference to your decision?\n\n\nC.\n\n\n> Q4:    What features would you really like to see added to Radiance?\n\n\nSince I only use 20% of Radiance's features now, I'm not really wanting \nfor new features.  Shoot, all the stuff is there already; new features \nwould be ease-of-use thingys like a GUI and some automation of existing \nstuff.  This almost always ends up being limiting.  Schorsch already did \nthe most amazing job of putting a GUI in front of Radiance that still \nallows access to the underlying engine.  Radiance calculates all kinds \nof materials, deals with complex models, etc.  What else is there? \nMaybe the ability to select from more sky distributions, such as the \nUtah sky?  Maybe a better rview (excuse me, rvu), one that allows for \neasier manipulation of the model view?  Rshow sounds like exactly this, \nbut I've never been able to get it to run.  Maybe all the new features \nwe want already exist (photon map, rshow, direct cache), they just need \nto be folded into the main Radiance distribution?  I have no idea how \ncomplicated that would be, but the quality of the install script (and I \nguess the underlying code) has *really* improved over the last year.  If \nthese other goodies could be installed just as easily, you'd be adding \nsome sweet functionality.\n\n\n> Q5:    What is your main complaint about Radiance from a user's standpoint?\n\n\nIt's complicated!  We all know and appreciate the power of Radiance and \nthe openness of the tools allows for unlimited flexibility; there were \nplenty of examples of that at the Workshop(s).  But that doesn't change \nthe fact that it's totally impenetrable to the novice.  If it weren't \nfor the generosity of Greg, Schorsch, Carsten and several others on \nthese lists, I'd never have been able to learn Radiance well enough to \nuse it in my work.  I'm grateful for their help, advice and \nencouragement, but I wonder how many people were scared off once they \nsaw Radiance for the first time?\n\n\nI believe many folks out there in the lighting design community are not \nat all interested in how this stuff works.  To me, that's surprising, \nbut after being involved in this business for the last decade that seems \nto be a fair statement.  Most folks just want to know if there's enough, \nor too much, light.  Load model, add lights, calculate, print, thank you \nvery much.  The thought of command lines and compiling source code is \nscary voodoo, the domain of people with t-shirts that say \"no, I will \nnot fix your computer\".  As a result, the typical Architectural LD is \nusing Lumen Micro and AGI, unaware that Radiance even exists.  And \nthat's a shame.\n\n\nThis complaint of mine is simply a response to the question.  I'm not \nreally complaining, and I don't know what the answer is, I'm merely \npointing out how the Radiance learning curve looks to Joe Lighting \nDesigner.\n\n\n> Q6:    What do you think of the current development arrangements?\n\n\nWell, it's active, which is good, yeah?  I'm not really knowledgeable \nabout these things, but the CVS system seems to be the way this stuff is \nusually handled...\n\n\n>     Q6a:    Would you like to see more people involved in Radiance \n> development?\n\n\nThis isn't really any of my business either.\n\n\n>     Q6b:    Would you like to participate in develoment, yourself?\n\n\nHa.  If I knew how to, I would.  Let me say this, though:  maybe there's \na way I can help.  Maybe some more tutorials would help the novice users \nbe more willing to dive in?  As good as the tutorials are in RwR, not \neveryone has that book.  I like to write, and can generally lighten \nthings up a bit.  Maybe a couple of simple baby step tutorials that \ncould get a person to install and compile radiance, followed by some \ngeneral explanations of how to get started could live on \nradiance-online.org?  This was discussed at the last workshop too.  Free \ntime is always an issue, but I'd like to help the cause in some way. \nSince it ain't gonna happen with my coding skills, maybe I can do it \nthis way.  Just a thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000289.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 08, 2003 at 01:02PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000283", "id": "radiance-dev_000289"}
