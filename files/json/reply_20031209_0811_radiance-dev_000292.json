Which \nresults in very practical and efficient code. But both revenue \ngenerating project work and \"strategic\" programming tend to be full time \njobs, so larger sw changes don't happen. Supporting other people's code \nis simply out of question for these folks too.\nInstitutions like LBNL, ISE, EPFL, IRC and DMU provide money if they \nhappen to have funds, e.g. government/industry funded projects that run \nfor months or a some (1-3) years. LBNL tried to get further funds for \nRadiance in vane for years, my experience at ISE was the same (apart \nfrom Jan Wienold's project that funded photon-map), Christoph Reinhart \nseems to have some luck at IRC, EPFL had apparently funded Greg to do \nconsiderable work for a year. Funds are sporadic and require \nconsiderable work to get them. Once it's there, some institutions are \nreluctant to give it to outsiders. Which is most efficient (hiring Greg \ngives the maximum ratio of Radiance results per cost) and ensures that \ntheir project is at the forefront of international research.\nVolunteers are welcomed, but should be prepared to look after their code \nthemselves to keep it alive. (In the current photon-map situation, I'd \npledge for a CVS branch, but that's a different thread). At least \nRadiance gives them a platform that conveys programming ideas to real, \nprofessional and live usage, which is more than what happens to most \nuniversity-level, academic software.  If they're good and their code \nperforms well, that is a solid reference for other industrial (and \nthereby better than ac paid) jobs for them. The draw back is that \nfeedback, especially positive one, from the community is not frequent. A \nbit more motivation would be good for them.\nCommercial users may want to fund small to medium software changes to \nstreamline their daily work, but I don't know how often that happened. \nWhether one could set up a Radiance fund, that commercials contribute to \nvoluntarily (\"pay what it is worth to you\" - tax detuctable) and that \ngives away yearly prizes for the most influential Radiance contribution, \nI don't know.  With Radiance, commercial users can influence the \nsoftware to fit their needs (try that with Autode$k).\n\n\nIt seems that no single way provides enough resources all by itself, so \nwe very probably have to live with a mix, trying to coodinate the \nauthors and communicating the current situation and new lines of thought \nto the wider user base. At least it is more on the move that it had been \n5 yeas ago.\n\n\nmy 2 cents thoughts\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000292.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "December 09, 2003 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000291", "id": "radiance-dev_000292"}
