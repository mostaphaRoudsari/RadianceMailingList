I will weigh in as \nI can.\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n[snip - people have weighed in with some excellent comments]\n\n\n>\n> Why don't we take a survey?

I was able to compile it and run some of \nRonald's examples. Note I also checked out Carsten's \"direct cache\" as \nwell. To my mind both of these are certainly interesting developments. \nOn the other hand, in our everyday production use, we are dependent on \nthe knowledge we have built up over the years about tweaking parameters \nin \"classic\" radiance and managing a production pipeline around the \nengine. However if these tools were incorporated into a standard release \nin a manner that would not impact \"classic\" use and performance, then I \nwould be more likely to work with these add-on on a more regular basis.\n\n\nGenerally, I am interested in anything that helps increase speed of the \nsimulation process and quality of the resultant images. For us this has \nmeant faster hardware over the years and the use of rpiece in single \nnodes. I have also played around with rpiece on distributed nodes, but I \ndo have concerns about the file locking consistency (whether this is an \nNFS settings thing, Linux things or Radiance things I do not know).\n\n\n>\n> Q2:    Would you try the photon map if it were added to the HEAD release? \n\n\nYes and others, if they are incorporated in a way that does not impact \n\"classic\" use and performance. To me this could be either as compile \ntime options, command line switches or alternates for commands (ie \nrpict, rpict_pm, rpict_dc whatever, although I suspect this is not the \nmost efficient thing from a development standpoint).\n\n\nAlternatively, I like the idea of a stable and development branch as \nwith Linux development. Then you know what is what. And perhaps \ndevelopment can be more aggressive in the development branch (people and \nother resources for development is an entirely different topic).\n\n\n>\n> Q3:    If the photon map were added to the next official release, \n> would it:\n>     A) Encourage you to upgrade?\n>     B) Discourage you from upgrading?\n>     B) Make you want to wait and see what others thought of it, first?\n>     C) Make no difference to your decision? \n\n\nProbably make no difference. I am one of the people referred to \nelsewhere who is still using the pre 3.6 release of radiance. This has \nmostly been out of laziness and not needing/wanting to mess with \nsomething that works. There are however many new exciting features that \nI think could be useful. This is also matter of just finding the time as \nwell.\n\n\n> Q4:    What features would you really like to see added to Radiance? \n\n\nAs I stated above, at one level anything that could result in increase \nperformance and quality. Some ideas (wish list) could be as follows:\n\n\n    * alternate distributed/network rendering strategy - perhaps a\n      client server mechanism to supplant nfs locking, or some other\n      locking/sharing mechanism\n    * optimizations to rendering engine to produce faster results - are\n      there optimizations to the monte carlo solution that could be\n      considered (I do know that there are variants of monte carlo -\n      probably though specific to particular problem domains).\n    * mechanism for improving ambient caching performance and reuse - I\n      know that Chas Erlich had at one point mentioned some thoughts\n      about some possibility to process ambient data to \"smooth\" out\n      results, would it also be possible to have a progressive cache\n      that can evolve has parameters and other things change?\n    * I like the idea of somehow having photon mapping integrated but\n      somehow as separated things that then integrates with the mkillum\n      strategy already included in radiance.\n    * compiled materials - if it makes sense I would like to see the\n      capability for adding special compiled functions (I know this is\n      possible in Radiance currently, but how easy it is to do and\n      compile in the linked functions is not clear) that can be used to\n      improve performance of procedural materials, likewise is there any\n      sense in being able to \"compile\" light source ies data to improve\n      performance in complex scenes with lots of lighting?\n\n\nObviously, I am probably suggesting things that take a lot of time, \nresearch and funding to do. And I realize and accept the reality that \nthis is a very small community with limited resources.\n\n\n> Q5:    What is your main complaint about Radiance from a user's \n> standpoint? \n\n\nWell there is a lot to learn, however this has just fueled my personal \ninterest and motivation over the years, so this is not really a \ncomplaint but more a indication of my twisted sense of what is fun. But \nthere are probably places where documentation could be provided or \nextended with examples or even little test cases.\n\n\n> Q6:    What do you think of the current development arrangements? \n\n\nThey are what they are. I think by its nature and development, Radiance \nis something that probably needs a small core developer team. And the \nreality is that Greg, for as long as he wants and chooses to be \ninvolved, is the person who should have final say of what gets included \nand worked on. I am all for a (hopefully) benevolent dictatorship in \nthis context. It seems to me that the team that has come together in \nsupport of continued support and development is pretty self selecting, \nwith a main core of Greg, Georg and Peter, obviously there are others \nsuch as Carsten and Roland, who have had the wherewithall to navigate \nthe original code and make developments of there own.\n\n\n>     Q6a:    Would you like to see more people involved in Radiance \n> development? \n\n\nOnly if it is manageable and useful to the development process.\n\n\n>     Q6b:    Would you like to participate in develoment, yourself? \n\n\nSure, if there is something useful that I can do.\n\n\n\n\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------090406090906000800020300\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\">\n  <title></title>\n</head>\n<body>\nHi all,<br>\n<br>\nBoy there are some interesting things in discussion.
