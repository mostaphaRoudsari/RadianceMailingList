In the old days, Greg would use it to \"keep a pulse\" on the progress of his updates...how many people have compiled the software versus just downloading it.  This was intended to provide some feedback to DOE for funding purposes, but I'm not sure that ever happened.  We also used it to fix the old Radiance \"announcement\" list when a would-be subscriber's email address was mangled or unintelligible.  The \"data\" exists only as a series of email messages residing in a user account on LBL's Radiance server (radsite.lbl.gov).\n\n\nWhen I started working at LBL, I too thought the phone-home feature was a bit 1984-ish.  I support the idea of getting rid of it in favor of a web form with required (unchecked) personal registration information (that is saved) before downloading the tarballs.  This is in line with access to the Desktop Radiance installation package.  Immediately prior to the registration form, the OpenSource license is displayed and the would-be user must \"accept\" its terms in order to proceed to the download.\n\n\nThis information can then be used at some future date to support efforts to develop an ongoing funding source for Radiance--or at least paying for the server space.  I know how much everyone hates web page ads, but Peter Apian-Bennewitz's benevolence may not last for ever, even if he remains at his current place of employment.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n--0-1479844715-1070999352=:50995\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<DIV>The \"phone home\" feature of the&nbsp;makeall script and the data it generates&nbsp;has not been looked at, as far as I know,&nbsp;since I left LBL in May 2000.&nbsp; In the old days, Greg would use it to \"keep a pulse\" on the progress of his updates...how many people have compiled the software versus just downloading it.&nbsp; This was intended to provide some feedback to DOE for funding purposes, but I'm not sure that ever happened.&nbsp; We also used it to fix the old Radiance \"announcement\" list when a would-be subscriber's email address was mangled or unintelligible.&nbsp; The \"data\" exists only as a series of email messages residing in a user account on LBL's Radiance server (radsite.lbl.gov).</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>When I started working at LBL, I too thought the phone-home feature&nbsp;was a bit 1984-ish.&nbsp; I support the idea of getting rid of it in favor of a web form with required (unchecked) personal registration information (that is saved)&nbsp;before downloading the tarballs.&nbsp; This is in line with access to the Desktop Radiance installation package.&nbsp; Immediately prior to the registration form, the OpenSource license is displayed and the would-be user must \"accept\" its terms in order to proceed to the download.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>This information can then be used at some future date&nbsp;to support efforts to&nbsp;develop an ongoing funding source for Radiance--or at least paying for the server space.&nbsp; I know how&nbsp;much everyone hates&nbsp;web page ads, but&nbsp;Peter Apian-Bennewitz's benevolence may not last for ever, even if he&nbsp;remains at his current place of employment.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>-Chas</DIV>\n--0-1479844715-1070999352=:50995--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000301.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "December 09, 2003 at 11:49AM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000296", "id": "radiance-dev_000301"}
