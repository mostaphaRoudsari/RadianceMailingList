{"body": "Hello all,\n\n\nI noticed that the license text in the makeall file is different from\nthe license text on the website. The one in the makeall file still has\nthe old license I think ?\n\n\nSecondly the makeall file has a \"phone home\" function wich i think is\nnormally only something for spyware/adware like programs and not for\nopensource projects. If the developers are interested in hearing who is\nusing what version of radiance they could simply ask if people would\nwant to mail them that information. \n\n\n- Erwin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Erwin Rol Software Engineering - http://www.erwinrol.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000293.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Rol", "created_at": "December 09, 2003 at 12:01PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Rol", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000296", "id": "radiance-dev_000293"}
