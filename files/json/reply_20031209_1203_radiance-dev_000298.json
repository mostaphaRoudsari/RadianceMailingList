Let's be clear about a few things (at least insofar as I \nunderstand them).\n\n\n   1. Radiance was originally developed with funds from LBNL as well as\n      EPFL, along with some pieces at SGI\n   2. Greg was/is the main developer of the software and has maintained\n      his involvement as best possible over the years\n   3. As work paid for by the government it had been released for use in\n      industry with no fee for use except if the use was to build and\n      sell an application with Radiance as the engine (I believe this\n      required a separate license with fee from UC Berkeley/LBNL)\n   4. With Greg's departure from LBNL, support for radiance fell off\n      dramatically to the point where ultimately I would suggest the\n      tool was unsupported (and I am sorry that I do not think\n      support/development of Desktop Radiance equals support/development\n      for the core radiance engine)\n   5. Greg has more recently been in a position to be more involved with\n      Radiance (for better or worse) now over the past few years\n   6. Peter has setup and maintained radiance-online.org\n   7. Radiance has been released under \"open source\" style license.\n\n\n From my standpoint, there was a period, the dark years, after (4) where \nI had to support and do the best I could with radiance source code if we \nencountered problems (which we did). During these dark years, Greg and \nothers such as Chas Ehrlich did the best they could to provide at least \nanswers to questions when they had time as well as some patches. I am \nvery grateful to them for their energy during this time. But again, I \nfeel that during this time my company had made the decision to continue \non with Radiance as best we could and support it as possible internally \nourselves. In many ways, I think there are a lot of users who are using \nthe tool out of dedication as well as the fact that for some kinds of \napplications/problems there is really nothing out there like it or with \nits robustness (and if there is such as Integra to name one, these tools \nare far too costly for the kinds of applications/services that they \nwould be used to support).\n\n\nI think most significantly with Peter's creation of radiance-online.org \n(6) there has been a tremendous upswing in Radiance development and use. \nThe site has provided a central location for people to share information \nand exchange knowledge. This has been furthered by \"open-sourcing\" of \nradiance (7) and Greg's emergence (5) and ability to be involved in \ndevelopment. In addition to this, Georg Mischler's development of \nRayfront has placed in him in a position to know enough about Radiance \nand its inner workings that he can actually have meaningful discussions \nwith Greg about the evolution of the tools.\n\n\nAlthough Carsten suggests he is not blaming anyone, his intimation that \ncompanies using radiance to support their service offerings \"don't pay a \ncent for the software\" does just that. I would suggest that there are \nmany ways to return or transfer value in a community such as this one. I \nthink that there are many of us who have contributed in our ways over \nthe years. This has probably been as simple as asking a question that \nresults in the discovery of a potential bug that then gets resolved, to \nsupplying patches or even just having interesting images to show that \nhave been generated with the software. I would gladly arrange contracts \nfor development of specific things if and when I can get the work to \nsupport such contracts. Unfortunately the reality is that this has only \nhappened on rare occasion.\n\n\nI think given the current size of the community, it has to be up to the \ndevelopers to determine how much time they are willing to contribute \nbefore saying  in response to some question or idea \"Hey this is great, \n<your name here>, but it is really beyond the scope of what I can do \nwith donated time. Do you have any funding available to support what you \nare asking about? And if so are you willing to donate the resulting code \ndevelopment back to the community?\"\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarsten Bauer wrote:\n\n\n> Greg Ward wrote\n>\n>> I am not a dictator ...\n>\n>\n> Ave, Greg!
