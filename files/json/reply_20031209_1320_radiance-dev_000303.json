{"body": "--0-129104571-1071004807=:90521\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\n\n\nHi all,\n\n\nI'm sure there are many good sources of information about the history of the core group of Linux developers, but there is a really good one in the October 2003 issue of Wired magazine.  I see many paralells between the Linux and Radiance development efforts... no need to elaborate. \n\n\nHere are some revisions to the history, as quoted from Jack de Valpine:\n\n\n   Radiance was originally developed with funds from LBNL as well as EPFL, along with some pieces at SGI. *** Greg has said that well over 50% of the time that he spent developing Radiance has been on his own personal time.  With current trends, this ratio is steadily increasing.  Greg Ward's personal wealth from the sales of Rendering with Radiance--ha!\n\n\n   Greg was/is the main developer of the software and has maintained his involvement as best possible over the years *** Here, here!\n\n\n   As work paid for by the government it had been released for use in industry with no fee for use except if the use was to build and sell an application with Radiance as the engine (I believe this required a separate license with fee from UC Berkeley/LBNL) *** One of the ongoing disputes at DOE (when there was money coming from that general direction) was that Radiance was paid for by US taxpayer money, but most of the users tended to be from outside of the USA.  The only reason Radiance remains publicly available today is because that is the way Greg Ward wanted it to be that way.  As a scientist at LBL working for DOE, the author of a piece of software has considerable leeway to determine how one's software is to be used and distributed.  That being said, Stephen Selkowitz at LBL deserves considerable credit for not getting in the way and anihilating opposition, at some expense (and much benefit) to his career aspirations.\n\n\n   With Greg's departure from LBNL, support for radiance fell off dramatically to the point where ultimately I would suggest the tool was unsupported (and I am sorry that I do not think support/development of Desktop Radiance equals support/development for the core radiance engine)  *** I take no bones with this fact.  Desktop Radiance was not intended to be a replacement for Unix Radiance.  It was hoped that its development would have attracted qualified Unix programmers to provide ongoing support of the Unix core, but this never materialized.  Desktop Radiance has been successful in generating considerable interest in Radiance--even if the D.R. software itself is languishing due to lack of support.  \nThere was considerable effort expended by LBL staff to port Radiance to native Windoze, and a separate effort to enhance Radiance for use on the LBL 512-processor Cray T3E with MPP extensions and stereoscopic real-time display of the results.  As the program manager, I made sure that these two efforts worked from the same code base.  This code is also freely available as part of the OpenSource license.  I was the project manager for this effort and despite my attempts to involve Greg in these efforts, he was--understandably--not interested.  Another sub-version of this so-called \"LDRD\" version of Radiance works on the multi-processor SGI Onyx and its version of MPP. \n\n\n   Greg has more recently been in a position to be more involved with Radiance (for better or worse) now over the past few years *** Here, here!\n\n\n   Peter has setup and maintained radiance-online.org *** Here, here!\n\n\n   Radiance has been released under \"open source\" style license. *** At long last!  <self promotion mode on> This has been a long-time personal effort of mine that began before there was anyting called  \"OpenSource\".  While at LBL and over the years, Greg and I spent countless hours with the software licensing staff to demonstrate the value of Radiance and to assure them that the code was not \"polluted\" by copyrighted contributions from others.  There was a months-long effort to research patents on pseudo-random ray-tracing owned by the developers of RenderMan.  <self promotion mode off> These patents continue to be a major stumbing block for commercialization of Radiance by big-time (i.e., deep pocket) developers.  Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.  Interestingly, it was only after the successful sale of 5 or 6 distribution licenses for Radiance at $10,000 each (thank you Georg Mischler and others) that we were able to command the attention of the LBL licensing staff.  It was\n as if Radiance had to make money for itself to demonstrate its \"value\" before it was allowed to be successful.  About 25% of these funds were deposited into LBL's software licensing legal defense fund.  I believe this has had significant influence on LBL's willingness to go along with the OpenSource effort.  (Thank you Viviana Wolinski and other LBL licensing staff.)\n\n\nOne reason for stating the above is to illustrate that many aspects software development efforts require the contributions of \"coders\" and \"non-coders\" alike.  I consider myself to be more of a non-coder.  Dealing with licensing issues, coordinating the efforts of other programmers, detailing the input/output requirements of the Radiance core software, marketing, dealing with user issues, developing installation software, testing the software--all of these are the less technical side of programming.  It was just a few days ago that the \"coders\" were stating the need for a test suite.  The biggest users of Radiance are mostly non-coder, architects like myself who have some technical programming skills.  Greg's survey is welcome and is an appropriate way to democratize his fiefdom.  :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there were two things that I could wish for in this effort to continue the development of Radiance they would be 1.) an acknowledgement of the contributions of non-coders and 2.) a \"place at the table\" to represent the user's perspective.  IMHO, this is what has been missing from Linux development as well as Radiance.  How long did it take to get a version of Linux (or Radiance) that did not require a programmer to install?  There are plenty of good reasons for this omission of non-coders--no need to open that can of worms.  Oops.  Too late.  The problem is that the non-coders, by definition, do not have the wherewithall to implement their own suggestions, no matter how good the suggestions might be, if the programmers in charge of the code development don't like or agree with the users' point of view.  Alas, this has become a modern-day archetype--the Dilbert syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not my intent to complain about anyone's efforts, least of all Greg's.  To make the leap to this next stage of Radiance development would require significant cash investment and/or ongoing funding.  And to be sure, Greg and I (and others) have gone down that path more than once.   Unfortunately, I'm currently not in the position to be making money from using Radiance, and so I can not donate my time to provide support (Darn, what am I doing writing this message?).  In my experience, providing non-coder technical support for Radiance is a full-time job.  The coder-programmers derive significant benefit through association with the software as a \"prime author\" whereas support staff generally do not get such recognition.  I acknowedge that this is as much a philosophical issue as a programmatic one, and I have no hope of a quick solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong live Greg Ward!\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\nP.S. I'm sorry about the HTML that <tags> along with my messages--just Yahoo! detritus that I don't know how to get rid of.\n\n\n--0-129104571-1071004807=:90521\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<DIV>Hi all,</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>I'm sure there are many good sources of information about the history of the core group of Linux developers, but there is a really good one in the October 2003 issue of Wired magazine.&nbsp;
