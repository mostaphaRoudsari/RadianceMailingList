So in general is trying to keep track of\nusers of open source projects not really doable in that way. \n\n\nWhen server space/download volume is expensive you really want others to\nmirror and distribute your sources. \n\n\nAnd for ads a simple page hit count is enough, no need to ask for things\nlike email address etc. \n\n\n\n\n> -Chas\n\n\n- Erwin\n\n\n       Erwin Rol Software Engineering - http://www.erwinrol.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000302.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Rol", "created_at": "December 09, 2003 at 08:58PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Rol", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000296", "id": "radiance-dev_000302"}
