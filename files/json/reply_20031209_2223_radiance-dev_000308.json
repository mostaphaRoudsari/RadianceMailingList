{"body": "No need to continue discussion on this.  I agree that the e-mail \ncompile notification shall be removed -- it was really negligence on my \npart that it wasn't gone in 3.5.  I don't even know what becomes of \nthose e-mails, if they're saved or not.  As for the license text, that \nneeds to be updated as well.  Again, my fault.\n\n\nThanks for pointing these things out!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000308.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 09, 2003 at 10:23PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000296", "id": "radiance-dev_000308"}
