I also don't see that \nI'm getting unstuck with Radiance anyway soon. The initial reason for \nstarting radiance-online three years ago was the thought that I'll wake \nup one morning and have to use Microsoft products for my simulations...\n\n\nregarding the anon CVS server: The port's not switched through in the \nfirewall and I'm quite happy not to watch another port for security \nleaks. There aren't compelling reasons for anon CVS access at this time, \nIMHO, although it may be common with other software projects: Writing is \ncoordinated by just two folks, who have write access and reading is \nfairly constant over time since functionality doesn't change that \nfrequently.  Most changes are either minor or opsys related and \nshouldn't require a frequent CVS sync, if the local current version runs \nfine.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000305.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "December 09, 2003 at 10:38PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000296", "id": "radiance-dev_000305"}
