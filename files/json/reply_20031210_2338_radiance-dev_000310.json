You know Linux is free and gratis, but\nRedhat makes good money with their Enterprise editions that have prices\nranging from 300 to 18,000 dollar. I think not many architects will want\nto bother with downloading the source, putting everything to getter and\nso on, they rather have a ready to use solution with support and\nservice. And who could better support them than the named persons ? \n\n\n> People have accustomed to the things.

Radiance is just starting as\nan Open Source project, it will take some time before it will attract\nmore developers. And those developers put time (read: money) in Radiance\ndevelopment.   \n\n\n> \n> Now forget about the money.

This project ended up being very successful and later was\nmerged with GCC again to have best from both worlds. \n\n\nOr look at Mozilla and Netscape. Netscape was the base for Mozilla, and\nnot it is turned around. They are not merged back again, but Netscape\nuses a lot of code from Mozilla. \n\n\nI see no problem in why this would not be possible for Radiance. The\ncurrent license allows you to do it. A \"Radzilla\" could be more\nexperimental, and Greg could work on the \"official\" Radiance. At some\npoint Greg might get convinced that for example the new build system\n(just a random example) from \"Radzilla\" is good stable and useful that\nhe decides to also use it for Radiance. This way the stability and good\nname of Radiance does not get compromised and also the development of\nnew and experimental features does not get stopped.\n\n\n> -Carsten\n\n\n- Erwin\n\n\n\n\n       Erwin Rol Software Engineering - http://www.erwinrol.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000310.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Rol", "created_at": "December 10, 2003 at 11:38PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Rol", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000309", "id": "radiance-dev_000310"}
