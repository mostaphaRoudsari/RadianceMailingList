One would think that users suggest new ideas while using it, \nhaving the advantage of in-house development, but that happened only \noccasionally. Generally only a few users are keen on trying something \nnew, and even fewer have a vision of what they want. Radiance's \ncontinously uphill learning-curve doesn't help in this. Consequently, \ndeveloppers follow the vision in their mind and in case of Greg's that \nturned out to be fairly usuable for others too.\n\n\n> ...\n> And as we speak of development: from the repeatedly appearing \n> statements in Gregs answers I assume that he is not reaaaallllllly \n> overwhelmingly enthusiatic about modifications which mess with the \n> core (the radius of the core has of course yet to be defined). \n\n\nI find his thoughts about user's trust in Radiance quite realistic. And \nsupporting other preople's code can be _very_ time consuming. I'm not \nsure if contributors are prepared to support their contribution over \nyears to come. Even porting rshow to R3.5 and something more modern than \nTcl/Tk is a drag, and that doesn't include validations of results.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000312.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "December 11, 2003 at 07:33PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000309", "id": "radiance-dev_000312"}
