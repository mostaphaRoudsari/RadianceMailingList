Having said that, it's up to you to make \nsure they're *consistent* with the other data you supply, for instance \nthe light source emission. Note that radiometric units like radiance and \nirradiance are defined in terms of meters^2.\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
