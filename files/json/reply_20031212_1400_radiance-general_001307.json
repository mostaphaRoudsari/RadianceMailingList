I believe any *new* user accounts you create will default \nto bash, though.\n\n\n> I know you can change the shell in Terminal Preferences, but what's the \n> difference anyway?\n\n\nLots of little differences between all the various shells, but bash \nseems to have the most useful doodads for interractive use. It's the \ndefault shell on most Linux distros too.  Here's a nice little summary \ncomparing the most popular shells I just found:\n\n\nhttp://www.ee.ucla.edu/~brucker/howto/shells.html\n\n\n> Also, in X11 when I use rad -o x11 nov15.rif, I get\n>  rview -vf qtvr.vp -ps 3 -pt .04 -dp 4096 -ar 112 -ms 0.85 -ds .2 -dt .05\n>  -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01 -ab 3 -af Nov15.amb -aa .08 -ad 1024 -as \n> 512 -av 0.\n> 5 0.5 0.5 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -av .1 .1 .1 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 105 -aa \n> .05 -ps 1\n> -R nov15.rif -o x11 -pe 1 nov15.oct\n> \n> I get an error:\n> Unknown option: \"-ps\"\n> \n> yet when I run rview directly it works\n> rview -vf qtvr.vp -ab 2 -ps 2 -af Nov15.amb nov15.oct\n> \n> I'm a little slow, but I'm asuming this is the conflict with rview and vi?\n\n\nHmmm.

Are you saying this \nerror started appearing only after you upgraded to Panther?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001307.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 12, 2003 at 02:00PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001306", "id": "radiance-general_001307"}
