{"body": "Rob F. and I exchanged a couple of e-mails.  I think his problem is \nthat he has rview \"aliased\" to /usr/local/bin/rview, but does not have \n/usr/local/bin in his path before /usr/bin, where the vim link lives.  \nThat's why running from rad, which doesn't get aliases, gets \n/usr/bin/rview (i.e., vim) instead of /usr/local/bin/rview.  The \nsolution is to put /usr/local/bin in the path before /usr/bin.  Next \nrelease, we'll rename rview so this won't happen again.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001314.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 12, 2003 at 04:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001306", "id": "radiance-general_001314"}
