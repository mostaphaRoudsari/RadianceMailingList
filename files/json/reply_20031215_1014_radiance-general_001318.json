I\n      would check the man page for rpiece carefully to make sure you are\n      doing this correctly, it looks like you are leaving out the -x and\n      -y image resolution parameters as well as the viewfile -vf  from\n      the short version of the invocation. As an alternative to keep\n      things more \"simple\", I would suggest just calling exactly the\n      same thing as the initial invocation. This could be coded into a\n      simple script or makefile to save yourself some of the headache of\n      typing the whole thing our or a potentially incorrect cut and paste.\n   3. scene complexity - depending on the simplicity or complexity of\n      the scene you are trying to run here there is a another possible\n      problem. If the scene is really simple and the image size small\n      (500x500 is not that large) then the first rpiece process could\n      have completed everything  before the next invocation (I seem to\n      recall that this may produce the same kind of message?) Are you\n      getting a completed image?\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nJohn S. An wrote:\n\n\n> Hi all,\n>\n> I had followed Andrews discussion on resolution mismatch a few weeks \n> back.
