You can feed rtrace a text file with a \nwhole series of points (one per line) and it will calculate the \nilluminance for each one in turn.\n\n\nFor example, create a file with lines like this:\n\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 10 0 0 -1\n\n\nThat file describes two \"virtual light meters\", one on the floor at \n0,0,0 looking up.  The other is located ten units above it, looking \ndown, just as an example.  You'd feed these to rtrace like this:\n\n\nrtrace [options] -I scene.oct < points.txt > values.txt\n\n\npoints.txt is the file with all your points you'd like to evaluate, and \nthen rtrace saves the computed illuminance values in values.txt.\n\n\nOf course, you'd then have to manually paste in some sort of graphic tag \nindicating the illuminance into a completed .pic file, if you wish to \nhave an image with the illuminance.  I'm sure there's a way to have \nRadiance do it for you, but in general I use rtrace to spit out a whole \nseries of numbers, which I summarize in tabular form.  I'll usually just \ndo one image which serves as a reference key to all the calculation \npoints.  This method works for me; YMMV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001322.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 15, 2003 at 12:49PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001321", "id": "radiance-general_001322"}
