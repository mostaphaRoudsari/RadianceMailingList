I did take your \nadvice and tried making the -x -y and -vf parameters explicit in the \nsecond invocation.    I no longer get the resolution mismatch error.  \nAlso, although my image is only 500 by 500, the settings seem to be \nsufficiently high enough that each piece takes at least a couple \nminutes to render.\n\n\nHowever, a few things that I have noticed are:\n1) when I use the \"top\" command, there are 4 rpict processes.  2 seem \nto be active, and 2 are idle.  I had assumed that there should be only \n3 rpict processes (2 active, and one waiting fork).\n2) when I look over the output log, both processes are working on frame \n1, then again, both working on frame 2, etc.\n3) the final output .pic file only has the center (where the light \nfixture is located) rendered, and the rest of the image is completely \nblack.\n\n\nI'm sure I'm making a dumb newbie mistake, but can't seem to figure out \nwhat it is.  Could you (or someone) post a detailed printout of which \ncommands with what parameters one would use to get a simple rpiece \nprocess going?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n(btw, my initial attempt at the rpiece command was adapted from Greg's \npost a while back)\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n_________________________________\nJack de Valpine wrote:\n\n\nJohn,\n\n\nWe use rpiece but probably a little differently in terms of invocation.\nThere are a couple of things to look at:\n\n\n    1. typo - there is a typo in your first command line you have --aa\n       which should be -a\n    2. invocations - there is a short form for invoking rpiece after the\n       initial invocation, which is what you are trying to do here.
