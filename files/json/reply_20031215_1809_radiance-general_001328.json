{"body": "I know it's a bit strange, but since a spotlight sometimes acts like it \noriginates behind its real position due to some magnification in its \noptics, this is a quick way to simulate the effect of a circular \nporthole on a distant source in the virtual focus position of the \nspotlight.  Since it's always preferable to apply an actual photometric \ndistribution, this approximation is probably of limited utility.  Just \nuse a short vector if you don't know what it means, or avoid the \nspotlight type altogether.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001328.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2003 at 06:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001319", "id": "radiance-general_001328"}
