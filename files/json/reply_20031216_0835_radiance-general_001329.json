{"body": "The weights correspond to the conversion matrix between Radiance's RGB \ncolor space and CIE XYZ (the Y channel, specifically).  This is not \nvery well correlated to the V-lambda curve, because the conversion \ndepends so strongly on the exact choice of red, green, and blue \nprimaries.  In the case of Radiance and most standard RGB systems, the \nred primary is much closer to the peak of V-lambda than is the blue \nprimary.  Thus, the contribution of the blue channel to luminance is \nmuch reduced.\n\n\nI hope this explains things for you.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001329.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 16, 2003 at 08:35AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001319", "id": "radiance-general_001329"}
