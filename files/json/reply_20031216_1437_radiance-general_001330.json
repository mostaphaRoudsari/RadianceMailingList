{"body": "Jack,\n\n\nI think it's working now.  Actually, after following your initial \nadvice of cleaning up, I think everything was working.\n\n\nThe problem of the black room was that all the surfaces had very low \nreflectances (somewhere in the order of 7% to 14%), and there was only \none 100w incandescent bulb in the scene.  When I used the human option, \nthen the space was visible.\n\n\nSo, I guess the moral of the story is clean up after yourself, and know \nwhat it is you are doing.\n\n\nThanks for you help.\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Dec 16, 2003, at 6:00 AM, \nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001330.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John S.
