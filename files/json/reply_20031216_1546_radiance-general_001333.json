{"body": "I need to correct the color of mural painting photographs and I am \ntrying to do it using macbethcal. I observe that several colors are out \nof gamut  (diagonal lines are visible). When I apply macbethcal to the \nimage \u00a8macbeth_spec.pic\u00a8 that is included with radiance,  the yellow \nsquare shows the same problem.\nIs it only a display problem or does it involve the calculation of the \ncolors?\n\n\nThe chart has rounded corner. This is why I would prefer to put the \ncoordinates of the color squares instead of the coordinates of the \nchart. Does it matter?\n\n\nThis part is not a radiance problem but if somebody can help, .. I am \nlooking for a software to correct the distortion of these images to \nobtain orthophotos of these paintings.\n\n\n  genevieve lucet\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001333.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "genevieve lucet", "created_at": "December 16, 2003 at 03:46PM", "created_by": "genevieve_lucet", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001334", "id": "radiance-general_001333"}
