Are you sure you installed the additional\nsupport package before building? Because otherwise you're missing\nout on the tifflib, which will cause other stuff in the same\ndirectory not to get built (even if it doesn't actually use the\ntifflib).\n\n\n\n\n>  BTW - pinterp does not seem to work in the\n> windows version either.\n\n\nTry to make sure that the file paths you feed to pinterp are as\nshort as possible (ie. use relative paths). This is fixed in\nHEAD, but many of the picture manipulation programs used to\nsuffer from buffer overflows when comand lines got too long.\n\n\n\n\n> 4.)

You're also moving\naround a lot, so that most of your previous ambient values will\nbe irrelevant for the part of the scene you're looking at a few\nframes later.\n\n\n\n\n> 6.)

On the other hand,\nthere's no real point in mapping a wood grain pattern to surfaces\nthat you never look at from up close.\n\n\n\n\n>   Also, I would like to map the\n> textures better onto these surfaces rather than using xgrain,\n> ygrain...etc.  How could this be done?\n\n\nThere's an \"arbmap.cal\" included with Rayfront for that (and it\nshould also be in the archives here somewhere for those who don't\nhave that).\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001337.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 16, 2003 at 09:42PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001335", "id": "radiance-general_001337"}
