I had seen that webpage before, I guess I was \nhoping I didn't have to export to obj or 3ds from my CAD file, although \nthat really shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n\nSo, I took one of my objects I wanted to smooth and exported it as a 3ds \nfile.  I use AutoCAD 2000 and could not see any way to export as an obj \nfile.  Anyways, my 3ds seemed to generate fine.  And so I ran:\n\n\n3ds2mgf entry_roof.3ds entry_roof.mgf -s40 -om\n\n\nand got:\n\n\n3ds2mgf: unexpected EOF\n\n\nseems like an end-of-file error has to do with a linux vs windows \nproblem, but on the webpage John mentioned he also used the DR version \nof 3ds2mgf.  Any ideas whats causing this error?\n\n\nI would like to the try the obj2mesh approach as well but am not sure \nhow to get an obj file from my autoCAD 3d model.\n\n\nNow stepping back just so I understand, I'm guessing you need to use \nobj2mesh or the 3ds2mgf because these will generate the A2 thru A10 \nparameters required by tmesh.cal.  On that website it gives this example \nof .rad data created by 3ds2mgf.\n\n\nWOOD texfunc T-nor\n4 dx dy dz tmesh.cal\n0\n10 0\n-0.00163623 0.00042471 1.21556195\n0.00738964 -0.00120012 -0.94298270\n0.00000000 0.00000000 -0.00000000\n\n\nwhere A2 thru A10 is the surface normal perturbation matrix - I have no \nclue what this is or how to generate it.  Because couldn't I also just \napply this modifier to the polygons I want to smooth if I could create \nthe necessary tmesh.cal matrix.  Do the polygons have to be triangles or \ncould I just apply this as a modifier to my .rad file created with \nradout (assuming I have a correct matrix).\n\n\n....an hour later.....Well, I just saw Peter and Greg's responses.  I'm \nguessing that I can not just apply it to my polygons in my radout rad \nfile cause there are no normals...but can't the normal be determined \nfairly easily as the cross product of this sides of the polygon?  Do you \nreally need to define each surface normal when the surface vertices are \ndefined?  Is it just a more expensive calculation?\n\n\nI hope my confusion makes sense.\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nStaff Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nwww.archenergy.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------030304080303080607090905\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\">\n  <title></title>\n</head>\n<body>\nHi Rob,<br>\n<br>\nThanks for the input! &nbsp;I had seen that webpage before, I guess I was hoping\nI didn't have to export to obj or 3ds from my CAD file, although that really\nshouldn't be too difficult.<br>\n<br>\nSo, I took one of my objects I wanted to smooth and exported it as a 3ds\nfile. &nbsp;I use AutoCAD 2000 and could not see any way to export as an obj file.\n&nbsp;Anyways, my 3ds seemed to generate fine. &nbsp;And so I ran:<br>\n<br>\n3ds2mgf entry_roof.3ds entry_roof.mgf -s40 -om<br>\n<br>\nand got:<br>\n<br>\n3ds2mgf: unexpected EOF<br>\n<br>\nseems like an end-of-file error has to do with a linux vs windows problem,\nbut on the webpage John mentioned he also used the DR version of 3ds2mgf.\n&nbsp;Any ideas whats causing this error?<br>\n<br>\nI would like to the try the obj2mesh approach as well but am not sure how\nto get an obj file from my autoCAD 3d model.<br>\n<br>\nNow stepping back just so I understand, I'm guessing you need to use obj2mesh\nor the 3ds2mgf because these will generate the A2 thru A10 parameters required\nby tmesh.cal. &nbsp;On that website it gives this example of .rad data created\nby 3ds2mgf.<br>\n<br>\n     <font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">WOOD texfunc T-nor<br>\n     4 dx dy dz tmesh.cal<br>\n     0<br>\n     10 0<br>\n     -0.00163623 0.00042471 1.21556195<br>\n     0.00738964 -0.00120012 -0.94298270<br>\n     0.00000000 0.00000000 -0.00000000</font><br>\n<br>\nwhere A2 thru A10 is the surface normal perturbation matrix - I have no clue\nwhat this is or how to generate it. &nbsp;Because couldn't I also just apply this\nmodifier to the polygons I want to smooth if I could create the necessary\ntmesh.cal matrix. &nbsp;Do the polygons have to be triangles or could I just apply\nthis as a modifier to my .rad file created with radout (assuming I have a\ncorrect matrix).<br>\n<br>\n....an hour later.....Well, I just saw Peter and Greg's responses. &nbsp;I'm guessing\nthat I can not just apply it to my polygons in my radout rad file cause there\nare no normals...but can't the normal be determined fairly easily as the\ncross product of this sides of the polygon? &nbsp;Do you really need to define\neach surface normal when the surface vertices are defined? &nbsp;Is it just a\nmore expensive calculation?<br>\n<br>\nI hope my confusion makes sense.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nZack<br>\n<br>\n<pre class=\"moz-signature\" cols=\"$mailwrapcol\">-- \nZack Rogers\nStaff Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\n<a class=\"moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" href=\"http://www.archenergy.com\">www.archenergy.com</a></pre>\n<br>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n--------------030304080303080607090905--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001340.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "December 17, 2003 at 12:08AM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001335", "id": "radiance-general_001340"}
