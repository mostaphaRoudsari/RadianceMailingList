{"body": "There's no way to get a solid angle associated with a sample in rtrace, \nbecause there is no image plane.  That's what Peter was saying.  A \nvalue of zero would have to be given, which would have to be treated \nspecially by the handling .cal file.\n\n\nExcept for perspective view rays, we'd probably always be giving a \nsolid angle of zero.  The vast majority of rays in a rendering are \nsecondary rays, which have reflected one or more time from various \nsurfaces, making solid angle problematic to track, if not impossible.  \nWhat is the solid angle of an ambient ray?  A source ray?  You see what \nI'm driving at.  (Parallel views also cannot have solid angle \nassociated with rays.)\n\n\nEven if we made solid angle available under the rare circumstances \nwhere it made sense and we knew it, what would you do with it?  It's \nnot like you're going to resample your texture on the fly in a .cal \nfile.  What would you do?  When I first considered this problem (many \nyears ago), I decided that ray distance from the origin was as good a \nmeasure as any for driving these sorts of approximations, so that's why \nyou have access to T.  If you've tried it and it really can't work for \nyou, then is the time to start looking at alternatives.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001345.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 17, 2003 at 08:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001335", "id": "radiance-general_001345"}
