{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks for your explanation about the weights for computing luminance. \nThat has helped.\n\n\nNow, our next problem deals with the exposure value:\n\n\nIf you use rview on the octree, trace returns among other values a \nluminance value. As far as we understand the octree should be free of \nany image processing stuff, like exposure values. So, we regard this \nluminance value as a reflection of the reading of a photometer.\n\n\nIf we then use ximage on the picture, generated from the very same \noctree, we read the very same luminance value as under rview, even \nthough getinfo returns an exposure value (Note, we have not set any \nexposure values in rpict and pfilt (apart from the default values).\nAccording to the luminance equation and other notes, one should actually \ndivide each radiance value by the exposure value, or divide the \nluminance reading by the exposure value.\n\n\nSo, which luminance reading is the 'right' one in ximage? The one \nreturned from the image or the one that one obtains by dividing the \nreturned one by the exposure value?\n\n\nAnd how do I avoid any exposure setting or correction when producing a \npicture (radiance picture that is)?\n\n\nTHanks for all your help in the hectic pre-christmas time.......\n\n\nalexa and marina\n=dumb and dumber   :-)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001343.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alexa I.
