Where it comes from is the user's problem. :^)\nHaven't looked at the code which parses the input lines, but I'm sure it \ncould be modified to handle an optional 7th datum before the newline. \nIts absence would indicate an inifinitesimal solid angle, which is what \nrtrace assumes right now. That should cater to backward compatibility.\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
