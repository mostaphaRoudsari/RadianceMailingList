{"body": "Hey John,\n\n\nYes, NFS is just a big nasty mess to deal with.\n\n\nIt looks like there was some funny configuration going on on the OS X \nclient/server only setup. It would be worth taking another pass at \ntrying to identify what is going on in this configuration.\n\n\nFor OS X to linux NFS server, I think that you will need to determine \nhow to set which nfs protocol version is used (2 or 3) for each system. \nAdditionally you have to have statd running on both the client and \nserver for locking to work. Further you will have to determine what \nswitches need to be set on the OS X to enforce synchronous read/writes.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nJohn S.
