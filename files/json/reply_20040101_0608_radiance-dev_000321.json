It\nlooks like Greg happened to check in his latest changes just\nafter this happened, so you don't have the most current version\n(the code containing the above line is now in a seperate file).\n\n\nI just integrated the new stuff with the SCons build system, and\neverything compiles fine here. It will all be in the HEAD dump\ntomorrow (really now! ;).\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000321.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 01, 2004 at 06:08AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000320", "id": "radiance-dev_000321"}
