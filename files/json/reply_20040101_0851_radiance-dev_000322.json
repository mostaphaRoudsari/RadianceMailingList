{"body": "Thanks, Schorsch for pointing that out.  I try not to check in anything \nafter midnight, but that's California time!\n\n\nIf you want to see the latest, you can always go directly to the source \npages Peter has so lovingly arranged for us:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/\n\n\nThere you can always see the changes and download the latest, without \nrelying on the nightly dump.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  A \"rule of thumb\" on check-ins is that they should always \ncompile.  I obviously messed up on that check-in, then messed up again \nby telling everyone to go grab it!!  (Sorry about that.)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000322.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 01, 2004 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000320", "id": "radiance-dev_000322"}
