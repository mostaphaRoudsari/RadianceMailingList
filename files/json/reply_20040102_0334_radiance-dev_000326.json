I have now installed Python and SCons. Whats the next step?\n\n\n\n\nThe best information can be found in the SCons documentation.\n http://scons.sourceforge.net/doc/HTML/scons-man.html\n\n\nHere's a brief summary:\nIn all cases, you need a console window and to change to\nthe \"ray\" directory of the Radiance sources.\nThen the simplest invocation (assuming Scons is installed so\nthat it gets found on the %PATH%) is just typing:\n\n\n  scons\n\n\nwhich will build everything. If the \"scons.bat\" file wasn't installed\non your %PATH%, then you can feed its *.py sibling to Python:\n\n\n  python \"x:\\where\\ever\\is\\scons.py\"\n\n\nYou can give arguments to specify individual targets or directories\nto get built:\n\n\n  scons src\\rt\\rtrace.lib\n  scons src\\lib\n\n\nTo remove all previously generated files involved in building a target\nuse the -c option:\n\n\n  scons -c\n\n\nThere are several configuration options in our build, which will be\nremembered for future invocations. The general form is:\n\n\n  scons opt=val\n\n\nThe -h option will give you a list of what's available.\n\n\nThe os specific configuration files are located in ray/platform/.\nIn your case the file \"win32.cfg\" will be used. Don't modify those,\nbecause they'll be replaced when you update your sources. If you\nwant to make any changes (you shouldn't need to), then you can\ncreate a copy named \"win32_custom.cfg\" and modify that. SCons will\nprefer the xxx_custom name for a platform if it exists.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000326.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 02, 2004 at 03:34AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000316", "id": "radiance-dev_000326"}
