{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks, I am rerunning the process to see what happens. I will note \nthat, although I have successfully rendered this scene before, it is \nwith an older version of Radiance (probably somewhere between 3.4 and \n3.5 in vintage), so it sound's like this could likely be something \ncompletely unrelated to the source routines. There are a limited number \nof lights in the scene, so I do not believe that this would be a problem.\n\n\nAs a side note. Would it be possible to have the routine(s) ecalloc and \nothers report the name of the .cal that a process dies on, if indeed \nthis is the problem?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000330.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 02, 2004 at 02:42PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000329", "id": "radiance-dev_000330"}
