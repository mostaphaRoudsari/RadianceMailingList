{"body": "Regarding the problems I am having with simple room rendering, I have \nzipped and placed all the .rad, .mat, and control files at the same \naddress (http://homepage.mac.com/jsan).\n\n\nAlso, I finished rendering another image of a room twice the size of \nthe original (13'-6 x 27') and with 18 bare bulbs.  This time, there is \na weird moir\u00e9-like effect in the rendering.  All of the parameters \nwere, for the most part, identical to the previous case (the only \nchanges were that I upped the -y parameter to 1024 to account for the \nlarger room).\n\n\nAny ideas as to what is going wrong?\n\n\n\n\nJohn An\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001375.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John S.
