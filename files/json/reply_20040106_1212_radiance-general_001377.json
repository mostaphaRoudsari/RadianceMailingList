{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nI don't really have time right now to look at your input files, but it \nseems that your problems are associated with the light source sampling. \n  Specifically, the original image with the single fixture seems to have \nsome kind of geometry in front of it, which is going to cause \nrandomness in the shadows produced.  You should either get rid of this \nbit of geometry (looks like three vanes of a fan) or use an illum \nwithout such obstructions in front of it.\n\n\nIn the second case where you have many sources, what you are seeing is \nthe result of the direct jitter.  If you set -dj 0 these artifacts \nshould disappear.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001377.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2004 at 12:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000593", "id": "radiance-general_001377"}
