Anytime you change \nthe rendering parameters you have to delete the ambient cache.  Rad does \nthis for you automatically.  My guess is that you didn't do that, so \nthere's the reason for both the speedy rendering and the negligible \ndifference in image quality avan after doubling your ambient parameters.\n\n\nSo no, as I understand it, an ambient file seeded under lower quality \nsettings will not improve when you re-run with higher settings.  You \nmust start over.\n\n\nAs for the splotchies, maybe some more detail about your model would \nhelp us troubleshoot that, or maybe a sample image?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001378.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 06, 2004 at 03:35PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001376", "id": "radiance-general_001378"}
