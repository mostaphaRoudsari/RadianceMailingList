Unfortunately, you cannot reuse an \nambient file in this manner where you progressively refine the \nparameters and thus refine the ambient data. Generally, if you change \nthe ambient parameters then you need to start off with a fresh ambient \nfile. The one note here is that it is possible to \"relax\" certain of the \nparameters after first doing an overture calculation to fill the ambient \ncache. The -aa, -ad and -as parameters can be reduced after the overture \ncalculation. For example, just looking at the ambient parameters:\n\n\npass 0 (overture)\n-ab 2 -ar 200 -ad 4096 -as 2048 -aa .15\n\n\npass 1\n-ab 2 -ar 200 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -aa .25\n\n\nNote that the overture calculation is performed by running rpict on a \nsmall image size (64x64 for example) and discarding the image output. \nThe point is to populate the ambient file with data. Rendering with \nRadiance has further information on this in John Mardaljevic's chapter \n(6) on Daylighting Simulation.\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\nFitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n\n\n> I rendered a series of images with -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 52 -af  \n> file.amb (taking many hours to render)\n> They came out splotchy, so I increased -ad 4096 -as 2048 -ar  200 -af \n> file.amb (building upon the same data)\n>  I expected it to take quite a while to render, but they took ~ 5 to \n> 10 minutes and I saw no real improvement\n> my question is the nature of the ambient file..\n> If I start it with a lower quality, can I improve it?
