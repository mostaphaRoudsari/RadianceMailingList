{"body": "Rob, \n\n\nOh so familiar! Rob's comment on using mkillum is right, I think. It\nlooks like you have no direct sources - primary or secondary -\ncontributing to the illumination of surfaces visible in the scene. You\nshould be able to achieve far better results with lower ad's ab's etc.\n\n\nPlease someone correct me, I'm speculating much of the following: \n\n\nThe ambient resolution (ar) corresponds to the typical spacing of\ncalculated ambient values (octree size/ar for their approximate spacing,\nand the size of resulting splotches). \n\n\nIn corners, sploches arise where two adjacent values do not adequately\nrepresent the soft gradation into the corner - hence the too dark/too\nlight splotches. This suggests upping the ar value. The aa works as a\nkind of refinement toggle, forcing additional samples when the\ndifference between adjacent ambient is greater than a factor of aa. \n\n\nSplotches occurring arbitrarily, for instance the one in the foreground\njust to the right of the wall, suggest inaccuracies in the ambient\ncalculation, most likely because of insufficient samples - therefore\nmore ad's and as's may be necessary. However I think random sampling\nfalls down without a direct source at least one, maybe two bounces away\nfrom visible surfaces. \n\n\nEvery project seems to generate a new problem. I'm constantly trying to\nfigure Radiance out. \n\n\n\n\nBruce Sounes\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001384.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bruce Sounes", "created_at": "January 07, 2004 at 01:54PM", "created_by": "Bruce_Sounes", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001376", "id": "radiance-general_001384"}
