Not knowing the\nsource\ncode I can't tell what type of variables/math Radiance uses.  But if\nyou can\ncombine a two step 32bit operation into a single 64bit operation then\nyou can\ngain significant performance improvements.\n\n\n> There are many elements in a program that can be either 32 or\n> 64 bits wide (or any other size).

Radiance isn't using\n64bit words\nand won't benefit from 64bit math.\n\n\nThanks,\nFerdinand\n\n\n\n\nFerdinand Schmid\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\nCelebrating over 20 Years of Improving Building Energy Performance\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000336.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ferdinand Schmid", "created_at": "January 08, 2004 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "Ferdinand_Schmid", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000334", "id": "radiance-dev_000336"}
