{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nThat did the trick.  The geometry above the luminaire was the cable \nwhich would suspend it.  I simply removed it, and all seems fine now.  \nI feel so stupid, I spent an entire week increasing the -ad parameter \nand not getting anywhere.\n\n\nFor my purposes, it is ok to remove the cables at this point from the \nmodel.  However, for suspended light fixtures, it doesn't seem possible \nto ever create an illum that would encompass everything including the \ncables without having the illum sphere touch up against the ceiling.  \nThis would be more for indirect fixtures than for direct fixtures.  If \nI needed to keep the suspension cables in the model, what would be the \nmost proper way of defining the light source?\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan 6, 2004, at 3:12 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001388.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John S.
