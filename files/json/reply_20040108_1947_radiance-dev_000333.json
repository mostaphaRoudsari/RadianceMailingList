I \nthink it was a problem with sed, but I never figured out why. I vaguely \nremember sed generated the makefile fine from the commandline, but not \nfrom the configure script -- VERY weird. I ended up doing it the hard \nway, i.e. manually. You might wanna try a newer libtiff and pray it's \nstill compatible with RADIANCE. In any case, future RADIANCE releases \nshould definitely upgrade to a current(ish) libtiff.\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
