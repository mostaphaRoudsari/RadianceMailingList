{"body": "Thanks Greg and Georg,\n\n\nThis is the type of information I was hoping to receive.  Many of Zack's\nsimulations take several days to complete (on our current dual AthlonMP\n1.8 GHz\nsystems).  I wanted to identify options to improve performance.  For\nsome type\nof analyses (e.g. some of our CFD work) it makes sense to use 64bit\ncode to\nmore efficiently fit the problems into memory and to improve the math.\n\n\nApparently Radiance problems are not the best fit for a 64bit platform\nat this\ntime.  We may be better off with a small cluster of high clock speed\n32bit\nsystems. \n\n\nThanks again for taking the time to guide us with your expert insight,\nFerdinand\n\n\n--On Friday, January 09, 2004 09:06:20 AM -0800 Greg Ward\n<gward@lmi.net> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000339.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ferdinand Schmid", "created_at": "January 09, 2004 at 11:01AM", "created_by": "Ferdinand_Schmid", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000334", "id": "radiance-dev_000339"}
