I \nbelieve Visarc Jack uses dual CPU machines and keeps all his rpiece \nsimulations limited to the two CPUs in any one box, after trying many \ntimes do get good results across a cluster.  John An recently reported \nsome difficulty as well with this.\n\n\nI'm not saying it cannot be done, simply that a lot of very experienced \npeople on this list have seemingly given up on making big clusters run \nrpiece without error.  But if you're bringing your dual CPU machine to \nits knees already, perhaps it's worth a look.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this advice, since I only have a rudimentary \nunderstanding of rpiece and the NFS problems.  I just thought I'd bring \nit up.  I'd love to hear success stories with this issue...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000340.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 09, 2004 at 01:21PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000334", "id": "radiance-dev_000340"}
