If we can pick out only a dozen\nof those to know where to look for bottlenecks, then that sounds\nvery promising!\n\n\nOf course, we need to find a collection of scenes where each one\ntriggers one of those bottlenecks. That might actually be\nsomething to put into the standard test suite...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000343.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 10, 2004 at 04:42PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000334", "id": "radiance-dev_000343"}
