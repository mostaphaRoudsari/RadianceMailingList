{"body": "Hi Daniel,\n\n\n>My question is this.

Rather than \nmeasuring a sample in the real world and defining it in Radiance, you \ncould probably find the glazing in this database and use Optics 5 to \ndefine it.\n\n\n>\n>I presume also that transmittance + reflectance (+ absorptance) of \n>glazing can never exceed 1.  In Desktop Radiance, the description of \n>Generic clear glass lbnl (clear3.rad) states a transmittance of \n>89.90% and a reflection of 82.0%.  Is my understanding fundementally \n>wrong, or is this a typo?\n>  \n>\nI've always been a little confused how desktop radiance defines glass.  \nThe front RGB reflectance is actually defined with this line under \n\"clear3_front\"\n\n\n0.07428    0.08322    0.08556\n\n\nand the back RGB reflectance is defined with this line under \"clear3_back\"\n\n\n0.07567    0.08418    0.08538\n\n\nSo the reflectances are roughly 8% which does obey the rule.\n\n\nI am not completely clear what the other RGB values are but my guess is \nthat they modify the transmittivity defined under clear3_glass somehow.  \nWhenever I've manually defined glass I've used this form (from \n\"glazing.cal\") instead, its just a little clearer to me.\n\n\nmod BRTDfunc my_glazing\n    10    rrho    grho    brho\n        rtau    gtau    btau\n        0    0    0\n        glazing.cal\n    0\n    18    0    0    0\n        0    0    0\n        0    0    0\n        FRRHO    FGRHO    FBRHO\n        BRRHO    BGRHO    BBRHO\n        RTAU    GTAU    BTAU\n\n\n    where:\n        FRRHO    FGRHO    FBRHO    is front normal spectral reflectance\n        BRRHO    BGRHO    BBRHO    is back normal spectral reflectance\n        RTAU    GTAU    BTAU    is normal spectral transmittance\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\nZack\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nStaff Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nwww.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001395.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "January 14, 2004 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001394", "id": "radiance-general_001395"}
