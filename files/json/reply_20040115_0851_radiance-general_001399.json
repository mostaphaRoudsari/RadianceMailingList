{"body": "A minor point.  Unless they changed the laws of physics since I was in \ncollege, transmittance has to be the same for a surface seen from the \nfront as seen from the back.  This is called Helmholtz reciprocity, and \nis one of the basic tenets of reflection theory.  Total (hemispherical) \ntransmittance must be the same, and specular (directional) \ntransmittance must be the same in every direction.  It has to do with \nthe time-reversibility of light, I think.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001399.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 15, 2004 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001394", "id": "radiance-general_001399"}
