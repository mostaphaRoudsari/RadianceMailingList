{"body": "Hey Greg,\n\n\nYou may be right, I've wrestled with this quite a few times.  That was \nexactly my line of thinking until we got a composite translucent ceiling \nmaterial measured with an integrating sphere and it resulted in a \nsignificantly different transmittance from the front the the back.  I \nthink for a single surface this is exactly true (ie. a low-e film or a \nsingle pane of glass) but for a composition I think it can vary \nslightly.  Like a one-way mirror?  And using the example of a pane of \nglass with a low-e coating.  It seems like light striking that low-e \nsurface from air's index of refraction could behave differently than \nlight striking the surface from the glass's index of refraction. \n Atleast thats how I justify it to myself....\"do I lie to myself to be \nhappy?\"  But it also doesn't have to break the conservation of light \nlaws, I don't think.  As an example, say of the light striking the low-e \nside of the composition, 70% transmits, 20% reflects, and 10% absorbs. \n Then of the light striking the glass side of the composition say 75% \ntransmits, 15% reflects, and 10% absorbs.  In both situations 100% of \nlight is accounted for.  I am completely unsure on this issue.  Can \nanyone help explain?\n\n\nThanks for correcting and/or questioning my response Greg.\nZack\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nStaff Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001401.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "January 15, 2004 at 12:36PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001394", "id": "radiance-general_001401"}
