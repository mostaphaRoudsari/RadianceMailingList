Since there is a fair bit=20=\n\n\nof discussion on precise measurement of transmission and reflection=20\nproperties, this might be a good opportunity to check about Radiance=20\nhandling of glazing with the greater wisdom out there.\n\n\nOk so as my limited understanding has it:\n\n\nrefractive index: in Radiance this is only used for tracing 'view rays'=20=\n\n\n- (so that we see a view refracted through the glazing) but that the=20\nlight is transmitted through and cast into the space is unaffected.=20\nWhen tracing a ray back towards a direct source, such as the sun - if=20\nit were refracted it would be deflected and might miss a small target=20\nsource.\n\n\n(hmmm, might create some surreal situations - suppose we are standing=20\nin a space and could just see a refracted sun through the edge of the=20\nwindow but the line on the floor indicates we are standing in shadow.)\nProbably the most common example where refraction of direct sources=20\nmight be visually important would be glass bricks.\n\n\nI think refractive index also does not apply when tracing rays as part=20=\n\n\nof the indirect calculation - even though missing a large area source=20\n(sky) is not likely to be a problem.\n\n\nReflectance - in atria there are likely to be complex and multiple=20\nglazing surfaces - eg the roof and then in large areas along the=20\noffices lining the edge. The intricate reflections may be visible in=20\nthe scene, but specular reflections from the glazing (or anything else)=20=\n\n\nwill not contribute to illuminance levels in the atrium - unless=20\nspecified as secondary sources (ie generate 'virtual' sources). This is=20=\n\n\nnot going to handle anything other than smooth flat surfaces (eg not=20\nwater).\n\n\n(Daniel - this may have relevance for your work) it does not include=20\nthe contribution of indirect sources eg bright overcast skies are not=20\ngoing to be specularly reflected around the atrium. The Radiance=20\nindirect calculation essentially deals with diffuse-diffuse pathways=20\nonly.\n\n\nOk so does that mean specs and functions for reflectance changing with=20=\n\n\nangle of incidence are going to effect the appearance of the scene=20\nvisible in the glazing, the light transmitted, but not the light=20\nreflected?\n\n\nAnd what about direct sunlight and diffusing glass? Is the light=20\ntransmitted - or does the random scattering cause the same problem as=20\nrefraction about missing the target when tracing the ray backwards?\n\n\nAnyway synthetic images of what we see in these types of scenes - with=20=\n\n\nall those glossy hard surfaces and intricate multiple reflection of sky=20=\n\n\nsources etc. - may be substantially different to what the walls, floor=20=\n\n\netc 'see'.\n\n\nwell hope this is right - i await heavy editing/ comments.\ncheers\nalex\n\n\n*******************************************************\nA.

Some of these\nwere actually measure by me and looking back on it, I would prefer to\nmeasure the \"pvb\" materials under a more precise protocol than I did\noriginally (again Rob G. would be the real resource here). I would\nthink that the tool could be extended to account for many things that\ncan be exported from Optics 5. Perhaps the Optics 5 group might be\ninterested in having Greg develop a more robust solution for what gets\nexported from Optics 5 to account for a more sophisticated model of\nangular dependance and other properties?\n\n\n\n\nWell, all in all probably more confusion that clarity.\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsecondly, what does this do to the transmittance?=A0 physically, the\ntransmittance going one way should be the same as the transmittance\ngoing the other way.=A0 should the (rtrns, gtrns, btrns) variables then\nbe the same for both front and back panes?=A0 or does it not matter, as\nlong as the product of their transmittances is equal to that of the\ncombination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is true for a symetric glass composition (ie. single pane no\nlow-e, double pane, clear, no low-e) but not true for non-symetric\nglass which is often the case for glass with low-e and glass with one\nof the panes tinted.=A0 I believe the front and back transmittance is\nalways really close, (ie. it can't be 10% in one direction and 90% in\nthe other) but they can vary slightly.=A0 This is what desktop radiance\nand optics 5 definition method allows you to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinally, there are no functions built in.=A0 that means that there is no\ndependence on angle of incidence for either transmittance or\nreflectance.=A0 this is unrealistic, as transmittance generally reduces\nand reflectance generally increases with increasing angle of incidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do think Desktop Radiance and Optics 5 both make use of the angular\ntransmittance function.=A0 This is part of the glass primitive.=A0 And =\nin\nmy example, the BRTDFunc calls glazing.cal which provides the angular\ntransmittance function.=A0 Also, from my comparisions a while ago now,\nthe two methods gave me identical results.=A0 That is:\n\n\n\n\nvoid glass=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 clear3_glass\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n3=A0=A0=A0 0.92189=A0=A0=A0 0.98612=A0=A0=A0 0.972\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 void =\nBRTDfunc=A0=A0=A0 clear3_front\n\n\n10=A0=A0 =A0=A0 0.84636=A0=A0=A0 0.90553=A0=A0=A0 0.89251=A0=A0 =A0=A0 =\n0.07428=A0=A0=A0 0.08322=A0=A0=A0\n0.08556=A0=A0 =A0=A0 0 0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0 .=A0=A0 0\n\n\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n=A0 void BRTDfunc=A0=A0=A0 clear3_back=A0=A0 10\n\n\n=A0=A0 0.84636=A0=A0=A0 0.90553=A0=A0=A0 0.89251\n\n\n=A0=A0 0.07567=A0=A0=A0 0.08418=A0=A0=A0 0.08538\n\n\n=A0=A0 0 0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0 .=A0=A0 0\n\n\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc clear3_glass\n\n\n=A0=A0 10=A0=A0=A0 rrho=A0=A0=A0 grho=A0=A0=A0 brho\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 rtau=A0=A0=A0 gtau=A0=A0=A0 btau\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 glazing.cal\n\n\n=A0=A0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0 18=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0=A0=A0=A0 0\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 0.07428=A0=A0=A0 0.08322=A0=A0=A0 0.08556\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 0.07567=A0=A0=A0 0.08418=A0=A0=A0 0.08538\n\n\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 0.84636=A0=A0=A0 0.90553=A0=A0=A0 0.89251\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you might want to check out glass1.cal and glass2.cal which is\npart of the newest HEAD radiance release.=A0 It just distinguishes\nbetween single pane and double pane which have different angular\ndependance functions.=A0 Also, check out glaze.csh in the latest\nrelease, I was just informed of this and have not checked it out\npersonally, but I understand it helps create these definitions.\n\n\n\n\nSo, I think the BRTDFunc methods can provide greater accuracy than the\nglass primitive.\n\n\n\n\nI hope I have not mistated any of this, anyone please correct me if so.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nZack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\n\n\n\n\n<color><param>0000,0000,EEEE</param>Radiance-general@radiance-online.org</=\ncolor>=20\n\n\n\n\n<color><param>0000,0000,EEEE</param>http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman=\n/listinfo/radiance-general</color>=20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<fixed>--=20\n\n\n#       John E. de Valpine\n\n\n#       president\n\n\n#\n\n\n#       visarc incorporated\n\n\n#       =\n<color><param>0000,0000,EEEE</param>http://www.visarc.com</color>\n\n\n#\n\n\n#       channeling technology for superior design and =\nconstruction</fixed>\n\n\n\n\n=20\n\n\n</excerpt>=\n\n\n--Apple-Mail-1--686586292--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001406.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "alex Summerfield", "created_at": "January 16, 2004 at 12:49PM", "created_by": "alex_Summerfield", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001394", "id": "radiance-general_001406"}
