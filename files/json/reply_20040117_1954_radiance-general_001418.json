{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nSome more on the topic... I found that one problem with vrml from \nmgf2inv is that coordinated in the generated vrml file are written in \nexponential writing ( e.g. +1.23456e+1), while formZ doesn't accept \nthat. I don't know who is not vrml-1 conform here... There are not many \nbrowsers able to view vrml-1 in our days, too, so the format itself is \na problem. I also didn't find open source converters from inventor to \nother cad file formats. So at the moment, the idea to generate cad \nfiles from radiance models is impossible for me. The only way that \nmight still work is renderpark, a renderer able to read mgf (and afaik \nto write vrml), and the xrml library's converters from the same author \n(P. Bekaert). However I was not able to get one of these packages to \nwork on my Mac OS X machine, and as I am working together with people \nusing Mac OS, Solaris and Linux installations, this is necessary for me.\n\n\nDo you think developing a vrml-2 output (or maybe an .obj export) for \nmgf would be hard to do, or would it be a smaller task to enhanve the \nmgf2inv converter? Is there anyone else who had to bring radiance \nscenes to a 3d-format?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
