My solution was to edit the RMakefile\nin src/px to link to the existing system libraries. This was as\nsimple as:\n\n\n186c186\n< ra_tiff:      ra_tiff.o ../lib/libtiff.a\n\n\n> ra_tiff:      ra_tiff.o /usr/lib/libtiff.a\n189c189\n< ../common/tiff.h ../common/tiffio.h:  ../lib/libtiff.a\n\n\n> ../common/tiff.h ../common/tiffio.h:  /usr/lib/libtiff.a\n193c193\n< normtiff:     normtiff.o ../lib/libtiff.a\n\n\n> normtiff:     normtiff.o /usr/lib/libtiff.a\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001422.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "January 19, 2004 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000643", "id": "radiance-general_001422"}
