{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nThank You for the link, but they have only binaries there, and none for \nMac OS or Linux, so I cannot use it. I wrote them a message asking if \nthey will give sources or maybe a java port in future, as this would be \nquite a useful tool. However, your mail gives me the hope that the \nvrml-files generated with mgf2inv are at least readable with some \nvrml-1 tools, so maybe I will find some way ;-)\n\n\nHow nice a vrml-output would fit into the real-time thread, wouldn't \nit...? I mean there are vrml- and x3d-browsers able to use opengl \nhardware for displaying shaded triangles.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
