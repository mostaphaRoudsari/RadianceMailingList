{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThere is a tool for converting inventor files to VRML1 and 2 called\nivToVRML.\nOn SGIs with inventor this is installed by default.\nFortunately there is a GPL version of Inventor from Systems in Motion\nthat can be compiled on Macs, Unix and Win32 called Coin which you can\ndownload\nin source code from http://www.coin3d.org/\nUnfortunately there are no sources for ivToVRML in Coin.\nThe sources for ivToVRML you can find as part of the example files of\nTGS Inventor at\nftp://ftp.tgs.com/OpenInventor/common/oiv25_common.tar.Z\nIn the directory tree under\nOpenInventor2.5\\src\\tools\\ivtovrml\nAfter some minor modifications this can be compiled with the coin library.\nivToVRML supports VRML1 and VRML2 output.\nI have successully used it to convert files from rad2mgf|mgf2inv\nto VRML1 and VRML2 that can be loaded for example in Cortona.\nmgf2inv ignors the new mesh primitiv and more complex materials like BRTDFs\nbut works\nwell for basic geometry and materials.\n\n\n\n\nBernhard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001421.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernhard Spanlang", "created_at": "January 19, 2004 at 01:40PM", "created_by": "Bernhard_Spanlang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001374", "id": "radiance-general_001421"}
