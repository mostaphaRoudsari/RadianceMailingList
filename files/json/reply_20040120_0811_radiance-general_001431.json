{"body": "Please, as a favor to myself and Rob and the other authors, who spent \nmonths developing the material for RwR, do not purchase an online copy \nfrom some third party who has no right to sell it.  You are only \nhelping to make thieves richer.  If you desperately need a section from \nthe book, I will send it to you.  Otherwise, please wait until the book \nis available again in a month or so.\n\n\nThis time around, we will be splitting the profits from book sales to \nall of the coauthors, so everyone stands to make a little money off it. \n  We expect it to be very little, as there simply isn't that much left \nover after printing and distribution costs, but it will be something.\n\n\nThanks.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001431.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 20, 2004 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001426", "id": "radiance-general_001431"}
