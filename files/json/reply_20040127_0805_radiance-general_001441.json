{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThis is what you want:\n\n\nvoid brightfunc trans_mod\n2 1-.6667/Rdot .\n0\n0\n\n\ntrans_mod trans surf_dens\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\n\nThe modifier will alter the specular transmission, and the trans has no  \ndiffuse component or specular reflection.  The reason transfunc didn't  \nwork for you was because the specularity you can modify is only used  \nfor light sources in that material.  You could use BRDTfunc, but the  \nabove is simpler.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 27, 2004 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001437", "id": "radiance-general_001441"}
