However, There \n*is* a way to animate your sun, simply using rpict and some shell \nscripting.  John Mardaljevic's script in \"Rendering with Radiance\" is a \nprime example. The basic idea is that you set up a for-each loop for \neach timeslice you want to render.  John's script plugs the variable \ninto the time parameter for gensky.  Alternately you could feed the \nvariable to sed to directly modify a sky.rad file.  That way, you could \nuse rad to produce the renderings.\n\n\nAlso, if you're primarily concerned with seeing the movement of the sun \npatch, a neat trick (again John M's idea) is to render the stills with \n-ab 0 and assign some decent -av so that you can at least see the rest \nof the space.  By eliminating the ambient calculation, your stills will \nrender ultra-quickly; you can be watching the sun path in minutes, \nrather than hours.  As Martha Stewart used to say, that's a Good Thing. \n  (These days, she says \"I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and \nnothing but the truth.\")  =8-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001440.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 27, 2004 at 10:12AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001439", "id": "radiance-general_001440"}
