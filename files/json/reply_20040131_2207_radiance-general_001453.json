If you have more than one process runing, one might delete\nthe sun.rad of another (though this may be an unlikely coincidence,\nit's still possible).\n\n\n> Where I'm telling the computer I want to create my sky starting \n> from 6:30 AM and every frame from then on will add = \u00bd hour.\n> \n> Now, if anyone can help me figure out a way to get a time stamp \n> on each frame, that would be great!\n\n\nCreate expressions to rename the file from <basename>frame.pic to\n<basename>timestamp.pic and append them to a file you can run as\na script after the rendering.\n\n\nThere might be a built-in solution, but this will work as well:\n\n\n#! /bin/bash\nframe=$1 \ntime=`ev \"6+(${frame}/2)\"`\ngensky 1 28 ${time} > sun_${frame}.rad\noconv -i scene.oct -f sun_${frame}.rad\nrm sun_${frame}.rad\n# create rename-cmds\necho \"mv /path/to/*_${frame}.pic /path/to/room_at_${time}.pic\" >> rename.sh\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001453.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 31, 2004 at 10:07PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001439", "id": "radiance-general_001453"}
