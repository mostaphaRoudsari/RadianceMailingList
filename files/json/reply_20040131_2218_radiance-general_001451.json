It's \nprobably hard to do fully automatic, as a \"good\" exposure depends on the \npart of the image you are interested in. I had glanced a bit at the \nproblem in May 2001 (the http://www.pab-opto.de/pers/animation/hist1.mpg \nanimation shows the histogram overlaid on the image), but haven't found \na generally nice method.\nPersonally I was surprised that my digital Nikon handles automatic \nexposures quite well, apparently a lot of engineering has gone into an \nintelligent guess as to what is imporant in an image. Similar algorithms \nplus (spline-based ?) interpolation may be very useful for automatic \nexposure settings in Radiance animations.\ncheers\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001451.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "January 31, 2004 at 10:18PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001449", "id": "radiance-general_001451"}
