Use this value for all the smaller images.\n\n\nI could send you an image of one of this combined renderings.\nI have no website to make it available to the group, though.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001452.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 31, 2004 at 10:29PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001449", "id": "radiance-general_001452"}
