{"body": "** Proprietary **\n\n\nThank you for the responses.  I see your point!  I'm having a hard\nenough time figuring out what part of the images I want to focus on\nmyself!  Getting the computer to auto expose would probably be pretty\ntough when you have both interior and exterior in an image.  What is the\nhistogram showing?\n\n\nWell I went through and manually computed my exposure values using\nrview and then interpolated the frames in between.  This was kind of\ntedious but it was enough to determine what I am calling \"good\" exposure\nvalues.  Now, it seems that RAD uses the exposure value to determine the\nambient value of the image, while RANIMATE uses the exposure value and\nsimply passes it on to pfilt.  Only rad will only accept one exposure\nvalue and the exposure file goes in ranimate...  which does not seem\nright considering all the frames are getting av .5 .5 .5 rather than a\nvalue appropriate to the frame's daylight condition.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\nmdelafuente@wmtao.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001459.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "February 02, 2004 at 04:08PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001449", "id": "radiance-general_001459"}
