{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI did not think that using the typical displacement map is the best \nsolution. My idea was taking a geometry as a surface modifier. The \nbasic functionality is provided by todays radiance: instances and the \nreplmarks program are doing almost what I want. If I don't replace \nevery triangle (like replmarks does) with an instance, but every face \nof a geometry, using the uv-values to place and rotate the instance, \nthen cutting this instance at the boundaries of the face, I have a \n3d-texture... or am I totally wrong here?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
