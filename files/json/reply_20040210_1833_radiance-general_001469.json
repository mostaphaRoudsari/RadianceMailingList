{"body": "Hi Jeffrey,\n\n\nIn fact, it's not a Cygwin problem.  It's due to something missing in \nthe key.fmt file.  I forgot to add the new -vo and -va view parameters \nto the list, so the format string didn't match any of the views \nproduced by rview.  Here is the corrected version, which works:\n\n\nrview -vtv -vp ${px} ${py} ${pz} -vd ${dx} ${dy} ${dz} -vu 0 0 1 -vh \n${vh} -vv ${vv} -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t ${t}\n\n\nI should have checked it before reposting the message -- I had the \nchance to correct my mistake, before!\n\n\nSorry,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001469.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 10, 2004 at 06:33PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001468", "id": "radiance-general_001469"}
