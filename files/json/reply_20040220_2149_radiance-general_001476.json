{"body": "Hi Alexa,\n\n\nThe latest version of pvalue (from the HEAD distribution) includes a \n-dF option to output byte-swapped floating point problems.  If your \nsource and destination machines have different byte orderings (little \nendian vs. big endian), then this might solve your problem.  You also \nshould apply the -H option (in addition to the -h option) to avoid \noutput of the image resolution string, which will likely mess up the \nreading of the data.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001476.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 20, 2004 at 09:49PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001475", "id": "radiance-general_001476"}
