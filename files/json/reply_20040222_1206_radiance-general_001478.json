Can anyone\n\n\nFirst information for Pov-Ray users:\n\n\n    You made it through the mirror!\n\n\nRadiance is based on a right-handed coordinate system.\n\n\nFor elevations this means:\n\n\nX points right\nY points into the screen and\nZ points up\n\n\nFor plan views:\n\n\nX points right\nY points up\nZ points out of the screen\n\n\n\n\nAbout the view vector:\n\n\nYou define views basically by giving the position of the\nobserver (viewpoint, -vp) in world coordinates and the\ndirection (not the point!) of his view (view direction, -vd).\nFor views, there is only the global coordinate system, so\nthe direction is given in dx, dy and dz of the global system.\n\n\nIf we picture a scene with a room centered at (0,0) and an\nobserver looking from east (10,0) into the room, his view\nvector is (-1,0). Another observer at (10,-3) has a vector\nof (-1,0.3). The view vector will be unified internally but\nto define it in \"rview\"/\"rvu\" you can enter any value you like.\n\n\n> here either point me towards documentation that\n> describes it or give me that crictical piece of\n> knowledge that makes it obvious to someonme who knows\n> alot of math?\n\n\nNo PhD needed to use it!\n\n\nI'm a bit out of touch and can't point you to URLs but\nthe Radiance home page and www.radiance-online.org will\nhave sections about documentation.\nSearch for the introduction of Ward/Shakespears book\n\"Rendering with Radiance\". The intro chapter is/was\navailable as pdf and contains a simple tutorial. You may\nhave to replace every occurence of \"rview\" with \"rvu\" \nsince the application was renamed recently. It depends\non where and when you got your Radiance distribution.\n\n\n> Thanks for your time,\n> Tyler Riddle\n\n\nBeautiful pictures,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001478.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 22, 2004 at 12:06PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001477", "id": "radiance-general_001478"}
