If you want to look at \nthe point (0,0,0) with the camera at (-1,2,-5)  the view vector \nis (1,-2,5). Don't forget the up-vecor, (0,1,0) or (0,0,1) should \nbe fine for the most cases (according to the orientation of your\nscene, Radiance uses rather (0,0,1) (gensky creates a z-upward \noriented sky), but if are more familiar with 3d-programs with y \nfor up, it might be easier to build scenes that way with (0,1,0).\n\n\nSabine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001479.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sabine Wolf", "created_at": "February 22, 2004 at 04:30PM", "created_by": "Sabine_Wolf", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001477", "id": "radiance-general_001479"}
