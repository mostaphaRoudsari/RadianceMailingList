{"body": "Hi Ling,\n\n\nThe smoothing functions of tmesh2rad and gensurf should work adequately \nwith all material types, including trans and trans2.  Prior to the 3.5 \nofficial release, there was a bug in the code that caused the surfaces \nto look wrong when viewed from the backside, but this was fixed about a \nyear ago.  If you are using Desktop Radiance or an older release of the \nsoftware, this could be your problem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001482.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 24, 2004 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001480", "id": "radiance-general_001482"}
