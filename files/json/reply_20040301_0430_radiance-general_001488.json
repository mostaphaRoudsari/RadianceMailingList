{"body": "Jack,\n\n\nJust the sound of BRDTfunc scared me off.  I'll have to have a closer \nlook at this material type.\n\n\nI apologize for resurrecting a previously discussed topic.  But my \nsearch (\"dichroic,\" \"multiple material,\" \"materials with multiple \nproperties,\" etc. on radiance-online, as well as \"dichroic brtdfunc\" on \ngoogle ) resulted in no useful results (that I found).  Do you have \nsome suggestions as to other search terms to find this past discussion?\n\n\nThanks for always responding so quickly.\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001488.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John An", "created_at": "March 01, 2004 at 04:30AM", "created_by": "John_An", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001486", "id": "radiance-general_001488"}
