{"body": "Hey John,\n\n\nMy apologies, although I seem to remember somebody somewhere talking \nabout dichoic glazing in radiance (albeit a long time ago), after having \nfollowed my own advice to check in the archives, I have not been able to \nfind anything. In any event, I think that something like BRTDfunc or \nperhaps transfunc will do what you want. Do you have any performance \ndata that you can share so people can get a better sense of the \nperformance characteristics of the material.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nJohn An wrote:\n\n\n> Jack,\n>\n> Just the sound of BRDTfunc scared me off.
