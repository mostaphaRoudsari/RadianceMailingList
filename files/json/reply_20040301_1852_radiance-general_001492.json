{"body": "Hi Guilio,\n\n\nThat is correct -- Radiance only finds virtual source objects using \nmirror or prism material types directly.  It doesn't even look if you \nhave a modifier in front of the material in the chain (e.g., you \nreference a pattern before the material).\n\n\nI recently made a change that allows Radiance to find ordinary sources \nwhen the source material is further down the modifier chain or \nalias'ed, but I didn't do this for virtual source materials, whose \nsurfaces must still be modified directly.  Actually, I should make the \nchange so aliases and intervening modifiers work properly with virtual \nsource material types -- there's no reason not to.   This still won't \nwork for mixtures, in any case.\n\n\nMixtures don't make a lot of sense for sources or virtual source \nmaterials the way Radiance is designed, in my opinion.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001492.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 01, 2004 at 06:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001486", "id": "radiance-general_001492"}
