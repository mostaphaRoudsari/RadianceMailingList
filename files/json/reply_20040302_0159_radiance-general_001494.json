{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nJudging from what you've said and the spec. sheet for dichroic film, \nthe BRTDfunc seems to be your best bet.  You can vary reflectance with \nangle and wavelength (RGB color) using any function or data you have.  \nSince we're just talking about the mirror and transmitted directions, \nthe BRTDfunc gives you complete control and should deliver accurate and \nefficient simulations.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 02, 2004 at 01:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001493", "id": "radiance-general_001494"}
