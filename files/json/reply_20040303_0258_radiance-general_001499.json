{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nThe \"major axis\" is the dominant component in the surface normal vector \n(the axis with the largest absolute value).  Since barycentric \ncoordinates are defined in two dimensions, I throw away the major axis \ndirection as it is the one most perpendicular to the plane of the \ntriangle, and I just use the other two.  This is no less accurate than \ndoing a fancy projection and a whole lot cheaper.\n\n\nThe functions defined in tmesh.h and tmesh.c in src/common/ should help \nyou out.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001499.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 03, 2004 at 02:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001498", "id": "radiance-general_001499"}
