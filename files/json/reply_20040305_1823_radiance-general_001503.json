For added fun, if we use a value of 1-4 pixels we get the \nfollowing: \"system - Out of memory in makemap: No such file or directory\".\n\n\nUsing values >= 5 for the legend height and/or width works just fine \nthough.  But even with just five pixels there's still a little sliver of \nblack along the left edge.  For truly legendless falsecolors, Peter's \nmodification is the way to go, or of course Greg's original solution \nworks too.\n\n\nIt'd be great if my modifications worked all the way down to zero. \nMaybe we could add a switch to make the legend optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001503.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 05, 2004 at 06:23PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001500", "id": "radiance-general_001503"}
