I only have the transmissivity value which is 4.4%.\n\n\nWelcome to trans, where the fun never ends.  Ben, the trans material is \none of the more confusing ones in the Radiance suite, I'm afraid.  It \nrequires seven different parameters, actually.  Do you have the \n\"Rendering with Radiance\" text?  There are some excellent formulas in \nthere for deriving the seven trans parameters.  Here they are, in case \nyou don't have the book:\n\n\nA7=Ts / ( Td+Ts )\nA6=( Td+Ts ) / ( Rd+Td+Ts )\nA5=Sr\nA4=Rs\nA3=Cb / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )\nA2=Cg / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )\nA1=Cr / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )\n\n\nWhere:\nThe red, green, and blue reflected components are Cr, Cg, and Cb. The \nphotopic average of the RGB is Rd.\n\n\nRs = Reflected specularity\n\n\nRs = surface roughness\n\n\nTd = Diffuse transmissivity (fraction of light that passes all the way \nthrough the surface diffusely).\n\n\nTs = Transmitted specularity (fraction of light transmitted as a \nbeam\u2014that is, the fraction of light not diffusely scattered).\n\n\nYou need to get the reflectance of your material, or guesstimate the \nvalue, before you can proceed.  For reference, here are trans values for \na material that is 20% reflective and 4.4% transmissive, all of the \ntransmitted component being diffusely scattered:\n\n\nA1\t0.244000\nA2\t0.244000\nA3\t0.244000\nA4\t0.000000\nA5\t0.000000\nA6\t0.180328\nA7\t0.000000\n\n\nThat was based on the following assumptions:\n\n\nDiffuse reflectance, RED\tCr\t0.200\nDiffuse reflectance, GRN\tCg\t0.200\nDiffuse reflectance, BLU\tCb\t0.200\nReflected Specularity\t\tRs\t0.000\nSurface Roughness\t\tSr\t0.000\nDiffuse Transmissivity\t\tTd\t0.044\nTransmitted Specularity\t\tTs\t0.000\nPhotopic Average refl.\t\tRd\t0.200\n\n\nI hope this helps.
