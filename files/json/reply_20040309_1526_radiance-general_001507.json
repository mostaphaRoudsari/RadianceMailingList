{"body": "Hi Rob - and others,\n\n\nPlease can you clarify the following re- trans material, as myself and my\ncolleagues have been arguing over whether to use transmission or\ntransmissivity for diffuse transmission and/or specular transmission when\nsetting the parameters for the trans material based on radiance tests.\n\n\nDo you consider transmissivity of the diffuse transmittance only, and use\nthe pure transmission of specular component?  The reason I ask is that we\nset up a small test which measures the luminance of a trans material and the\noverall light transmission through a trans material with different settings.\nUsing a specular transmission (Rs) of 0.5 (50%) - i.e. not converting to\ntranmissivity, and NO diffuse transmission/transmissivity, we get exactly\nhalf the source luminance on the side opposite the light source on the trans\nmaterial using rtrace.  i.e. tranmissivity not used for specular component.\n\n\nWorking out the diffuse transmission is a little more tricky, but looking at\nthe maths behind the settings for the trans material, I don't quite\nunderstand whether transmissivity or transmittance should be used - it\ndepends on how the internal workings of radiance interprets the parameters\nand therefore I can't be sure.\n\n\n(As I understand, transmissivity is the proportion of light that travels\nthrough the medium before inter-reflection within the medium).\n\n\nSo - the question could be written :\n\n\nDo I use specular transmission with diffuse transmissivity when setting the\ntrans parameters?\n\n\nAlso - if transmissivity is used for the transmitted light, why is a factor\n(such as transmissivity) not applied to the reflected part also (due to\ninter-reflections)?\n\n\nThanks for any insight - I know there's been many questions and answers on\nthis subject, but I'm still confused!\n\n\nTim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001507.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Hanson", "created_at": "March 09, 2004 at 03:26PM", "created_by": "Tim_Hanson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001504", "id": "radiance-general_001507"}
