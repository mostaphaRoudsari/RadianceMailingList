{"body": "Phil,\n\n\nWhat!?  You mean 'The Book' is wrong!  Sacrilege!\n\n\nWell - I tried to stick up for the book, but Giulio (otherwise known as\nPillo in the radiance world), was arguing for transmission also.\n\n\nIt always helps to have another view from someone with a different\nperspective (i.e. from beneath, being in Australia :o)).  In fact, I've just\nre-read the definition it gives which says 'Td - Diffuse Transmissivity :\nFraction of light that passes all the way through the surface diffusely' -\nwhich is a contradiction anyway!\n\n\nThanks for the clarification,\n\n\nTim\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001510.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Hanson", "created_at": "March 10, 2004 at 01:14PM", "created_by": "Tim_Hanson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001504", "id": "radiance-general_001510"}
