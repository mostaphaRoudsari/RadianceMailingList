{"body": "I just wanted to confirm that the term \"transmissivity\" is used \nincorrectly on page 325 of \"Rendering with Radiance.\"  It should be \ndiffuse transmittance (a.k.a. \"transmission coefficient\") rather than \ntransmissivity.  However, the equations for these values are correct.  \nThe term transmissivity is used properly in relation to the \"glass\" \nmaterial type as given in the trans.cal code on page 238.\n\n\nGoogle pointed me to these terms better defined on Schorsch's website:\n\n\n\thttp://www.schorsch.com/kbase/glossary/transmittance.html\n\n\nFor further information, you can also refer to the document that I \nbelieve Pillo is referring to:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001512.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2004 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001504", "id": "radiance-general_001512"}
