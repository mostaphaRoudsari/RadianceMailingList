{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nSorry for the slow response -- this one fell through the cracks \n(growing wider by the minute).\n\n\nI took texture coordinates out of obj2rad because I didn't have any \nworking texture examples, and had some unresolved questions about \nhandling texture (image) files and getting the mappings to work out.  \nHowever, texture coordinates are fully implemented in the obj2mesh \ncode, which is the method I recommend because it doesn't need to \ninterpret any .cal files, which can be costly as you point out, even if \nthey're well-written.\n\n\nAs for surface normals, most surfaces are indeed two sided, but not \nall, and in cases where you need surface orientation (e.g., dielectric \nsolids), the normal interpolation will not work correctly if the vertex \nnormals are opposite to the face normals.  This is why there is some \ncode for reversing them in obj2rad and obj2mesh.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-March/000349.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2004 at 07:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000348", "id": "radiance-dev_000349"}
