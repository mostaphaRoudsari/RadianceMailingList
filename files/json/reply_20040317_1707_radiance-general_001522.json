{"body": "Hi Pierre-Felix,\n\n\nOn X11 displays that support 8-bit color lookup mode, you can use the \n-b option of ximage and the 'i' command to create contours, labelling \nthem manually with the 'l' command.  This doesn't work on a lot of \nmodern graphics cards, unfortunately.  The -cl option of falsecolor is \nyour next best option.  Or, if you don't like that one, try -cb.\n\n\nOne of my favorites is to generate both an illuminance image and a \nregular image, then combine them with falsecolor:\n\n\n% rpict [options] octree > regular.pic\n% rpict [same options] -i+ octree > illum.pic\n% falsecolor -cl -i illum.pic -l Lux -p regular.pic > isolux.pic\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001522.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2004 at 05:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001520", "id": "radiance-general_001522"}
