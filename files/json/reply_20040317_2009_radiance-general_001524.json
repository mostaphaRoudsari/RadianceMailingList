If the default is for \nrpict to compute radiance, I'd expect \"-i\" to always cause an irradiance \ncalculation, the same as \"-i+\", and that's been my experience.  In \nre-re-re-reading the manpage, I see:\n\n\n\"Normally, the appearance of a boolean option causes a feature to be \n'toggled', that is switched from off to on or on to off depending on its \nprevious state.\"\n\n\nHow does rpict \"remember\" what state it was placed into from one \ninstance to the next?  I suppose the safe thing to do is to always call \nthe option explicitly, but I'm curious now: can someone give me an \nexample of rpict \"remembering\" it was set to compute irradiance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001524.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 17, 2004 at 08:09PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001520", "id": "radiance-general_001524"}
