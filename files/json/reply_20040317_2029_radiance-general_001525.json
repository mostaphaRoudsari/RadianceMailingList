{"body": "Rpict doesn't \"remember\" the setting from a previous run, if that's \nwhat you're thinking.  It only remembers it from previous appearances \nof the option.  For example:\n\n\n% rpict -i\n\n\nturns irradiance computation on, but\n\n\n% rpict -i -i\n\n\nturns it off again.\n\n\n% rpict -i -i -i -i -i -i+\n\n\nturns it  on.  (Had you counting, didn't I?)  If your intention is to \nswitch the option \"on\", then -i+ (or equivalently, -iY -iy -iT -it -i1 \nall mean the same) is probably better.\n\n\nThe reason rpict pays attention to multiple appearances of an option is \nin case you have aliased your version of rpict to something else, e.g. \nthe following in your .cshrc file:\n\n\nalias robpict 'rpict -ab 1 -ad 2048 -i+ \\!*'\n\n\nThen, every time you ran \"robpict\" instead of \"rpict,\" you would get \nthe set of starting options above.  If you ran \"robpict -defaults\", \nyou'd get to see these options and how they affect the normal default \nvalues.\n\n\nIn other words, giving an option then overriding it later on the \ncommand line makes sense in terms of creating your own default sets, \nwhich you can incorporate into an alias as above or put into an options \nfile and read with the @file.opt feature.  Using rad, the render= \nvariable overrides whatever parameters rad has set for you.\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001525.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2004 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001520", "id": "radiance-general_001525"}
