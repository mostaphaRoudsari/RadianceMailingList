{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nNow that I relook this ,I think I did not expressed myself correctly:\n\n\nI am using the -e switch of the falsecolor utility. The text labels overlaid\non the drawing (extrema points) are really useful for me.  I would like to\nadd more of theses labels though and wonder if it is possible somehow\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nPierre-Felix\nNote:  I must say that I don't generate the irradiance data out of radiance.\nI use mental ray that saves a pic file with the data I want so I am\nessentially looking for 2d tools.\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001527.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pierre-Felix Breton", "created_at": "March 19, 2004 at 12:41PM", "created_by": "Pierre-Felix_Breton", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001520", "id": "radiance-general_001527"}
