{"body": "in my experience (lived in York for 5-7 years, a *lot* of stained glass there\nin the minster) stained glass is grey-black with a lowish reflectance on the\noutside: dirt mostly. -The leading is generally visible but also has a very\nlow reflectance. being able to see a tracery but not really see 'through' would\nbe normal.\n\n\ncouldn't that be modelled by two one-way transparent/translucent substances\none inward facing, one outward, the outward one with a texture?\n\n\nnighttime is different. I think thats the real problem.\n\n\n(a lot of stained glass is also now covered with anti-pigeon mesh. Glass in\n York minster is a 3-layer sandwich, to protect the medieval panes from \n exposure and other damage and the like. thats also reducing its transmittance\n I expect)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001530.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "George Michaelson", "created_at": "March 22, 2004 at 01:29AM", "created_by": "George_Michaelson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001529", "id": "radiance-general_001530"}
