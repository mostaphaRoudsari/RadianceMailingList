{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThe error message is probably due to using an unfrozen octree for one \n(or more) of your instance(s).  This particular error is rare, because \nit requires geometry and materials somehow be reordered in the input, \nand usually one takes stuff out or adds it, which results in another \nmessage, \"bad object count.\"  The solution in either case is to apply \nthe -f option when you create the octree(s) you use for your \ninstance(s).  This avoids problems when you move the instance octree(s) \nto a library location, and speeds their loading.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001533.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 24, 2004 at 05:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001531", "id": "radiance-general_001533"}
