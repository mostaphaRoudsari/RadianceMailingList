{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nThe best way to do this is to create a Makefile that manages the \ncreation of auxiliary files needed during rendering (such as meshes).  \nThat way, you only run obj2mesh when you really need to -- i.e., when \nthe input file has changed.  Some have used the trick of inserting \ninline commands in their Radiance scenes that don't actually produce \nany output, but update some file (such as a luminaire), but I don't \nrecommend this practice as it makes loading of the scene just that much \nslower, and it generates a warning message, besides.\n\n\nA simple Makefile might look like the following:\n\n\n# John's first Makefile\n\n\nview:\tmyscene.oct\n\trad -o x11 myscene.rif\n\n\npics:\tmyscene.oct\n\trad myscene.rif\n\n\nmyscene.oct:\tmyscene.rif myobject.rtm\n\trad -v 0 myscene.rif\n\n\nmyobject.rtm:\tmyobject.obj\n\tobj2mesh myobject.obj > myobject.rtm\n\n\n# End of John's first Makefile\n\n\nTo use the Makefile, simply type \"make\" followed either by \"view\" or \n\"pics\" depending on whether you want to run rview or rpict.  (If you \njust type \"make\" you'll get the first target -- \"view\" -- by default.)\n\n\nI hope this isn't too confusing.  Consult the make man page if you \nreally want a good time.  Just don't type \"make love\".\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001534.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 24, 2004 at 05:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001532", "id": "radiance-general_001534"}
