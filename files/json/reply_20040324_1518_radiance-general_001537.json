{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nIt is possible that some of the octrees that define your instances need \nto be recompiled (w/ oconv) because of changes or updates to materials \nor geometry relating to the instance object. This could occur if you are \nusing one master material file or sharing multiple material files within \nyour scene. A reason that this may only be occuring sporadically as an \nerror is that for views where the instances are not in the view then \nrays are not going to be traced to the instance object.\n\n\nIf what I have indicated is in fact the basis for the error, then one \nway to avoid this is to comile your instance objects with the -f option \n(this in effect binds everything into the octree ) making the object \nself sustaining. The potential downside to this is if these instance are \ngoing to be dependant on changes and upadates to materials then you need \nto remember to recompile them if you make changes to the material files \n(that is additions or deletions of material information, changes to \ncurrent material parameters are fine).\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001537.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 24, 2004 at 03:18PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001531", "id": "radiance-general_001537"}
