{"body": "I guess what you have to do is to scale the rgb values you have by a factor\nthat depends on the expected light levels on the table (is there a table?)\n\n\nwhen you consider light sources modelled with spheres:\n\n\nA= apparent area of the sphere = PI * R^2 [m2]\nF= luminous flux [lm]\nI = luminous intensity= F/4PI [cd]\nL=I/A [cd/m2]\nR=L/179 [W/m2] = radiance = your R G B in the ligth definition \n\n\nE=illuminance on a plane=I * cos3(theta) / h2\n\n\ntherefore you have to:\nmeasure the light levels at a given point\nfrom the illuminance you get the intensity\ntherefore after some number crunching you have the radiance.... ;-)\n\n\nhope it helps,\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001538.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "March 24, 2004 at 03:36PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001536", "id": "radiance-general_001538"}
