If you take a sphere with a diameter\nof 1 cm, then you get an emitting surface of 0.000314 m2.\nThe luminance is therefore 1/0.000314 = 3183.10 cd/m2.\nIn Radiance terms this is  3183.1/179 =   17.78 W/sr*m2.\n\n\nThe (weighted) average of your RGB values should be roughly the\nsame as that. The values you have above only specify the color\nproportions, which you need to scale accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001540.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 25, 2004 at 12:35AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001536", "id": "radiance-general_001540"}
