Its not so\nbad on the first without stained glass but the second is really bad, the\nfirst is just glass glass on the windows, the second is dark stained\nglass. Its definitely not low render settings, the one without stained\nglass took nearly 24 hrs and the other 8 hrs. Both of these renders were\ndone with these parameters of rpict\n\n\n-x 2560 -y 2048 -ar 128 -ad 512 -aa .15 -as 256 -ab 3\n\n\nBoth were done with mkillum using -ab 2 -av 18.9 18.9 18.9 on the\nlighter non stained glass and just -ab 2 on the second darker render\nwith the book. The textures are not low quality, and externally this\nrenders great, but internally they are really bad in corners? \n\n\nWhats going wrong?\n\n\nCheers John\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Sutherland", "created_at": "March 28, 2004 at 04:59PM", "created_by": "John_Sutherland", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001547", "id": "radiance-general_001546"}
