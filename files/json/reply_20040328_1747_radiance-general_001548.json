I assume it is known that -as should\nusually be half of -ad, and that increasing both will reduce\nsplotches in most cases. What is less known is that -aa needs to\nbe in balance with them as well. The right balance may depend on\nyour scene, but often when increasing -ad/-as doesn't eliminate all\nartifacts, you can take this as an indication that -aa is too small.\n\n\nIn fact, if you want a fast, relatively inaccurate, but sill nice\nlooking rendering, one possible way to get that is to increase\n-aa more than you normally would. In fact, I whish rvu had a\nhigher default setting for -aa...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001548.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 28, 2004 at 05:47PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001547", "id": "radiance-general_001548"}
