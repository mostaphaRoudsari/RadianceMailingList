{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nlooks like indirect lighting problems. You might try to increase the \ndifferent values for the indirect calculation or think about using \nillums. The scene has quite difficult light sources (e.g. the window \nwith the complex geometry) that make the probability of indirect rays \nto hit your sky (which seams to be the most important source) rather \nlow... I would try to use illums for the window.\n\n\nI would really like to know how you mapped the text on the (rather \narbitrary) surface of the book? Is the book modeled in a CAD or a \nresult of maths... (which is somehow the same - I know ;-) ?\n\n\nMaybe some experts follow... indirect errors and these kinds of \nartifacts are quite a topic here ;-)))\n\n\nCU+good luck, Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
