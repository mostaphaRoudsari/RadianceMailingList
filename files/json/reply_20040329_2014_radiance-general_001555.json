{"body": "just a quick check: \nare you sure to be using illum in the window surfaces? you miss the typical\nfake shadows this solution implies....\nI guess you can use an illum surface outside of the windows, pointing\ninside, close to the glass and with a good -pj of 0.6 ?0.8 and -ds < 0.1\neliminate all the fake shadow... doing this way the 'arlechine' effect\nshould go away... I guess\nalso... remember to set -av... seems to be a little high...\n\n\nif you use -aa more than 0.3 with low values for -ad and -as you can save\ntime and eliminate artefacts... well artefacts are too big to be visible...\nsometimes is a good trick to speed up renderings, other time it is not, just\ntry ;-))\n\n\ncheers\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\nPS another option is to use a good -ad value, more than 1024, may be you can\nreduce a little ar to speed up, say -ar 64?96 ... \nor the crazy solution: -aa 0  -ad 32 -as 4 -ab 1 -ps  1 -pj .8 (or if you\ncan 2)....\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001555.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "March 29, 2004 at 08:14PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001554", "id": "radiance-general_001555"}
