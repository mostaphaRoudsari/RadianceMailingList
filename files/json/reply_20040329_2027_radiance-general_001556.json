But since you have\n-ad and -as at relatively inaccurate settings, that would result\nin a better balance. Alternatively, you can increase -ad and -as,\nwhich also results in better balance, with better accuracy\noverall, but taking (possibly much) more time to render.\nIn either direction you will eventually find a combination that\nreduces or even eliminates the artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n> Well anyway I definitely don't think aa is the problem anyway.\n\n\nThere's hardly ever a single parameter responsible for specific\nartifacts. They all need to play together in the right way.\n\n\nYour new pictures are a nice demonstration of what happens when\nyou disturb the balance even more than was first the case.\nI actually suspect that the original builders of that space\nwould have been very happy if they could have produced such\nan effect in reality! ;)\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001556.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 29, 2004 at 08:27PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001554", "id": "radiance-general_001556"}
