{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nIt's probably fair to say that gensky can't be trusted to produce \naccurate absolute luminances for the sun OR the sky at ANY altitude.  \nSkylight is simply too variable to be pinned down, even on average, \nwithout considering the local climate.  In the case of low altitude \nsunlight in particular, there are a lot of highly variable atmospheric \neffects at play, which is why we don't see many reruns of the same \nsunset.  In the code for gensky, I was going by some general ballpark \nvalues taken from Wyszecki and Stiles (Color Science), and it's a \nreally crude estimate.\n\n\nFor accurate values, you'll have to come up with your own \"sources\" and \nset the -B and -R options accordingly.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 31, 2004 at 06:33PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001552", "id": "radiance-general_001565"}
