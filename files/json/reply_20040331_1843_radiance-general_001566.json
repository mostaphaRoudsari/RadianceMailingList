{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nFirstly, you should move your illum's to just inside the windows, \nrather than having them on the outside.  This should reduce the bizarre \ncolor artifacts you're seeing.  Secondly, you should increase your -ar \nparameter a bit and simultaneously increase -ad and -as parameter \nvalues.  This should reduce the splotches you are seeing in corners.  \nDecreasting the -aa value might help as well, but I would try that next \nif these suggestions don't solve the problem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001566.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 31, 2004 at 06:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001554", "id": "radiance-general_001566"}
