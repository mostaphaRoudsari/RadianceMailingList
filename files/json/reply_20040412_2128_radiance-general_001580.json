And AFAIK, Roland \n(whom you also refer to as late & great) is great, but definitely not \nlate.  =8-)\n\n\nI played with RADZILLA briefly during lunch here.  Some notes:\n1. Your source code compiled just fine on Fedora Core 1.\n2. How do I specify a .rif file with radz?\n3. Getinfo likes radzilla octrees, but the \nmodel-viewing-utility-formerly-named-rview does not.  I guess that's \nbecause getinfo is simply a header reader, whereas rview is dealing with \nthe octree more intimately.  Any plans to make an rzrvu?  Will you paint \nmy house when you're done re-writing Radiance?\n\n\nKeep up the good work!  Interesting stuff, Carsten.  This is such a fun \ngroup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001580.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 12, 2004 at 09:28PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001578", "id": "radiance-general_001580"}
