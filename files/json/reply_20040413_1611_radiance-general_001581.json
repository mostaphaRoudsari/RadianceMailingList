So \nyou can expect more functionality coming soon.\n\n\nJust a quick note: I'm currently on a one weeks holiday, so this \ncertainly means some delay on my side for answering questions  etc. But \nI'll be back working on the stuff next week...\n\n\nAnd concering your house: It depends what kind of artwork you want your \nhouse to be after I'm finished with it ..:-)\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001581.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "April 13, 2004 at 04:11PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001578", "id": "radiance-general_001581"}
