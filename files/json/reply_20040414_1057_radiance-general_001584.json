{"body": "Ahhhh ok, makes sense... this is not what I was expecting. As the inside\nis dark, and so is the glass, I was expecting the glass not to reflect\nmuch light? What properties do I need to play with to get what I was\nexpecting, ie darker looking glass from the outside, not reflecting\nmuch? You must know what I mean, like stainglass on churches, its very\nmurky from outside, definetly cant see much reflection in it.\n\n\nCheers guys!\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001584.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Sutherland", "created_at": "April 14, 2004 at 10:57AM", "created_by": "John_Sutherland", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001582", "id": "radiance-general_001584"}
