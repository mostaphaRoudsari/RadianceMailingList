I think there's also a .cal file that simulates a \ndirty surface?  Both things would help your cause. Right now you have a \nmirror-smooth surface there, which I believe is causing your problem there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001585.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 14, 2004 at 03:47PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001582", "id": "radiance-general_001585"}
