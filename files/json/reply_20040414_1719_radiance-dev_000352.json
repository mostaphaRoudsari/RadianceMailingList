{"body": "Thanks Greg for the info.\n\n\nI did take a look through the source code. When I first looked, this value \nappeared to only be used in logical statements. After looking further, I can \nsee that this value is used to calculate other values.\n\n\nThe reason I have interest in this is because I am looking to implement an \noptimization to Radiance for ray-triangle intersection. From what I can \ntell, Radiance uses generic routines for calculating ray/n-sided polygon \nintersection and nothing specific for triangles. Since the geometry for my \nscenes, with the exception of light sources, consist entirely of triangles, \nI want to optimize the code a bit. The ray-triangle intersection algorithm \nthat I am going to use is the M\u00f6ller-Trumbore method listed here:\n\n\nhttp://www.acm.org/jgt/papers/MollerTrumbore97/\n\n\n\n\nIt seems pretty straight forward to implement. There are two branches to the \ncode, culling and non-culling. I am going to implement both and do a \nperformance comparision. The reason I asked whether about the member 'rod' \nis because I only want to calculate only what is necessary. Since I am \nimplementing the culling branch of the M\u00f6ller-Trumbore algorithm  first, I \nwas curious as to whether or not the value would be needed if I am doing \nbackface culling. I see now that I will need it. If this is sucessful and I \ncan achieve a modest performance increase, I may look to implement the \nalgorithm into o_mesh.c\n\n\nBTW, the dicussion that we had last month about tmesh.cal worked great for \nme. With the revision to the source code to my conversion program, I \nachieved a 10.5% - 12.5% gain in performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-April/000352.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "April 14, 2004 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000350", "id": "radiance-dev_000352"}
