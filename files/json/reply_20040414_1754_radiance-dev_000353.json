{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nI'm already using a supposedly fast triangle intersection test in \nrt/o_mesh.c -- didn't you look?  It uses the following algorithm by \nSegura & Feito, which the they compare favorably to Moller's technique:\n\n\n\thttp://wscg.zcu.cz/wscg2001/Papers_2001/R75.pdf\n\n\nIf you feel like implementing Moller's method and comparing it to \nSegura & Feito, be my guest, but I bet they're pretty similar.  The \nlegacy Radiance code for general polys is probably faster in fact, \nsince it stores and reuses surface normal information.  I don't do this \nin meshes due to the storage overhead.\n\n\nI also implemented my own optimization in o_mesh.c that cuts the number \nof cross products approximately in half, since neighboring faces are \nusually tested together.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-April/000353.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 14, 2004 at 05:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000350", "id": "radiance-dev_000353"}
