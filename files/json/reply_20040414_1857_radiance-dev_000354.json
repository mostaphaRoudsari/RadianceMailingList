{"body": "Hi Greg\n\n\nTo be honest with you, I have only glanced through o_mesh.c. I thought I \nwould mention that I would use M\u00f6ller-Trumbore for optimization just as an \noff hand thought as I was sending a reply and to get your comments on it. \nSince o_mesh uses the Segura & Feito method, I see no reason to try to \nimplement M\u00f6ller-Trumbore. Though, I may look to store and reuse the surface \nnormal values since I have a couple of gigs of memory to play with on my \nmachine. I'll have to evaluate it later. If I am correct though, \nM\u00f6ller-Trumbore doesn't use the surface normal values in order to test for \nintersection (though the values will be stored). Thank you for all of your \ninsight.\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-April/000354.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "April 14, 2004 at 06:57PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000350", "id": "radiance-dev_000354"}
