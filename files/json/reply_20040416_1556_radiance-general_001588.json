{"body": "hi,\nglow is considered as a light source by the direct component only within the\ngiven distance (4th number of glow definition) and I guess \"mist\" doesn't\nconsider glow with 0 (or -1) because it is not a direct light source.\n\n\na quick and probably useless (**) trick is to change the sky description \n\n\nfrom\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n3 1 1  1\nto\n\n\nskyfunc light skyglow\n0\n0\n3 1 1  1\n\n\nthis way the 1st bounce is now direct but -ds doesn't work on the sky and\nthere is just a big point source above so ...  (**) \n\n\nanother trick (this time should be ok) is to create a big polygonal volume\nof brightfunc-light-sources with the sky distribution... in this case you\ncould be able to use -ds.\n\n\nhope it helps,\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001588.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "April 16, 2004 at 03:56PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001587", "id": "radiance-general_001588"}
