{"body": "Unfortunately, mist is never going to work with distant sources, \nbecause if your raise any extinction to an infinite power, no matter \nhow close to one it starts out, you get a zero result.  (From RwR Chap. \n14, eq. 14.7, we see that light is absorbed as the power of distance.)  \nI just had a similar discussion with another user (Pablo Escanilla \n<pabloe at ivo.cps.unizar.es>), who was simulating fog on a roadway.\n\n\nReal atmospheres are quite a bit more complex than setting a global \nconstant value for extinction and albedo.  Real atmospheres change with \naltitude, often dramatically, so it doesn't become pitch dark as soon \nas the fog rolls in.  Simulating large scale atmospherics in Radiance \nmeans creating enormous \"slabs\" of mist with different extinctions at \ndifferent altitudes.  It can be done, but it's a bit of a pain and, as \nfar as I know, no one has yet made the attempt.\n\n\nAs to sampling the sky dome, this is never going to work.  You are much \nbetter off setting a sensible value for -av, which gets figured into \nthe mist calculation as an appropriate multiplier on albedo.  This was \nmy advice to Pablo.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001590.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 16, 2004 at 07:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001587", "id": "radiance-general_001590"}
