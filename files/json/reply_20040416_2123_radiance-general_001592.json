{"body": "Hi Caroline,\n\n\nThere are as many possible reasons to your problem as there are option \nsettings in rpict.  (I.e., a lot.)  You have to give us a little more \ndetail about what settings you are using in your rad input file (if \nyou're using rad) or your rendering/simulation command (if you're \ncalling rpict or rtrace directly).  Posting an image if you have a \nwebsite is also an incredible help.  If you haven't generated any \nimages, I recommend you do so, even if you don't require them for your \nanalysis.  Renderings are one of the best debugging tools ever \nconceived.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001592.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 16, 2004 at 09:23PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001591", "id": "radiance-general_001592"}
