{"body": "Thank you very much for your answer.\n\n\nMy intention was not simulating light extinction through the atmosphere but\nonce light reaches a mist object which is on the ground, (I exactly know the\nextinction coefficient within it), analyze the light (direct from sun and\ndiffuse from sky dome) extinction inside this small volume.\n\n\nSince I need to know the light levels (illuminance) inside the volume at\ndifferent depths, it seems to me that the -av approach will not work.\n\n\nAny suggestion?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nGuedi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001594.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guedi Capeluto", "created_at": "April 18, 2004 at 06:06PM", "created_by": "Guedi_Capeluto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001587", "id": "radiance-general_001594"}
