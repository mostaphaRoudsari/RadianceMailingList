{"body": "While other can remark on pcond and how it represents\nscotopic/photopic adaptation, I would like to comment on the lighting\ndesign issue. The close-up of the manuscript indicates a dominant\ngrazing highlight from the right and less contribution from the left. I\nalso note the shadows cast by the candle configuration.. front candles\nblocking rear candles... at least that is my guess.  Consider\nreorganizing the candles so that each has a full \"sightline\" to the\nmanuscript. Additionally increase the luminance of the page by moving\nthe candles closer and by reducing the cosine effect by repositioning.\nTo reduce the masking shadow cast by a reader, consider elevating the\nlight sources.\n            Radiance provides fairly accurate representations of\nlighting choices. Though there have been a few occasions where I gasped\nwith disbelief at a rendering of a lighting scheme I was testing, I must\nacknowledge that Radiance typically illustrates the flaws and strengths\nof the design choices.  \n\n\n-Rob Shakespeare\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001598.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robert A.
