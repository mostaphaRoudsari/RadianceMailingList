{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nOur intention is to simulate light extinction inside a tree (yes yes...a\ntree) or a group of trees with the purpose of studying light penetration\naccording to different morphologies. The mist approach looked to me much\nsimpler than modeling the whole tree (or a lot of trees), considering than\neven in this case the model will be just an approximation.\n\n\nAnyway I will try constructing a dome from polygons\nbrightfunc-light-sources, as Giulio suggested.\n\n\nGuedi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001599.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guedi Capeluto", "created_at": "April 19, 2004 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "Guedi_Capeluto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001587", "id": "radiance-general_001599"}
