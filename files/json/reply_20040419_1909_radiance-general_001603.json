{"body": "Hi Caroline,\n\n\nThanks for posting your input and images.  The mostly likely cause of \nyour problems is that you left rad to set the default value for -av, \nwhich is based on your exposure.  Since you use the -2 option to pfilt, \nyou don't see the effect this exposure setting has on your image, \ntherefore you don't realize that it is probably too high.  You need to \neither manually set the -av value in your render= line, or figure out \nwhat the correct exposure should be for your scene and use that in your \nEXPOSURE= setting.  Then, the light should be better balanced.\n\n\nA lot of people set -av 0 0 0 as a matter of course in their \ndaylighting simulations.  Although such a conservative setting is \nguaranteed to underestimate your lighting levels, it is often better \nthan ending up with too much light where it does not belong, like you \nare seeing here.  At least you noticed it!\n\n\nThe Unix version of radiance comes with a script called compamb that \nautomatically determines an appropriate ambient value (and exposure) \ngiven a rad input file.  I don't believe this is included in \nDesktopRadiance, but you can look for it.\n\n\nGood luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001603.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 19, 2004 at 07:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001602", "id": "radiance-general_001603"}
