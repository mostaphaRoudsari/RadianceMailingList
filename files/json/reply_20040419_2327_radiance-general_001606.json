{"body": "Quite Hazardous! :)\n\n\nI did get it to work, although not quite the way you suggested.  Not\nsure what the problem is with Cygwin & rad, but I almost always get a\ncore dump when rad tries to oconv something big.  Therefore I needed to\nget around this problem as well as I was getting tired of manually\noconving after each core dump...  (BTW, it's been great having Cygwin as\nan option for running radiance on a Windows system)\n\n\nThe one problem I'm still having (not really a problem) is that I can't\nget mkillum to generate all of its *.dat files in the illums folder. \nThis is making it harder to keep everything nice and clean since I end\nup with 82 files for every run and there are 53 runs!  Best I can do to\nclean this up is to remove the old *.dat files before I begin the next\nmkillum process.\n\n\nAlso, I can't quite settle on the best looking view..  But I don't\nexpect much help there!\n\n\nMy final octree generator looks as follows.  Basically I pulled the\nlight sources and octree updating from rad.  This eliminated both of my\nproblems.  We'll see how long this takes with all the variables set to\nhigh.....\n\n\nframe=$1\ntime=`ev \"5.25+($frame/4)\"`\ngensky 3 21 $time +s -a 38.7 -o 90.5 -m 90 > sun.rad\noconv -f -i ./octree/lobby_b.oct sun.rad sky.rad >\n./octree/lobby_b0.oct\nrm *.dat\nmkillum @anim1/render.opt ./octree/lobby_b0.oct \"<\" ./scene/illums.rad\n> ./illums/processedillums.rad\noconv -f -i ./octree/lobby_b0.oct ./illums/processedillums.rad\n\n\nGreg, thanks for the hand.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001606.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "April 19, 2004 at 11:27PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001595", "id": "radiance-general_001606"}
