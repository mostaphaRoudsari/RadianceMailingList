{"body": "Great! Thanks for the suggestions. Indeed it seems as\nthough -av will fix this. Next step is to try this on\nmy larger simulations.\nAn additional questions, as I am not too experienced\nwith this application:\n\n\nAs my primary use of Desktop Radiance centres on the\nchanges in daylighting in a building as the glazing\ntype changes, should I expect to need a different -av\nsetting for each variation of the design? What is\nlikely to be the greatest factor in setting my -av\nnumber - does it sound reasonable that for the same\nbuidling geometry, I will probably find the same -av\nsetting works throughout all glazing variations? Or\nwill it be the date/time/location setting which is the\nbiggest player? or something else? \n\n\n...or should I just plan for this to take several\ntests of -av settings for each and every glazing\nvariation?\n\n\nCheers,\nCaroline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
