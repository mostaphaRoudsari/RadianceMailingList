Each variation will result in a\ndifferent \"general illumination level\", which is what\n-av more or less represents.\n\n\n\n\n> What is\n> likely to be the greatest factor in setting my -av\n> number - does it sound reasonable that for the same\n> buidling geometry, I will probably find the same -av\n> setting works throughout all glazing variations?

If there are other modifications involved,\nyou might still need to start experimenting from there.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 20, 2004 at 04:45PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001602", "id": "radiance-general_001610"}
