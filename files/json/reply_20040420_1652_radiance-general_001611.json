{"body": "Hi Caroline,\n\n\nIf you are changing all the glazing at once, you can simply scale the \n-av parameter value by the transmittance of your glazings and that will \ngive you the correct relative changes.  In fact, excepting for angular \nvariations in transmittance, you could scale your entire result under \nthose circumstances.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001611.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 20, 2004 at 04:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001602", "id": "radiance-general_001611"}
