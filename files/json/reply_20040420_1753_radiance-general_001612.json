{"body": "I've found that Radiance on Cygwin is great for learning and for \nsetting up your Rad's and Rifs. But when I got to do a large \nrendering, I then hand it over to a G4 Mac (since I don't have a Linux \nbox anymore). It's just been wonderful for learning, but I too have \nhad the segfaults sometimes when dealing with large RAD files. I've \ntaken to exporting my models from Revit to AutoCAD then using a LISP \nroutine to then export each layer out to a separate RAD file to try to \nget around this, and it works pretty well.\n\n\nHow is the speed with VMWare? I'd love to use it rather than trying to \nmake my laptop a dual-boot, however I do a lot of heavy 3D and need \nwhatever speed I can get sometimes...\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\n\nMartin Moeck wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "April 20, 2004 at 05:53PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001608", "id": "radiance-general_001612"}
