{"body": "How is the speed with VMWare? I'd love to use it rather than trying to\n\tmake my laptop a dual-boot, however I do a lot of heavy 3D and need\n\twhatever speed I can get sometimes...\n\n\n\tThanks!\n\n\n\tJeffrey McGrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI use vmware on my laptop (1.7GHz, 512MB RAM) and on the 3GHz office PC. There is no slowdown - the speed is the same as if you would run it on native Linux/Unix. The setup on laptops is no problem whatsoever. vmware recognizes the graphics card automatically. Heavy 3D doesn't need more than 150 MB RAM, so I run Photoshop and Radiance even on the laptop at the same time. Actually, I use vmware more than Linux dualboot on the office PC, because you always need some microsoft programs. \n\n\n\tMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001613.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "April 20, 2004 at 06:50PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001608", "id": "radiance-general_001613"}
