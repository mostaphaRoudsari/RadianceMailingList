At the\nmoment, the user needs to control that manually, but I'm\nworking on queueing and load distribution functionality.\n\n\n\n\n> Second off: Would it even be feasible to use e-mail as the way to\n> submit and receive jobs?

Actually, a simple scp might\ndo the trick.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001616.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 20, 2004 at 07:58PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001615", "id": "radiance-general_001616"}
