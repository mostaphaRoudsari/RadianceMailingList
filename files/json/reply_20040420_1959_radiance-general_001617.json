The really large files tend to \nbe the octrees, the ambient cache files, and the Radiance pics, which \nall get generated from your rad files which are relatively small.  Could \nyou make do with jpeg versions of the images?  They'd be much smaller \nthan the 32 bit Radiance images.  You could create a script that would \ntake your uploaded .rad files (and maybe a rif file), runs the \nsimulation, converts the pics to jpeg, and emails 'em back to you (or \ngenerates some html so that you could view the images online).  All the \nbulk of the simulation would still be on the RRS (Radiance Render \nServer).  Maybe the script could pack up the simulation as a tar.gz \narchive and a link to download the file could be added to the image html \npage; this would get around any email file size limits too.\n\n\nNotice how there are no practical code samples here.  I'm good with the \nideas, but not with the programming. =8-)  Keep us posted on your \nprogress though!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001617.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 20, 2004 at 07:59PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001615", "id": "radiance-general_001617"}
