{"body": "Hi Woogie,\n\n\nWhat you are seeing is likely the result of a known anomaly in the \nhemispherical sampling pattern used by the indirect calculation in \nRadiance.  I think Charles Ehrlich was the first to point this out to \nme -- the polar sampling I use on the hemisphere means that the exact \npole is never sampled, and there is a slight dip in the response to \nindirect surfaces directly overhead as a result.  Since this is how you \narranged your scene, it is likely that this is the source of the odd \ndip in value towards the center of the surface illuminated by the glow \nsource, as the glow only contributes to the indirect portion of \nilluminance.\n\n\nTo fix this problem would complicate the code and only reduce errors in \nsome very odd circumstances.  There are many other circumstances that \ncause similar biases, so I never thought it worthwhile to change it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001626.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 26, 2004 at 04:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001622", "id": "radiance-general_001626"}
