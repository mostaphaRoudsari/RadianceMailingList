{"body": "Ive not done any work on that specific period, but I tried to tackle\nthis problem in my medieval abbey reconstruction of stained glass. \nI found that for internal views of the glass the material glass was\nbest, as it could be textured and propagated the light well into the\nroom. As for external rendering, the glass was far too reflective,\nalmost like a mirror , therefore I used trans. Have a play with the\nsettings for it, the reflectivity can be adjusted etc, but I found it\ndifficult to get the same internal lighting quality with trans.\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001627.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Sutherland", "created_at": "April 26, 2004 at 05:11PM", "created_by": "John_Sutherland", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001624", "id": "radiance-general_001627"}
