{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nof course I watched your thread. In my model, the situation is a bit \ndifferent. I don't care about exterior appearance, the windows are \nmainly light sources. However, as I am working on a model of a real \nbuilding, I don't want to create a glass material just by guessing, and \nI am currently searching for e.g. measured data of glasses as used in \nthat time. However... as almost all the light goes through these \nwindows, the values of transmissivity and color will only change the \nnumeric results, not the perceived appearance, right? So it is not that \ndangerous ;-)\n\n\nThank you + CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001628.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
