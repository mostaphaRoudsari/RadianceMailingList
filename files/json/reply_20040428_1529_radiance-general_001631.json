{"body": "hi,\nI managed to compile it on a powerbook 1.25 G4\nso the answer  it's: yes it works!\nmy system has:\n10.3.3 panther\nradiance 3.5 binaries\npmap 3.28\n\n\n\n\nthe way I did it is:\n\n\ndownload the archives from\nhttp://www.ise.fhg.de/alt-aber-aktiv/radiance/photon-map/download.html\n\n\nput all the archives .tar.gz in the same new directory called Test ( just a\nname.. )\n\n\nyou decompress radiance archive (rad3R5.tar.gz) in the directory Test with\ntar -xvf rad3R5.tar.gz\n\n\nthen there should be a new directory called ray inside Test. (I do this way\nbecause stuffit doesn't work...)\n\n\nnow from the same location, inside Test, type \ntar -xvf pmap-3.28.tar.gz\n\n\nyou should have only two .gz file and a ray directory....\n\n\n\n\nnow:\n\n\n\n\n1 - go into ray\n\n\n2 - type ./makeall install from ray\n\n\n3 - select the text editor you like (pico it's my preferred)\n\n\n4 - select a directory for the compiled binaries like ~/Desktop/bin (must be\ncreated before; be carefull with permission)\n\n\n5 - choose 7th option (macosX)\n\n\n6 - select the library location (be carefull with permission)\n\n\n7 - select your options by editing the file, if you dare ;-)) (I use\ndefaults...)\n\n\n\n\nshould be ok....\n\n\ncheers,\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\nPS sometimes I use this optimisation with G4 and radiance (not with pmap):\n(you get up to 30% more)\n -fast -mcpu=7450\nbut could be a little buggy sometimes....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001631.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "April 28, 2004 at 03:29PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001630", "id": "radiance-general_001631"}
