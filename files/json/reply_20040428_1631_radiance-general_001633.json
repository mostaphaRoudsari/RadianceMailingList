{"body": "That's great news the book's finally available!  This is the first I've \nheard of it.\n\n\nI just wanted to add a note regarding the \"revised\" version in the \ntitle.  Not much was actually changed from the first edition, since we \ndidn't have time (or thought we didn't a year ago when we started this \nprocess) to add any new chapters, which is what we'd really need to do. \n  Plus, we were restricted to working with the PDF from Morgan Kaufmann, \nsince the originals were all lost.  All we did was fix a few typos and \nformulas, since the opportunity presented itself.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001633.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 28, 2004 at 04:31PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001629", "id": "radiance-general_001633"}
