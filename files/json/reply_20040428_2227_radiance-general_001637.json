{"body": "Sigh.  The price was for a paperback edition, which we did not \nauthorize, at a price we did not authorize.  BookSurge has made a \nnumber of screw-ups, this being the most recent.  Since they did not \nsend us an author's copy as we requested or let us know when they were \nmaking the book available as we requested, we only found out from \nJohn's e-mail that it was for sale.  Chas contacted them and corrected \nthe situation, hence the price change.  (Technically, this is not an \n\"increase\" because we never suggested the price they quoted.)  Perhaps \nyou recall that earlier, they put the PDF up for sale against our \nwishes, and that was also caught by an astute user.\n\n\nI am sorry for the price change, but we did not intend to offer a \npaperback version, and we would have to redo the cover (again) to make \nit work.  Given the wear and tear we expect most people to get out of \nit, we thought a hard cover was preferable.  The higher cost also \nreflects the overhead of on-demand printing, I think.  Chas could tell \nyou more, and you should contact him if you wish to make any bulk \npurchases.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001637.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 28, 2004 at 10:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001629", "id": "radiance-general_001637"}
