{"body": "John,\n\n\nAre you sure you are sending the rays in the right direction ?\n From the two first lines of your script:\n\n\ncnt 6 12 1 | rcalc -e '$1=51+((72/6)*$1+6);$2=96+((144/12)*$2+6);$3=30' \\\n-e '$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' |  ....\nit seems you are sending rays from a regular grid in a xy plane in the \nupward direction ($6=1) !\n\n\nI guess you should ensure your calculation grid is located above your desk \n(e.g. by setting $3=30.5) and then trace rays downwards ($6=-1). Then \nrtrace will calculate the luminance values at the rays intersections with \nyour desk plane which is what you expect I think...\n\n\nHope this will help you.\nRapha\u00ebl Compagnon\n\n\n  it seems you are tracing rays\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001643.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Raphael Compagnon", "created_at": "May 03, 2004 at 08:57AM", "created_by": "Raphael_Compagnon", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001640", "id": "radiance-general_001643"}
