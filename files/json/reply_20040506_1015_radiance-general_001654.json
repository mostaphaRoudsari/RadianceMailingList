{"body": "Ben,\n\n\nThere are various ways to estimate time-varying daylight\nilluminance from a few 'static' simulations.  Your application\nhowever seems to require fairly precise values.  I think the\nonly way to achieve them with any certainty is to carry\nout a full blown time-varying daylight illuminance calculation\nusing a full year of 1hr met. data.  If you're not convinced,\nsee Figures 6.36 and 6.37 (Chapter 6) here:\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/zxcv-thesis/\n\n\nfor an illustration of the difference between static daylight\nfactors and time-varying daylight factors.\n\n\nTo generate time-varying daylight illuminances, try Christoph\nReinhart's DAYSIM package:\n\n\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/daysim.html\n\n\n-John Mardaljevic \n\n\nPS. I would have suggested also the DLS (IESD's own Radiance-based\ntool to predict time-varying daylight illuminance).  But\nit is currently broken becuase changes in Java have not yet been\nincorporated into the tool. :(\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic                     \nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001654.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 06, 2004 at 10:15AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001653", "id": "radiance-general_001654"}
