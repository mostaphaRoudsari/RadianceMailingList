But there is no\nknowing how good the estimate is until you make comparison with\nabsolute values from, say, a TRY.  My suggestion is: find the\nmaximum global horizontal irradiance (& associated diffuse horizontal)\nin the TRY, and use those to set your -R and -B gensky parameters.\nDoesn't matter too much when in the year it occurs, it's more a\ncase of getting an idea of what likely magnitudes are.\nMaybe increase the overall value by a little to account for very extreme\nconditions, but be careful not to exceed theoretical limits.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic                     \nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001659.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 07, 2004 at 11:08AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001653", "id": "radiance-general_001659"}
