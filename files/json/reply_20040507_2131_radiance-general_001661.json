A new material model promises advances in material models IMHO, \nnot only for pearls, but for very basic materials like aluminium too.\nDo you plan to do validations on your new model, e.g. compare calculated \nresults with measurements or use measured BRDF data and fit parameters \nof your new model to these ?\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001661.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "May 07, 2004 at 09:31PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001660", "id": "radiance-general_001661"}
