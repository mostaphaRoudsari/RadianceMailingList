{"body": "Hi,\n\n\ndo you have an example picture that you can publish on the net? AFAIK \nyou can't switch off the ambient from a rad file, the ambient settings \ndon't describe the scene. So they are passed as command line parameters \nto rpic or set in the rif-file (if you use rad or trad). You might try \n-ab 0... however, it sounds not clear why your surfaces are all looking \nthe same, even with ambient light ;-) BTW, do you calculate the ambient \n(-ab ?) or pass values you got somewhere else?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
