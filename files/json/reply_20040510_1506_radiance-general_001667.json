{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nyes, of course you are right. However, the idea is to reuse geometry \nwhen possible (and I have hundreds of objects which are placed by \nreplmarks) and stay as close as possible to the cad packages. I wanted \nto ask as replmarks seams to be just for that goal ;). The integration \nof CAD and radiance without the need of writing radiance scene files \nmanually is sometimes important... That's why I wonder if it would make \nsense to use surface normals of the triangles in replmarks - and add \nmirroring functionality that way.\n\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
