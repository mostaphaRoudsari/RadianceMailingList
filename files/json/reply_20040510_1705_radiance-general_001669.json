{"body": "Hi,\n   I passed the value \"-ab 1\" to the rad file because I want to use 1 indirect light source. \nThe problem is when I am using single light source, the scene looks okey( shinny objects are \nshinny). But in order to create softer shadows, I am using area lights now. But It seems now \nthe shinny objects look the same as the matt ones. I also lost all the shading of the scene. \n\n\nThanks. \n\n\n\n\nBei \n\n\n > \n> Hi, > > do you have an example picture that you can publish on the net?
