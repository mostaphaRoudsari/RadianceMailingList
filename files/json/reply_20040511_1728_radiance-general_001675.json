{"body": "Hi Rob\n\n\nI've tried ltview with this luminaire (lumen output is prob. wrong, but \nit doesn't matter):\n\n\nerco.rad:\n\n\nvoid brightdata erco_dist\n4 flatcorr erco.dat source.cal src_theta\n0\n3 100 0.035 0.0005\n\n\nerco_dist light erco_light\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nerco_light ring erco.d\n0\n0\n8\n        0 0 -0.00025\n        0 0 -1\n        0 0.0175\n\n\nerco_light ring erco.u\n0\n0\n8\n        0 0 0.00025\n        0 0 1\n        0 0.0175\n\n\n\n\nerco.dat:\n\n\n1\n0 180 37\n\n\n        3.91061 3.6933  3.25531 2.61173\n        1.80559 0.368156        0.157542        0.0374302\n        0.0145251       0       0       0\n        0       0       0       0\n        0       0       0       0\n        0       0       0       0\n        0       0       0       0\n        0       0       0       0\n        0       0       0       0\n        0\n\n\nThe lamp is correctly positioned in the middle of the room, but the box \nlooks just grey. No light/shadow is cast by the luminaire. Setting it to \n10 (metric) units doesn't help.\n\n\nIf I use\n\n\nroom.rad:\n\n\nvoid plastic box_mat\n0\n0\n5  .5 .5 .5  0 0\n\n\n!genbox box_mat box 10 10 10 | xform -t -5 -5 -5\n\n\n\n\nwith this view file:\n\n\nrview -vtv -vp 10 0 0 -vd -1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 90 -vv 90 -vo 5.5 -va 0 \n-vs 0 -vl 0\n\n\n(clip front surface), it works hunky dory: splotch on the floor!\n\n\nI can't see which one of the default rvu parameters causes this. Could \nbe one of the -a* or -d*, but I am not sure...\nMy feeling is that -av should be set to zero. The lamp might be very \ndim, in which case it's washed out with the ambient. Is it really \nnecessary to involve rad? this is done in objview, because you don't \nknow upfront how big the scene is etc.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001675.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 11, 2004 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001671", "id": "radiance-general_001675"}
