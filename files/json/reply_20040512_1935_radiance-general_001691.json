Pcond attempts to \nadapt the original scene levels to the current viewing environment -- \nsomething not even an HDR display can do.  You need something like the \nwide-field HDR viewer I built to test out tone operators for that.\n\n\n> Talking about the limitations of CRT's.

Beware of \nmanufacturer's claims regarding contrast ratios and bit depths.  There \nare no standards, and the marketing people have a field day with these \nspecs.  Bottom line:  don't trust it unless you've measured it \nyourself.\n\n\n> Is that the same technology used in last year's emerging technology \n> SIGGRAPH session:\n> Seetzen, H., Stuerzlinger, W., Vorozcovs, A., Wilson, H.R., Ashdown, \n> I.,\n> Ward, W. and Whitehead, L., 2003, High Dynamic Range Display System. \n> SIGGRAPH 2003, Emerging Technologies Program.\n> http://www.siggraph.org/s2003/conference/etech/hdr.html\n\n\nWe actually have a full-blown paper in this year's Siggraph, which is \nnow online as well at Wolfgang Heidrich's website if you're interested:\n\n\n\thttp://www.cs.ubc.ca/~heidrich/Papers/index.html#siggraph\n\n\nThis is a very cool device, but is only available in limited quantities \nas a prototype to select companies and individuals.  Sunnybrook \nTechnologies (http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/ Vancouver, BC) hopes to be \nmanufacturing the real deal by next year.  As I said, even an HDR \nmonitor doesn't deal with surround issues, so it's really quite \ndifficult to reproduce the visual appearance of the real world in all \nit's glory.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001691.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 12, 2004 at 07:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001679", "id": "radiance-general_001691"}
