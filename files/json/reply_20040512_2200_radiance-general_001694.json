Probably not.\n\n\nHi!\n\n\nThe trick is to use the SAME illumination source ;-) I have done a \nnumber of such measurements in archeological context by simply taking a \ncamera and the color chart to the site. The method that is described in \nRendering with Radiance requires some installation (I think it was \ndeveloped to measure material values in some kind of \"studio\"). I did \nit a bit simpler: one person holds the chart next to the material, I \ntake a photo of the surface with the chart. As long as there is no \nvariation of lighting over the area (no highlights etc) this seams to \nbe a rather comfortable way, and I think for me it was accurate enough. \nOf course the chart should not cover the 5% of the area at the border - \nthe chances that it is in a different lighting situation is to high \nthan.\n\n\nHowever, any expensive hardware is fun - and maybe you can even compare \nthe results of the color chart way and the hardware way. I would be \ninterested in that ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
