{"body": "Hi Carsten, hi list!\n\n\n> if you look into the mirror, you don't see yourself upside down, so I \n> guess that formZ behaves correctly in leaving the normal unchanged \n> during mirroring :-)\n\n\nIn fact, it was what I had guessed. However, I wanted to be sure. Also, \nI wonder if there is any reason why the surface normal information is \nnot used from the triangle.\n\n\nI think, if I replace the call to fcross() in replmarks.c by a routine \nthat aligns the z-achsis to the surface normal, mirroring \ntransformations should be supported by replmarks, right? Is there a \nfunction to get the direction of the surface normal defined that I \ncould use (I am sure it is, I just don't know where ;-) ?\n\n\nSuch a feature in replmarks would be very useful for me, as I could use \njust the triangle markers I have and I would not have to search for \nmirrored objects in the whole model, which would certainly introduce \nerrors as I am rather sure that I would miss some objects.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
