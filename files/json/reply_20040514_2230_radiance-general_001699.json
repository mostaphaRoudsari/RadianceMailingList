{"body": "It seems to me that whatever convention you decide upon for mirroring \nobjects with replmarks, you are going to have to deal with some \nambiguity.  If you say that a downward pointing normal means the object \ngets mirrored, how do you know which axis to mirror?  There are three \nchoices, and all of them result in a mirrored object, but with very \ndifferent positions.  The logical choice if we're talking about the \nz-axis would be to mirror z, but that will result in an object \nprojecting into the ground in most cases.  How do you justify choosing \none axis to mirror over another?  It seems rather confusing from a \nuser's standpoint, or am I missing something obvious?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001699.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 14, 2004 at 10:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001663", "id": "radiance-general_001699"}
