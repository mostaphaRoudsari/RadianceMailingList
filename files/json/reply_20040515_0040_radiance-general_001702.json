{"body": "Hi, Greg\n Thank you. I am generating hyperspectral images using Radiance and also\nPsychotoolBox. For right now, I rendered 24 chips of the macbeth\nchecker board to test the code of generating right color of hyperspectral\nimages. But the color of the objects come out weird because the light has a yellowish\ncolor. So everything looks yellowish.\n\n\n  I follwed the thread of the specular reflectance. But i am not so clear\nwhat does the -st (specular thresold mean). Currently, I set the -st as\n0.1. But I found whatever falue I use for specular reflectance, the effect\nof the glossiness is not big.\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nBei\n\n\n On Fri, 14 May 2004, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001702.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bei Xiao", "created_at": "May 15, 2004 at 12:40AM", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001700", "id": "radiance-general_001702"}
