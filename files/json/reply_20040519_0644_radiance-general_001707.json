Interesting \nmaterials for light redirection are  non-lambertian, starting with \nsimple structures like outside louvers.\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001707.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "May 19, 2004 at 06:44AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001706", "id": "radiance-general_001707"}
