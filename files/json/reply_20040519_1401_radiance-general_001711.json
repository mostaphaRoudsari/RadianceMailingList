{"body": "> VIM - Vi IMproved 6.2 (2003 Jun 1, compiled Sep 26 2003 16:12:37)\n> Unknown option: \"-vp\"\n\n\nHi,\n\n\nthere was a discussion some time ago about the problem that the \nfilename \"rview\" is used by vi (a text editor) as well as radiance. \nAFAIK in newer releases of radiance, rview was renamed. The rview that \nreported the unknown option to you is from vi(m), not from radiance. \nYou could take a look at what the vi-rview is, maybe you don't need it \nand can rename it into rview.vi. \"which rview\" should point you to the \nfile that was executed when you wanted to start rview, it might be \n/usr/bin/rview. You can also get a cvs-snapshot of the current \nradiance-development-tree from www.radiance-online.org, if you want to \ncompile it on your own (or maybe someone offers binaries of the \ncvs-radiance?).\n\n\nGood luck, CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
