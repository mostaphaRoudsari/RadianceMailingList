{"body": "Hi Olga,\n\n\nNo one mentioned the simplest solution, which I suppose is obvious, of \nchanging your PATH environment variable in your shell so that the \nRadiance bin directory (/usr/local/bin by default) preceeds the \ndirectory containing vim (/usr/bin usually).  This will fix the problem \nwithout having to rename or reinstall anything.  Renaming Radiance's \n\"rview\" to \"rvu\" will break the concurrent release of \"rad,\" which \nstill calls \"rview\" to start an interactive rendering.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001716.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 19, 2004 at 04:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001710", "id": "radiance-general_001716"}
