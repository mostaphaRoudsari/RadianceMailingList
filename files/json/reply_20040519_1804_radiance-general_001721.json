{"body": "Another P.S...  Following the quoted conversation from Pillo, I went \noff and improved the material handling for sources (and virtual \nsources) so that it does look up the modifier tree past patterns and \nthings that might come between the material primitive and the object.  \n(If you understood that last sentence, you're probably in the top 2% of \nthis class.)  However, the code still isn't smart enough to consider \nmixfunc's that make material assignment as part of ray evaluation, \nwhich is basically incompatible with a priori assessments of which \nsurfaces are considered light sources and which surfaces aren't.  In \nother words, don't expect me to fix this anytime soon.\n\n\nIf you are trying to reflect objects in a surface, the \"mirror\" \nprimitive allows you to specify any alternate material you choose when \nit is not participating in the virtual source calculation.  This should \nbe enough to do what you want in most cases.\n\n\nThe Lord of Radiance has spoked.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001721.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 19, 2004 at 06:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001706", "id": "radiance-general_001721"}
