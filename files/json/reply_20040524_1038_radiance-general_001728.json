This is\nbecuase a (correctly specified) ground glow cannot account for the shading\nof the ground plane by the building (see Fig 6.8 in Rendering with Radiance).\nNo harm in having a ground glow as well as a ground plane.\n\n\nBoth of your questions are addressed (with examples given) in the\nnewly reprinted Rendering with Radiance book.
