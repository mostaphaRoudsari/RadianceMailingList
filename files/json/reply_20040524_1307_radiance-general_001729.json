{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nin my opinion it is a question of the used spectrum. RADIANCE itself \ncalculates completely within the visible spectrum. So the internal luminous\n efficacy of 179 lm/W is from visible to visible spectrum.\n\n\nThe commonly used  luminous efficacy is from the full spectrum (as e.g. \nmeasured by a pyranometer) to the visible. This efficacy strongly depend \non the actual sky state (Blue sky about 90 lm/W, overcast sky about 130 \nlm/W).\nIf you use \"gendaylit\", the perez-sky luminous efficacy model is used to \n\"transfer\" full-spectrum data into the visible range and gives good \nresults for the most sky situations.\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001729.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "May 24, 2004 at 01:07PM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001727", "id": "radiance-general_001729"}
