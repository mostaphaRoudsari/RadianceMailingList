{"body": "> Are ambient files really independent of the viewfile?\u00a0\n\n\nNo, not really ;-) They are, hmm... \"populated\" depending on the view, \nas the samples depend on the view. But if you change the view, the \nprior samples should still be valid (as long as you didn't change the \nscene). So the samples can be reused for different views.\n\n\nAs I understand the panoramic picture ambient file topic, the idea is \nto get the ambient file \"full\" before starting the actual rendering. \nThis is just the same idea that is behind the \"initial ambient file\" \ntrick, where people render the images in low resolution first, so that \nthe ambient file collects ambient data during a fast rendering, and \nwith that, the final rendering is started. You can get some problems if \nyou start the final rendering with an empty ambient file, as the \nchanges in the beginning can show up in the image.\n\n\nHowever, there should never be a reason not to re-use the ambient file \nin an unchanged scene and with unchanged ambient parameters (right?)!\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
