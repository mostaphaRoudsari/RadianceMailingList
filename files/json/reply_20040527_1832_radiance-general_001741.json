{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThe \"bad ray direction\" is a serious error, caused either by a \nmiscompiled binary or a corrupted ambient file.  Assuming it's the \nlatter, you should try deleting (or renaming) your ambient file before \nattempting recovery.  A corrupted ambient file is usually the result of \na faulty NFS lock manager.  See previous posts on this topic.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001741.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 27, 2004 at 06:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001740", "id": "radiance-general_001741"}
