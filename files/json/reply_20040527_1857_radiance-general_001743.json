{"body": "Thanks for your quick reply, Greg. I have more information\nthat may help our understanding.\n\n\nThe other options that the rendering used are\n\n\n-ps 1 -ab 2 -aa 0 -ad 8 -as 0 -dj 0.7 -st 0.05\n\n\nso I'm guessing it's not the ambient file. It is possible that\nwith all of the compiler optimizations that I used, I cut one\ntoo many corners.\n\n\nBut how does this explain the fact that I could always\n\"rpict -ro\" and it would continue where it left off, creating\na fine image in the end?\n\n\nIs there some way to find out what compile-time options\nI used? Is there a file in ray/src that contains that\ninformation?\n\n\nAlso, I seem to be unable to search the radiance-online\narchives for a whole phrase. How is this done?\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Thu, 27 May 2004, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001743.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "May 27, 2004 at 06:57PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001740", "id": "radiance-general_001743"}
