{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nYeah, I had similar problems with the gcc optimizer when I tried it.  \nIf you used makeall to set the options rather than doing it by hand on \nthe command line, you should be able to find your settings in the \n\"rmake\" script that gets put in your Radiance executables directory.  \n From my experiments under OS X at least, I couldn't approach your \nbenchmark speeds without simultaneously introducing some nefarious bug \nin the renderer.  I spent some time on it, but gave up trying to figure \nout where the calculations had gone south.  From what I've seen with \ngcc problems in the past, they can be incredibly subtle.  (At one \npoint, the optimizer was giving incorrect arithmetic results inside a \nsimple loop -- 2+2 = 5 and that sort of nonsense.)\n\n\nI can't explain why rpict would be able to recover using the -ro option \nwhere rpiece cannot.  When code doesn't compile right, it's anybody's \nguess as to what's going on.\n\n\nI also don't know how to search the archives for phrases -- maybe Peter \nA-B or someone familiar with our system could help with that one?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001748.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 27, 2004 at 10:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001740", "id": "radiance-general_001748"}
