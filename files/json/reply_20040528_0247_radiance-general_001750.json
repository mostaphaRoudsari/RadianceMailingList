Standards conforming mail systems always\npreserve this header, and a reply will have an \"In-Reply-To\"\nheader referencing the message ID of the original.\n\n\nNovell GroupWise fails to preserve/add those headers.\nTo solve the problem, simply use a decent mail system. Either by\nswitching to an external service, or by convincing your employer\nto dump GroupWise.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001750.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "May 28, 2004 at 02:47AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001731", "id": "radiance-general_001750"}
