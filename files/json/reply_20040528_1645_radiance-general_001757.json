{"body": "Hi Barbara,\n\n\nMentioned on Axel Jacob's webpage \n(http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/ as noted by Dr. M) is my \napplication called Photosphere that enables one to manage and assemble \nHDR images from multiple exposures.  To facilitate camera-based \nphotometric work, I have recently added a calibration feature to obtain \nmore accurate absolute luminances from the resulting HDR images.  \nPhotosphere currently works only under Mac OS X, though I've been \nsearching around for someone with sufficient talent and free time to \nport it to Windoze.  Photosphere (and the command-line version \n\"hdrgen\") may be found at my personal website:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/\n\n\nOutput to Radiance as well as LogLuv and floating-point TIFF, and now \nOpenEXR formats are supported.  If you want some examples of HDR \nimages, check out Erik Reinhard's website as well:\n\n\n\thttp://www.cs.utah.edu/~reinhard/cdrom/hdr.html\n\n\nI have a whole slew of HDR images I've created with Photosphere, but \nhave not found a place to put them on the web as yet.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Say \"hej\" to Oyvind for me!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001757.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 28, 2004 at 04:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001754", "id": "radiance-general_001757"}
