{"body": "Surface normals are definitely a hack, but a worthwhile one in many  \ncases.  Radiance does it's level best to deal with perturbed normals in  \nthe ambient calculation and elsewhere.  Results aren't always perfect,  \nbut hey -- it's Radiance, not Renderman!\n\n\nTo remove surface normal interpolation from a .OBJ file (converted with  \nobj2rad), apply the -f option.  To eliminate them from 3DS files when  \nyou used 3ds2mgf, you can use the little-known mgfilt program after  \n3ds2mgf and before mgf2rad (there really should be a -f option added to  \nmgf2rad, I suppose).  Here's an example:\n\n\n\t3ds2mgf building.3ds\n\tmgfilt  \n'#,c,cct,cone,cmix,cspec,cxy,cyl,ed,f,ies,ir,m,o,p,prism,rd,ring,rs,side \ns,sph,td,torus,ts,v,xf,fh' building.mgf | mgf2rad > building.rad\n\n\nA nasty command just to remove surface normals, but it beats writing a  \nscript (for most people).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001760.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 28, 2004 at 05:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001751", "id": "radiance-general_001760"}
