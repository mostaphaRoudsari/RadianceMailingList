{"body": "As discussed in earlier postings, the HEAD release is a much better, \nmore solid starting point than the official release at this point.  We \nreally need to make a proper 3.6 release, but I've been waiting for \nGeorg Mischler to get settled with his many ANSI and Windows \nimprovements to the source tree.  Following that, we should have a \nperiod of testing, where we encourage people to download and compile \nthe latest HEAD, and during which time we fix only compile problems and \nbugs that are found before making an official release.  This would \nhopefully be more solid than the scantily-tested 3.5 official release \nof last year.\n\n\nSchorsch, what does your schedule look like?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-May/000359.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 28, 2004 at 05:47PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000358", "id": "radiance-dev_000359"}
