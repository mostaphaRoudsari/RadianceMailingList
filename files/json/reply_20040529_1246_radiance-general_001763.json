If you \nvary the aperture, your images may not be consisent in focus, \nparticularly in near field photography. This course assumes the digicam \nimplement f-stops traditionally with an actual diaphragm. If it simply \nmodulates the CCD gain (as I believe most El Cheapo digicams tend to do) \nthis is all moot anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
