But what do e.g. 471100 photons really mean \nin terms of accuracy or even image appearance? (my personal rule of \nthumb is: never start with less than a million photons to get anything \ngood-looking :-))\n\n\nBut I don't have a better idea, either, and concerning the lack of \nintuitivity, the photon-map in fact fits perfectly into the rest of the\nRadiance-parametermania :-) (viewed from a non-scientists point of view)\n\n\nAdditionally, the photon-map currently is not adaptive, distributing and\ngathering are strictly separated. So controlling pmap 'form the output\nend of the line', i.e. the image, is not possible now. For comparison, \nin the ambient case addtional samples (the supersamples) are produced \nif the calculation doesn't meet a given accuracy criterion.(OK, this \naccuracy criterion is again rather obscure ...)\nAnd I know, I know, I know of course similar adaptive behaviour would be\nfar more complex in the pmap case. Maybe one would even end in something \nlike the metropolis stuff ...\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001764.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "May 30, 2004 at 07:01PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001745", "id": "radiance-general_001764"}
