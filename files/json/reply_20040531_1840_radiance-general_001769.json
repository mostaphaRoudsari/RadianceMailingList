{"body": "Hi Leslie,\n\n\nThe last official release of Radiance installs the interactive viewer, \n\"rview,\" which is named the same as a symbolic link to \"vim\".  If you \nchose as your executable directory /usr/bin, where vim lives, you may \nhave overwritten the original vim executable by mistake.  This is why \nit's a good idea to use /usr/local/bin or some special directory for \nRadiance executables.  (The default is \"/usr/local/bin\" in the makeall \ninstallation script.)\n\n\nIn the HEAD version and the next release, we have renamed \"rview\" to \n\"rvu\" to avoid this conflict in the future.\n\n\nYou will need to retrieve the \"vim\" executable from backup to get it \nback -- sorry!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001769.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 31, 2004 at 06:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001768", "id": "radiance-general_001769"}
