{"body": "Hi Olga,\n\n\nIt seems you did misunderstand a bit.  Rtrace is the underlying \ncomputational engine that permits the holodeck interactive program to \noperate.  Rtrace does the raw ray-tracing, and the holodeck program \nhandles user interaction and display update.  For more details on \nrunning rholo, see the manual page at:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rholo.1.html\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001782.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 09, 2004 at 06:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001781", "id": "radiance-general_001782"}
