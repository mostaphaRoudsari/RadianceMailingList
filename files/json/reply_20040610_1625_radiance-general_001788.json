Essentially, the dynamic range of the images \nhas gaps between them or is clipped on either side of the range. Try:\n\n\n- Taking images at smaller f-stop intervals\n- remove images that are too bright or too dark\n- include darker or lighter images.\n\n\nWe keep having this problem with webhdr, but here doesn't seem to be a \nrule of thumb for getting it right. If the worst comes to the worst, you \ncan disable hdrgen's built-in auto exposure routine and do a hand-jobby, \nbut this is more difficult.\nhttps://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/\n\n\nYou should also save the coefficients from a run that doesn't create any \nerrors/warning and re-use them when you do get them. Please note that \nthe response curve is/can be different even between two cameras of the \nsame model/make, so don't mix-n-match them.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001788.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 10, 2004 at 04:25PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001788"}
