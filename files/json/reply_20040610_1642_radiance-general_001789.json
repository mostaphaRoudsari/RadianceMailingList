{"body": "just a quick extra question about HDR and light sources:\n\n\nsupposing that with a camera we have got some images,\n\n\n1 we calculate the HDR image\n2 we measure on the mac screen the luminance with ximage\n3 we measure the luminance in the real scene.\n4 we compare the numbers and find a factor ( k=lum(hdr):lum(real) ).\n\n\n\n\nis this factor independent from the spectrum of the light source once that\nthe camera is 'calibrated' or it is related to it?\nlike in the case of: sun, low pressure sodium, MH, mercury lamps, theatre\nblue filtered light....\nis the correction factor (k) constant for these different conditions?\nif not is there a best calibration environment (D65 or something else)?\n\n\nmany thanks,\ngiulio\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001789.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "June 10, 2004 at 04:42PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001789"}
