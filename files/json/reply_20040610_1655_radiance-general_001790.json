{"body": "Hi Olga,\n\n\nIt sounds like one of your files (probably the octree) got truncated.  \nThis usually happens when you abort a make.  Try running \"make clean\" \nfirst, then \"make sholo\".  If you still have troubles, type \"which \ngetinfo\" to make sure you don't have some other executable taking \nRadiance's place.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001790.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 10, 2004 at 04:55PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001781", "id": "radiance-general_001790"}
