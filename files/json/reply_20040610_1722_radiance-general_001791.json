In zones of extreme contrast, it's \nquite difficult to accurately sample a scene with a handheld luminance \nmeter with the same precision that pextrem -o can find the peaks. The \nfactor derived from peak values is different from the factor derived \nfrom other values, I've found. Which is right?  If the real scene and \nthe HDR are within a certain precentage of each other, do you call them \nsynonomous?  I'd love to hear others weigh in on this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001791.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 10, 2004 at 05:22PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001791"}
