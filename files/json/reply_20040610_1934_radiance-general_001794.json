{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nI`m not sure about this, but the way I understand the calibration procedure,\nyou have three curves (one for each rgb color) that relate the pixel values\nin the jpegs to the luminance values. On the other hand, most cameras have\nsome built in correction functions for different light sources, so I guess\neach correction function (daylight, tubes, etc.) will have different\nresponse curves for the three colors (in order to compensate for the\ndifferent source spectra). However, if you use always the same correction\nfunction in the camera (not the auto-correction, which is changing all the\ntime, this really got me confused for a while), you`ll get good results with\nany light source (probably there is still some error caused by the rgb being\ndifferent from the CIE observer... is it?)\n\n\nSo, for example, if you make your calibration with the camera set up for\ndaylight, then you should use it always with the daylight correction, even\nif you are measuring a scene lit up with tubes. The images will look\ngreenish, but the values will be calculated according to the correct\ncalibration curves. I`ve tried some measurings (not with such wide range of\nconditions, but) using daylight compensation for an indoor scene, with good\nresults.\nI hope this makes some sense, got too long...\nSaludos,\n\n\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001794.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "June 10, 2004 at 07:34PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001794"}
