{"body": "Martin,\n\n\n>Ah yes, I had been meaning to try the camera calibration technique but I \n>hadn't come around to it. It turns out to be very useful. But I still have \n>some issues.

I \ndon't know if this could cause the prob.\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nPS: I don't know if Greg has recently updated hdrgen. My copy is >6 \nmonths old (LINUX).\n\n\nPPS: With the two darkest and the two brightest images excluded, there \nis a poor convergence for orders 1 and 5 fit, but still no distortions.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001796.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 11, 2004 at 11:43AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001796"}
