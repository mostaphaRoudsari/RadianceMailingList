{"body": "> I hdr'ed all ouf the 13 images in one go, and apart for some 'poor\n> convergence' (orders 1, 3, 4 and 5) warnings, it worked fine. There is\n> no apparent distortion.\n\n\nI repeated the process using the manual mode of the camera rather than \naperture priority. Again 13 images (same room, scene was a bit different as I \neliminated the sky in the framing) and I was able to compute a hdr. But the \nalignment problem still persists, I use the -a switch to turn it off.\n\n\nLater I took a couple more images and used the calibration data to compute a \nhdr and read the luminance values off it. It turns out that those are \nsomewhat accurate so that's a good sign!\n\n\nHowever, I'm still not quite satisfied. Obviously, the calibration procedure \nis meant to give a most accurate static description of the camera, but I used \nthe camera's automatic whitebalance correction, so that's a variable. My \nquestion is a complete novice one: how does the whitebalance affect the \nluminance? What can I do to eliminate this variable (if it is significant).\n\n\n\n\nMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001798.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Matusiak", "created_at": "June 11, 2004 at 02:17PM", "created_by": "Martin_Matusiak", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001798"}
