{"body": "Hi again.\n\n\nWell, I played around with limiting the saturation on patches, and it \nonly seems to make matters worse; I'm not sure why.  I think it's \nbecause you don't have enough unsaturated pixels in your scene for it \nto work, but I'll have to perform some more experiments to determine \nthat for certain.  For now, you'll just have to find a more \"neutral\" \nscene to perform your calibration on, then save the response function \nand reuse it for other scenes, which is what I've been doing.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001802.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 11, 2004 at 06:18PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001802"}
