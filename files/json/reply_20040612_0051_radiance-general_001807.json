This is a general rule to point right the fitting.\n\n\nThe IES specifies:\n\n\n[...]\nThis integer value indicates the type of photometric web used for the\nphotometric measurements as follows:\n\n\n  Value Description\n\n\n    1   Type C photometry\n    2   Type B photometry\n    3   Type A photometry\n\n\nLuminaires are photometered by locating the luminaire at the center of\nan imaginary sphere and measuring the light intensity (candela) values\nat grid points (the \"photometric web') on the sphere's surface. The\norientation of the luminaire's axes relative to that of the sphere\ndetermines the photometric type.\n\n\nType C photometry is normally used for architectural and roadway\nluminaires. The polar axis of the photometric web coincides with the\nvertical axis of the luminaire, and the 0-180 degree photometric plane\ncoincides with the luminaire's major axis (length).\n\n\nType B photometry is normally used for adjustable outdoor area and\nsports lighting luminaires. The polar axis of the luminaire coincides\nwith the minor axis (width) of the luminaire, and the 0-180 degree\nphotometric plane coinicides with the luminaire's vertical axis.\n\n\nType A photometry is normally used for automotive headlights and signal\nlights. The polar axis of the luminaire coincides with the major axis\n(length) of the luminaire, and the 0-180 degree photometric plane\ncoinicides with the luminaire's vertical axis.\n[...]\n\n\nNormally the major axis in the type C (the most used) coincides whit\nthe lengt of the lamps. If the lamp is vertical in the fitting, like a\ndownlight, the luminous flux is normaly simmetric so is not important\nwhich is the 0-180 plane.\n\n\nIf the fitting has an asymmetric reflector, then the direction of the\nmax flux coincides at 90\u00b0 (0\u00b0 3 o'clock, 90\u00b0 12 o'clock)\n\n\n> because the spec is so loosely written.
