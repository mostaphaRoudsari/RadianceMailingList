{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nIt's pretty simple, really.  The macro:\n\n\n#define  VERTEX(f,n)\t((f)->va + 3*(n))\n\n\nIs designed to be used where you might otherwise use an FVECT.  To get \nthe y-coordinate of the first vertex, you would use:\n\n\n\tVERTEX(myface_pointer,0)[1]\n\n\nThe z-coordinate of the second vertex would be:\n\n\n\tVERTEX(myface_pointer,1)[2]\n\n\nLikewise, you can pass it to a function that takes an FVECT argument, \nas in:\n\n\n\tfcross(vres, v1, VERTEX(myface_pointer,1));\n\n\nHopefully, you get the idea.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-June/000362.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 12, 2004 at 07:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000361", "id": "radiance-dev_000362"}
