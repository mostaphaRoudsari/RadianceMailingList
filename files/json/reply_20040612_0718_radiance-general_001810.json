{"body": "Hi Pillo,\n\n\nBasically, I'm writing to agree with Santiago.  If you want repeatable \nmeasurements, you have to fix your camera's white balance to a \nparticular setting.  Otherwise, the response curves for the three \nchannels will change.  Technically, the camera merely applies a \ndifferent multiplier to its three channels, but it does this in a color \nspace other than RGB -- a space we cannot know after the image has been \nrecorded in a JPEG or TIFF.  Because we cannot know when and how the \ncamera's gamma/contrast curve is applied relative to its color \ntransformation(s), it is not possible to back this out.  The best we \ncan do is keep the color space transitions constant by fixing the white \nbalance and contrast settings on the camera, and let hdrgen do its best \nto estimate the response function on the result.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001810.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 12, 2004 at 07:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001787", "id": "radiance-general_001810"}
