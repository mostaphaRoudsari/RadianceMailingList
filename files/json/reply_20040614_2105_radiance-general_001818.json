I also \nwent the El Cheapo way and used a mirror in my lightpipe tests (see pmap \nwebpage). As I understand it, Anthony wants to simulate an actual \nprismatic panel which transmits and redirects light coming from the \npipe. This is certainly more elegant (and realistic), but simply not \ndoable with the current pmap implementation. Anthony will most likely \nhave to go the awkward way with a separate transmitting (nonredirecting) \npanel followed by a mirror in order to circumvent the limitations of the \nsystem. Come to think of it, do you need a panel at all, then?\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
