{"body": "Hi Olga,\n\n\nThere is no method provided for looking at the ray values in a holodeck \nin ASCII format, as I never found this useful even for debugging \npurposes.  The data is organized in a very hard-to-understand way, and \nthe individual ray values are so many that I'm not sure what you would \ndo with them if you had them.  However, there are a couple of useful \nutilities for holodecks that you might enjoy:\n\n\nrhinfo\t- prints the header and grid information from a holodeck file\nrhcopy\t- copies information from one holodeck to another, or from a \npicture to a holodeck\nrhoptimize\t- optimizes beam placements in a holodeck for more efficient \nrendering\nrhpict\t- reconstructs a picture from beams stored in a holodeck\n\n\nWhat purpose did you have in mind for recovering ray values?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001822.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 21, 2004 at 07:20AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001821", "id": "radiance-general_001822"}
