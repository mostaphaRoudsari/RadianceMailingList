{"body": "Thanks for your reply, Greg!\n\n\nThe purpose is to try to manipulate a holodeck file in terms of inserting an\nartificial object (like a mirrored shpere) into a laser scan of a room. Of\ncourse it is possible to do so in the appropriate .rad file (or in the octree),\nbut I was just wondering if it's also possible to do it directly by changing\nthe actual holodeck file. This is why I wanted to see the actual values.\n\n\n-Olga\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001824.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "O Graf", "created_at": "June 21, 2004 at 01:05PM", "created_by": "O_Graf", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001821", "id": "radiance-general_001824"}
