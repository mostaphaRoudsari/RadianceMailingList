Adding the object to the octree is a \nmuch more robust solution, however.  If you were to insert samples \nusing rhcopy, you could end up with some odd reconstruction errors in \nrholo.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001825.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 21, 2004 at 02:26PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001821", "id": "radiance-general_001825"}
