{"body": "Greg, in this case I'm looking at a 20' linear fluorescent\nIndirect/Direct pendant.  The IES file is for a 4' section and I would\narray it 5 times.  A sphere with 2' diameter would probably not work if\nthe suspension length were less than 2' since this is a partially\nindirect pendant..  Also, not sure if having the pendant poking through\nthe illum sphere would work.\n\n\nI thought of a different way of handling this.  Since the ies2rad\nprogram creates the top and bottom rectangles in this case, why not just\nuse an illum material with a void modifier to create the edges of the\nbox?\n\n\nThanks for the response.  It would certainly be faster to use the -i\noption.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001838.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "June 24, 2004 at 03:23PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001833", "id": "radiance-general_001838"}
