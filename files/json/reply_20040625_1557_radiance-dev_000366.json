{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nJust out of curiosity, for diagnostic purposes have you tried to run \njust two rpiece jobs on one opteron host (assuming these are dual cpu \nhosts)? This might be one way to diagnose if there are compile problems \nversus NFS problems. I know that setting up NFS locking on Linux \nrequires some pretty careful tailoring of the server and client \nconfiguration and mount options. I have never really been sure that I \nhave been able to set it up properly myself.\n\n\nAlso what are you using to tie your \"cluster\" together if anything? \nObviously the most basic solution is NFS with file locking and rpiece. \nThere are other solutions such as beowolf with bproc and some kind of \nshared filesystem space such as GFS or others such as openMosix with \nMFS/DFS (I tried this at one point and encountered some problems).\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-June/000366.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "June 25, 2004 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000364", "id": "radiance-dev_000366"}
