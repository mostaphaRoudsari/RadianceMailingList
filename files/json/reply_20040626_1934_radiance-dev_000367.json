{"body": "I'm using the \"-aa 0\" option, so I don't store an ambient file.\n\n\nCarsten gave me the idea of looking in the cone intersection\ncode, as the error stems from the normal, somehow. I realized\nthat the cones in my scene are very narrow (0.01 long, but\nradii are 0.0001 and 0.0). I know very little about raytracing\ncalculations, but I'd guess that a ray-cone intersection test\npossibly involves a division of a radius (or radius difference)\nand a length. This may puch the calculation towards machine\nprecision...enough so that a normal may not be calculated\naccurately.\n\n\nHere are two cones (one at a tip, and one just before\ntransitioning to cylinders):\n\n\ndef cone 0c 0 0 8\n-0.525577 -0.177557 -0.381599  -0.526188 -0.185438 -0.38283  0\n0.0001391\n\n\ndef cone 18c 0 0 8\n-0.505553 -0.317633 -0.401908  -0.502736 -0.324996 -0.403267\n0.0039803 0.004\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Fri, 25 Jun 2004 gward at lmi.net wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-June/000367.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "June 26, 2004 at 07:34PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000364", "id": "radiance-dev_000367"}
