{"body": "I guess, I've solved the problem with -r option of the rholo command. My mistake\nwas that I used\n\n\nrholo -o ogl -r bar.hdk bar.hif        instead of\nrholo -o ogl -r bar.hdk\n\n\nBut I still can't see any changes in the bar.hdk. Actually I've done the\nfollowing: (bar.hdk is a holodeck file from a laser scan of a real bar room)\n\n\nrholo -n 1 -o ogl bar.hdk bar.hif         to calculate the destination hdk-file\nrholo -n 1 -o ogl sphere.hdk sphere.hif   to calculate the second hdk-file\nrhcopy bar.hdk -h sphere.hdk              to copy sphere into bar\nrholo -o ogl bar.hdk                      to view the changed bar-file without\n                                          overwriting the values\n\n\nMaybe I am just missing some important bit of the whole procedure?\n\n\n\n\n-Olga\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001847.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "O Graf", "created_at": "June 27, 2004 at 01:54PM", "created_by": "O_Graf", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001844", "id": "radiance-general_001847"}
