A little ditty from a year or so ago? \nYou sent me this tip when I asked you how to get illuminance on a \nbuilding's curtain wall.  The first rtrace computes the intersection \npoint (which is fast) and the second rtrace does the illuminance \ncalculation.  Cool, yes?  Yes.\n\n\nNow, given this little tip, could he use trans as I described?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001856.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 28, 2004 at 09:05PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001849", "id": "radiance-general_001856"}
