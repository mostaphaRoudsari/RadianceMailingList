If this technique works not only would it do that\nbut hopefully (maybe) render the image much faster also. It might take a\nlittle while but if I come up with anything interesting I'll report back.\n\n\nJim Estes\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001857.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jim Estes", "created_at": "June 29, 2004 at 05:31AM", "created_by": "Jim_Estes", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001849", "id": "radiance-general_001857"}
