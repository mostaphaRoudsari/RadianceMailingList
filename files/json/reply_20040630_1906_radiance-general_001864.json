{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nthank You for the reply.\n\n\n> 2.\tfinal reflectance set by base material - colorpict is used to \n> modify reflectance set by material, that is normpat image colorpict \n> modifier is used to modify reflectance set by material\n\n\nI want to do this, I have the material values, the colorpict is just to \nadd some visual credibility ;-) But I also want to have the final \noverall (that means the average over the whole surface, like selecting \nan area in ximage vs. a point) color from the base material.\n\n\n> So steps as follows:\n>\n> 1.\tacquire sample material image by photography, scan....\n> 2.\tcallibrate sample image with macbethcal\n> 3.\tuse callibrated sample image to estimate average color\n> 4.\tcalculate reflectance based on average color values, grey(r,g,b)\n> 5.\tnormpat the callibrated image\n\n\nSo, if I already have the rgb for the base material (which is plastic), \ndo I really have to calibrate (macbethcal) the picture map?\n\n\nMaybe I show you an example:\n\n\n# porphyry red 1: values from ximage and macbethcal'ed pic\nvoid plastic porphyry_red_1\n0\n0\n5 .09 .06 .05 .02 0\n\n\n# non-calibrated normpat'ed pic\nvoid colorpict sophia_porphyry_red_1_pattern\n13 noop noop noop sophia_porphyry_red_1.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v \n-s .2 -rx 90 -rz 90\n0\n0\n\n\n# give alias the modifier as output from dxf2rad\nsophia_porphyry_red_1_pattern alias l_porphyry_red_1 porphyry_red_1\n\n\nWill this be correct?\n\n\nTIA, CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
