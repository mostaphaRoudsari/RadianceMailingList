{"body": "Model comparisons are tricky. All sorts of calibration and measurement error5s occur.  Do not use a 0.5 m box because it is too small (near field photometry problems). In addition, black has a reflectance of 5% unless you have a heavy sand texture, which gets it down to 2%. \n\n\nA comparison between radiosity code and radiance code is at \n\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/agi_rad.pdf\n\n\n\n\nThe reflectance is 50% diffuse.\n\n\nMartin, Penn State\n\n\nP.S. I would have to run point by point values to do a complete error analysis, but either Radiance or AGI32 1.7 draws the PAR beam not right. The Radiance beam looks a little bit too soft. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Martin,\n\n\nThanks for the reference file.\n\n\nHave you published any comparison or know of any comparison for lamps and\nenclosures such as a black box?\n\n\nI have constructed a simple 0.5 cube with black walls and lamp socket\ncentral to the ceiling. Should I replace my GE lamp with the PAR lamp?\n\n\nWith the par lamp file you sent me, do I simple draw the lamp as per its\nactual dimensions, and assign the rad file to it?\n\n\nRegards, and thanks for the help,\n\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001870.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "July 01, 2004 at 05:46PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001861", "id": "radiance-general_001870"}
