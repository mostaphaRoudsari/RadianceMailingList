{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> Ok, lets jump into the ring :-)\n> Hmm, maybe Lars want three things at once:\n> 1) get the physics right\n> 2) preserve the average color appearance of the material base\n> 3) add the additional color variation from the map without disturbing \n> 1+2 in the average..\n\n\nYes!!!!

It's similar to what normpat \nis doing, only it doesn't normalize to 1/1/1, but to R/G/B values I \nknow as the average material color (->brightness). I think I will have \nto take a look at normpat to find out how it does that in detail - \nwould be a nice tool if it could bring pictures to (known) color values.\n\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
