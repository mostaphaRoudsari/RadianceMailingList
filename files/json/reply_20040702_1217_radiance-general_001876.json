You probably won't get away without some manual \ninteraction, e.g. deciding which color-ranges to convert.\n\n\nBTW, if it is not so important to use exactly that picture, but just to \nhave a marble stone pattern, you might try out the procedural stone \ncolor patterns I've provided in my 2002 workshop contribution (available \non the radiance-online site). Here you can set the rgb values of the \ncolor-map explicitely to the ones you need.\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001876.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "July 02, 2004 at 12:17PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001837", "id": "radiance-general_001876"}
