{"body": "Hi Martin,\nI have a couple of questions about your study:\nWhen you say that \n\"The error drops to around 5 % at 3 ambient bounces. \" \ndo you mean \"difference\"  between radiance and agi32?\ndid you calculate the analytical solution?\nIf you considered the agi32 solution to be the right one, what about\nchanging the mesh density or the number of iteration\ndoes the solution converge to a unique value?\n\n\nAbout the Radiance parameters you used:\n\"rtrace -ab 1/2/3/4/5  -ad 512 -as 256 -ar 5000 -ds .1 octree ...\" \ndid you tested the scene while changing -aa and -ad? which is the -aa value\nyou used?\nI personally would increase settings for -ad,-as,-aa and reduce -ar to keep\na balance speed/accuracy.\n(-ar seems to me a little too high for your scene, compared to ad)\nThat's also interesting: time vs accuracy.\n\n\nBut at the end of the day: is it your scene particularly general?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001888.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "July 07, 2004 at 11:20AM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001886", "id": "radiance-general_001888"}
