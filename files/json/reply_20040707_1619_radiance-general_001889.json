{"body": "Hi Charles,\n\n\nthank You very much for this information. It seams to be a bit like the \ndistilled information about oconv, octrees and instances over the years \n;-), and that was just what I need... Maybe one should start a \nRadiance-FAQ on radiance-online.org...\n\n\nI will try to use the nested-instances method you describes. Is the \nnumber of sub-instances fixed or just resulting from the -n 8 option? \nNested instances represent very well the hierarchic structure of my \nmodel. So far, I used instances for the smaller elements (with \nreplmarks)  and xformed whole building blocks containg all the \ninstances. If I replace the xform transformations by the useage of \n\"super-instances\", I arrive at the nested instance model, however, I \nwould have about 40 instances in a typical \"super-instance\". So should \nI change the -n to 40?\n\n\nSo far, I could not see any errors cause by the -r 256 option, I just \nguessed that I could reduce memory needs by reducing -r, as the default \nwas much lower in old versions of radiance and I remember quite well \nwhat happened when I had to increase -r some time ago...\n\n\nAnyway... in the worst case, I will have to give up instancing and do \nthe brute-force method with a lot of geometry, a very large octree and \nhigh memory needs. I just don't want to as I don't know how much \ngeometry will be added in the future, and also the excessive \napplication of colorpicts makes me think about memory...\n\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
