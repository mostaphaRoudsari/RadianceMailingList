I am curious to see how theses  products\nperform with the same data.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nPierre-Felix Breton\nLighting consultant\n\n\n(and Discreet 3d R&D designer)\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001893.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pierre-Felix Breton", "created_at": "July 07, 2004 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Pierre-Felix_Breton", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001886", "id": "radiance-general_001893"}
