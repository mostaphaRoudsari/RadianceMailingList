The real problem is that Xcode won't support rview, rholo, \nand ximage--those would have to be given a native Mac interface, \nprobably a Cocoa interface.  Unfortunately, there's a maintenance issue \n(ANSIfication, which I am told is not quite complete) that the Radiance \ndevelopment collective would need to address before a Cocoa interface \nto these apps can be written.\n\n\nMeanwhile Georg Mischler's Rayfront <http://www.schorsch.com/> \naddresses your issues under X Windows.  I'm not sure he has it running \non Mac OS X, but it would probably be a simple port.  However, it would \nbe a Unix app--not Mac-like at all.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001896.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "July 07, 2004 at 11:04PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001894", "id": "radiance-general_001896"}
