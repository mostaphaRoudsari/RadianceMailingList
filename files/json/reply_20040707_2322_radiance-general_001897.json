We have the sources\nof Winrview, where we can borrow some of the logic about how to\npaint the image and other stuff.\n\n\nThere are several GUI builders around that could be used for\nthis. The most promising one used to be BoaConstructor, although\ndevelopment on that one seems to have slowed down.\nThe UI description files produced by Glade can also be used,\neven on those platforms where WxWidgets doesn't use Gtk.\n\n\nhttp://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/ (fetch from CVS)\nhttp://wxglade.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nThere will be a lot of details to solve, but those belong to\nthe dev-list. Any volunteers? ;)\n\n\n\n\n> Or - Ive heard and kind of experienced that each scene has its own quirks\n> and needs - maybe a simple scene would not give a reasonable idea of what\n> would be needed for a complex scene.\n\n\nYes, that's entirely correct. You need to play with the real thing.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001897.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "July 07, 2004 at 11:22PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001894", "id": "radiance-general_001897"}
