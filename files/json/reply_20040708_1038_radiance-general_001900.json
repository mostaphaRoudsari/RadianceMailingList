{"body": "Rob,\n\n\n> BTW, did you know that you can \n> change parameters in rv(ie)u with the 'set' command, and then type 'new' \n> to re-render the image?\n\n\nAs far as I'm aware, you could only do that once when filling\nthe ambient cache - say, changing the ab setting from 0 to 1.\nThereafter, rview will continue to re-use the ambient cache as originally\npopulated first time round.  The calculation may add to it, but it won't\nflush it out and start again.  Any further changes to ambient parameters\nusually lead to inconsistent and, most likely, misleading results.\nThe only way to be sure is to kill the session and start again.\n\n\nNow that certainly used to be the case.  Does anyone know if rview has\nbeen modified to flush out the ambient calc and restart during the\nsame session?  Actually, there would be very little to gain over\nquitting and restarting as the calculation has to begin from er... the\nbeginning for both.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic                     \nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk   \nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001900.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "July 08, 2004 at 10:38AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001894", "id": "radiance-general_001900"}
