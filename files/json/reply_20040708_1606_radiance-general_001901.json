Honestly, I only change parameters \nthat affect a visual change and it's purely for aesthetic reasons. \nIncreasing the ambient bounces to see the interior of a daylit space, or \nincreasing the direct sampling to see the pattern of a linear \nfluorescent that's close to the ceiling, for example.  But if what you \nsay is still the case, surely my tip is useless for analytical work.\n\n\nThanks for the heads up, the Robs thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001901.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 08, 2004 at 04:06PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001894", "id": "radiance-general_001901"}
