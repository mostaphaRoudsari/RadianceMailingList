{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe -n parameter is the maximum allowed number of objects per \"voxel\".  A voxel in Radiance lingo would be cubic piece of space.  The oconv program sub-divides the scene until all voxels contain no more than -n number of objects--be they spheres, polygons, whatever.   Since an instance counts as one object, the fact that it (the instance) contains sub-instances is irrelevant. So no, keep -n at 8.\n\n\nThe number of times that an instance can be recursively instanced inside of super-instances is, I imagine, a fixed number based upon the size of a varriable--of which Greg would be the best to advise.\n\n\nPerhaps the default value for -n should be 8 considering the likelihood that architectural scenes will contain square-ish and cubical entities.  The impact on rendering time should be negligible, I presume.\n\n\nGreg boasted that using sub-instances it is possible to model the entire planet earth down to a resolution of one inch without any loss of geometric precision in the ray-intersection calculation.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\nDate: Wed, 7 Jul 2004 17:19:49 +0300\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001904.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "July 08, 2004 at 11:27PM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001882", "id": "radiance-general_001904"}
