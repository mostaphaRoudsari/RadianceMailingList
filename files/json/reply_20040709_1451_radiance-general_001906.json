{"body": "> building.\u00a0 Applying mkillum avoids this error, besides accounting for\n> the framing of the window panes and the circular shape of the opening.\n>\n\n\nHi,\n\n\nto recall what this is about, Greg suggested to use one illum surface \ncovering the whole of a window made of small panes fixed in stone \nframes (I sent an URL pointing to a mini-pdf showing that in detail).\n\n\nNow I wonder... afaik the window frames will disappear in the indirect \ncalculation, as the average over the whole covering surface is used as \nsource, right (of course the frames are counted when calculating this \naverage)? So shadowing from these frames will only be visible when \nwindows are hit by a dircet source (the sun), while those frames e.g. \non the north walls won't cast shadows. The only way to change this \nwould be to use subdivisioning of the illum surface.\n\n\nAm I right here? I have to decide that modeling topic now, and I am \nstill not really sure about it. If I have to use subdivided illum \nsurfaces, I think that manually defining each pane as ONE illum surface \n(so that subdividing would not be necessary any more) is better than \nmaking a subdivision that doesn't exactly fit the panes.\n\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
