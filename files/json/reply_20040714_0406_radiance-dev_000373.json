{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nI don't see why we couldn't link this in.  I wonder how expensive it is \n-- I looked into implementing it myself following his Siggraph \npresentation, but it looked a bit too complex at the time.  Taking the \nsource code and adding it to the tree wouldn't be particularly \ndifficult.  I assume you'd find it useful if you're asking for it -- \nthanks for pointing out its availability.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-July/000373.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 14, 2004 at 04:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000371", "id": "radiance-dev_000373"}
