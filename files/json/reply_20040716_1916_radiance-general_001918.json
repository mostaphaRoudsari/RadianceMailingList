{"body": "Beware to those who attempt to read the Radiance source code -- it is \nnot meant for human eyes!  I have trouble interpreting it, myself.  The \nbest I can say for it is that it compiles well, most of the time....\n\n\nThough it's true that gensky uses a different efficacy for the sky \nconversion, it only does this when the zenith brightness is being \ncomputed from turbidity, which is an iffy proposition at best.  If you \nuse either the -b or -B options to enter your own zenith radiance or \nirradiance (from TRY data or on-site measurements), it is YOUR \nresponsibility to convert from whatever was measured to the right units \nfor your simulation.  If you took a luminance measurement on a gray \nsky, then you should divide by 179.  If your sky has some color to it, \nyou should take this into account as Chas recommends.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001918.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 16, 2004 at 07:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001915", "id": "radiance-general_001918"}
