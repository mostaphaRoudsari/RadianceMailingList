Than sp.pic as the picture, ok, with white meaning foreground \nmod, black background? Finally picture_UV.cal, I guess you wanted to \nshow the need of a beer glass mapping func ;-)?\n\n\nAll I know about mixpict is from ray.pdf, is there any other source?\n\n\nI have some kind of mosaic that I don't want to model geometrically. It \nconsists of three different materials. I have material definitions \n(plastic) of all three. Can I use mixpict to create some kind of \"mask\" \nin radiance? Is it possible to use a mixpict modifier as a background \nin mixpict (I think I would have to do so if I want to combine three, \nnot two)? Finally - is it more adviseable to assemble the mosaic in a \nbitmap editor (gimp, photoshop & co) and apply it by using the \ncolorpict modifier?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
