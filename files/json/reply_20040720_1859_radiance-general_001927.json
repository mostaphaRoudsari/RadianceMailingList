{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nUsing mixpict to achieve transparency can be done in one of two ways.  \nThe preferred method is to specify \"void\" as one of the alternate \nmaterials, either foreground or background, and where the mixpict \nevaluates to 1 (or 0), the surface will be disregarded.  The other \nalternative is to specify a trans material with the following \nparameters:\n\n\nvoid trans passthru\n0\n0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\n\nIf I remember right, this will send the ray straight through without \nany alterations, though it is slightly more expensive than using the \n\"void\" modifier.  For more information, check out this entry in the old \nRadiance digests:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v3n0.html#OPACITY_MAPPING\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001927.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 20, 2004 at 06:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001274", "id": "radiance-general_001927"}
