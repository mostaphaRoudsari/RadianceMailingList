Rays that are part of the \"direct\" calculation and \nsent to light sources to test for shadows account for the 1/r^2 \nfall-off of light by computing the solid angle of the source (or source \nsample region) in their equation.  For details, see Section 4 of the \nfollowing document:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\n\nI'm sure you can find similar advice in books like \"An Introduction to \nRay Tracing,\" by Glassner.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001931.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 21, 2004 at 05:23PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001930", "id": "radiance-general_001931"}
