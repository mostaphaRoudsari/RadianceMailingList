{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nYou need to read the man page for macbethcal more carefully, I think.  \nInput to it is a scan or capture of a Macbeth chart.  If you don't have \na Macbeth chart, then you cannot use this program.  Macbeth \nColorChecker charts are available from most high-end photography supply \nstores.\n\n\nThe advantage to using macbethcal is that it can improve the color and \nreflectance accuracy of your scanned textures.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001945.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 24, 2004 at 04:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001944", "id": "radiance-general_001945"}
