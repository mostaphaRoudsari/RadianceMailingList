{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nmight it help to use boxes instead of spheres? Just to reduce the \nnumber of faces (and make them bigger)... hmmm... does a sphere take \nmore memory in radiance than a box? I guess so, at least it is worth \ntrying. Reducing the resolution (-r) should also reduce memory needs, \ndepending on your scenes, you get errors doing so. AFAIK (r=resolution \nof oconv, dmax_scene, dmin_scene) the resolution has to be r > \ndmax_scene / dmin_scene, and is preset to 16K at the moment.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
