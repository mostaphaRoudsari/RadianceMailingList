{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI think it's not  problem with the spheres (in fact a sphere is probably \nthe primitive which uses the least amount of memory among all), but with \nthe number of objects in general.\n\n\noconv - roughly spoken - inflates itself considerably during octree \ngeneration, to a far bigger size that the actual octree has in the end, \nwhen the process is finished.\n\n\nThis inflating can be reduced a bit by using a lower resolution, the \ncurrent default is 16 K as Lars pointed out, you might try running oconv \n-r 8192  ..., if it still doesn't work, try 2048 or even 1024 (I think \nthe latter was the default a long, long time ago). But this produces \ngreater object sets at the leaves and thus slows down the rendering.\n\n\nA better way is to divide your input file into separate ones, the sets \nof spheres should be disjoint in space, however, then set up a wrapping \nscene file with simply loads these separate octrees as instances. You \ncan also nest instances, i.e. use instances which themselves contain \ninstances.\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001949.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "July 25, 2004 at 09:43PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001947", "id": "radiance-general_001949"}
