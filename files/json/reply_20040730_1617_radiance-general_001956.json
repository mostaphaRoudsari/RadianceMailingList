The triangular polygons are usually the \nsource of the \"aiming failure\" errors seen when running mkillum.   The \nbest explanation is of course in the Rendering with Radiance text.  Do \nyou have a copy?  If so, this problem is addressed on pg 577.\n\n\nYour building seems a challenge for mkillum.  Are you trying to create \npretty pictures, or get some illuminance data at points?  If the former, \nit may still be worth the effort to try and seal your opening -- from \nthe inside -- with a combination of polygons less likely to generate \nfailures.  If the latter, it's probably best to simply crank up the \nambient calculation parameters, and wait it out.  (This method could \nalso be used for pretty picture generation, but now you're talking about \n*really* waiting...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001956.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 30, 2004 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001953", "id": "radiance-general_001956"}
