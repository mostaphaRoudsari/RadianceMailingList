If the \nlightsource (or illum) is outside, than the geometry between the source \n(or illum) will still cause errors. You can answer this by either \nsetting the ambient paramters higher (so that every detail of your \ngeometry is hit, which is very slow) or place the illum on the inside.\n\n\nYou might try to break down your illum panes into smaller surfaces. \nDon't use too much, as this will also slow down calculation, but maybe \nif you divide each face into some smaller faces, you can use rectangles?\n\n\nAs Rob said, if you can take a look at the chapter in \"Rendering with \nRadiance\", that might explain a lot.\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
