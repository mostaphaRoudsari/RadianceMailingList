As far as I understood, it is \none of the main reasons to use illum surfaces at the windows to reduce \nthe errors caused by the ambient calculation, which can cause visible \nartifacts. And this problem could still arise if the illum is placed \noutside. Am I wrong here?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
