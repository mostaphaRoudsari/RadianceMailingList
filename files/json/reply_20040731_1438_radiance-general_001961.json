Reducing artifacts is a secondary effect.\nIt happens because the illum surface averages the large variety\nof luminances found outside. Window geometry between the space\nand the illum may have some adverse effect, but it should be\nminor in comparison to the improvements mkillum gives you in\neither case.\n\n\nAs always, need to weight the pros and cons in the context of\nyour actual scene.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001961.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "July 31, 2004 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001957", "id": "radiance-general_001961"}
