In that respect the\nanswer to the following question may help in\nconsiderations such as yours: which category do you\nbelong to and who are the intended other users, if\nany,  of your platform-specific port?\n\n\nOn one hand you don't want to spend too much time on\nsupporting every platform-specific GUI gizmo. That is,\nunless you do it for fun or exercise.\n\n\nOn the other hand, you don't want to be deprived of\nthe features that make 'typical' work with programs on\nyour platform more efficient and pleasant.\n\n\nThen there are issues with continuing support.\n\n\nThat is, you either have:\n\n\nA) Radiance -> direct platform-specific OS kernel and\nGUI interface\n\n\nor\n\n\nB) Radiance -> platform-independent package ->\nplatform-specific stuff\n\n\n\n\nIn case A there is a danger that port author\neventually gets married, dies, graduates, etc. If the\nport is moderately successfull and usable, then it\nmakes sense to try make it available and documented.\nThe way online storage and search is expanding, for\nexample, it may soon be possible to do that without\nrequiring or needing any sort of institutional\nendorsement or support, without risking high network\nusage charges or unknown people annoying you with\nquestions you don't feel like answering again after 10\nyears.\n\n\nIn case B, changes to platform-independent package\naffect users on all platforms. Even if users are\nsoftware developers they may find the need to learn\nand depend on one (or several) Radiance-unrelated\nintermediate software packages a bit hard. \n\n\nLess sophisticated users may a have hard time finding\nand/or buying old version of AutoCAD on eBay. And they\nmay find using text editor to compose a scene even\nharder.\n\n\nIf GUI look and feel and gadgets are the only issue, I\nagree with what Georg wrote. Regarding performance I\nwouldn't know, except for stating the obvious. Like,\nyou wouldn't want rview to be 50 times slower than it\ncould be just because bit blitting via some\nintermediate package is so platform-independent that\nit sucks on all platforms. Or, you may want to exploit\nsome concurrency, I/O, number crunching, etc. features\nspecific to your platform.   \n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
