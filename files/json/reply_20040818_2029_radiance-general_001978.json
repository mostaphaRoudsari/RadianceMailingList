My first experiment with a specular floor \nmaterial, I mistakenly set roughness to zero, and my floor looked like \nan ice skating rink.  All objects in the room were reflected perfectly \nin the floor.  Not saying it's realistic, just saying it's a quick \nlesson in roughness' contribution to the mirror image you are seeking.\n\n\nHere's a good chart showing the effects of varying both specularity & \nroughness:  http://www.artifice.com/radiance/rad_specularity.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001978.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 18, 2004 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001975", "id": "radiance-general_001978"}
