{"body": "I use Revit. I export my models to a DWG, and then open them in \nAutoCAD, clean-up some of the layers and such (it puts things on \nlayers named by category of the element, not by the element's \nmaterials), and then run an old LISP routine called 'TORAD' that then \ngenerates my Radiance files. I then create test renders under Cygwin, \nand then when the project is ready I feed it to a OS X box I've got \nacting as a 'render server'.\n\n\nHowever, I've just found out that Revit (which is a lot like ArchiCAD, \nonly more so ;) also includes into it's DWG/DXF exporting 'xdata' \nabout the material a surface is, so I'm currently investigating how to \nwrite a new 'revit2rad' converter that would take a DXF from Revit and \nturn it into a logical structure of Radiance files.\n\n\nFinally, there is a wonderful little 3D modeling program called \nECOTECT that allows you to make simple surface models and includes a \nRadiance exporting feature & rendering front end. This you might find \nto be your best bet to get into Radiance at first.\n\n\nBest of luck,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001983.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "August 20, 2004 at 04:12PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001981", "id": "radiance-general_001983"}
