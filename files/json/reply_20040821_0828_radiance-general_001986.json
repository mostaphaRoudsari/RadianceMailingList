{"body": "Radout, while vastly superior to TORAD, don't work none with AutoCAD \n2004+. Just FYI. TORAD don't work, really, either, but it will make \nRAD files (it just won't listen to option settings). And DXF2RAD, \nwell, the models I make in Revit seem to be either too much (lots and \nlots of data) or dxf2rad doesn't like 2000 or 2004 DXF formats, for it \njust crashes out when I try to run it under Windows. I haven't tried \nit under Linux in a while, but I seem to remember it acting the same way.\n\n\nSo, for now, it's Revit -> Autocad -> messing with layers and such -> \nTORAD -> Radiance.\nand I'm trying to make something that will allow Revit -> (insert new \ntool here) -> Radiance. ;)\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\n\n\n\nMark de la Fuente wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001986.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "August 21, 2004 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001984", "id": "radiance-general_001986"}
