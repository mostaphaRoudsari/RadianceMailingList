{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nThe trouble with your floor is that you have specified a very small, \nbut non-zero value for the surface roughness.  Radiance employs a \nhybrid technique for computing specularity, which does a closed-form \ncomputation of specular highlights related to light sources (including \nyour illum's) plus a Monte Carlo sampling of other soft-specular \nreflections.  If you set the roughness to zero, you will see a perfect \nmirror reflection of the window, without artifacts.  Presumably, this \nis not what you are after.  Alternatively, you may increase your \nsurface roughness value and your reflection will improve.  Finally, you \ncan set the surface roughness to zero, then apply the included \n\"gloss.cal\" function to achieve a pure Monte Carlo sampling of \nreflected rays.  This will lead to greater noise in the result, but \nwill eliminate the source sampling artifacts you are now seeing:\n\n\nwood_pattern texfunc mc_roughness\n4 gloss_dx gloss_dy gloss_dz gloss.cal\n0\n3 .02 .02 .02\n\n\nmc_roughness plastic wood_flooring\n0\n0\n5 .5 .2 .05 .02 0\n\n\nOf course, I am only guessing on the parameter values, but this should \ngive you an idea of what I mean.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002001.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 07, 2004 at 07:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001998", "id": "radiance-general_002001"}
