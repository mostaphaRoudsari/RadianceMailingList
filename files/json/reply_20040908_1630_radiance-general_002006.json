{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nThe pivot (\"p\") command in rview/rvu will rotate about a chosen point \n(i.e., the axis is the up vector through the selected point).  Quoting \nthe rview man page:\n\n\n        pivot angle [ elev [ mag [ x y z ] ] ]\n                  Similar to the \"move\" command, but pivots the  view  \nabout  a\n                  selected  point.  The angle is measured in degrees \naround the\n                  view up vector using the right hand rule.  The \noptional  elev\n                  is  the  elevation  in degrees from the pivot point; \npositive\n                  raises the view point to look downward  and  negative  \nlowers\n                  the view point to look upward.\n\n\nThe first argument is the angle (clockwise about point in degrees), the \nsecond is the elevation change, the third is the zoom factor, and 4-7 \nspecify the point if you prefer to enter it manually rather than pick \nit from the current view.\n\n\nYou do have the man pages, I hope.  If not, they can be found online at \nthe LBNL website:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/whatis.html\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002006.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 08, 2004 at 04:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002004", "id": "radiance-general_002006"}
