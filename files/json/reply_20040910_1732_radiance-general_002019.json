{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nWhat's happening there is that your system has a symlink to the vi text \neditor named 'rview', which is also the old name for the model viewer in \nRadiance (which your model is fed to when you run rad with the -o x11 \nswitch).  The symlink is in a directory further up the path prescedence \nchain than the rview executable, so it's being called by rad instead of \nthe rview you want.\n\n\nWhat version of radiance are you using?  rview was recently renamed to \nrvu to get around this problem.  If this is your personal system, you \ncould also locate the link and remove it, that's what I used to do (I \ncould never understand why people would rather type 'rview' for an \nexecutable called 'vi').\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 10, 2004 at 05:32PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002018", "id": "radiance-general_002019"}
