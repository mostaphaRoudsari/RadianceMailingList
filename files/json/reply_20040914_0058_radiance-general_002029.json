{"body": "Another caveat -- the -z output from rpict is the \"effective ray \nlength,\" not the distance to first intersection.  This means that for \nglass or mirror surfaces, it may be the distance to the object seen \nthrough the glass or mirror rather than the distance to the glass or \nmirror surface itself.\n\n\nIf you really want the first object intersection distance, regardless \nof material type, you should use the vwrays command together with \nrtrace and the -oL option.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002029.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 14, 2004 at 12:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002026", "id": "radiance-general_002029"}
