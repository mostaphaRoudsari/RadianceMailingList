{"body": "In general, Radiance is more accurate than other programs if you make extensive use of small patches with mkillum, set the -av parameter to a reasonable value, and use the following parameters:\n-ab 5\n-ad 2048 or higher\n-as 1024\n-ar 5000 \n-ds .05\n\n\nIf you use -ab 1 instead of 5, your values are typically half of what they should be. If you use -ab 3, they might be 30% too low. \n\n\nMartin\n\n\nMartin Moeck, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, ASHRAE, IESNA\nThe Pennsylvania State University\nDepartment of Architectural Engineering\n104 Engineering A\nUniversity Park, PA 16802\ne-mail: mm12 at psu.edu\nTel +1 814 863 3555\nFax +1 814 863 4789\nhttp://www.engr.psu.edu/ae/faculty/moeck.htm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002035.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "September 27, 2004 at 05:19PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002032", "id": "radiance-general_002035"}
