{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nRadiance offers the obj2rad converter to go from (Alias/Wavefront) .OBJ \nformat to Radiance.  However, it does so by expanding the mesh into \nindividual triangles, which is not terribly space-efficient.  If you \ndon't apply the -f option, it also creates a texture for each triangle \nto produce a smoothed result if vertex normal data is included in the \n.OBJ file, which leads to further expansion of the model.  This may not \nbe a problem for small meshes, but it can add up to a lot of memory use \nfor large ones.\n\n\nA new alternative in the HEAD release is the obj2mesh converter, which \ncompiles a .OBJ file into a \"Radiance Triangle Mesh,\" a special kind of \noctree that may be instantiated in the scene using the new \"mesh\" \nprimitive.\n\n\nIf you have a formula or vertex data points rather than a .OBJ file, \nyou may use the gensurf command to convert it into Radiance polygons.  \nThe HEAD version of gensurf includes a -o option for outputting to .OBJ \nformat, which may then be converted to an RTM using obj2mesh.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002039.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 27, 2004 at 05:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002037", "id": "radiance-general_002039"}
