{"body": "Good idea.\n\n\nI recommend some profiling ahead of time to determine where to \nconcentrate in the code.  I suspect that the vector and matrix \nroutines, although inviting, don't use a substantial fraction of the \ntime in most renderings.  If short vectors don't kill you on set-up, \nthe color manipulation macros might be a better starting point, or \nperhaps something could be done to accelerate the expression evaluation \ncode in the common/cal* routines.  I know these can be a bottleneck in \na lot of scenes.\n\n\nIn general, a good profiling of the code on a variety of scenes would \nbe very helpful to anyone wishing to work on tuning Radiance in the \nfuture.\n\n\nMy humming desktop also compels me to mention that Apple has some handy \nC libraries for vector and matrix operations on the G4 and G5 \nprocessors.  (I haven't tried them yet myself, I'm ashamed to say.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000382.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 01, 2004 at 07:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000381", "id": "radiance-dev_000382"}
