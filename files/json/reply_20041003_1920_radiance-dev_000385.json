{"body": "Compiling Radiance under Visual C++ is actually pretty\neasy. \n\n\nLook into Rmakefile file in each source directory.\nEven if you are not familiar with UNIX makefiles it is\npretty clear which sources go into which\nprogram/library and what gets linked to what.\n\n\nI would suggest to start with common directory and\ncreate the library which then gets linked into almost\nevery Radiance program.\n\n\nThis is where the problems start because some files\nsimply won't compile. For example, malloc.c won't\ncompile because Windows has no sbrk() call. One file\ndoes ++ on void pointer and VC++ doesn't like it.\nOther files assume you have X11 or OpenGL headers.\nEtc.\n\n\nMy suggestions is to initially simply exclude the\nfiles that won't compile and resolve porting issues\nonly when and if you get linker errors.\n\n\nI started creating MS IDE project files (but for\nVisual Studio .NET 2003, i.e. compiler version 7.1\nrather than 6) but then got sidetracked into Fast\nFourier Transforms, SIMD and such stuff. For this I\nneeded only common (librt) library and image decoding\nprograms(in px directory) and it didn't take more than\nan hour to get these programs running.\n\n\nRpict, rview and such programs require much more work.\n\n\nTony \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000385.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tonko Juricic", "created_at": "October 03, 2004 at 07:20PM", "created_by": "Tonko_Juricic", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000384", "id": "radiance-dev_000385"}
