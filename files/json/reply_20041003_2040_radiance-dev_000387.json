There are a few parts\nthat still need to get ported, such as the holodeck, the GUI\nprograms, and some other minor stuff.  The default installation\nlocation for Windows is under \"C:\\radiance3.6a\\\".  You may need\nto set the correct RAYPATH for everything to work properly.\nActually, I'm not sure if it will actually *work*... ;)\nI have done a few simple tests, and I don't remember any major\nhickups. If you (or someone else) find any, feel free to report\nand/or fix at your leisure.\n\n\nIf you want it to install in a different location, then you\nhave two possibilities:\n\n\n* Either add the variables RAD_BINDIR, RAD_MANDIR, and RAD_RLIBDIR\n  to the SCons command line like this:\n  \"scons RAD_BINDIR=c:\\where\\ever\\bin install\"\n  (add the other two as well).\n\n\n* Or make a copy of the file \"platform\\win32.cfg\" to\n  \"platform\\win32_custom.cfg\" and change the respective variables\n  in the new copy. Note that in this case those three variables\n  are relative to RAD_BASEDIR. If such a *_custom.cfg file\n  exists, then it will take precedence over the original.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need the missing parts as well, then you'll have to resort\nto Cygwin, SCons will work there as well. In fact, the SCons\nbuild system works on all platforms supported by Radiance, as an\nalternative to the traditional makefiles.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000387.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 03, 2004 at 08:40PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000384", "id": "radiance-dev_000387"}
