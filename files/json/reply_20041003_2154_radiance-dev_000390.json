Anyway, I am looking\ninto CVS from Web site and bmalloc.c has:\n\n\nstatic void  *bposition = NULL;\n....\n\tbposition += n;\n\n\nand in few places more in the same file.\n\n\n> > I started creating MS IDE project files\n> \n> Don't do that.

After all these\nyears I can not switch to Windows version of vi editor\nand drop to command line to recompile/relink each and\nevery time. \n\n\nTony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nDeclare Yourself - Register online to vote today!\nhttp://vote.yahoo.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000390.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tonko Juricic", "created_at": "October 03, 2004 at 09:54PM", "created_by": "Tonko_Juricic", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000384", "id": "radiance-dev_000390"}
