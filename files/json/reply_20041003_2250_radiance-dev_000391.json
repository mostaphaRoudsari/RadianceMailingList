And it's probably me who changed the\ndeclaration from a char* to a void* in my ANSIfication efforts.\n\n\nBut you're right. Even if most compilers allow it, by the books\nit's not legal to do pointer arithmetic with void pointers.\nThe solution is probably to just change it back:\n\n\n static char *bposition = NULL;\n\n\nSince bposition is only accessed within those two functions,\nand it only gets assigned void pointers, that should work just\nas fine as it did before my change. I've just checked the fix\ninto CVS, so it should be in tomorrows HEAD dump.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000391.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 03, 2004 at 10:50PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000384", "id": "radiance-dev_000391"}
