The main reason why there are not\nmore formats currently supported is that Greg hates third party\nlibrary dependencies. The tifflib is currently the only\nexception, mainly because that was (and probably still is) the\nmost common lossless format, which even supports HDR data\nnowadays.\n\n\nThe situation of JPEG is shady at the moment, due to some\npatent claims. This caused the IEEE to discuss the depreciation\nof the JPEG format as an official standard. Nobody seems to\nknow where that will lead eventually.\n\n\nI'd be in favour of adding PNG support though, which has been\ncarefully designed to steer clear of intellectual property claims.\nThe libPNG offers a variety of losslessly compressed formats in\nvarious bit depths. The library seems robust, and both the\nspecification and the API are stable.  Since early this year, PNG\nis also an ISO standard, so we can count on it staying around in\na backwards compatible manner for a long time.\n\n\nAny folks with too much time on their hands are invited to\ncontribute...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000408.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 04, 2004 at 02:30PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000406", "id": "radiance-dev_000408"}
