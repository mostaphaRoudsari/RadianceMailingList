{"body": "For image conversion (cli), I would strongly suggest ImageMagick \n(www.imagemagick.com). This toolset is available in source and compiled \nforms (for both windows and linux). It contains some very powerful tools \nsuch as: convert, mogrify and composite are a few. In many cases these \ntools can be used to deal with most image processing issues, then and \nonly then do you need to consider doing things by hand with photoshop or \ngimp. On a side note, along with Carsten, I am a big fan of Gimp! \nAlthough I have never messed with it, gimp can also be driven from the \ncommand line for batch type processing.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nCarsten Bauer wrote:\n\n\n> AFAIK, there are no hidden secrets in a Radiance pic.\n>\n> You may know that already, the most important thing getting lost \n> during conversion is of course the HDR character.
