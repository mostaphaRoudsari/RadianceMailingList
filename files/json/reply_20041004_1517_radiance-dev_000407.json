{"body": "AFAIK, there are no hidden secrets in a Radiance pic.\n\n\nYou may know that already, the most important thing getting lost during \nconversion is of course the HDR character. There is a lot of awkward \ncolor math in this step from radiance data (W/m2sr) in three color \nchannels to rgb values, of which e.g ra_t16 or ra_tiff is taking care of.\n\n\nI for example convert to TGA and then use GIMP (the Linux equivalent of \nPhotoshop) for postprocessing and conversion. I doubt that it pays off \nwriting an extra converter to go directly from pic to png jpeg\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000407.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 04, 2004 at 03:17PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000406", "id": "radiance-dev_000407"}
