I use it to make\nminor adjustments on 16 bpc TIFFs before reducing my work to\n8-bit and sending it to the printer.\n\n\nThere are versions for Mac, Windows, and Linux.\n\n\nMark\nmstock at umich.edu\n\n\nOn Mon, 4 Oct 2004, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000410.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "October 04, 2004 at 03:26PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000406", "id": "radiance-dev_000410"}
