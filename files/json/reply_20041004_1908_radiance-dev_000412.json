It also appears that the patent\nwill expire in 2006. Fogent has just sued three dozen large\ncorporations about it this year, although the applicability of\nthe patent to the actual JPEG format is still under debate.\nSeveral companies (including Sony) have bought licenses for\ntens of millions of dollars so far.\n\n\nJPEG 2000 is covered by some known patents, but those have been\nreleased for use without fee. How much is this format already in\nuse? As it seems to be lossless, it looks very promising.\n\n\n\n\n> As long as it doesn't cause hitches on different compilers, I wouldn't\n> be opposed.
