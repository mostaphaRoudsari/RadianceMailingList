Compression involves thresholding \nand removing coefficients, so there's inevitable loss. However, wavelets \nadapt well to signal features, largely due to their local support, so \nthe loss may not be as noticeable as with the old JPEG. I would imagine \ncontours are well preserved with this method and don't exhibit the \nobnoxious ringing artifacts we've all come to hate from standard JPEG \nwith high compression rates.\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
