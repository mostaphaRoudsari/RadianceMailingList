There is a \"lossless\" \nversion of JPEG 2000 that exactly reproduces the 8-bit input values \nusing wavelet compression, though this isn't the mode most folks are \nexpected to use.  Likewise, JPEG is \"almost lossless\" if the \nquantization tables are set to all zeroes, but due to round-off error, \nthe 8-bit values you get back are sometimes off by one or two counts.\n\n\nThis of course begs the question, what does it mean to record \n8-bits/channel \"losslessly?\"  So much information has been lost in \nderiving those 8 bits, that the exact reproduction afterwards is mostly \na joke.\n\n\nMy two bits.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000415.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 04, 2004 at 09:56PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000406", "id": "radiance-dev_000415"}
