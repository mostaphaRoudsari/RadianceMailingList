{"body": "Hi Tom\n\n\nyepp, now you see where you are, Radiance is indeed complex and you \nnotice the complexity right form the beginning :-)\n\n\nIt's always the same problem, for those working already with it \neverything has become self-evident, and its difficult to imagine how a \nbeginner might see it..\n\n\n\n\n1)\nthere is a so called 'official' RADIANCE version 3.5, which can be \ndownloaded from the official radsite.lbl.gov\n\n\nthis contains everything you need in one package\n\n\n2)\nthis 'official' version is not really up to date, there is a continously \nimproved RADIANCE version, which is called RADIANCE-HEAD, containing the \nlatest bugfixes and some new features. This can be downloaded from \nradiance-online.\n\n\nBut the HEAD - Version is split into two parts, the rendering and \npostprocessing programs and - the second part - a collection of library \nfiles '.cal-files' (<- after some time spent with RADIANCE you'll know \nwhat these are) etc, etc. This is called the auxilary package and has to \nbe downloaded separately (also from radiance-online)\n\n\n3) not to be mixed up with this auxiliary package is the SCons and \nPython stuff.\n\n\nRadiance contains an installation script based on the classic UNIX \nshells (C-shell) to perform all the tasks necessary to install it\n\n\nGeorg Mischler has added a second possibility to install RADIANCE with \nhelp of a publicly available tool called SCons, which itself needs \nPython. So if you want to go the SCons way for the installation, you \nhave to get that tool of course.\n\n\n-cb.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000423.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 05, 2004 at 01:38PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000384", "id": "radiance-dev_000423"}
