I am involved\nin a couple of other open source projects and it is\nalways the same story : you spend enormous time\nlearning how to build. That's why I like those\nprojects that settled for complementary approach -\ngeneric build tool+separate directories for specific\nIDE builds. The problem with adding the latter is that\nthere is another set of files that have to be\nmaintained separately, but for some popular Source\nForge projects it is obviously not a problem.\n\n\nTony\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
