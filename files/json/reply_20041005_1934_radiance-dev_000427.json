This means that memory sizes\nare always measured relative to the size of a char, while the\nactual number of bits in a char is irrelevant. If this rule (or\nan equivalent one) wasn't enforced, reliable memory handling\nwould be impossible, let alone in a platform-independent way.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000427.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 05, 2004 at 07:34PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000395", "id": "radiance-dev_000427"}
