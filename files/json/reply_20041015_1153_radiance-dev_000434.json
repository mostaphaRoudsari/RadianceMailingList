Did you use SCons to build? It\ndoes a few things differently than the traditional makefiles.\nSo the reasons why you had to fix some files may be caused by the\nbuild procedure, by changes that happened since my last try, or\nmaybe even by a different compiler version.\n\n\nThe SCons build has the advantage that it works the same on all\nplatforms. It has the disadvantage that it doesn't directly\ninteract with the VisualStudio environment on Windows, which\nprevents graphical debugging.  Actually, SCons should be able to\ngenerate VS project files. I'll try this feature some time next\nweek, unless you manage to get it working before me...\n\n\n\n\n> So the important question to Greg and Schorsch is: how can I check in the\n> sources?\n\n\nIf you ran the build with SCons, send me the changes.\nIf you built your own project files manually, then you may not\nhave included/linked to all the right files, so at least some of\nyour changes may turn out to be redundant.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000434.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 15, 2004 at 11:53AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000431", "id": "radiance-dev_000434"}
