I could not check, wether the \nproblems were old or not. One was the void problem, already \ndiscussed here a few days ago, another was a goto adress, which \ndid not exist.\n\n\n\n\n> It has the disadvantage that it doesn't directly\n> interact with the VisualStudio environment on Windows, which\n> prevents graphical debugging.

(I already stopped working this week.)\n\n\n\n\n> If you ran the build with SCons, send me the changes.\n\n\nSCons selected VisualStudio 7.0 for the build, I will also try it \nwith VisualStudio 6 and then send you the changes.\n\n\nHappy weekend\n\n\nSiegbert\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000435.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Siegbert Debatin", "created_at": "October 15, 2004 at 01:59PM", "created_by": "Siegbert_Debatin", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000431", "id": "radiance-dev_000435"}
