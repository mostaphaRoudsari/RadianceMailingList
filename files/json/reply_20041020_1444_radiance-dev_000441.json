{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nthe Radiance library librt.a apparently cannot be used as standalone \nmodule. It needs the separate ofun table. The reason is probably this: \nif you produce oconv, the ofun table gets assigned the 'inclusion' \nfunctions which check if an object intersects an octree subcube. If you \ncompile rpict or rvu, the ofun table gets assigned the ray-object \nintersection functions.\n\n\nSo if you don't need either of those, simply remove all references to \nthe ofun table from your parser code files. The other way would be \nincluding it (no matter of you need it or not), then you have to look \nout for the files which define it  (one is e.g. initotypes.c in src/rt), \nbut then in turn you have to include the whole set of functions, too, \nand you'll end up in compiling almost all of the complete rpict...\n\n\nNo matter which way you take, be aware that modifying the Radiance code \nbrings you right into the devil's boiling pot...\n\n\nBut don't give up, there's always a solution..\n\n\n-cb\n\n\nPS: if you've further questions, I'd offer to continue this discussion \noff-list\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 20, 2004 at 02:44PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000438", "id": "radiance-dev_000441"}
