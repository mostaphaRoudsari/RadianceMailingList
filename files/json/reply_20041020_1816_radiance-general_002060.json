{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nThe .unf finished files are the rendered images pre any filetering \noperations. The .pic image have been filtered and perhaps some other \noperations depending on your rif settings. The .pic images are your \nfinal frames. To view the animation like a movie you will need to \nconvert your .pic images to tifs or some other format and then from \nthere into an animation format. There are a few options to view:\n\n\n   1. convert final pic frames to jpg and use \"animate *.jpg\" to view\n      the animation (this presumes linux)\n   2. to generate an avi or other format (again presuming linux) you can\n      convert the frames to tifs and then use \"ffmpeg\" to generate an\n      avi or mpeg. Note this tool can be a little tricky. It is\n      powerful, but the documentation really presumes a fair amount of\n      knowledge about codecs, encoding and decoding.\n   3. otherwise you can load up the converted frames into something like\n      adobe premier and generate an animation.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002060.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 20, 2004 at 06:16PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002059", "id": "radiance-general_002060"}
