{"body": "Hi Siegbert, Giulio\n\n\nyepp, thanx. Now I see it right before my eyes.. it's looking very \nstrange indeed..\n\n\nI came so far by now with my first tests:\n\n\nYou look at the source at a very flat angle, and I suppose it's \nsomething with the additional source-drawing routine. The pattern \ndoesn't appear in rvu (where this add. src-drawing is not performed).\n\n\nI made checks with radzilla, too, where I've switched off source-drawing \nfor illums by default. The pattern doesn't appear.\nBut if I set -dd 1 individually for the illum polygon (i.e. switch on \nadd. source-drawing), I get the rim pattern, too. (but only for -ps 8 \nand higher)\n\n\nThe connection to the ps setting (which controls the sampling density \nfor the picture generation) is not yet obvious to me. And probably the \nboxcorr function plays a role,too...\n\n\nso there are still some mysteries to unravel :-)\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000448.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "October 20, 2004 at 06:22PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000437", "id": "radiance-dev_000448"}
