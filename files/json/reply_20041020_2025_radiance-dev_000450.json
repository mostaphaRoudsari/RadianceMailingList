{"body": "Hi Siegbert, Guilio, Carsten,\n\n\nThere was indeed a problem with the source drawing routines used by \nrpict, which are not used in rvu.  I thought I had fixed this awhile \nago, but apparently not well enough.  I just checked in a new version \nof srcdraw.c, which I'm hoping will be included in tomorrow's HEAD \ntarball, or you can get it individually from CVS if you like.  The \nchange was minor, affecting the edges of illum surfaces.  Let me know \nif there are still problems.\n\n\nAnd thanks for pointing this out!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000450.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 20, 2004 at 08:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000437", "id": "radiance-dev_000450"}
