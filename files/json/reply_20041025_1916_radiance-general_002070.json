{"body": "I have discovered the source of this error, with Mark's help.  It comes \nfrom a peculiar combination of the mist type with the new source \nobstruction rotuines.  It is not an input error -- no input should ever \ncause a consistency error.  If you get an error like this, you will \nneed to download and compile the new version of src/rt/srcobstr.c or \nuse the HEAD release.  We may offer a patch to the 3.6 release at a \nfuture date if this (or other) problems warrant it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002070.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 25, 2004 at 07:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002069", "id": "radiance-general_002070"}
