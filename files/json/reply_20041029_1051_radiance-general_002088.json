However, I can't hold myself\nback from wondering just how useful is a daylight factor evaluation for\nthe scenario you describe.  Surely, the blinds are there also to control\ndirect sunlight?  Perhaps even it is their main purpose.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "October 29, 2004 at 10:51AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002078", "id": "radiance-general_002088"}
