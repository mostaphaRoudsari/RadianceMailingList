{"body": "Rob, I like the off-color idea.. this is after all just a diagram.  To\ncombine images all you need to do is type pcomb pic1.pic pic2.pic >\nnewpicture.pic.  It just adds all the values together.  This has been a\nvery useful for me in the past.  Keep in mind you are adding light, so\nyou want to try and keep from \"double dipping\" sort of speak.  So you\nwould not have light A and B in one picture and B and C in the other and\nadd them up.  You would have A, B, and, C all in separate pictures. \nThis can be a big time saver if you are trying to develop images for\nvarious \"scenes\".\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002091.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "October 29, 2004 at 08:10PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002080", "id": "radiance-general_002091"}
