{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nIf you know roughly the reflectance of the surface you want to model, \nyou can still use normpat (or more easily \"pfilt -2 -e 2\") to create an \nimage that has its overall value set to 1.  Then, simply apply the \ndesired reflectance as a neutral value to your surface (e.g., 20% \nreflectance would be \"0.2 0.2 0.2\") and use the image map you have \ndownloaded.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002092.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 29, 2004 at 08:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002090", "id": "radiance-general_002092"}
