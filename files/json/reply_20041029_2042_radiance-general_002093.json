{"body": "Hi Christoph,\n\n\nYou can use mkillum or any other aspect of Radiance for an annual \nilluminance profile by creating a cumulative sky model from weather \ndata.  Using mkillum, you would pick up the appropriate external \nreflections as well, which a BRTDfunc could not do.  If you want to \nbreak down the profile over time, then you need to create a \ntime-stepped calculation, possibly using an acceleration scheme such as \nthe one you devised or those of John Mardaljevic or Raphael Compagnon.  \nIn such cases, I can see where a BRTDfunc modeling blinds might be a \nreal time-saver, since it will avoid a lot of the sampling variance \ncaused by detailed blind geometry.  It still wouldn't pick up those \nexternal reflections, though.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002093.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 29, 2004 at 08:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002089", "id": "radiance-general_002093"}
