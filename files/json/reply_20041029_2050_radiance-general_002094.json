{"body": "Hello,\nThere`s a new paper that is related, but can be accessed online only (as far\nas I know):\n\n\nM. Andersen, M. Rubin, R. Powles, J.-L. Scartezzini, Bi-directional\ntransmission properties of venetian blinds: experimental assessment compared\nto ray-tracing simulations, Solar Energy, In Press.\n\n\nIt discuses mainly the method to measure BRTDs, but not much about the\napplication to simulations. If somebody has more information about this\nresearch, I would also be interested to know.\nOn the other hand, to simulate blinds, would it be possible to combine a\nBRTD with a linear function that accounts for the slats? I mean, can the\nBRTDfunc be dependent on the object coordinates? just an idea, I don`t know\nif it makes much sense.\n\n\nRegards,\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002094.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "October 29, 2004 at 08:50PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002078", "id": "radiance-general_002094"}
