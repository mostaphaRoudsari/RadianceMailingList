{"body": "I haven't read this paper -- thanks for pointing it out.  I know that \nMarilyne Anderson is continuing her measurement work now that she's at \nMIT.\n\n\nRegarding your suggestion with the BRTDfunc, if I understand you \ncorrectly, you are suggesting that it might be possible to simulate the \napprearance of slats in the model.  I agree, but I think that might \ndefeat the purpose of using such a model, as we would be reintroducing \nirregularities in the light coming through that would then require \nheavier sampling to resolve.  That is the current problem with venetian \nblind models -- it's not that Radiance can't handle the complex \ngeometry, quite the contrary.  It is simply that the slats themselves \ncause a large variance in the penetrating radiation, to the point where \nmany ray samples are needed to resolve the agregate (i.e., integrated) \nbehavior.\n\n\nI hope I didn't misunderstand what you were saying.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002095.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 29, 2004 at 09:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002078", "id": "radiance-general_002095"}
