{"body": "Actually, the slat interreflection is significant, but modeling slats \nin the BRDTfunc directly won't incorporate such behavior, since the \nsurface is flat and therefore doesn't see itself.  I have to model the \ninterreflections mathematically, and that's the tricky part.  That's \nthe part I think will take a day or two to work out, if I'm able to do \nit at all.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002100.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 30, 2004 at 12:57AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002098", "id": "radiance-general_002100"}
