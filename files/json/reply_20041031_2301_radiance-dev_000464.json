{"body": "HiFrancesco,\n\n\nThanks for the bug report, and the fix.  For whatever reason, varargs \nis still supported on the gcc 3.3 compiler under Mac OS X.  I've \nnoticed other differences between the Linux gcc and the Mac OS X one, \nto the point where I really don't think the version means much.\n\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure it's even worth making this fix, since the Impress \nprinter drivers are not used anymore.  We should simply remove this \nprogram from the build list and fix it that way.  There's no sense in \nmaintaining obsolete programs in my opinion, though we seem to have a \nlot of them.  We really need to compile a list of programs no one uses \nanymore and decomission them.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-October/000464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2004 at 11:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000462", "id": "radiance-dev_000464"}
