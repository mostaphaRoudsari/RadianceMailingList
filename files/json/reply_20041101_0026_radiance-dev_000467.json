It is still supported by most\ncompilers (resp. the associated libraries) for backwards\ncompatibility.  Apparently some gcc packages are starting to\nabandon that tradition now, which was to be expected eventually.\n\n\n\n\n> > Anyway, I'm not sure it's even worth making this fix, since the Impress\n> > printer drivers are not used anymore.\n\n\nIf that's the only place where we use varargs.h, then dropping\nthat driver is a reasonable solution. If it's used elsewhere as\nwell, then we should fix those places to use the ANSI stdarg\nmacros instead.  That's one of the remaining items in my\nANSIfication efforts.\n\n\nApropos: Can we establish any kind of consensus about which\nmodules in the current distribution are considered obsolete?\nI'm sure there are a few more, and if we remove all of them in\none go, then that might eliminate a few more potential build\nhassles. The deleted files will go to the CVS attic, where\npeople can still get them if anyone should ever need them again.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000467.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 01, 2004 at 12:26AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000462", "id": "radiance-dev_000467"}
