{"body": "I don't think varargs.h is used anywhere else -- at least, I've never \nused it.  I took the impress functions from somewhere else.  I don't \nthink the printers have existed since 1989 or so, and they weren't even \nall that popular back then.  PostScript took over the printer market \nabout that time.\n\n\nHere's my candidate list of programs for the CVS attic:\n\n\noki20\t- printer driver for OkiMate 20 printer (B&W)\noki20c\t- printer driver for OkiMate 20 color printer\npcwarp\t- intended as more general substitute for macbetcal, but never \nquite worked\nplotin\t- convert old Unix plot(5) files to metafile graphics\nra_avs\t- convert to & from AVS image format\nra_bn\t- convert to & from Barneyscann format\nra_pr\t- convert to & from 8-bit Sun rasterfile format (still used by \nanyone?)\nra_pr24\t- convert to & from 24-bit Sun rasterfile format\nthf2rad\t- convert GDS \"things file\" to Radiance scene format\nttyimage\t- picture to ASCII output converter (useful for anything \nanymore?)\n\n\nSo, not quite as many as I thought.  In fact, I notice that the impress \ndriver isn't in my list of built executables -- meaning that it's \nalready effectively \"off the list\" of Radiance programs.  However, it's \nstill in the source directories, along with a lot of other flotsam \nthat's no longer used for anything.  I wonder now why Francesco was \neven seeing this error, and now I see that my gcc 3.3 compiler does NOT \nsupport varargs when I try to build the \"impress\" executable manually.  \nPerhaps he was using SCONS, and schorsch included things there that are \nnot built by the default Rmakefile.\n\n\nSo, we should add to the list source files that are not built by \ndefault these days.

For others, you have to examine the files themselves.  Some \nhave clearly not been compiled for a long, long time.  As far as I'm \nconcerned, we can retire them all to the CVS attic.  If it turns out we \nmade a mistake on one or two, we can always pull them down again.  \nThere's no real rush on this, so if anyone has any thoughts or wants to \nspeak up for a favorite routine, now's the time.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000468.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 01, 2004 at 04:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000462", "id": "radiance-dev_000468"}
