It is generally a nice\ndebugging tool, which I also used when I wrote my image file\nparser for Python some time ago.\n\n\n\n\n>   I wonder now why Francesco was even seeing this error,\n\n\nHe obviously tried to build the \"special\" selection.\n\n\n\n\n> and now I see that my gcc 3.3 compiler does NOT\n> support varargs when I try to build the \"impress\" executable manually.\n> Perhaps he was using SCONS, and schorsch included things there that are\n> not built by the default Rmakefile.\n\n\nSCons has the same \"special\" targets as the RMakefiles, but\nI'd be happy to get rid of them.\n\n\n\n\n> Unused C-files:\n>\n> common/fixargv0.c\n\n\nThis is (or should be?) used on Windows to remove the *.exe\nfile name extension from executable paths. I'm not sure how\nnecessary it really is though, because even the SCons build\nseems to ignore it at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000470.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 01, 2004 at 10:53AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000462", "id": "radiance-dev_000470"}
