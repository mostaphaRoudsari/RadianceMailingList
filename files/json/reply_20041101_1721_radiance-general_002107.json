I feel really sorry for you.

Hmmm...\n\n\nYesterday on the road I passed a car with a sticker on the rear\nwindshield depicting an American flag and the words \"Fear This\".\n\n\nI'm fretting, and I *live* here.  It seems that many of my fellow\ncitizens think life is a football (*not* \"soccer\") game, or a gang\nfight.  They haven't evolved past high school gym class, they can't\npronounce \"nuclear\", and ironically enough, can't use the word\n\"hegemony\" in a sentence.\n\n\nI agree Greg.  If you're one of the blessed ones, get out there tomorrow\nand try to make a difference:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/weblog/214/youd-better-think\n\n\n-Rob G.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002107.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 01, 2004 at 05:21PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002105", "id": "radiance-general_002107"}
