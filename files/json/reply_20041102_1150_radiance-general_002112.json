{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nsounds fine to me. No, you don't need to double the numbers, as your \nnumbers correspond to one half of the spotlight cone (0 deg = centre of \nspotlight to 5 deg).\nI played around with the lumens number and did not find that it was \naffecting anything.\n\n\ngood luck!\n\n\nalexa\n\n\nFitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n\n\n> I hope I'm doing this correctly.. can anyone give me some advice?\n> I'm modeling a Source 4 10 degree ellipsoidal spotlight\n> On the web, I found this pdf which contains photometric data\n> http://www.productionadvantageonline.com/pdf_files/410.pdf\n> \n> By looking at the cosine curve on page 2, I gathered these numbers - degrees\n> vs candela\n> 0           .5          1            1.5         2           2.5         3\n> 3.5         4           4.5         5            5.4   90.00\n> 82000 81000  80000  76000   70000  62000   53000 45000   36000  27000\n> 16000   0      0\n> I'm not sure if I should double the angles - in that the chart goes from 0\n> to 5, yet this is a 10 degree light\n> \n> from the table on the upper right of page 2,\n> 750 Watt lamp -- 21900 lumens (tho I guess eis2rad doesn't use this number?)\n> \n> So I put it into a eis file like this:\n> TILT=NONE\n> 1    21900    1    12  1  1  1 -.6 0 0\n> 1 1 750\n> 0     .5     1      1.5     2      2.5     3     3.5     4     4.5     5\n> 5.4   90.00\n> 82000 81000  80000  76000   70000  62000   53000 45000   36000 27000   16000\n> 0     0\n> \n> I left my RwR book at home, so I don't remember the meaning of all the other\n> numbers.\n> Does this seem correct?
