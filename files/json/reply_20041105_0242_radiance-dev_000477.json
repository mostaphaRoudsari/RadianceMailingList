{"body": "Hi Carsten,\n\n\nThanks for the follow-up. Is there a way to determine what MAXASET and \nMAXFLEN should be set to relative to amblist[]. For example if I double \namblist to amblist[256] do I need to double the other values. Also I \nnote that amblist occurs in rtrace.c and rview.c. Wouldn't it make sense \nif amblist was defined in one place (eg some header file) so that it \ncould be uniformly applied? Also is there some hidden downside to \nincreasing these values?\n\n\nFYI, as to hitting the border. The exclude file that I have is really to \nserve as a default list so that if certain objects (trees, plants) are \nused in the scene then their geometry is excluded from the ambient \ncalculation (that is that I do not have to think about it). I was trying \nto add some more and encountered the problem. It is not that I currently \nhave more that 128 items that are actually being excluded.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nPS, I really need to set some time aside to work with radzilla and play \nwith all the features you implemented!\n\n\nCarsten Bauer wrote:\n\n\n> Hi Jack,\n>\n> yes, the number of materials in the ambient exclude/include list ist \n> currently limited to 128.\n>\n> if you want to augment it (at compile time) change\n>\n> 1) in rpict.c the declaration char* amblist[128]\n>\n> 2) to be on the safe side\n>     in ambient.c : augment the #define MAXASET 511\n>\n> 3) also to be on the safe side\n>    in wordfile.c (src/common) augment the #define MAXFLEN 8192\n>\n>\n> steps 2 and 3 are probably not necessary, the business is a bit weird \n> because the hierachyless input format allows the occurence of several \n> material instances with the same name, but different object number \n> (that's why the MAXASET (511) is greater than the name list maximum \n> (128))\n>\n> as usual, I don't give any guarantee if this is enough or right or if \n> I've still forgotten something ...and AFAIK you can only specify one \n> exclude file, 'cause there's only one list internally which is checked\n>\n> -cb\n>\n> PS it's funy, in fact I've already waited for something like this to \n> happen, i.e. someone running against this border :-)\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-dev mailing list\n> Radiance-dev at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-dev\n>\n>\n\n\n\n\n#\tJohn E. de Valpine\n#\tpresident\n#\n#\tvisarc incorporated\n#\thttp://www.visarc.com\n#\n#\tchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000477.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 05, 2004 at 02:42AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000475", "id": "radiance-dev_000477"}
