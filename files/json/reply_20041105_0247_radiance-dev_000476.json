{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nyes, the number of materials in the ambient exclude/include list ist \ncurrently limited to 128.\n\n\nif you want to augment it (at compile time) change\n\n\n1) in rpict.c the declaration char* amblist[128]\n\n\n2) to be on the safe side\n     in ambient.c : augment the #define MAXASET 511\n\n\n3) also to be on the safe side\n    in wordfile.c (src/common) augment the #define MAXFLEN 8192\n\n\n\n\nsteps 2 and 3 are probably not necessary, the business is a bit weird \nbecause the hierachyless input format allows the occurence of several \nmaterial instances with the same name, but different object number \n(that's why the MAXASET (511) is greater than the name list maximum (128))\n\n\nas usual, I don't give any guarantee if this is enough or right or if \nI've still forgotten something ...and AFAIK you can only specify one \nexclude file, 'cause there's only one list internally which is checked\n\n\n-cb\n\n\nPS it's funy, in fact I've already waited for something like this to \nhappen, i.e. someone running against this border :-)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000476.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "November 05, 2004 at 02:47AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000475", "id": "radiance-dev_000476"}
