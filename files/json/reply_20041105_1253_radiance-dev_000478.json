{"body": "Hi Jack\n\n\nagain, the following holds as far as I understood it ..\n\n\nThe matter is this: you can write e.g.\n\n\nvoid plastic blue\n0\n0 ..blablabla\n\n\nblue sphere b_sphere\n0\n0\n4 ...\n\n\nvoid plastic blue\n0\n0\n...\n\n\nblue polygon b_polygon\n0\n0\n..\n\n\nthen the sphere will be made of the first blue, the polygon out of the \nsecond. You have only one time the name blue, but two material objects \nwhich are affected if 'blue' is to be excluded.\n\n\nNow no one would do this in the way I described it, but think of putting \ntogether a scene by xforming several inputfiles together. A typical case \nare luminaire description files, usually you have a 'brightdata', a \nbrightdata-modified 'light', and then the geometry, say a 'ring' or a \n'polygon'. If you model a 10 times 10 array of these luminaires on a \nceiling, and xform luminaire.rad a hundred times into your scene, you \nwill have 100 instances of the 'brightdata' and the 'light' material \nalso, i.e. a hundred 'light' material objects with the same name.\n\n\nSo the amount by which MAXASET needs to be bigger than the name list is \nin fact not determined, but depends upon how often the same material \nname appears in your input files. And the MAXFLEN sets the file size for \nthe exclude list, and thus depend a bit on your names (there is another \nlimit, a name string can be maximal 128 characters long, so the current \nMAXFLEN allows e.g 64 128-character long words\n(who names materials with 128 character words ???) .\n\n\nIn other words, if you specify a material name only once in your scene \ninput, you needn't bother about MAXASET and MAXFLEN, only augment the \namblist length.\n\n\nYes, it would be easier if this max. list length could be set by one \ndefine somewhere. But I guess the topic simply was considered of minor \nimportance, as in 99.99% of all cases maybe one or two materials are \nexcluded. The weird thing about all this is that this minor detail \ncauses some headache on the programming side... :-)\n\n\n\n\nThe downside from a longer list is probably negligible. You have to \nsearch a longer list on input. The number of name occurences in the \ninput files determine the list which is checked during rendering, so if \nyou 'pro forma' exclude a material which doesn't appear in your scene \nanyway, you won't notice it at all.\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000478.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "November 05, 2004 at 12:53PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000475", "id": "radiance-dev_000478"}
