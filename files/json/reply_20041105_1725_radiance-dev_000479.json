{"body": "Hi Carsten,\n\n\nSorry to be dense-headed here.\n\n\n   1. amblist[128] - is this the number of names possible in the list?\n   2. MAXASET - the comments indicate this is the maximum number of\n      elements in the ambient set, what does this mean? Is a scene\n      limited to 511 names of materials assigned directly to geometry?\n   3. MAXFLEN - Does the type of compile make a difference? I have a new\n      opeteron system which I am compiling with -m64? I must admit I am\n      a bit confused about the 64 v 32 bit stuff (all I really care\n      about is performance!) The exclude file is well under 8K in size.\n\n\nSo the question still remains (mostly because I still getting my head \naround it), if I want to increase the number of names that can be \nincluded in the exclude list, what do I need to change?\n\n\nI believe that I can add the following to the rmake file:\n\n\n    -DMAXASET=a_new_value -DMAXFLEN=b_new_value\n\n\nI have done this for -DMAXOBJBLK=131071 at compile, so I assume this \nwould work for the others\n\n\nCan I do something similar to set amblist[] at compile rather than \nediting the files?\n\n\nThanks for all your help.\n\n\n-Jackl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000479.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 05, 2004 at 05:25PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000475", "id": "radiance-dev_000479"}
