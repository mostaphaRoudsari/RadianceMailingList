{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nI think I have spotted the problem. The first line in the keys.vf  file \ndoes not have a -t parameter. The first line should always be -t 0 and \nevery line needs to have -t parameter assigned.\n\n\nrcalc is very unforgiving in this regard. Since your first line did not \nmatch the format it just stopped. It is also very sensitive to trailing \nwhitespace, thus if you had \"-t 0 \" as opposed to \"-t 0\" this would also \ncause a problem.\n\n\nHopefully this will get you past this piece and onto the next.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002135.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 08, 2004 at 07:25PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002131", "id": "radiance-general_002135"}
