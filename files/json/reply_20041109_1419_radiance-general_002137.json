If the opening angles\nresult in a different image aspect, then it will fit the largest\npossible rectangle of that aspect within the given -x/-y hull.\n\n\nRview applies the same concept, but uses the screen size as the hull.\nIt would be simple and straightforward to allow for a -geometry\noverride to that if someone is willing to volunteer the necessary\nchanges.\n\n\nAt the same time, it would probably be confusing to have -x and\n-y determine the window size, because in a preview we usually\nwant to see a as much as possible as fast as possible. With rpict\nwe rather want (more) accurate results and may determine the\npicture size based on the time we're willing to wait for them.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002137.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 09, 2004 at 02:19PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002133", "id": "radiance-general_002137"}
