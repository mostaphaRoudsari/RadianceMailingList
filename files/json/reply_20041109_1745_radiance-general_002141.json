I've already said, I'm trying to \napproach this from the X server side, not the radiance side.  I realize \nthis is a Radiance list, but I thought I'd tap the list's experience with X.\n\n\nMaybe it's time to reinstall linux (or at least X) on this machine.  Oh \nwell.\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002141.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 09, 2004 at 05:45PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002140", "id": "radiance-general_002141"}
