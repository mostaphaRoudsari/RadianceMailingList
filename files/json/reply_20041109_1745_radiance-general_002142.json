{"body": "I think Rob is right.  As I said in my initial reply, many window \nmanagers under X11 override the client window dimensions, and some can \neven be instructed how to override these dimensions for specific \nprograms via a preferences file.  Unfortunately, each window manager \nhas its own way of doing this, so we need to ask the X11 gurus out \nthere how it might be done.  I don't really know how Gnome handles \nthings, for instance.  Under twm, the user can create a \".twmrc\" file \nin their home directory, which contains the variable \"MaxWindowSize\" \nthat may be set to control the maximum dimensions for any client \napplication.  Related variables are UsePPosition and RandomPlacement.  \nI don't have a reference, but I know the Solaris window manager can \ndirect individual client placements.\n\n\nHowever, I agree that a -geom option would be a nice addition, and I'll \nlook into it if there's enough interest.  I'm also curious what people \nhave to say in response to Carsten's query about output dimensions \nversus view angles.  I always considered the latter to be more \nimportant, but I'm willing to be proved wrong democratically.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002142.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 09, 2004 at 05:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002140", "id": "radiance-general_002142"}
