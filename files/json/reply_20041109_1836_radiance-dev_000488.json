However, I might not be very up-to-date \nwith my bare-metal X hacking.\n\n\nAnyway- the main idea would be that the X client (rvu) has _some_ wish \nhow large and where it wants to be. That much the client may specify and \nmaybe (like) even enforce by the attributes, thereby ignoring any window \nmanager.\nAt last, the window manager is just another X-client in the world of X, \n- no super natural powers assigned to it.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\nPS: at least these bits belong on the dev list, mea culpa to those not \nused to an X-programming overdose...\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-November/000488.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "November 09, 2004 at 06:36PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000485", "id": "radiance-dev_000488"}
