I created an \n.Xresources file (my xinitrc file seems to check for the presence of \nthat and does the \"xrdb -merge\" thingy if it exists) and placed:\n\n\nradiance.rvu.x:800\nradiance.rvu.y:600\n\n\n... in that file, but it didn't seem to work.  Of course the number of \nways I could have screwed up that tip is roughly equal to the number of \nKerry votes that may have been swallowed by Diebold voting machines a \nweek ago.\n\n\nAs usual, I am humbled by the list's collective knowledge of this stuff. \n  I'll watch -- from the sidelines -- the continuing saga about getting \nthis done from the application side.  Looking forward to seeing how this \none pans out.\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 09, 2004 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002140", "id": "radiance-general_002146"}
