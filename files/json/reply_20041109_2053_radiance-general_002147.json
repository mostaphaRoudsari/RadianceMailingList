There's lot of really fancy stuff that a\nprogram could do for interacting nicely with the X11 system.\nHowever, the design goal behind rvu was \"make it paint a window\non screen with the least effort possible\". It's debateable\nwhether it's worth the effort to change that... And the result of\nsuch a debate would probably be determined by any volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002147.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 09, 2004 at 08:53PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002140", "id": "radiance-general_002147"}
