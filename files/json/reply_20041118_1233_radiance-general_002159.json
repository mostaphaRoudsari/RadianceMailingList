June 1993. That never made it, since a \nchange of format would have produced various nasty side effects. The \nmain reason for my wish was to paste the image into existing (tpically \noutside) scenery easily. With fisheye HDRs being on-vogue now, \nsurrounding the model with an HDR source-primitive is a better way to \nsolve that merging problem.\n\n\nSo, you'll have to generate a z-file (-z option), use the z-value to \ndifferentiate between an object hit (alpha opaque) and infinity (alpha \ntransparent) and convert that to whatever image format you need. \nSuitable pcomb/pfilt/pvalue scripts are left as an exercise to the \nreader ...\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "November 18, 2004 at 12:33PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002156", "id": "radiance-general_002159"}
