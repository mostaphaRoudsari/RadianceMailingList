{"body": "Hi,\nI am not really sure which is your question... I missed the 1st\nemails...sorry ;-)\n\n\nBut if I am right you are trying to create an alpha channel from a rendered\npicture,\n\n\nI would do this way:\n\n\n1) generate your rendering: image\n2) generate a mask: you can just create an image with only the object and\n-av 1 1 1,\nthen use \"pcomb -e 'vo=if(li(1),1,0)' object > mask \" to create a BW image\nwith 0 and 1.\n\n\n3) apply the mask to the 1st image:\npcomb -e 'ro=if(li(2),ri(1),0);go=if(li(2),gi(1),0);bo=if(li(2),bi(1),0)'\nimage mask > filtered\n\n\n\n\nin general all the functions are defined in rayinit.cal, into the radiance\nlibs...\n\n\nhope it helps/works,\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002163.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "November 19, 2004 at 11:48AM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002156", "id": "radiance-general_002163"}
