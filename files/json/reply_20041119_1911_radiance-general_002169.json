{"body": "It was frustratingly hilarious trying to reverse engineer the \"if\" \nstatement in the pcomb manual example that draws the dot.  I tried \nseveral times to put a conditional statement in the \"if \n\"like,'if(ri(1)<0.05,0,1)' and kept getting errors associated with a \n')' expected.  Finally I realized that the condition was an expression \nimplicitly compared to 0.  Then i realized that there was a built-in \nfunctional language and that this was not standard Unix syntax.  Then I \nrealized there were whole reference sections devoted to the functional \nlanguage in the book and on the website.  The knowledge base just keeps \nexpanding... too bad my little brain can't oftentimes keep up.  \nThankfully this forum is here and I hope I am not testing people's \npatience with my inane questions.  Thanks folks.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn Nov 19, 2004, at 12:41 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002169.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "November 19, 2004 at 07:11PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002156", "id": "radiance-general_002169"}
