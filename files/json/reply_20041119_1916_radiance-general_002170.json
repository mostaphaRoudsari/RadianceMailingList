As an added bonus -- and more importantly -- I have \nalso gained some very good friends.\n\n\nWelcome, have fun, share, etcetera and so forth.\n\n\nJust out of interest, what brings you to the Radiance world?  Research, \nlighting design, sustainability?  Art?  This list attracts all kinds. \nHow did you find us, and what are you doing with Radiance?\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002170.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 19, 2004 at 07:16PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002156", "id": "radiance-general_002170"}
