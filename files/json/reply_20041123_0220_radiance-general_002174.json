{"body": "What beam spread are you looking for? VNSP, NS, FL, WFL are typical\ndesignations.  GE has these in their lamp data base. BEGA and other\nmanufacturers have photometry of the lamp in a fixture fixture. I will\nsee what I can find unless someone else has the data at hand.\n\n\nhttp://www.gelighting.com/na/specoem/lightbeams.html\n\n\nLots of PAR lamps in this data base which you can extract and run\nthrough ies2rad.
