{"body": "Hi Mike,\n\n\nThe only reference I know about texture baking with Radiance\nis here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Spanlang/index.html\n\n\nThe idea is to set up an ortographic view for each polygon.\n\n\nI do something similar with blender, not fully automatic yet,\nbut usually my models are only made of triangles and a few quads ...\n\n\nMaybe you can have a look at the glu tessellation functions\n(like checking the MESA source code).\n\n\nI've also put together a doxygen documentation of the radiance source\ntree, that you can download from here:\n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/pub/radiance_doxygen.tar.gz\n\n\nThis really helps me a lot when I'm looking for something\ninside the radiance source tree, together with grep ...\n\n\nHope this helps ...\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Anselmo <pisuke at blueyonder.co.uk>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002176.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "November 26, 2004 at 12:52PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002175", "id": "radiance-general_002176"}
