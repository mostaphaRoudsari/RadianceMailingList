{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nWhat you are running up against is the general limit to the length of  \nindividual words in Radiance scene files.  This is set by the MAXSTR  \nmacro in src/common/object.h.  You could change this macro value and  \nrecompile, but it should not be necessary.  The instance type can give  \na filename minus the directory path and it will perform a search of all  \nthe directories in the RAYPATH environment variable.  You can simply  \nadd the path(s) you want included to this variable and execute  \nreplmarks in the directory containing your instance octrees so that it  \nproduces only the final path component.\n\n\nIs this the problem you were having with replmarks in 3.6, or is  \nsomething else wrong as well?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002179.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 26, 2004 at 05:23PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002177", "id": "radiance-general_002179"}
