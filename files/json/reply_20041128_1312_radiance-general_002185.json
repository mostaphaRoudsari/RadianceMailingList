I have 3.6 compiled on \n10.3 here, and everything is fine. Do you want to try my binaries for \n10.3.x?\n\n\n> but i am sure i have X11 support in my mac. so how can i do to let it \n> work???\n\n\nProbably, if you use 10.3.x (did you use any other X11-apps in the \npast?).\n\n\n> P.S>i am sorry about any unconvenient due to my POOR english.\n\n\nI think I am the one writing the worst English on this list - and you \ndidn't have to HEAR me so far ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002185.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
