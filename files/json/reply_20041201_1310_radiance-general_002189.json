{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> Because of a conflict, the command \"rview\" has been renamed  \"rvu\"\n\n\nThat's true, however, if this was the problem, he should simply get the \nwrong program (vi) started, no such error message.\n\n\n>> \"\"dyld: rview can't open library: /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib  (No \n>> such  file or directory, errno = 2)Trace/BPT trap\"\"\n\n\nBy the way, did you check if this library exists on your system? Try: \nls /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.*\n\n\nThe file is there on my OS X 10.3.6 machine and should be installed if \nyou have X11-support!\n\n\nOne more hint, you can perfectly remote-control linux- and other \nix-machines from your OS X laptop using ssh, even X11-windows can be \nredirected to your laptop. IMHO it's better to use \"real\" computers for \nlarge renderings, I don't like to overheat my laptop by having 100% cpu \nfor hours...\n\n\nI will make some 3.6 binaries and provide them on my binary-pages as \nsoon as I find the time.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002189.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
