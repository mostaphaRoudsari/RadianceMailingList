{"body": "Jelle,\n\n\nThis is a very interesting question, and one in which I have an\ninterest in following. I'll share with you my limited knowledge.\n\n\nIt has been my knowledge from speaking and reading about display\ndevices (mainly reflective print and transparency film) that film\ncan record a greater range of brightnesses, allowing it greater\nbit depth. Print is hindered by its reflective nature, and the\nupper and lower bounds of reflectivity (users of Radiance are\nmore aware than most that what is normally percieved as white is\nprobably no more than 70-80% reflective).\n\n\nI have been assured by professional digital printers that a\ngood 8-bit-per-channel image gets printed just as well as an\nimage with grater depth. I may have even been told that the\nrasterizer upgrades the bit depth as it upsamples the image.\nI can't confirm that, though.\n\n\nI usually print on a Lightjet 5000. I use ra_tiff to convert my\n.pic into a 16-bit-per-channel TIFF, then I use Cinepaint on\nLinux to do final adjustments, outputting to an 8bpc TIFF.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Wed, 1 Dec 2004, Jelle Feringa // EZCT / Paris wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002191.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "December 01, 2004 at 03:20PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002190", "id": "radiance-general_002191"}
