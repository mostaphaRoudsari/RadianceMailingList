{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> In general you need to print to a print device that goes direct rgb.\n\n\n??? You mean a driver that can do the rgb to cmyk translation, without the\nneed to do that in an application? Just wondering, I never heard about\nrgb-printers, do you mean transfering to a film (which is like foto and as\nsuch rgb)?\n\n\nRegarding printers, it is a big help to use printers that don't offer just\ncmyk, but also the light colors (there are 6 and 8 color printers), as this\navoids raster problems in bright regions of your renderings.\n\n\nCalibration... afaik the radiance output is close to srgb, so if you have an\noutput profile for your printer (icc), this should be easy. There is also\nmacbethcal which could be used to make a simple output calibration, however,\nI never used it (I tried once).\n\n\nI can't imagine that the bit per channel question is really relevant (for\ninkjet printing), because the limitations of paper and the raster technique\nused to mix the colors.\n\n\nI will have to do some large-format printouts of radiance pictures (which\nhave to be rendered first ;-) for an exhibition next march, as such I am\ninterested in the topic.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002194.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
