{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYes, as I understand these photographic printers (eg direct to photo \npaper), such as the Lambda and Pegasus, print RGB not CMYK. The nice \nthing about this is there is no mucking about with conversion from one \ncolorspace to the other. They use red, green and blue lasers to expose \nthe paper. Do a web search for Durst Lambda to learn more or check out:\n\n\nhttp://www.durst-online.com/uk/produkte.asp?pid=2&hid=\n\n\nI think that the kodak product may be different, perhaps some kind of \nLED to expose the paper.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002196.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 01, 2004 at 10:42PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002190", "id": "radiance-general_002196"}
