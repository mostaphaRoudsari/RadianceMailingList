Or is that purely \nacademic ?\nI had found it rather difficult to get a feel what the a laser printer \ndoes internally, what happens between the RGB values in the PS or PDF \nfile and the beam intensity. Has the user enough control over that \nprocess to justify a calibration ? Anyone got (negative ?) experiences \nto reproduce colors and shades between self-calibrations of a printer ?\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002202.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "December 02, 2004 at 10:54AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002190", "id": "radiance-general_002202"}
