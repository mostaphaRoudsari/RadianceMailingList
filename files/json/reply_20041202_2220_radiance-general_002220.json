Otherwise set 'fore' to a constant value and a '.' \n(point) for func.cal.\n\n\nIf you apply this mixed material to a trans base, make shure that the \nroughness parameter is zero to have the light really shine through it.\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002220.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "December 02, 2004 at 10:20PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002213", "id": "radiance-general_002220"}
