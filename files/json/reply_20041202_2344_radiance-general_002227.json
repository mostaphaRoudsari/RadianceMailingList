{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nXimage using the 'h' command or the -e human option is more-or-less \nequivalent to pcond -c -s, but the -h option of pcond turns on acuity \nand veiling glare filters (-v and -a) that are not included in ximage.  \nThe veiling glare in particular can reduce the image contrast, \nespecially around bright sources and objects.  Also, pcond using \nfoveal-size (1 degree) luminance samples, rather than pixels, and this \ncan result in a different tone curve.\n\n\n-Greg (waving his hands wildly)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002227.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 02, 2004 at 11:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002222", "id": "radiance-general_002227"}
