{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nUnfortunately not getting any love using that, although I did accidentally\ncome across a slightly better result by applying the mirror material to\nitself using the code below, not sure why!\n\n\nvoid mirror lamp_bulb_outer_material\n1 lamp_bulb_outer_material\n0\n3 0.9 0.9 0.9\n\n\nThe surface I'm trying to apply the material to is an imported mesh, could\nthat be a reason that adding the transparency to the mirror material isn't\nworking? The code I've tried is below if it helps:\n\n\nvoid trans lamp_bulb_outer_transparency\n0\n0\n7 .9 .9 .9 .01 .01 .5 .5\n\n\n\n\nvoid mirror lamp_bulb_outer_material\n1 lamp_bulb_outer_transparency\n0\n3 .9 .9 .9\n\n\nlamp_bulb_outer_material mesh lamp_bulb_outer_object\n1 lamp_bulb_outer.rtm\n0\n0\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nTom\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002228.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tom Wood", "created_at": "December 03, 2004 at 12:25AM", "created_by": "Tom_Wood", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002216", "id": "radiance-general_002228"}
