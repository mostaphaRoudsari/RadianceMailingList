{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\n> matte saturated colored samples\n\n\nDon't expect good results, but this is definitely worthwhile.\n\n\n> matte Munsell gray cards\n> variation of f-stop from 2.8 to 8 (min and max on my digital camera)\n\n\nYou should combine this with the off-axis tests, since vignetting is \nknown to increase at larger apertures.  You can actually plot the \nfall-off as a function of angle from the image center and fit a curve \nto it for each f-stop.  This can then be applied as a correction using \npcomb.\n\n\n> incandescent vs. fluorescent vs. daylight (daylight is tough as it \n> varies)\n\n\nYou can use different color-balance fluorescents instead of relying on \ndaylight.\n\n\n> on-axis vs. 40 degrees off axis\n> colored and gray cards on black vs. white background\n> sample size around 4 X 4 cm^2 photographed at a distance of 5 meters \n> or so\n>\n> tested against spot luminance meter 1 degree\n\n\nThe flare measurement we just performed on our camera is one I \nrecommend.  Start with a uniform light source, such as a fluorescent \nfixture with a good diffuser.  Capture an HDR image of it, and take a \nluminance reading at its center.  Then, cover it with a black \nposterboard with a small hole cut in it and capture an image of the \nhole using exactly the same settings.  If the camera lens is perfect, \nthe measurement of the hole should match the original uniform field.  \nIt will be lower, and the difference is due to scattering in the lens.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002232.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 03, 2004 at 01:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002219", "id": "radiance-general_002232"}
