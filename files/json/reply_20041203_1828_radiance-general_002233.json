{"body": "Hi Tom,\n\n\nI'm not sure why using a mirror as its own alternate would do anything \n-- the code says it should be the same as not specifying an \nalternate....\n\n\nThat said, there's little point is specifying a mirror material for a \nmesh surface.  It should behave just like trans at that point -- it \nwon't create any virtual sources, which is presumably why you would use \n'mirror' in the first place.  Virtual sources only get created for \nplanar surface types:  'polygon' & 'ring'.  Any other surface type \n(including meshes) just get treated normally.\n\n\nFor a 90% reflective material with 10% transmission, the following \n'trans' should work:\n\n\nvoid trans mirror_mat\n0\n0\n7 .92 .92 .92 .9 0 1 1\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002233.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 03, 2004 at 06:28PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002216", "id": "radiance-general_002233"}
