{"body": "Rob,\n\n\nWhen using IES files, do you think it's better to convert your lamp\ncolor to white or use the real color values?  I always use the V-lambda\nmultiplier (something like... rcalc -e '$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'\n) and include the color when using ies2rad.  Seems like things get\ncomplicated when you are running calculations and renderings and you\nhave different types of sources.  Maybe white is best?\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002243.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "December 11, 2004 at 07:48PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002240", "id": "radiance-general_002243"}
