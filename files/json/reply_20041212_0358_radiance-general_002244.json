RwR goes into this a bit, explaining \nit better than I could, but the general deal is that the eye is still \nbetter than any machine at dealing with visualizing scenes.  The eye \ndoes an amazing color-balance job, on the fly, that computer displays \ncannot, so color temperature differences tend to get exaggerated in \nrenderings when you use explicit lamp colors.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I botched a point calc that didn't even involve \ncosine evaluation, so you may wanna think 2x (or 10.76x) before asking \nme *anything* about this stuff.  ;-)\n\n\nStill embarrassed,\nRob Guglielmetti\n\n\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002244.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 12, 2004 at 03:58AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002240", "id": "radiance-general_002244"}
