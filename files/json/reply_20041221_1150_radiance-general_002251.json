The best and simplest way to convert them is by using\nRayfront. There are also some workarounds available for\ntransforming them into \"normal\" entities first, which may or may\nnot be practical for you.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002251.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 21, 2004 at 11:50AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002249", "id": "radiance-general_002251"}
