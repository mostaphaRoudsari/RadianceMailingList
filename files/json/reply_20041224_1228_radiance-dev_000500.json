I really like the enthusiasm people put into\nsuch projects, but if you develop for X11, then that will just\nperpetuate the porting problems we already have.\n\n\nOf course, abstract toolkits like WxWidgets also have the\nadvantage that programming with them is *much* easier and more\nconvenient than with any platform specific API.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-December/000500.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 24, 2004 at 12:28PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000496", "id": "radiance-dev_000500"}
