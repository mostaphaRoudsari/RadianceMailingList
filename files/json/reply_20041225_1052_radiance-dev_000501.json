{"body": "Maybe, the best way is using a timer. I worked with wxwidgets and i did a\nfirst aproximation of the viewer adding a orbit and a pan function to glrad\nbut  I would not like to soil Gregs code with new libraries, and probably\nwxwidgets also use a timer on x11.\nI am only starting with the viewer, learning greg's code (it's amazing). I\nwould like to do an interactive viewer althougth it works at small\nresolutions (300x300 px or so) starting from rview. I think rview can be\noptimized for architecture visualization on some ways:\n\n\n- adding interactive orbit, pan and walkthrough functions\n- using opengl to obtain point(color=object number,z buffer=distance)\nintersections from viewer\n- using opengl to make shadow maps from light points and using them or\nforcing the ray calculation in function of the distance to the shadow (to\navoid too small shadow pictures)\n- using the irradiance caching but adding to the file all the values cached\nfrom all the hemisphere and using them to the ambient component (indirect\nirradiance) and also for the rough specular component\n- using opengl objects duplication in the plane of simmetry and stencil\nbuffer to calculate points intersections of reflections(specular\nsampling)(color=object, zbuffer=distance)\n\n\nThe viewer will try to optimize time but maintaining all greg's light and\nmaterial calculation\n\n\nthanks peter and georg\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-December/000501.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Mun\u00e1rriz", "created_at": "December 25, 2004 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Mun\u00e1rriz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000496", "id": "radiance-dev_000501"}
