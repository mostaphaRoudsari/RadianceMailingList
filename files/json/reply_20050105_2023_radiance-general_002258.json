{"body": "> Hi all!\n>\n> I've finally decided to release \"brad\". :)\n\n\n> It is available through my new \"radiance tools\" website\n> http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/\n> (the website needs a lot of work, too!)\n\n\nTotally snowed under here at work, no time to look, but I am psyched about\nthis news, Francesco!!  I registered right away, but alas, lack the time\nfor a proper look-see.  But I will.  It would be *great* to be able to\nplay with this on the Mac (of course my Mac is on the way to Apple for\nrepairs, perhaps this gives you an idea of my crazy life around here right\nnow)!\n\n\n> A happy new year to the Radiance community!\n\n\nRight back at ya!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002258.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 05, 2005 at 08:23PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002256", "id": "radiance-general_002258"}
