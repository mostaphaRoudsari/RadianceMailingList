In any case,\nit hat quite a few problems when there were multiple holes in odd\nshapes.\n\n\nBut the best solution to this entirely depends on the way your\ninput data is structured. The more you know about what kinds of\npolygons you're going to see, the easier it becomes.\n\n\nOne alternative approach would be to cut the outer polygon apart\ninstead of keeping it intact. Just sort the corner points of all\nthe holes eg. vertically, and make a horizontal cut at each\nheight. You need to be careful to combine equal hights (allow for\nsome numeric rounding error), and not to cut through tall holes\nsitting next to short ones. This method should work particularly\nwell if the wall and hole polygons are orthogonal to each other,\nwhich happens to often be the case in architectural models.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "January 06, 2005 at 04:08PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002259", "id": "radiance-general_002260"}
