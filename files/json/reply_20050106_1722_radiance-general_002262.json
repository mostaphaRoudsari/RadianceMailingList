{"body": "Maybe I'm being naive, but I've had good luck creating connecting seams \nbetween arbitrary vertices in holey polygons.  Make sure the outer \nvertices are in counter-clockwise order around the normal, and the \ninterior (hole) vertices are clockwise.  Then, the algorithm goes \nsomething like this:\n\n\n\tFirst N vertices are N vertices of outer contour\n\t\tNext M1 vertices are M1 vertices of hole 1\n\t\tClose hole loop with vertex that is copy of the first hole vertex\n\t\tClose seam by adding copy of last outer contour vertex\n\t\tRepeat 3 steps above for each hole contour\n\n\nIn Radiance, polygon seams can cross all over each other and it doesn't \ncreate any artifacts.  This is how fonts are rendered, for example.  \nThis is also why I never bothered implementing holes in polygons; I \nnever found where seams caused a problem, and I couldn't think of any \nway besides seams for implementing holes.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002262.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2005 at 05:22PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002259", "id": "radiance-general_002262"}
