{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nThis can be done with an appropriate insertion of rcalc in your \nRadiance command.  In the scene file, you would modify your gensky line \nto read:\n\n\n!gensky 6 21 12 | rcalc -p -i sunlight.fmt \\\n\t-e 'sr=1.035*si;sg=1.003*si;sb=0.826*si' \\\n\t-o 'void light solar 0 0 3 ${sr} ${sg} ${sb}'\n\n\nThe color for the sun is converted from the CIE (x,y) chromaticity for \nstandard illuminant B, which is (0.3485,0.3517).  The file \n\"sunlight.fmt\" must contain the following:\n\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 ${si} ${si} ${si}\n\n\nYou'll need the latest version of rcalc (3.6.1 release), as previous \nversions did not have the -p option.\n\n\nHope this works for you.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002263.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2005 at 05:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002261", "id": "radiance-general_002263"}
