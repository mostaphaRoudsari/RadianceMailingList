{"body": "Thank you for your answers. Both are really very useful!\n\n\n. I am still a little bit confused about aperture...\nDoes big aperture number (big depth of field) mean that you \"focus\" (if i can use this term) on the whole scene?\nand does small aperture (small debth of field) mean that you focus only on the foreground?\n\n\nIn my case I take photos of a mirrored ball in order to create a light probe.\nWhat I really need to use for aperture? Small or big values as aperture number?\n\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002268.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Despina Michael", "created_at": "January 06, 2005 at 10:44PM", "created_by": "Despina_Michael", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002264", "id": "radiance-general_002268"}
