{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nShort answer to your long question:  3 exposures separated by 1 f-stop \neach is not enough for an HDR image, in my opinion.\n\n\nI find that 2 stops on either side is often less than I need for \noutdoor shots that include bright clouds.  Also, I wish the shortest \nexposure on my Olympus 4040 was faster than 1/800th sec., as that still \nleaves bright areas saturated.  (I used to have an Olympus 3030 and it \nwas the same.)  The manufacturers do seem to be headed the wrong \ndirection when it comes to HDR these days.  I've also noticed that they \nlike to add all kinds of auto exposure curves and crap like that which \ntotally screws me up.  To be honest, you're better off getting a C-3040 \nfrom some discount place than a newer, fancier cameras.  That goes for \nSLRs as well.  I honestly don't think they're worth the extra bucks, \nunless you happen to have a slew of lenses you have to justify owning.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002272.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 07, 2005 at 04:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002264", "id": "radiance-general_002272"}
