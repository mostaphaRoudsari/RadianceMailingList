{"body": "Greg, Rob thanks for your answers!\n\n\n> Look at this page - gives a decent demonstation of the relationships\n> http://www.photonhead.com/exposure/exposure.php\n>\nThe link is exactly what I need!!\n\n\n>> 5) One problem of resulting hdr images (in cases that there was a\n>> generation of image)\n>> was that they were somehow \"green\".

From the information I \nlearned from your replies, I understood that my photos are very bad...\n\n\nI'll take new ones, taking in account all you said. Hopefully results will \nbe better. If I found out what's the problem with \"green\" in generated hdri \nI will let  you know!\nThanks again,\nDespina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002274.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Despina Michael", "created_at": "January 07, 2005 at 01:48PM", "created_by": "Despina_Michael", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002264", "id": "radiance-general_002274"}
