{"body": "Hi Judy,\n\n\nIn what way do you qualify as a \"newbie??\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no output facility from ximage.  The only way \nto get the image is with a window capture.  Fortunately, X11 has a \nutility for this, called xwd.  If your image file were named \"35b3\", \nyou could call the following command once it was up:\n\n\n\t% xwd -name 35b3 -out 35b3.xwd\n\n\nThe xwd program looks up the window by name, then dumps its contents to \nthe file 35b3.xwd.  Unfortunately, none of the mainstream programs will \nrecognize the little-used \"X-window dump\" format, so you'll have to \nload it into GraphicConverter or somesuch and save it out in a more \nconventional format.\n\n\n-Greg\n(Definite oldbie)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002280.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 11, 2005 at 05:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002278", "id": "radiance-general_002280"}
