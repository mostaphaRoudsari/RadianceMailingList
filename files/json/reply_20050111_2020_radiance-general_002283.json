{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nThe formula for K should be:\n\n\n\t\t\t             exp(-tan^2(delta)/alpha^2)\n\t\t\t  K =     -----------------------------------\n\t\t\t         cos(theta_i)*cos(theta_r) *4pi*alpha^2\n\n\nHow are you computing delta?  It is the angle between the half-vector \nand the normal.\n\n\nAlso, for large disk sources, the exact calculation for solid angle is:\n\n\n\t2pi*(1 - cos(theta_s/2))\n\n\nWhere theta_s is the subtended angle of the light source.  This is a \ninsignificant correction to what you have for distant sources.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002283.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 11, 2005 at 08:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002279", "id": "radiance-general_002283"}
