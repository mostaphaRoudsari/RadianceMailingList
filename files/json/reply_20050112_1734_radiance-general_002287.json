{"body": "Thanks for that, made the correction for tan^2(delta) and delta is as you say\ndelta = normal.dotProduct(halfwayVectorUnit);\nwhere\nhalfwayVector = point_to_lightUnit  - point_to_camUnit;\nhalfwayVectorUnit = halfwayVector.normalize();\n\n\n\n\nSo for the ambient light of .5 .5 .5 I just add it at the end? I don't need to\nmultiply by the diffuse component rho_diffuse?\n\n\nTarik\n\n\n\n\nQuoting Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002287.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tarik Rahman", "created_at": "January 12, 2005 at 05:34PM", "created_by": "Tarik_Rahman", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002279", "id": "radiance-general_002287"}
