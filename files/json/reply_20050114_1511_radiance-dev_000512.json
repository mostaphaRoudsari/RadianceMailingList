I don't see/feel a large common dominator between the Radiance users \nand computer guys used to anon CVS. Not unless Radiance swims the \nmainstream of CG and given today's abstraction level of the rendering \ncore (or the absence of it) I'd be surprised if that happens soon.\nFrankly I guess that the config caters for Radiance so far. There \nweren't any requests for features (except Wiki, at the LBNL workshop by \nsome, see next line) and less requests for things that would be too \ncumbersome to set up. Open for suggestions.\nThat's not to say I don't have some ideas what to set up next. \n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000512.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "January 14, 2005 at 03:11PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000512"}
