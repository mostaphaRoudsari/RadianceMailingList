It is truly the bible for this software.  As Brad Hamilton said\nto Jeff Spicoli in \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" when referring to the\nrules of the restaurant, \"read it, know it, live it\".\n\n\nAs for math & physics, well, this former theatre major is using Radiance\non a fairly regular basis.  Oh yes, there are conversations on this list\nthat go sailing clear over my head, but that just shows the enormous\nflexibility of the software and the diversity of the user base.  That\nsaid, you *should* have a grounding in the basics of the physics of light\n& illumination.  I'd assume you have an interest in that or you wouldn't\nbe looking to get involved with this bunch of wackos in the first place.\n\n\nHave fun...\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002293.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 14, 2005 at 04:23PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002292", "id": "radiance-general_002293"}
