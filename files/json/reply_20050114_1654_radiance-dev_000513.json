And there are so few developers because there's\nno CVS access...\n\n\n> I don't see/feel a large common dominator \n> between the Radiance users and computer guys used to anon \n> CVS.

A wiki would be a fantastic step forward. A central\nbug, request, & code repository would be ideal.\n\n\nWhat are you intending to set up next? :)\n\n\n- mike\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000513.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Kruger", "created_at": "January 14, 2005 at 04:54PM", "created_by": "Michael_Kruger", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000513"}
