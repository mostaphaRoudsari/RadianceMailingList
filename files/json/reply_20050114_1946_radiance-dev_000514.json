{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\ngood points. lines of thought worth some brain cycles.\n\n\nMichael Kruger wrote:\n\n\n> ....\n>\n>1) If we want radiance to become _really_ popular, then it could do with\n>Several improvements, like making it much simpler to install, increased \n>flexibility, exporters, or baking.\n>  \n>\n/historic flash-back on/\nreflecting for a second on some reasons why Radiance is in the shape it \nis now:\nRadiance has been push forward almost single handedly by Greg Ward, \nbecoming the \"keeper of the code\" and setting the bar for inserting new \nideas. The positive (IMHO) side is that the core is relative trustworthy \ncalculating the right values. However, except for its first couple of \nmonths and recently with merging versions for 3R5, there has never been \nexplicit funding for development or maintaining. Which is a reason not \nto accept (and understand, and maintain, and bug fix) code from others \n(Greg- correct me if I'm wrong).\n/historic flash-back off/\n\n\nThere's at least one sad example of extra code which illustrates the \nproblem: Roland's photon map had been development as Phd project paid by \na research grant. So far, so good. The grant money is used up, Roland \nheaded off to somewhere else, the research org doesn't seem interested \nin maintaining it and the code is left stranded. Maintaining someone \nelse's code is ugly and so far I haven't heard of anyone saying he/she \nported and checked the photon map for 3R6. Not to mention bug fixes or \nfeatures.\n\n\nI hope that I'm not devaluating other contributions and good will, but \nthe problem seems not so much contributing code, but nursing this \ncontribution over the years.\nThis does work with other PD projects very well. Take Apache for \nexample, whose security and stability requirements match those of \nRadiance's requirements of well validated light calculations easily. My \npersonal theory is depressingly capitalistic: More market, more money, \nmore money to pay people for development. Programmers have to buy food \nand if they are not paid for PD maintenance, they have to do other \nthings. Even with personal motivation being high. And more so after \nleaving university. Maybe I'm suffering from what the French call \n/deformation professionell/ ; the world might be better and and it would \nwork out without anyone paid at least half time to do the nasty bits \n(likely putting Radiance thru validation scenarios). I can't say for \nsure. However, I do think that a missing CVS access is the least part of \nthe problem. Sure its /technically/ the fastest part to solve.\n\n\n>2) These kind of requirements need multiple core developers.\n>  \n>\nApart from above remarks, that would be very useful.\n\n\n>3) I would like to contribute to radiance, but am put off by the\n>rather exclusive stance the project has over source contribution.\n>  \n>\nWell, I sure know that feeling. I always thought that a print in \nfunction files would be nice for quick debugging. That patch, besides \nothers, never made it into the source. Still I think a slick core is \ngood. That may be the same attitude as the \"Life of Brian\" guy in the \nRoman dungeon who admired the Romans as \"terrific race, the Romans\"....\n\n\n>That said, I've found that all the radiance people I've spoken to have\n>been a fantastic bunch - extremely cheerful, helpful, straight-forward, \n>and a pleasure to deal with. \n>\nabsolutely.\nDo you know about Carsten Bauer's radzilla project ? There's a mailing \nlist (http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radzilla)  which \nis not much announced publicly (that could be fixed) and run by Carsten. \nCarsten rewrote large parts of Radiance and that may serve as an \nalternative seed.\n\n\n>....\n>\n>I'd really love to see some decent documentation on developing\n>with radiance. A wiki would be a fantastic step forward. A central\n>bug, request, & code repository would be ideal.\n>  \n>\n From the results of the feedback form, at least 16 folks are willing to \nwrite doc and examples. Excellent. A WikiWiki try in Feb 2004 stalled as \nI found it incomprehensible. Next on the list is MoinMoin and that might \nbe installed as spin-off when I deal with the Wiki question on another \nproject in paid time (sic) around Feb 2005.\n\n\nRadiance's future depends on folks wanting to contribute, help and work \non it. Let's see what can be done to give folks a platform to work on.\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000514.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "January 14, 2005 at 07:46PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000514"}
