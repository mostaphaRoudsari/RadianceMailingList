I guess I was never sure quite how it would work, given that \na ray can spawn many others, resulting in a bit of a jumble on output.  \nDid you ever try the debugcal script?  This is what I have used in the \npast to pick rays and test function file output.  Unfortunately, \nthere's no man page for it, but you essentially give it an octree and \nsome rcalc options (-f function.cal for example), and it takes ray \norigins and directions on the input (as produced by ximage) and \nproduces results from your rcalc options.  It doesn't handle every \npossible case, I guess, but it's a 99% solution.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000516.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 14, 2005 at 09:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000516"}
