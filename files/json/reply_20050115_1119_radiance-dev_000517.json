There is a standard way, so \nwhy add it. Now hang me up the wrong way again.\nThe bit about the missing man page is slightly irritating, of course. At \nleast from the point of rhetoric elegance ...\n\n\nMysteriously, there's now a html page \nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/contribute-howto.html .\n\n\nHey guys, if you're still with us, don't let this stop you from writing \ncode. Roll up the sleeves and dig right in.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000517.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "January 15, 2005 at 11:19AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000517"}
