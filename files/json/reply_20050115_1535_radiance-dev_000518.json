Concerning the CVS write access question, my own experience from \nmessing with the code makes me definitely argue in favour of Greg and \nPeter. And, well, isn't it quite normal in every more or less complex \nproject (regardless if software or hardware or whatever..) that only a \nselected few poeple are in control of the vital parts?\n\n\nBehind those technical aspects, the (- one of the -) key point(s) is \nprobably the following: Radiance is used worldwide for a lot of \ndifferent tasks, including those it wasn't originally written for. The \ncode is freely available, and there are lots of programmers out there, \ntoo. So lets put 1 and 1 together, its natural that there arises an \nenthusiasm for adding features, changing stuff, etc.\nIt's natural, too, that mostly this reflects special preferences which \nhave not to be identical (mostly they aren't :-) ) with the original \nintention of Radiance.\n\n\nAs the point was mentioned (and secondly, because most of the external \nideas probably belong to the visualization branch) I can imagine \nRadzilla becoming an 'alternative seed', a freak platform for\nintegration of features. One should definitely wait a bit, however.\nThe current 0.8 doesn't suit for it, but I've once more rearranged \nthings, threwn out the massive code duplications etc, etc and the \nupcoming 1.0 release will have at least some sort of internal structure, \nwhich might make it easier for others to integrate stuff. So let's \npostpone this until I'm finished with the current revision (most \nprobably in some weeks..)\nI see it rather relaxed anyway, the chances that in some months hundreds\nof people will ring me up, offering fully worked out code for \nintegration, are quite low .. :-). Nevertheless things sometimes *might* \ngo on quicker if more than just one guy is working on it :-)\n-lets wait and see..\n\n\nConcerning the documentation issue:\na 'problem' might be that there is already lots and lots of it \navailable, but many of it is very sophisticated and probably hard to \nunderstand for non scientist users.\nSo the usual cry for 'more docs, more docs' might translate into 'easier \ndocs, easier docs'. I think it's a common aspect of life, that sometimes \nan outsider who has overcome lots of misunderstandings might have a \nbetter feeling of explaining things to a newbie than the real masters, \nfor whom everything is evident and who directly speak in abstract terms. \nSo some central structure for collecting tips, tutorials, FAQs etc from \na users point of view will be really nice to have, and save the gurus \nthe time of answering the same type of question again and again on the \nmailing list.\nBTW, there's that new exchange site from Francesco, \nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/, which already offers increased \npossibility of participation, (like upload of files and pics etc), so in \nfact some means are already present, they depend of course on all others \nto use them :-).\n\n\n-Carsten\n\n\n\n\nPS\n\n\n@Peter: MoinMoin ??? Jau, min Jung, keek mol on, wohnste nech mehr in \nFreiburch? kann man mit di jetzt moins opm Fischmaakt snaken?\n\n\nPS 2\n@Peter again\nyou've mentioned the photon map, this is really a sad example. One \nproblem is, that the code has a completely different flavour. Whilst \nhaving gained a quite comprehensive understanding of Radiance I still \nhave just a rough overview of the pm code. The other is that photon maps \nare newer, more experimental, more demanding in terms of machine \nressources (esp memory), so with the photon map now you have the \nproblems like perhaps with classic Raytracing 20 years ago, on normal \nPCs you soon run against some limits and that disappoints the users who \nare in the meantime accustomed to normal raytracing pics being produced \nquickly without problems. Although I'm fond of it, I also have the \nassumption that the current pm implementation needs some improvement, \nbut, yes, who should do it?\nAdditionally, situations which demand for a photon map approach appear \nfar less often than 'normal' applications for Radiance, which naturally \nresults in neglection of this feature from the majority.\nOn the other hand, the mentioned difficulties (different approach, \ndifferent code) are at the same time interesting, too, in that they show \nhow much can be done in integrating comprehensive new features into \nRadiance without compromising the original function as long as pm is not \nswitched on.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000518.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "January 15, 2005 at 03:35PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000518"}
