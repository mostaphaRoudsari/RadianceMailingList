{"body": "More on documentation.  It seems to me that it would be nice for new \nusers to have a place to help them get started, something like a web \npage where they could click a few checkboxes like the ones on your \nsurvey, identifying themselves as a student, a lighting designer, and \narchitect, a researcher, etc., then saying what kind of machine they \nhave or other details about their set-up before being directed to a \npage where they could get their newbie questions answered.\n\n\nSounds like a bit of work, but hear me out.  On another page, we would \nencourage experienced users to write about what helped them the most \ngetting started with Radiance.  They would answer the same survey \nquestions above, only at the end of it they would be directed to a page \nwith questions asked by the newbies, and be permitted to edit or fill \nin the answers.  Sort of a self-constructing FAQ with personalization \nbuilt in.  There would also be areas for essays on topics of general \ninterest, such as \"How I Got Started with Radiance\" and \"Some Bonehead \nMistakes to Avoid\" and \"Radiance Made No Sense To Me Until I (fill in \nthe blank)\".\n\n\nThe trouble with a general FAQ for Radiance is that there are too many \naspects to it, too many different types of users, and too many answers \nthat will only serve to confuse people if they haven't been properly \nprimed.  On the plus side, we have some amazing users who are good \nwriters and storytellers and are a generally helpful sort.  I'm sure if \nwe built it, they would come.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000522.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 17, 2005 at 06:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000522"}
