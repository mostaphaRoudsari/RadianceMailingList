{"body": "if you need just the solar bracelet make it a colored cylinder and tilt it\naccording to the latitude...\nyou can both draw it in some CAD system and use it as it is (instancing it,\nit could be split into colours according to months) or generate it on the\nfly by means of a parametric pattern on the skydome.\nIf you need to see sun positions (with equation of time) you can just keep\nadding sky definition without the glowing dome to the same file, then\nvisualize the all thing together, being also able to get annual exposure to\nother data... (remember -ps 1, look 0 0 1 facing 0 1 0, -vth ... and wait\n;-)) )\nall these things are really quick to be done...\ncheers,\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000525.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "January 17, 2005 at 01:30PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000524", "id": "radiance-dev_000525"}
