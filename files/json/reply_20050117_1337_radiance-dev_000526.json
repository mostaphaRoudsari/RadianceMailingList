We could just generate the parts of the gensky \noutput we need using a script and just use that?\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000526.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Kings-Lynne", "created_at": "January 17, 2005 at 01:37PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Kings-Lynne", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000524", "id": "radiance-dev_000526"}
