{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nMaybe that means that we should start something simple, like the good \nold how-to's. This is more application-specific, and can be done by \neach of us, as it depends on experience and not so much on general \nknowledge. E.g. if I write a how-to on using Radiance on my Mac with my \nMac software, it is easy for me as I know all the steps in the process \nfrom everyday life. And I think for most users this is the beginning - \nthey want to solve a specific problem (make a rendering from an AutoCAD \nmodel, map a picture onto a poylgon etc). Something close to the \ntutorlia examples, but more real-life (the tutorials cover modeling \nwith the Radiance scene description language, not with the steps to get \nfrom CAD to a rendering).\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000528.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
