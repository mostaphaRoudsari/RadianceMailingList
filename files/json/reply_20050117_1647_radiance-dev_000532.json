Have a look at the newly-created Mac OS\nX Server FAQ: http://www.macos-x-server.com/wiki/Main_Page\n\n\nThe admin created the FAQ, but anyone can click the edit link on each\ntopic and flesh out the answers to the FAQs, and add more.  It's a good\nexample of a \"new\" Wiki, one that is just starting to evolve.\n\n\nThere would also be areas for essays on topics of general\n> interest, such as \"How I Got Started with Radiance\" and \"Some Bonehead\n> Mistakes to Avoid\" and \"Radiance Made No Sense To Me Until I (fill in\n> the blank)\".\n\n\nThis is an excellent idea.  This is something I've always wanted to do on\nmy own site, but *still* haven't gotten around to doing.  Since I'm\nproposing to make a similar presentation at the Montreal Workshop this\nsummer, I can pretty much guarantee that I would have some content for\nthis section in the future, and would love to contribute more.  I vividly\nrecall my staggered start(s) with Radiance, and know loads of people who\nwere simply scared off by the unix/shell/no-gui aspects of Radiance and\nnever gave it a fair shake.  Something like you propose just may help a\nfew more people along before giving up and using AGI or Lumen Micro (I'm\nthinking of the architectural lighting design community first and\nforemost, since that's the aspect I deal with).\n\n\n> The trouble with a general FAQ for Radiance is that there are too many\n> aspects to it, too many different types of users, and too many answers\n> that will only serve to confuse people if they haven't been properly\n> primed.  On the plus side, we have some amazing users who are good\n> writers and storytellers and are a generally helpful sort.  I'm sure if\n> we built it, they would come.\n\n\nRight on, brother, I'm in.  Somehow, some way, I'd like to contribute\nsomething.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000532.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 17, 2005 at 04:47PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000532"}
