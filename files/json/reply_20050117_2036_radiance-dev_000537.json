I'm smashed by the wave of energy and power to write \ntutorials, examples and doc.\n\n\nSo far I've quickly looked at \nhttp://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OtherWikis , and had a 15 minute \nbrowse thru http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/  \n<http://moin.sourceforge.net/>. I'm not so much fixed on Moin as it is \nthe north German equivalent to /G'day/ or /Whats'up/ , but I found that \nmy favorite no-nonsense mail agent Exim uses it for their site \nhttp://www.exim.org/eximwiki/ . And it's written in a reasonable \nlanguage (Python or PHP much preferred over Perl).\n\n\nI'm on a fairly tight schedule to get a project finished until end of \nJanuary. So, if you guys can hold on, chances are good that it works \nproductive on radiance-online in early Feb 2005. Backup etc. implemented \nas usual (thanks to Fraunhofer ISE IT dep). I know it's available as a \nDebian package, I know installing *looks* easy, but I'd better not open \nthis can until then.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000537.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "January 17, 2005 at 08:36PM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000506", "id": "radiance-dev_000537"}
