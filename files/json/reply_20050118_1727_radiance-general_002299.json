{"body": "Hi Kristopher,\n\n\nThe reason ordinary materials do not create virtual light sources the\nway mirror and the prism types do is because it would be too\nexpensive.  If you had two such surfaces facing each other with\na light source between them, they would potentially create an\ninfinite number of virtual light sources.  (This is why the -dr\noption is there, to prevent such a calamity when using facing\n\"mirror\" surfaces.)\n\n\nIf you want to have the material properties of plastic or metal,\nwith the virtual light sources of mirror, then use your plastic\nor metal as the alternate type in your mirror specification.\n\n\nWhat is the problem?  Is it simply not what you expected?\nDid you expect it to create an infinite set of virtual sources\nfor you?  Then you should also expect the simulation to \ntake forever.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nOn Tue, 18 Jan 2005 09:56:11 -0600, Baker, Kristopher <kbaker at syska.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002299.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 18, 2005 at 05:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002298", "id": "radiance-general_002299"}
