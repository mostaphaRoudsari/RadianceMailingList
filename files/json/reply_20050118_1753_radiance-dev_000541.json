{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nI missed out on the Telegraph Ave. Revolution.  When was that?\nGee, no one invites me to these things....\n\n\nI tend to agree that Wiki is probably not the best route to a new \ntextbook on Radiance.  I was thinking of something less formal,\nlike a front page created by the site administrator (you or me) to\npoint to a number of Wiki pages with user-provided links to PDF\npapers, tutorials, and other online material.  Just to give you a flavor,\nwe could create links for:\n\n\no  Daylighting Research Using Radiance\no  Validation Studies\no  Tutorials\no  User Experiences\no  FAQs\no  Mac Users\no  Linux Users\no  Windows Users\no  Links to Other Simulation Software\no  Other Radiance-related Websites\n\n\nEach of these front-page links would then jump to a Wiki page\nwhere visitors could add their own resources.  If after a time\nwe discovered that there were too many internet vandals\ngetting in and tagging our pages, we could disconnect\nWiki and make some or all of the pages into moderated ones,\nwith users having to submit ideas like they currently do.  The\nproblem with the current model of course is that it's slow to\nchange.  (In the case of radsite, glacial.)\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nOn Tue, 18 Jan 2005 10:42:57 +0100, Peter Apian-Bennewitz\n<apian at pab-opto.de> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000541.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 18, 2005 at 05:53PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000540", "id": "radiance-dev_000541"}
