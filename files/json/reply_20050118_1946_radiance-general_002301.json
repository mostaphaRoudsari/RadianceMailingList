{"body": "> Thanks for the flowers.\n\n\nYeah, sorry for the late flower delivery myself, but I've been busy\nreading your tutorial and following the many good links!  Good stuff,\nAxel.  Here, have a rose.\n\n\n> While I would like to keep the BASICs tutorial as it is (it's my teaching\n> notes, after all -- but please tell me if there are any mistakes), I would\n> be very happy to donate the ADVANCED one to whatever central docu\n> repository might come up\n> a) as they are, with additional contributions from you guys (I am happy to\n> maintain them), or\n> b) converted to HTML pages/Wiki/(Not DOC!!!)/whatever-but-open, gutted\n> out, broken apart, re-formatted etc. At the moment, they're in LyX/LaTeX\n> format.\n\n\nI think this is an excellent quality bit of material for the newly\nemerging document repository, wiki, FAQ, FAQwa, whatever it becomes. \nBroken apart, your advanced tutorial fills a bunch of the topics being\nbatted around by folks the last day or so (on the Dev list).\n\n\nThanks for sharing these, and for writing them in the first place!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002301.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 18, 2005 at 07:46PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002297", "id": "radiance-general_002301"}
