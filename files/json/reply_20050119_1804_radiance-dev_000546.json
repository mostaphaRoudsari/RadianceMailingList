{"body": "just an alternative approach:\nwhy do not use points instead?\n\n\nyou can generate x y z coordinates for a grid on the desk (done with excel)\nin the form \nx y z nx ny nz\n\n\nthen you use:\n\n\nrtrace -w- -h- -I+ option < grid | rcalc -e\n'$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)' > illuminance\n\n\nat the end you can use excel for the chart.\n\n\nOR\n\n\nif you wish to improve the process:\n\n\n-1-\nuse rcalc to generate the grid\nsomething like:\n\n\n#!/bin/csh -f\nset spacingx = 0.1\nset spacingy = 0.2\nset numberofpointsx = 9\nset numberofpointsy = 9\nset height = 0.9\n cnt $numberofpointsx $numberofpointsy | rcalc -e '$1=$1'\"*spacingx\"';\n$2=$2'\"*spacingx\"'; $3='\"$height;\"' $4 =0; $5=0; $6=1' > grid\n\n\nthen \n\n\nrtrace .... < grid | rcalc > illuminance\n\n\nyou should however improve it a little by using also rotation and\ntranslation of grid...\n(if you get in trouble just tell, I can provide further help)\n\n\n-2- \n\n\nat this point you can try opendx visualizer:\nit's a superb software from IBM, now free.\n\n\nrun very well under MacosX (it's supposed to be good on Linux and windows\ntoo).\n\n\nyou can import your data and visualize them being able to spin the dataset\nand apply different filters.\nadmesh is a must program to import 3d formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2-alternative\n\n\nuse VTK and mayaVI or Paraview to visualize data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhope it helps\ncheers,\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "January 19, 2005 at 06:04PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000545", "id": "radiance-dev_000546"}
