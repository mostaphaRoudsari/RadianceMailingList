What if it's an irregular polygon for instance?  Perhaps even a \nconcave polygon?  Then we need to perhaps generate points in the \nbounding box of the polygon and then test each ray to ensure that it \nactually does hit the polygon before computing its illuminance.\n\n\nSeems like it would be handy to have a way of getting what Radiance \nknows about the illumination of a specified polygon and outputting it \ndirectly?\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000547.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Kings-Lynne", "created_at": "January 19, 2005 at 06:33PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Kings-Lynne", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000545", "id": "radiance-dev_000547"}
