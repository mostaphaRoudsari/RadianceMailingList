Just make sure you still include the G3, since the Father of\nRadiance still runs Radiance on a G3 (when he's using his laptop)!  The\n10% boost on my G4 will be appreciated.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000554.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 19, 2005 at 09:15PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000553", "id": "radiance-dev_000554"}
