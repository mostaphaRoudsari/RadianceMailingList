{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThe idea with the first rtrace command is to render the polygon by \nitself.  You don't need a fore (or aft) clipping plane simply because \nthere is *nothing* else in the scene to render.  (You'll even get a \nwarning about no light sources unless you add a -w option to rtrace, \nwhich I forgot.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000560.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 20, 2005 at 03:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000552", "id": "radiance-dev_000560"}
