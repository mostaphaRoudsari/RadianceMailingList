{"body": "Just an FYI, I do use a G3 laptop as Rob points out.  However, I also \nown a dual G5 desktop, so I'm not completely behind the times (although \nit's only a dual 1.8 GHz, rather than the latest 2.5 model).\n\n\nLars, I'm glad you were able to find a combination of gcc options that \nactually improves rendering speed without causing the code to hang, \nwhich is the problem I ran into with the -fast option.  This option is \nsupposed to turn on all the local optimizations for the target \nprocessor, but it seems to be a bit buggy in the version of gcc \ninstalled on my machine, anyway (3.3 20030304, build 1671).  In \ngeneral, I've learned the hard way to distrust the gcc optimizer, so \nI'm still running with -O2 in my rmake script.\n\n\nIf anyone has trouble with odd results using the faster compile, I \nsuggest they first try recompiling before they tear their hair out \ntrying to find the bug.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000561.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 20, 2005 at 03:51PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000553", "id": "radiance-dev_000561"}
