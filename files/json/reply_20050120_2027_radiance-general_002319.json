{"body": "Jack,\n\n\nI usually break them up into 5-10 subimages, each one the entire \nwidth, but a fraction of the height. I typically have 2 to 10 \nmachines that I can render on (depending on whether work needs \nthe 8-proc Opteron cluster). I'll write the rpict commands by \nhand, and \"nohup ... -t 600 ... &\" each command. Keep in mind \nthat I don't use a global ambient cache. I do the \"-aa 0 -ab \n[low] -ad [low] -as 0\" trick to prevent the RAM requirements from \ngetting too high (and to avoid having to deal with NFS).\n\n\nThen I just use rsync/scp to put the completed portions on one \nmachine, and pfilt there. pfilt uses only a very little bit of \nmemory, but it can be slow on massive images, especially with -r \nand decent downsampling. Compared to the rendering, though, I'll \nsit around and wait for the pfilt.\n\n\nM\n\n\nOn Thu, 20 Jan 2005, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002319.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "January 20, 2005 at 08:27PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002311", "id": "radiance-general_002319"}
