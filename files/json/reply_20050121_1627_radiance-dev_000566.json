{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nYes, I think -oN returns the surface's unperturbed normal, which means \nwhatever direction it has in the actual geometry is the one you get.  \nIf you use the -on option instead, which takes longer and may involve \ntracing additional rays, you'll get the perturbed normal that includes \ntextures and any reorientation for the material type.  I think this \nwould fix your problem, and wouldn't cost much since there are no light \nsources  or shading going on in your single polygon scene, anyway.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000566.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 21, 2005 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000564", "id": "radiance-dev_000566"}
