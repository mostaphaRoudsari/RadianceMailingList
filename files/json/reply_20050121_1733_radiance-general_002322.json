{"body": "A while ago, I compared radiance with agi32 for a very simple room with a PAR lamp on the ceiling.  The results are at \n\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/comparison_Radiance_AGI32.pdf\nand\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/agi_rad.pdf\n\n\nThe errors for 1 and 2 ambient bounces, as shown in www.personal.psu.edu/mum13/agi_rad.pdf,  are somewhat significant and will be worse for complex environments. \n\n\nIt is best to do validations where the results are known a priori. Otherwise, you have too many voltage fluctuations, contractor changes and errors, reflectances are off, locations are off, material BRDFs are not known, etc. \n\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002322.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "January 21, 2005 at 05:33PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002307", "id": "radiance-general_002322"}
