One could add \nthe term 'abstraction'. I'm sure you've already thought about that, too. \nProbably there's not one evidence, but many, and each one depends on the \nsituation and the correct mixture of the above terms. (Isn't that concrete?)\n\n\nI could write more about those nice images, but this is not an artists \nforum...\n\n\nOne general interesting point about Radiance is that it is often applied \nin some sort of 'interface' position, means where science/technology \nmeets architecture, ecology, ergonomics, PR & marketing, design and all \nthe rest from every day life. And its important to be aware when a \nborder is crossed, and not to stretch concepts from one world too far \ninto the other. I can understand your concerns that this topic might \nget lost sometimes, on the consultants side as well as on the clients \nside. On may apply the well known cynical saying from politics: every \nclient gets the consultant he deserves..\n\n\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002324.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "January 22, 2005 at 03:29AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002307", "id": "radiance-general_002324"}
