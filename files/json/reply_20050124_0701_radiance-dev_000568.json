{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThe standard vertex epsilon in Radiance is set by the VERTEPS macro in \nsrc/common/face.c, and is 0.00001.  In other words, any vertex that \nexceeds this difference from the average computed plane of the polygon \nwill result in a \"non-planar polygon\" warning.  Since your export only \nsupports 4 decimal places, this will be triggered all the time.  The \nonly way to avoid this error is either to switch warnings off (as I \noften do with this problem), or change VERTEPS and recompile.  Or, you \ncan just ignore them.  Warnings are mostly there in Radiance to let you \nknow something is not quite right, so if you spot a problem later (like \ncracks along object edges in this case), you'll have some clue as to \nits origin.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000568.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 24, 2005 at 07:01AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000567", "id": "radiance-dev_000568"}
