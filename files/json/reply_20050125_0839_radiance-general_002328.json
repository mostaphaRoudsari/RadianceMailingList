{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nI was waiting for someone else to answer your query, but I guess it's  \nnot happening.\n\n\nThe best option is probably the new \"glaze\" script in Radiance 3.6, but  \nthere's no man page and you'll have to dig into the C-shell source a  \nbit to see how to specify your own material properties.\n\n\nThe next option is to do as you suggest and vary the specularity of a  \ntrans primitive.  The downside to this (other than figuring out what  \nthe heck to set the parameters to) is it won't account for variations  \nin reflectance with incident angle.  For this, you would have to use  \nthe glaze script if you have something other than a piece of clear or  \nabsorbing glass.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  If you are stuck with Desktop Radiance, you're out of luck with  \nregards to glaze.  But, you could use Francesco Anselmo's Cygwin  \nversion:\n\n\nhttp://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/cygwin/ \nradiance_cygwin_3R6P1.tar.gz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002328.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2005 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002327", "id": "radiance-general_002328"}
