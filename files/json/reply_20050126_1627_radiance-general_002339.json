{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nYou can get much closer to what you want if you simply add a 't' in \nyour rtrace's -o option, like so:\n\n\n% ximage someRendering.pic | rtrace -ab 5 -otodLpnsm -h -x 1 -i  \nsomeOct.oct > rays.txt\n\n\nThis is going to give you more rays than you can possibly want, so I'd \nalso set -ad 32 or so to reduce the number of interreflected rays \ngenerated.  Any other trimming, you'll have to do yourself.\n\n\nAlso, this will not show all the rays returning to the light sources, \nas this part of the calcuation never gets fully 'traced', the reason \nbeing that the direct calculation in Radiance attempts to minimize the \nactual number of rays followed to sources as an optimization.  If you \nwant to see the paths all the way back to the sources, you'll have to \nget into the rt/source.c file and start modifying the code directly.\n\n\nRegarding the -s option in xshowtrace, you can go in and change it \nyourself.  The sleep call is on line 260 in px/xshowtrace.c.  \nUnfortunately, sleep only takes integer arguments, but you can replace \nit with a call to nanosleep() on most systems.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002339.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 26, 2005 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002333", "id": "radiance-general_002339"}
