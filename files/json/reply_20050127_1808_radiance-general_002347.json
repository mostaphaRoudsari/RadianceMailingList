{"body": "There's something I'm not getting, here.  Why would you synthesize a \nlight probe?  The whole point is to use a captured environment, isn't \nit?  If you had a good synthetic environment, you would just render \nyour synthetic object(s) into it directly.  Or are you doing this as a \ntest?  I would be surprised if HDRShop paid attention to the Radiance \nview parameters in the .pic file, as it's not expecting to read a \nRadiance rendering as a light probe.\n\n\nBy the way, there are two types of spherical projections used in \nHDRShop -- an angular projection and a spherical projection.  They are \nsubtly different.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002347.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 27, 2005 at 06:08PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002343", "id": "radiance-general_002347"}
