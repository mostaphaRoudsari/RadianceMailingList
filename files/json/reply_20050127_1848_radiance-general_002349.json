{"body": "One of the first things to consider is your \"up\" vector.  Debevec uses \nY up in hs <angmap.cal>, Radiance defaults to Z up.  This is easily \nchanged in the Debevec <angmap.cal> file by simply replacing the \ncoordinate (x,y,z) references consistently in the angmap.cal file (see \nDebevec's comments in the <angmap.cal> file for an explanation of the \ndirection convention).\n\n\nIt sounds like you are trying to light the image with a light probe and \nalso include polygons in the scene that will appear as the synthetic \n\"room\" (floor, ceiling, and 4 walls [N, E, S, W]).  You may have better \nluck generating a \"cross\" format probe, then taking each of the six \ncross segments and individually mapping them to the walls of your room. \n  Then give each of the polygons the glow and let the HDR-images on each \nof the six \"room\" polygons illuminate your interior scene.\n\n\nDoes that make sense?  it may be easier to try by using one of \nDebevec's cross probes on his site and xforming it appropriately so \nthat the correct segment fills each of the six room polygons - once \nthis is done you can try illuminating your Rad. scene with it.\n\n\nFun!\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn Jan 27, 2005, at 11:18 AM, Tarik Rahman wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002349.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "January 27, 2005 at 06:48PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002343", "id": "radiance-general_002349"}
