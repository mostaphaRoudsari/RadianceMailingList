{"body": "A radiance value of 10^-7 is negligible.  However, even if your value \n_should_ be exactly zero, round-off error could bring it up to as high \nas 10^-15 or so, which would cause your if statement to return 1.  I'm \njust suggesting that you be careful when comparing floating point \nvalues.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002359.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 28, 2005 at 04:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002354", "id": "radiance-general_002359"}
