{"body": "Nick,\n\n\nIf you\u0092re looking at right to light issues, I\u0092d\nsuggest using a simpler program, such as Ecotect\n(www.squ1.com)  which calculates waldram diagrams for\nyou.  If memory serves, waldram diagrams come up in\nterms of view of sky / skylight availability, which\nare geometric issues, rather than ones of daylight.  \n\n\nThen you can just use Radiance in the regular way to\nwork out change in available daylight in a room.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nNick L\n\n\n>Hi Nick,\n>\n>Try writing a .cal file that deforms a regular grid\n>of rays into a \n>waldram grid.
