Getpagesize() was previously used only in common/malloc.c,\nand both files have been retired together.\n\n\nIn other words, you can just remove all instances of malloc.o and\ngetpagesize.o from your copy of makeall, and everythging should\nwork fine (*don't* remove bmalloc.o, though). I don't normally\ntouch the old build system, so I'll leave it to greg to update\nthe master copy.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000570.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 01, 2005 at 01:33PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000569", "id": "radiance-dev_000570"}
