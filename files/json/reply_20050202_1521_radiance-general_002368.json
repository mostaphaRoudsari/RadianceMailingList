{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nIf you turn off all stochastic processes in Radiance, you get the worst \nimaginable results.  I don't think there's any way to get repeatable \noutput from Radiance that isn't terrible.  To see what I'm talking \nabout, try compiling with the -DNORANDOM flag.  Even with this flag \nset, the results will be hypersensitive to small changes in \nillumination values, etc., as the decision on whether to trace \nparticular rays may be go above or below the threshold.  The only way \nto avoid this is to set -lw 0 and rely on the -lr parameter to end \nrecursion.\n\n\nThe ideal approach would be to use a pseudo-random number generator \nthat is repeatable.  In principle, Radiance does this, but due to \ndifferences between machines and implementations, in practice it does \nnot work out that way.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002368.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 02, 2005 at 03:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002366", "id": "radiance-general_002368"}
