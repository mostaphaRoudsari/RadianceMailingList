Memcached accelerates in-memory caching of data.\nRadiance needs to coordinate access to a file on disk, where\nperformance is important, but not as critical as resolving access\nconflicts.\n\n\nThe most straightforward solution to our problem would probably\nbe to use lock files, as Greg suggested in earlier discussions.\nUnfortunately nobody has found the time yet to actually implement\nthat. If anyone wants to volunteer, please move the discussion of\nyour proposal to the dev-list.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002377.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 03, 2005 at 02:34PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002369", "id": "radiance-general_002377"}
