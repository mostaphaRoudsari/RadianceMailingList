{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nNo, falsecolor doesn't offer such an option.  However, you can do it \nyourself with pcomb:\n\n\n\tpcomb -e 'incontr=eq(we*li(1),16.5,0.25)' \\\n\t\t-e 'ro=if(incontr,0,ri(1)' \\\n\t\t-e 'go=if(incontr,1,gi(1)' \\\n\t\t-e 'bo=if(incontr,0,bi(1)' \\\n\t\t-e 'and(a,b):if(a,b,a)' \\\n\t\t-e 'eq(a,b,eps):and(a-b+eps,b-a+eps)' \\\n\t\t-o input.pic > contoured.pic\n\n\nThis assumes you meant 16.5 lux or nits (depending on whether \n\"input.pic\" was rendered with the -i option or not).  If you meant 16.5 \nwatts/sr/m^2, then take out the \"we*\" in the first expression.  I also \nused an epsilon of 0.25 about 16.5, so anything between 16.25 and 16.75 \nwill be colored green.  If you want some other range, you can adjust \nthis.  If you want a perfectly sharp line, then you'll need to use the \nmore sophisticated pcomb script within falsecolor, which I won't \nreproduce here.  Other options, such as placing a contour over a \ntone-mapped (pcond output) image are easily accommodated by altering \nthe command above.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002378.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 03, 2005 at 03:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002376", "id": "radiance-general_002378"}
