I figured this was possible with pcomb, but not\nreally having any handle on the functional language I never knew how to go\nabout it.  I tried your tip here, putting the whole thing into a shell\nscript, but I get an error: \"we: undefined variable\".  Is there something\nwrong with my environment (aside from going into New York City on a\nperpetually late, crowded train every day, I mean)?\n\n\nP.S. There are closing parens missing from lines 2,3,and 4.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002383.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 03, 2005 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002376", "id": "radiance-general_002383"}
