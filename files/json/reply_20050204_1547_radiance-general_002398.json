So I will \nfind out if the fs provided by openmosix (mfs) has this feature, which \nwould make a set of mosix nodes a great radiance installation. I don't \nreally want to spend hours on a working nfs setup to share just ONE \nfile ;-) at least if it is not really necessary.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002398.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
