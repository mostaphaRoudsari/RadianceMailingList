Requiring third party software just to get\nreliable file sharing is clearly out of the question.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002399.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 04, 2005 at 03:59PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002369", "id": "radiance-general_002399"}
