{"body": "Perhaps.  If the pixel sampling rate were high enough (e.g. pfilt -x \n/10 -y /10), you might get some stability.  At that point, you \nshouldn't have to worry about the random number generator.  However, \nthe MC ray tracing literature is full of examples where even 200+ \nsamples/pixel is not enough to avoid large variance in some regions, \nand the same can be true for Radiance, especially with specular \nsamples.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002404.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 04, 2005 at 07:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002366", "id": "radiance-general_002404"}
