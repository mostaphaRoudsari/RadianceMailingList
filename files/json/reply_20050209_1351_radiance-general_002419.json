In any case, for the \ndirect sky\nfactor, whack up ad to whatever gives you a converged value - try a few\nin steps of two starting -ad 1024.  Turn interpolation off (-aa 0) and, \nof course,\nuse -ab 1.  If it's RTL, then a uniform sky is used rather than the CIE \novc and\nI seem to recall that the window is an aperture without any glazing.\n\n\nI really wouldn't bother with a source window for something like this.\n\n\nIf the grid was orthogonal, I'd be tempted to supply a grid of points to\nrtrace and process the results in my preferred crunching/display \nsoftware.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002419.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "February 09, 2005 at 01:51PM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002418", "id": "radiance-general_002419"}
