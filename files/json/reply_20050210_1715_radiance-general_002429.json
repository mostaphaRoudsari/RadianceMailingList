{"body": "I don't think repurposing PostgreSQL code is going to be useful in this \ncase.  We'll be comparing floating point values within some delta, \nprobably over large images, and the existing tools should be sufficient \nfor that (pcomb, etc.)  We just need to create a few dozen test scenes, \na Makefile for generating results, and a generic script for comparing \nthem against the official results for each regression.\n\n\nIt's probably a 2-4 weeks effort to do it right.  It's always a \nquestion of who has the time, I suppose.  We could make assignments, \neach volunteer testing out their favorite aspect of Radiance.  Anyone \nwant to step forward?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002429.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 10, 2005 at 05:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002366", "id": "radiance-general_002429"}
