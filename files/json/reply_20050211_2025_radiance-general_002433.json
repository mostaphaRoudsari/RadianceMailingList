{"body": "I think that this error is resulting from one of the functions in the \n.cal (angmap.cal?) . In this case acos() is probably being fed a value \noutside the bounds -1 to 1, acos() is defined to return an error outside \nthese bounds (man acos). An alternative is to use Acos() (see \nrayinit.cal), which I believe forces the boundary condition. It is \nlikely that the subsequent divide by zero error is related to the domain \nerror with acos(). Of course this is largely a guess based on the error \noutput you indicated. If we had the cal to lookout then this might \nprovide more information.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nKirk Thibault wrote:\n\n\n> Tarik\n>\n> One thing I noticed when I did that exercise is that Debevec's world \n> in <angmap.cal> is Y up and Radiance defaults to Z up.\n>\n> I have no idea if this is a problem from the standpoint of generating \n> the errors below, but it is something that I noticed.\n>\n> I have gotten multiple \"divide by zero\" messages from rpict when using \n> IBL as well.
