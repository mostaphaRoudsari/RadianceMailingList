{"body": "Hi list,\n\n\nfor all LINUX users out there that used to think gamma calibrating was for\nwimps, just because they couldt do it under X, I thought I send you this\nlink\nhttp://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/02/07/2244242&from=rss\nto an article titled\n\"Looking good: Monitor calibration under X\". There are tons of other\ninteresting links included in the article, all about colour calibration of\nmonitors and printers.\n\n\nSomewhere on the RADIANCE web site there is a test chart with some\ninstructions to go with it, but I doubt anybody has ever taken a look at\nthem.\n\n\nIf you have no idea what Gamma calibration means, then DO read the article\nand follow some links, no matter what system you use!\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002434.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 14, 2005 at 12:32PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002417", "id": "radiance-general_002434"}
