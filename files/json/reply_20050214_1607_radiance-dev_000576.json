{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nso after all I decided to use openmosix, start all processes on one \nmachine and not to care about network file systems, as these processes \nread their data from the local fs before migrating to other clusters. \nThis should work like using a SMP-machine.\n\n\nBut, to get it clear, I have to ask this once again (I read the chapter \nin RwR again): if I start processes on ONE machine (e.g. a SMP \nenvironment or an openmosix cluster) and all file access is on the \nlocal fs, will the sharing of ambient data work? The byte range locking \nwould have to be done over the local file system, right? Or should I \njust use the -N option of rad (or the -PP of rpict?)?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000576.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
