{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI believe that openmosix's omfs filesystems supports locking correctly \nacross the networked nodes (open and fcntl). Also you should determine \nif you need to have dfsa enabled on top of omfs. It might be worth \nchecking the documentation carefully. Also it looks like they are \nchanging to another filesystem mechanism based on openGFS, although it \nlooks like this is still in the works. However what does not work (or \ndid not as of a year or so ago) are named pipes. These are needed if you \nare going to run multiple processes on each node and require sharing of \nmemory (-PP). I think there are some tricks to work around this, but \nthese essentially require starting and locking jobs on specific nodes.\n\n\nYou might want to consider a question to the openmosix listserv \nregarding file locking and named pipes. On the other hand you may just \nneed to set up some tests and run the renderings to see what works and \nwhat does not.....\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nLars O.
