{"body": "Hi Terry,\n\n\nYes, we did start working to replace /usr/tmp with /tmp, but hadn't \ngotten around to all the scripts and things.  Thanks for the \nreminder...  All we've done so far is change the macro used by C \nprograms to point to /tmp rather than /usr/tmp.  I'll get to work on \ntrad and the C-Shell scripts tonight.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000582.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 06:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000581", "id": "radiance-dev_000582"}
