{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nThanks for that.  I'm just a little unsure about the orientation of \nthis \"aligned with x-y plane\" in the header .. is this absolute (ie. the \nproject x-y plane) or does it automatically align with the surface it is being \napplied to.  Sorry if this is a stupid question, it's just I have had trouble \nbefore simulating fritting with mixfunc and different surface orientations.\n\n\nCheer,\nRichard.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002440.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Clibborn", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 07:06AM", "created_by": "Richard_Clibborn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002438", "id": "radiance-general_002440"}
