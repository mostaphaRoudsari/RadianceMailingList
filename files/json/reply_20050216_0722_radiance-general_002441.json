{"body": "It means that the .cal file assumes the surface is aligned in the x-y \nplane.  Assuming you want a vertical grid and your z-axis is up, adding \nthe following transform to the string arguments would rotate the \nmaterial so that your surface was instead in the x-z plane:\n\n\n\t-rx -90\n\n\nSince we use a right-handed coordinate system in Radiance, and positive \nangles correspond to counter-clockwise rotations looking down the \nselected axis, this rotates the positive y direction in the original \norientation so it is now in the positive z direction.  Since this \nmaterial is symmetric front-to-back, it actually didn't matter in this \ncase which direction we rotated it.\n\n\nIf you want the surface in the y-z plane instead,  you would use:\n\n\n\t-ry -90\n\n\nThis rotates the positive x-axis into the positive z direction.  Just \nto be clear, your BRTDfunc would look like so:\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc grating\n12\n         0       0       0\n         spectrans spectrans spectrans\n         0       0       0\n         grating.cal -ry -90\n0\n13\n         rrefl grefl brefl\n         rtrns gtrns btrns\n         rrefl grefl brefl\n         A10 A11 A12 A13\n\n\nYou just add a couple of arguments to the string arg count, and tack \nthem on the end.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 07:22AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002438", "id": "radiance-general_002441"}
