On posix (unix) systems,\nthe current sequence is \"/var/tmp\", \"/usr/tmp\", \"/tmp\", \".\".\n\n\nBut I haven't had the time to adapt all the programs so they\nactually use this code. Consequently, some will find the\nalternatives if /usr/tmp is missing or write protected, but\nothers will still fail. If I remember correctly, then I\nchanged all the easy cases, where only a string needed to\nbe replaced. But Radiance does quite tricky things with temp\nfiles in a few places, which will involve more work to update.\n\n\nSo you may get lucky that whatever you need actually works,\nbut in the general case it's still recommended to have /usr/tmp\navailable and accessible.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000583.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 12:42PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000581", "id": "radiance-dev_000583"}
