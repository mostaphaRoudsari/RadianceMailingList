I had some concepts of \nrearranging in mind which would greatly reduce the number of \ninvasion/interface points for additional modules, functions, whatever, \nbut I had to put them aside as they would definitely mean quite a lot of \nwork.\nIt's the usual story, at some point one better contents oneself with \nthat what's already there.\nLet me quote Peters words (ripped from another discussion thread and put \ninto a new sentence :-):\n  \"and given today's abstraction level of the rendering core (or the \nabsence of it) \" -end of quotation- any additional stuff has to adapt \nitself a bit to this underlying structure.\n\n\nWhich of course doesn't mean that there aren't at least some ways to \nmodify the current pmap/Radiance connection in favour of your proposals.\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000584.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 04:59PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000580", "id": "radiance-dev_000584"}
