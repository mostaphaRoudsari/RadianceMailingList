{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no program that will do what you want directly, \nas it would be an easy thing to do.  The only way I could figure out to \ndo this without writing a very nasty pcomb script is a hack involving \nvwrays and glow sources in rpict.  For a 1024x768 image, it would go \nsomething like this:\n\n\n% echo void glow sglow 0 0 4 100 0 0 0 > sources.rad\n% vwrays -i orig.pic < image.pts | rcalc -o 'sglow source s${recno} 0 0 \n4 ${$4} ${$5} ${$6} 2' >> sources.rad\n% oconv sources.rad | rpict -vf orig.pic -w -x 1024 -y 768 \\\n\t| pcompos orig.pic 0 0 -t 1 - 0 0 > spotty.pic\n% rm sources.rad\n\n\nThe file \"orig.pic\" is your original rendering, and \"image.pts\" is a \nset of x and y picture coordinates (x left to right, y bottom to top) \ngiving positions in this image where you want to place red spots.  \n(Change the echo command if you want a different color.)  The vwrays \nthen generates rays to each point in the image, which get converted to \n2-degree distant sources by the rcalc command.  (Again, you may wish to \nalter this if 2 is too big or too small.)  Finally, we render these \nsources and superimpose them on the original picture using rpict and \npcompos (with a threshold), resulting in \"spotty.pic\".\n\n\nI haven't tried this, and I probably messed up some bit of it, but \nhopefully you'll be able to sort it out.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002444.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 06:05PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002443", "id": "radiance-general_002444"}
