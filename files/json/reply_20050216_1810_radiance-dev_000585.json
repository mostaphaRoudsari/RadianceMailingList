{"body": "Hi Terry,\n\n\nI just conferred with Schorsch, and I think we've eliminated use of the \n/usr/tmp directory in tomorrow's HEAD release.  In most cases, we \naren't searching for a temp directory, just using /tmp and hoping it's \nthere.  This is at least an improvement from assuming /usr/tmp is \navailable, but not as robust as the searching method Schorsch is \nworking on.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000585.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 06:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000581", "id": "radiance-dev_000585"}
