{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nThe reason for the mktemp() warning is that you can end up with a race \ncondition if you have multiple processes trying to create temporary \nfiles using the same template, which is probably something we don't \nparticularly need to worry about.  Unless you have a lot of processes \nrunning in parallel and creating temp files like mad, the chances of a \ncollision are extremely remote.  Altering the code to use mkstemp() in \nsome places is impossible, and in other places is just a lot of work.  \nIn 20 years of using the software, I haven't run across a problem \nrelated to temp file collisions, so I'm tempted to ignore it.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S. to Francisco -- I used a command very like this to identify files \nto change, and changed them.  Thanks.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000587.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 06:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000581", "id": "radiance-dev_000587"}
