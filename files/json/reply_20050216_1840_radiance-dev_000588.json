{"body": "A P.S. to my last message -- mktemp() uses the process ID as part of \nthe \"magic number\" used to name the temp file, making collisions among \ncompeting processes on the same machine impossible.  It's really only \nwhen a single process is multithreading that one needs to worry, and \nRadiance doesn't use threads.  Different machines with potentially \ncolliding process id's could be a problem, but again it is extremely \nunlikely, especially when the files are being created in the /tmp \ndirectory, which is usually local to each machine.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000588.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 06:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000581", "id": "radiance-dev_000588"}
