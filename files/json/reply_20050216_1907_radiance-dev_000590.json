If done right, then this makes it\npossible for a user process to write to files that would\nnormally only be writeable with root priviledges. Don't ask\nme for the exact method, I'd have to look that up too...\n\n\nFor software not running as root, this is mostly of academic\ninterest. The worst thing an \"attacker\" could do to you is\ncorrupt your temp files, thus invalidating your simulation.\nAnyone having enough access (a normal user account) on your\nsystem to try this will have many other ways to harm you\nwith a lot less effort.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000590.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 16, 2005 at 07:07PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000581", "id": "radiance-dev_000590"}
