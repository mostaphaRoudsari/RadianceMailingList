{"body": "Dear Lars O. Grobe:\n\n\nThanks very much for your reply. :-)\nI am just starting to use Radiance. I used the Desktop Radiance 2.0 bata to \ngenerate those rendering images, they are just for testing. I am not sure \nabout the values of aa, ar, ab, ad, (I think I was using the default setting \nin the Desktop Radiance.) but I got this kind of results randomly.\nSo I wonder if there are some guidelines which I can follow to get rid of \nthis problem, or is it just based on experance?\nBy the way, those 2 pictures looks different mainly because I changed the \nview type from Hemispherical to Perspective.\nBest wishes.\n\n\nHuang\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002446.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Huang Weixin", "created_at": "February 18, 2005 at 03:32AM", "created_by": "Huang_Weixin", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002437", "id": "radiance-general_002446"}
