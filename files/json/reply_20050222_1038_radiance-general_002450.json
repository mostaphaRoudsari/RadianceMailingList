{"body": "Hi Huang,\n\n\nI think what you observe is a problem of the indirect calculation. If I \nguess that the only light source in your room is the descended light, \nwhich may be defined by using a manufacturers ies (is this the case?), \nthan it is not that easy for the software to calculate the indirect \nillumination of the room correctly without finetuning a bit. First try \nto set a reasonable -ab value, maybe 2, depending on how many bounces \nyou need to come from a surface to the source (it is just a simple \nroom, so try 2 for the beginning). More important settings may be the \n-ad, -ar and -ad values, which define, generally speaking, the accuracy \nof the calculation of the indirect values (imagine a resolution used in \nthe step of the indirect calculation, which is not the same as the \nfinal image resolution but must be coarse enough to find all the \ndifferences in the indirect values over your surfaces). On the other \nhand, setting these values to too accurate numbers is dangerous and \nwill give terrible rendering times.\n\n\nJust take a look at this list's archives, also at the documentation \n(there should be a small text file in the software documentation just \nabout rpict settings), and, if possible, at the book Rendering with \nRadiance.\n\n\nAnd try to find out what values are actually used by Desktop Radiance \nand how to influence them. If you want to rely on the GUI and it's \ndefaults, this is the wrong list here, you need to know what's \nhappening.\n\n\nGood luck ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002450.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
