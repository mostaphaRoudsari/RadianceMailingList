{"body": "1. Christopher, the theoretical factor between radiance and irradiance at a\npoint in that case is pi, you only have to integrate a uniform radiance over\na hemisphere to obtain it. Radiance can give some lite error due to the\nrandomless of indirect calculation.\n\n\n2. yes,  the simulation is over hemisphere or you can determine the source\nangle you want.ie\n\n\nvoid glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 angle\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002458.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Mun\u00e1rriz", "created_at": "February 25, 2005 at 11:33AM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Mun\u00e1rriz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002456", "id": "radiance-general_002458"}
