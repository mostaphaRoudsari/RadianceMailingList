For this to work, you need\nPython (www.python.org) and SCons (www.scons.org) installed on\nyour system. SCons will use the borland compiler, unless it finds\nanother one installed on the system first (ie. if you also have\nVC installed, then that one will be used).\n\n\nIf all the tools are present, you should be able to build most of\nRadiance that way on Windows. Open a console window (\"DOS box\")\nand change to the \"ray\" directory. Then type \"scons .\", (or just\n\"scons bin/rtrace.exe\") and the system should do the rest\nautomatically (depending on your installation, you may need to\nspecify a full path for SCons).\n\n\nI assume that the borland compiler accepts different command line\narguments than VC though, so you will most likely have to do some\nmore editing. Copy the file \"ray\\platform\\win32.cfg\" to\n\"ray\\platform\\win32_custom.cfg\" (the \"*_custom.cfg\" will be used\nif present). Open the new file in a text editor, and modify the\nCCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS variables in the [build] and [debug]\nsections as needed. If you find a combination that works, please\nsend me the resulting file, and I'll see if I can integrate it in\na way that it gets selected automatically when borland tools are\nused.\n\n\nI haven't tried to build Radiance on Windows for a while, so you\nmight run into some problems. If you manage to identify the\ncauses of any stumbling blocks, or even better if you can whip\nup some fixes, please send them to me, and I'll try to update the\nCVS version accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000597.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "February 25, 2005 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000596", "id": "radiance-dev_000597"}
