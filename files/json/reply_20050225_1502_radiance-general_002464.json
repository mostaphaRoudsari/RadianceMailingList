{"body": "Hi Rapha\u00ebl,\n\n\nYour tutorial looks very useful. I am giving an introductory course on\nbuilding simulation this winter term at McGill and I am struggling to find\ngood tutorials for beginners. Maybe we should set up a central place, e.g.\non the Radiance online web site, which points to the various\nRadiance/daylight simulation documents that are out there? \n\n\nFor those interested, our tutorial on the use of Radiance/Daysim Simulations\nfor Sustainable Design is located under\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/daysim/DaysimTutorial.pdf.\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "February 25, 2005 at 03:02PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002456", "id": "radiance-general_002464"}
