{"body": "On a separate but related note, is there some flag when using obj2rad  \nor similar transformation which will instruct the renderer to smooth  \nthe face normals for converted mesh objects?\n\n\nI recall seeing a \"-s\" option somewhere.  The basic idea is, I have  \nthis externally modeled object, i convert it to obj, bring it into  \nRADIANCE using obj2rad and then xform it into place.  During the  \nconversion, the object is made into a mesh and I would like the mesh to  \nrender smooth.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nkirk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002481.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "March 02, 2005 at 03:12PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002478", "id": "radiance-general_002481"}
