{"body": "Giulio is correct.  IBL creates glow sources rather than lights, so  \nmaterials with primarily diffuse components rely on the ambient  \ncalculation to pick up any illumination at all, and the parameters must  \nbe set such that Radiance can find the bright areas in the light probe.  \n  Something like -ab 1 -ad 1024 -as 512 at least, and sometimes even  \nthat is not enough.  There are tools for locating and replacing bright  \nareas in the light probe with equivalent sources.  I think HDRshop has  \nsuch a tool, and others have worked on similar tools.  There are even a  \nnumber of papers on it -- I know Alex Keller wrote one, and Bernhard  \nSpanglang worked on this as part of his thesis, and you can check out  \nhis talk from the first Radiance workshop online:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Spanlang/ \nindex.html\n\n\nSee also Santiago Torres' presentation from the second workshop:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop2/cd/Torres/ \nabstract.html\n\n\nThis topic is also well-covered in the notes Paul Debevec has online at  \nhis website from the various Siggraph tutorials he's given.  See for  \nexample page 8 from \"Paul Debevec's main slides on HDRI and Image-Based  \nLighting (6.7MB pdf)\" in the notes of the Siggraph 2003 course on IBL:\n\n\n\thttp://www.debevec.org/IBL2003/\n\n\nThere are resources out there.  It's a matter of finding them, as  \nalways...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002485.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 02, 2005 at 04:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002477", "id": "radiance-general_002485"}
