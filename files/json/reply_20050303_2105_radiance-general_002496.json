{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> The mixpict primitive uses the indicated function of the red, green and\n> blue channels of an image to determine how much of one material to use\n> versus another.

It looks better in my scene with a glow\nof 2 2 2 0 or 3 3 3 0.\n\n\n> void mixpict mp\n> 7 fc_glow void nonzero sp.pic fc.cal fc_u fc_v\n> 0\n> 0\n> --------\n> The file \"fc.cal\" looks like so:\n>\n> { Use false color contour image as selector }\n> nonzero(r,g,b) = if(max(r,max(g,b))-FTINY, 1, 0);\n> fc_u = Px;\n> fc_v = Py;\n> ------\n\n\nExactly what I was missing. The FTINY thing is in case the black isn't\nreally black, isn't it? Or is it for internal rounding errors etc. With my\nperfectly back background (you wished you had this in a lighting lab...),\nI could drop this. Well, I did remove it and it still works, anyhow.\n\n\nYou've been a great help\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002496.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 03, 2005 at 09:05PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002491", "id": "radiance-general_002496"}
