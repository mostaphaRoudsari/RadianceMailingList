{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI have create a couple of HDR probes lately and I can tell you what settings \nI have used.\n\n\nFirst of all, the sequence of photos that you have to take must be perfectly \nalighned.\nThe only way that works for me to do that, is to place the camera on a \ntripod and take photos remotely (that is connect the camera with a computer \nand use remotly capturing pressing a key on the keyboard - camera's software \nshould have the appropriate software for that - but good cameras usually do \nhave)\n\n\nI don't think so, auto bracketing is a good idea. Most cameras can take \nabout 3 (or 5) photos with Auto Bracketing but you need more in order to \ncreate an HDR Probe (about10-15 photos)\n\n\nIn order to take the photos set aperture at a fix value and change only \nexposure time in order to change the overall exposure.\nYou also have to set your camera at no flash.\n\n\nYou should  take a sequence of photos (about 10-15) with different exposure \ntimes, changing 1 f-stop each time, starting with bigger exposure.\nBefore begin to take your photos, take one photo using auto-focus in order \ncamera focus on the mirrored ball. Then set manual-focus and don't change \nfocusing (that is in order to have all photos with same \"focus value\")\n\n\nIf you planning ton use hdrgen for generating HDR probe, I recommned you to \ndisable alignment algorithm. At least in my case, when alignment was enable \nhdrgen gave worst results.\n\n\nI hope it helps,\nRegards,\nDespina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002505.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Despina Michael", "created_at": "March 09, 2005 at 03:23PM", "created_by": "Despina_Michael", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002503", "id": "radiance-general_002505"}
