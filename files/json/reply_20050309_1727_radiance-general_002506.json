{"body": "Hi Randhir,\n\n\nYou should read the 1995 SIGGRAPH paper by Craig Kolb, Don Mitchell and \nPat Hanrahan, \"A Realistic Camera Model for Computer Graphics,\" which \nyou may find at the following URL:\n\n\n\thttp://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/camera/gamma-corrected/\n\n\nRadiance's inherent camera model is indeed a pinhole, though there are \nmethods available for simulating depth-of-field using a synthetic \naperture.  Vignetting, coating effects, etc. are all beyond what \nRadiance was designed to simulate in it's camera model.  You could \nmodel the lens system and camera geometry in Radiance directly, I \nsuppose, but it would be a lot of work.  Calculating an image this way \nwould be quite expensive, but I think it's possible.\n\n\nHave you considered using a more general optics simulation package, \nsuch as TracePro?\n\n\n\thttp://www.lambdares.com/products/tracepro/\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002506.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 09, 2005 at 05:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002504", "id": "radiance-general_002506"}
