{"body": "Thanks, Paul, for that wealth of information.\n\n\nI just wanted to add a note on the RAW image files -- most of the time, \nthe native converters lose the exposure information on their way to an \n(uncorrected) JPEG or TIFF image for Photosphere, so I don't recommend \nRAW unless you know your camera is screwing with your JPEG's.  \nPhotoshop CS actually does a decent job converting RAW files, saving \nthe exposure info in the Exif header, and it handles most varieties of \nRAW.  Each RAW format is maker- and model-specific, which causes real \nproblems for long-term support and archiving -- another reason to avoid \nthis format.  RAW files also tend to be large, and their advantages for \nreduced noise and exposure latitude are widely exaggerated.  Since \nmultiple images are averaged together to make an HDR, noise tends to \nget smoothed out, anyway, and JPEG artifacts disappear as well.\n\n\nThat said, I encourage you to do your own experiments, but weigh the \ncost in your time using RAW against the actual benefit you get from \nthem.  I've done my own, and I've found the benefit to be negligible \nnext to the effort required.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I should have included the Nikon 900 series in my list of \nrecommended cameras -- most people who have used them for HDR capture \nhave had good experiences from all I've heard.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002513.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 09, 2005 at 08:23PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002503", "id": "radiance-general_002513"}
