{"body": "Wow, that's a great diagram, Schorsch.  I think I understand the \n\"trans\" type for the first time, myself!\n\n\nBe sure also to refer to section 5.2.6 (pp. 325-6) in \"Rendering with \nRadiance,\" which translates between more sensible physical quanitites \nand the parameters of the \"trans\" type.  I believe Rob G. has an Excel \nspreadsheet that implements these formulas nicely, if you'd like to \nrequest a copy.\n\n\nBy way of excuse, the reason the trans type is so baffling is my \nstubborn adherence to the principle that Radiance primitives have \nwell-defined legal ranges.  All the material parameters (except \nroughness) have legal physical ranges of [0,1).  Since Radiance does \nnot enforce these limits, you can specify values outside this range, \nbut you should know that you are on shakey ground at that point.\n\n\nThat said, I freely admit that the obtuse derivation of the trans \nparameters in particular has caused a good deal more consternation than \nif I had used more usual values of Rd, Td, Rs, and Ts and simply noted \nthat these coefficients must sum up to something less than 1.  Oh, \nwell.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002518.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2005 at 06:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002516", "id": "radiance-general_002518"}
