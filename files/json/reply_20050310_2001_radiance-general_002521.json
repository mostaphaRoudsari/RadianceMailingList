{"body": "Sorry, Axel -- I should have read through your original posting more \ncarefully.  I missed your questions and references at the end:\n\n\n> Some Qs:\n> --------\n> The specular components (both diff and spec) are hard to measure.\n> However, this is what the calculation in the radbook is based on.\n> How would one make estimations?\n\n\nI don't know of any *good* ways to measure these without some kind of \nphotometer.  A crude way to measure total transmittance would be to \nmeasure illuminance near a large white card, then again, covering the \nilluminance probe completely with your material.  The same trick will \nwork with a camera and Photosphere or hdrgen if you don't own a lux \nmeter.  Use your camera in the same way as the probe.  Divide the \naverage of the second image by the first using Photosphere (or hdrgen) \nand running \"pvalue -h -H -d -b -o capture.hdr | total -m\" (or \"Edit -> \nSelect All\" in the image viewer of Photosphere).\n\n\nFor reflectance, you can try a similar trick if you know the \nreflectance of your white card, and this is described in RwR, I think.\n\n\nSpecular is more difficult to measure, but you can usually guess with \nreasonable accuracy.  If a surface is a single dielectric interface \n(plastic or glass), it's specular reflectance will be around 4%.  If it \nis a double interface, as in a pane of glass, it will be about twice \nthat, unless the glass is very dark, where it will be somewhere between \n4% and 8% depending on the amount of absorption.\n\n\nAs for roughness, I have a nice little device with LEDs and a viewport \nthat allow me to estimate this value, but I don't know how to offer it \nto anyone as it's a piece of hardware, and requires a lot of experience \nto use effectively.\n\n\n> Is this only possible through visual comparision?\n> What are the steps to A1..A7 if given:\n> - reflectance (luxmeter + luminance meter)\n> - transmittance (2x luxmeter)\n> (practical scenario, assuming grey colour)\n> if\n> - Lambertion properties or\n> - clearly see-through\n> What is the plastic equivalent to a trans without transmittance?\n\n\nI'm not sure I understand the question.  If you set A6 to 0, trans is \nthe same as plastic.\n\n\n> Would that be _wrong_ or just _stupid_ to use?\n\n\nIf you mean substituting trans for plastic to be general, there's no \nharm.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002521.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2005 at 08:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002516", "id": "radiance-general_002521"}
