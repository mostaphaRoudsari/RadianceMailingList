You could try putting a \ntube on your lux meter (or using a luminance probe) and couple with a \ncollimated source (a good quality flashlight will do in a pinch) and \nback the source and probe away from the material.  Subtracting the \nmeasured specular (direct) transmittance from the previous integrated \nmeasurement will give you the approximate diffuse value.\n\n\nThis is all very, very rough.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002525.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 11, 2005 at 04:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002516", "id": "radiance-general_002525"}
