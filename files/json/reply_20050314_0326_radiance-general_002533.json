{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nIn brief, I think that 40% reflectance for a wood floor is too high.   \nAn off-white wall might have a 40% reflectance, but most wood floors  \nwould be closer to 20%.  If you use macbethcal for your floor capture,  \nthen it gives you back true reflectance values.  In such cases, I would  \nnot pass the pattern trhough normpat.\n\n\nFurther comments below:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002533.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 14, 2005 at 03:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002530", "id": "radiance-general_002533"}
