The 'make' program and a C-Compiler needs to be present, \nbut this is usually the case on any UNIX-like system. If you don't have \naccess to some of the usual places for executables (/usr/local/bin, \n/usr/bin, etc ) you can store your Radiance programs in your home \ndirectory and call them with the path.\n\n\nConcerning your error message.\noconv: fatal - (thermos6.rad): undefined modifier \"mesh01\"\n\n\nthis looks like a missing material definition, you might write a file\nwith some Radiance material definitons yourself and name them appropriately.\nthen you can oconv the material file together with the geometry file\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002537.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "March 15, 2005 at 02:27AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002532", "id": "radiance-general_002537"}
