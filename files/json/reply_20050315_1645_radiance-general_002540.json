{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nI couldn't really follow your question:\n\n\n> I'm wondering why when I view a .pic image I've created in HDRShop, \n> the pixel\n> values aren't the same as when I generate a text file of their colours \n> using\n> vwrays.\n\n\nI first read this as if you had created the .pic in HDRShop, which \ndidn't make sense.  I assume now you are only viewing it with HDRShop.  \nWhat do you mean that the pixel values aren't the same?  The same as \nwhat?  The same as eachother?  You are expecting them all to be the \nsame?  ??\n\n\n> I wnat a green box's surface reflectances in the pic file so I do\n>\n> ./vwrays.exe -fd greenbox.pic | rtrace -fda `vwrays -d greenbox.pic`\n> -ovm `if(s='green_plastic')` testroom.oct  | grep \"green_plastic\" > \n> rays.txt\n\n\nIgnoring the `if(s='green_plastic')` nonsense, which I'm hoping doesn't \ndo anything, this command might give you the luminance at each visible \npoint on the green surface, but not its reflectance.  If you want the \nreflectance, just look at the Radiance scene file.  It's right there in \nthe definition of \"green_plastic\".\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002540.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 15, 2005 at 04:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002538", "id": "radiance-general_002540"}
