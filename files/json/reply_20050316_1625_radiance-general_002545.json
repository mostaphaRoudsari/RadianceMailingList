{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nThe difference could be due to the change in pixel center between \nvwrays and rpict.  Rpict normally \"jitters\" pixel centers as an \nanti-aliasing measure.  If you rerender your image, turning jitterinig \noff with -pj 0, you will get the exact pixel centers produced by \nvwrays.  Being off by even a fraction of a pixel can make a difference \nin the result, especially near the object's visible boundaries.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002545.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 16, 2005 at 04:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002538", "id": "radiance-general_002545"}
