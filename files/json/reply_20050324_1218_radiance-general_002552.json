{"body": "Hi,\nthank you for your answers.\n\n\nthe model is .obj file and I used obj2rad to convert it in .rad file. Then I\nadded in .rad material and lighting info and use rpict to illuminate the\nobject.\n\n\nIt's not a \"perfect cylinder\" and this is the reason I don't use radiace\nprimitive cylinder (it just looks like a cylinder)\n\n\nCan you tell me please how I use obj2mesh command?\n\n\nI tried this\nobj2mesh model.obj > out1.rtm\nbut it does not seem to work. There is an error: obj2mesh: fatal -\nunreferenced uv coordinates\n\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002552.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Despina Michael", "created_at": "March 24, 2005 at 12:18PM", "created_by": "Despina_Michael", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002549", "id": "radiance-general_002552"}
