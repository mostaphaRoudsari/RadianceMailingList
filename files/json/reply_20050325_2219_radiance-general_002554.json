{"body": "Hi Despina,\n\n\nIf your geometry actually contains these creases, which it does, how \ncan you expect Radiance NOT to render them?  The .OBJ file you sent me \nhas numerous problems.  The creases are caused by incorrect surface \nnormals at the patch boundaries.  If you take these out by running \nobj2rad -f, then you see the polygonal faces and get a lot of warnings \nabout non-planar polygons.  I didn't check to determine if your \npolygons really are non-planar or if it's simply an issue with too few \nsignificant digits in your vertex coordinates.\n\n\nI would recommend a different modeling system.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002554.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 25, 2005 at 10:19PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002553", "id": "radiance-general_002554"}
