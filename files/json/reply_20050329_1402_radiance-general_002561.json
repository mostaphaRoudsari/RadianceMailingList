{"body": "Hi Carsten,\n\n\nyes, I guess that is the most promising way to go. I hesitated because the\nfact that the name of the modifier can appear in different contexts (not\nonly to modify geometry, but also e.g. to modify a material type etc) made\nme prefer some tool built on top of a real radiance scene parser. However,\nit should be possible to achieve that with sed, too (maybe even grep can do\nit).\n\n\nI was always afraid of sed so far, so it's time to start that now ;-)\n\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002561.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
