{"body": "Thanks Axel,\nyour ansewer was very explanotory and the webHDR webpage as well.\n\n\nI have another question on this - how we compute Dynamic Range?\nIf for example: the brightest pixel has luminance 50 000 cd/m^2 and the \ndarkest one 5 cd/m^2\nis dynamic range 50 000/5 = 10 000:1? is that correct?\n(i.e. 4 OoM)\n\n\nAnd something more... is there any standard threshold, that \"seperates\" \ndynamic range to High and Low?\n\n\nThanks again,\nDespina\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Despina Michael", "created_at": "March 29, 2005 at 06:54PM", "created_by": "Despina_Michael", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002562", "id": "radiance-general_002565"}
