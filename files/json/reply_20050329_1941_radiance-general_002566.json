It's easier in exponential notation -- the division\nbecomes a subtraction then: 5*10^5 / 5*10^1 = (5/5) * 10^(5-1) = 10 000\n\n\n> And something more... is there any standard threshold, that \"seperates\"\n> dynamic range to High and Low?\n\n\nNot to my knowledge. However, it's save to assume that all images are low\nDR, except for the ones that explicitly say that they are high. They must\nthen be stored in a file format that supports HDR, _and_ be created\nsuitably. It is possible to have a LDR image stored in a HDR file (e.g.\nfalsecolor RADIANCE images).\n\n\nThe difference between the dynamic range of LDR and HDR images is several\norders of magnitude ;-) (Just winding you up...)\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002566.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 29, 2005 at 07:41PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002562", "id": "radiance-general_002566"}
