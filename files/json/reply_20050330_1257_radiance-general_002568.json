{"body": "Hi again,\n\n\nso there is a real problem now... I had forgotten that there are not only\n4liners as objects in radiance. So e.g. a polygon may be described on 5 or\nmore lines, depending on the number of points, and that's where I have to\nwrite some kind of a parser to filter the complete objects :-( At least I\nwill have to get the first integer in a line, read n1 objects, than the\nfirst  integer on the line following the last objects, again read n2\nobjects, and so on... a pretty difficult task for someone new to sed and\nawk... Will have a look at O'Reilly's \"Awk and Sed\" book now.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002568.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
