{"body": "It seems to work only in the Classic version of PShop.  I tried to \ndesignate the plug-in for PShop CS and drop the .lib file into the \nSystem folder.  No luck in OSX 10.3.X.  I will try the Gimp and see how \nthat PANS out (ha ha ha!)\n\n\nNice render!  Yeah I noticed the \"real\" sphere had none of the \nreflections of the others in it - looks very convincing nonetheless.  I \nhave used HDRShop to remove the tripod/camera from 2 images taken at 90 \ndegrees.  I run it on a Mac with Virtual PC with no problems other than \nit is slow.  I use HDRShop v.1 (the free, or formerly free version).\n\n\nRock on.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn Mar 30, 2005, at 3:21 PM, Fitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002571.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "March 30, 2005 at 11:13PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002570", "id": "radiance-general_002571"}
