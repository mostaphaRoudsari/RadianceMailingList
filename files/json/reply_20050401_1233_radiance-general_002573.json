{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nI have written a little bash script that will filter radiance scene \nfiles by modifier. It has two modes, -i and -e (similar to rpict). -i \n<modifier> will write ONLY geometry modified by <modifier> to STDOUT, \n-e <modifier> will output everything but geometry modified by \n<modifier>. This is a rather simple script, using sed and awk, and as I \nam not very good in using the text utilities, there is certainly a lot \nof overhead. However, it is useable, and can be found here:\n\n\nhttp://130.83.168.34/lars/rad/rad_filter.sh.gz\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002573.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
