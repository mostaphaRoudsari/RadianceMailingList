{"body": "After a problem report from Lars, here's an updated version of the filter \nscript. It wasn't handling the rare alias declaration. I've tested it \nagainst a few scene files in the standard distribution, both \nvirtual/illumoff.rad and cabin/lvfurn.rad. The second one put a spanner in \nthe works because it contained this:\n\n\nalberta_image alias alberta_photo\n         photo_paper\n\n\nSo there's extra logic to handle having the reference on the following \nline. How lenient is the Radiance parser with respect to newlines? Can \nregular primitives also contain newlines in odd places, or is it just with \naliases?\n\n\ne.g\nwhite sphere\n\tball\t<== is this accepted as well??\n0\n0\n4\t0\t0\t0\n\t1\n\n\nI really hope that isn't allowed. Otherwise my perl code will become really \nugly... :(\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002575.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "April 02, 2005 at 08:17AM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002557", "id": "radiance-general_002575"}
