{"body": "Hi Ian,\n\n\nUnfortunately, Radiance input files are designed to be read with \nscanf(), which doesn't differentiate between spaces, tabs, and \nnewlines.  That means that the formatting of primitives in Radiance is \nalmost entirely by convention.  The only exceptions to this are for \ninline commands and comments, which must appear on a single line.  (In \nthe case of inline commands, the newline may be escaped with '\\'.)\n\n\nThis is all spelled out pretty clearly in the basic reference manual:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html\n\n\nYou should probably consult it.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-April/000610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 02, 2005 at 03:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000606", "id": "radiance-dev_000610"}
