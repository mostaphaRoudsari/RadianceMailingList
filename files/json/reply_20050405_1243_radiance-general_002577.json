{"body": "Hi Tarik,\n\n\nThis is an answer to your post about angmap.cal posted some weeks ago.\n\n\nI am not absolutely sure but I guess 0.159154943 is just to map acos(Dz)/d to values between -0.5 and 0.5.\nIf you multiply 0.159154943 *PI= 0.5\nPI is the greater value that acos(Dz)/d may be.\n\n\nIt does this in order to values of u and v range between 0 and 1.\n\n\nDespina\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi\nCan anyone explain this statement in the angmap.cal file.\nr = if(d,0.159154943*Acos(DDz)/d, 0);\n\n\nIs the 0.159154943 value related to the focal length and field of view\nparameters for Paul Debevec's light map .hdrs, so that if I want to map my own\nlight maps I must calculate the value of r using my camera parameters (well\nsimulated in Radiance vv and vh angles) ?\n\n\nThanks for any help\n\n\nTarik\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002577.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Despina Michael", "created_at": "April 05, 2005 at 12:43PM", "created_by": "Despina_Michael", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002445", "id": "radiance-general_002577"}
