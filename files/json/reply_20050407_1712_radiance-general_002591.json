{"body": "Usually, there are three reasons that the oconv process can blow up like \nthis:\n\n\n   1. duplicate geometry - do you have overlapping geometry for the\n      blinds (eg polygons on top of each other)\n   2. scaling - some piece of geometry that is being built seperately\n      and then xformed into the scene at the wrong scale\n   3. density - lots of small geometry clustered tightly together in a\n      large scene\n\n\nIn some of these cases you can work around the problem by increasing the \noctree resolution (-r), you can take a look at the man page for further \ninformation on this.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002591.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 07, 2005 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002589", "id": "radiance-general_002591"}
