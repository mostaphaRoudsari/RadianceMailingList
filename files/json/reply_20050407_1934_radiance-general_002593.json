Is this the way\n> clipping planes operate?\n\n\nClipping planes do not introduce extra light where it should not be.\n\n\nAssuming the model is air tight (which is not always the case for imported\nCAD geometry), the inside of the wall the ceiling is visible due to the\nambient light. Setting -av to 0 0 0 should remedy this.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002593.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "April 07, 2005 at 07:34PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002592", "id": "radiance-general_002593"}
