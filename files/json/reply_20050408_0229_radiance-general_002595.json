Radiance does some\ninterpolation between ambient samples. A new indirect sample is only\ntriggered if the new point is outside of the sphere of influence of all\npreviously computed ones. This is controlled by the -a* options. The\nradius of those spheres is\n\n\nr_min = max_scene_dimension * aa / ar\n\n\nThe light from the ambient sampling can spill over into areas that would\nnormally not receive indirect light. Could you post a blow-up image of the\nbottom part of the left-hand wall? And see what fiddling with the -aa and\n-ar options results in.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002595.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "April 08, 2005 at 02:29AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002592", "id": "radiance-general_002595"}
