{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nIn fact, it doesn't matter for the ambient calculation if polygons \noverlap or cut into each other, making the edge between them 'airtight'.\nWhen reusing ambient values from the cache no 'quasi shadow testing' is \ndone to ensure that nothing lies inbetween for the 'allowed' radius of \nthis ambient value. Theoretically, this perhaps might be possible, but \ncertainly at a very high computational cost.\n\n\nSo the solution is to set the ambient resolution -ar sufficiently high \n(and/or) -aa low. The size of the scene cube also plays a role as can be \nseen in the expression for rmin in Axels answer, so a big outside (e.g \nlarge ground polygon) increases the problem. (In the RwR book there is a \nsection on this, and the use of a 'ground glow' is recommended to \ncircumvent this problem.\n\n\nIf you want to model a huge outdoor part, it is better to use separate \nambient caches for the 'outside' and the 'inside' part of your scene.\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002596.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "April 08, 2005 at 11:29AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002592", "id": "radiance-general_002596"}
