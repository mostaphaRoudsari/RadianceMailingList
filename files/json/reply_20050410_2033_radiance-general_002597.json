{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nWe completed a second rendering with the settings below. It, as the \nother rendering, includes a ground polygon and ground glow. Prior to \nrunning the second interior rendering we did a quick outside view \nrendering to create an ambient cache. The difference we see between \nthis and the first rendering is that the sky is blue.\n\n\nCarsten; is this how you meant to \u201cuse separate ambient caches for the \n\u2018outside\u2019 and the \u2018inside\u2019 part of the scene\u201d?\n\n\n-ab  2\n-av  0.37 0.37 0.37\n-ad  5000\n-as  500\n-ar  500\n-aa  0.15\n-dj  0.03\n\n\nAxel; details of the left side are posted.\n\n\nhttp://www.labergedaylight.com/pages/temp.html\n\n\nThank you for your time. We are going to continue working on this \nrendering with your suggestions.\n\n\nPaul\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002597.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul LaBerge", "created_at": "April 10, 2005 at 08:33PM", "created_by": "Paul_LaBerge", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002592", "id": "radiance-general_002597"}
