{"body": "Hi Giulio,\n\n\nThanks for your quick reply. I will give Bodypaint a try, but I doubt if \nit does generate surface normals from a file that doesn't have them.\nAnyways, I wonder if the perforate.cal could be changed to work at once \non surfaces without UV coordinates.\nWhen mapping pictures it goed well, since I (not really me:) changed a \nfew lines in picture.cal :\n\n\npic_u = U;  //was: pic_u = Px;\npic_v = V;   //was: pic_v = Py;\n\n\nI don't know why this works, but it does....\nIf something like this could be done in the perforate.cal file, that \nwould be nice,\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\nGiulio Antonutto wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "April 13, 2005 at 04:56PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002608", "id": "radiance-general_002610"}
