{"body": "The U and V values defined in rayinit.cal will work for planar surfaces \nof any orientation, but will not work for curved surfaces or meshes.  \nFor these, you need to define a local (u,v) mapping and apply Lu and Lv \non a mesh surface as Guilio suggests, or else come up with an \napproximation plane that will work and use that by rotating your \nfunction.  You can always rotate any .cal function to another \norientation by adding transform arguments (-rx, -ry, -rz) to the \nmixfunc primitive that references it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002613.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 13, 2005 at 07:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002608", "id": "radiance-general_002613"}
