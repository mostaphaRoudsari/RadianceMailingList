{"body": "> Can you offer us a clue as to what this image is _supposed_ to look \n> like, or what version of Radiance you are using?\n\n\nHi Greg!\n\n\nThere is an image mapped onto the region over the arcs. I attach an \nolder image where I had less geometry in the scene. Here the black \nregion does not appear.\n\n\nI am using radiance 3.6.1, compiled it on a x86 machine.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002619.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
