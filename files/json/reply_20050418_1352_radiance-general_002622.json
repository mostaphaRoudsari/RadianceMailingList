{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> I'm only guessing, but is it possible that you have two surfaces \n> coincident in that plane?\n\n\nNo, I don't think so. I checked everything this morning. The silly and \ninteresting about this is that I get the wall behind the affected \nsurfaces as some kind of mask. I attach one more rvu-screenshot to \nillustrate this. As you can see, the surface is black, if there is a \nwall behind, and bright (colorpict-modifier visible) if the window \nopening (or no geometry at all) is behind. So it seams to be some kind \nof geometry mess that I created here. Also, this behaviour changes with \noconv -r settings.\n\n\nI use instances heavily in my scene. I have been warned not to do so \n(and of course, most of my instances don't fit into a cube, but are all \nkinds of random geometries). On the other hand, the model is too huge \nto be rendered without the use of instances, and I also cannot divide \nthe model into some cube-like parts, as there is a logical structure of \nbuilding elements in this building which defines how the model is \nbuilt. So maybe I just corrupted the scene by using too many \n(overlapping) instances' octrees? This is the only explanaition I could \nimagine at the moment.\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002622.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
