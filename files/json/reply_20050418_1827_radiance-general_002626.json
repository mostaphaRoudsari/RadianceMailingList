{"body": "Hi Roland,\n\n\nPcond and ximage use completely different implementations of the \nhistogram adjustment operator.  By design, they should be reasonably \nwell matched if you use the default options for pcond and \"ximage -e \nauto\", or \"pcond -s -c\" to match \"ximage -e human\".  However, because \nthe histograms are computed in a slightly different way, you can \nsometimes get discrepancies.\n\n\nIf you want your output to match the ximage display, I suggest you use \nnormtiff rather than pcond, which performs tone-mapping using the same \nalgorithms in ximage, and converts to a 24-bit RGB TIFF output.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002626.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 18, 2005 at 06:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002621", "id": "radiance-general_002626"}
