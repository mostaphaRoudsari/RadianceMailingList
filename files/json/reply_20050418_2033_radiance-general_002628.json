{"body": "Bear in mind that normtiff (and ximage -e auto) don't do everything \npcond can do.  In particular, they cannot simulate human loss in acuity \nand veiling glare, so if you really want \"pcond -h\", don't expect \n\"normtiff -h\" to work as a substitute.  Also, if you are converting \nanimation frames and want all the frames to use the same tone-mapping, \npcond -I works with the output of phisto, whereas there is no such \noption in normtiff.\n\n\nJust had to throw in some caveats.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002628.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 18, 2005 at 08:33PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002621", "id": "radiance-general_002628"}
