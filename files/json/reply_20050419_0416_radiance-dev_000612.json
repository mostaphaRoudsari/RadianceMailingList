{"body": "Well, I have a first cut at a more general method for tracking ray \ncontributions in rtrace, which I just checked into CVS.  I think I just \nmissed the midnight dump in Freiburg, so you may have to wait until \ntomorrow for it (big deal), but it's in CVS.  The basic idea is to use \nthe new -oTW option for rtrace, which then reports contribution factors \nfor each ray traced.  These may be used together with the surfaces and \nintersection points or directions to accumulate a transfer function for \nuse in a daylight coefficient or optical analysis.\n\n\nIf anyone is interested in applying this new functionality, or wants a \nbetter explanation of what it can do, please write to the list.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-April/000612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 19, 2005 at 04:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000611", "id": "radiance-dev_000612"}
