If several instances overlap, each one \nwill be traversed for a ray hit, and the one which actually 'wins' in \nthe end is determined by the way they're inserted into the object set \nfor this octree subcube, and not e.g by the distance of the ray hit to \nthe view point.\n\n\n(PS one reason for me joining into that discussion and risking a \nstatement is to check if my understanding of the meachinism is correct...)\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002633.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "April 19, 2005 at 10:56AM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002623", "id": "radiance-general_002633"}
