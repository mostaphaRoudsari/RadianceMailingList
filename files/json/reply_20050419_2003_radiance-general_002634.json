{"body": "Carsten is correct in the case of actual overlapping geometry, but \noverlapping instances are not a problem per se, though they do tend to \nmake oconv take a lot longer and use a lot more memory resolving them.\n\n\nIf two or more instances overlap, Radiance traces rays in each \ninstance, and returns the geometry that intersects first (in the case \nof multiple intersections).  If two bits of geometry are coincident, \nthe one that gets returned is decided randomly, usually as a result of \nfloating point roundoff errors.  The same is true when geometry is not \ncontained in instances.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002634.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 19, 2005 at 08:03PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002623", "id": "radiance-general_002634"}
