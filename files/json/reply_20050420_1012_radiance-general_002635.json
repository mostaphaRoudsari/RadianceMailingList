{"body": "Hi Greg and all,\nI`ve tried mksource a bit and it works wonderfully, it`s a great program\n(and just what I needed)\nI put a page with the first sample renders:\nhttp://home.att.ne.jp/banana/tiago/radiance/mksource.htm\nrpict was only with -ab 1, and all the rest defaults since I just wanted to\ntest the sources\n\n\nfirst I tried mksource with the default settings but it seemed to produce\ntoo few sources, and the render looked unnatural\n(don`t think this could be fixed with rpict settings)\nI tried changing the max angle to 0.5 (-a .5) but that was too small, and\nthe render took too long (at least for my laptop)\nso I tried other three values (5 deg, 2 and 1, after moving to a faster\ncomputer) and the differences are visible. The render with -a 1 took about\n15 hours, so I don`t want to imagine what would happen with -ab 3 -ad 5000\netc...\nI guess it`s a compromise, and maybe making the threshold higher would\nreduce the number of sources and allow a smaller -a?\nI will keep trying other settings and let you know how it goes.\nRegards\n\n\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002635.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "April 20, 2005 at 10:12AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002602", "id": "radiance-general_002635"}
