{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nThanks for giving mksource a try -- and for sharing your results.\n\n\nYou might try adding \"-dj .6 -ps 1\" to your rpict options (or setting \nPENUMBRA=True if you're using rad) to see if that helps with a smaller \nnumber of light sources.  If it still looks wonky, maybe I'll reduce \nthe maximum source angle default.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 20, 2005 at 07:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002602", "id": "radiance-general_002636"}
