I haven't used a light probe with mkillum yet. I had noticed that\nI needed at least -ab 1 (really INDIRECT=1 in the .rif file) to make a\nlight probe work. I suppose using mkillum would allow the use of -ab 0\nwhile still lighting up the scene?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid colorpict hdr_probe_image\n7       red     green   blue    uffizi_probe.hdr        angmap.cal      u\n     v\n0\n0\n\n\nhdr_probe_image glow light_probe\n0\n0\n4       1       1       1       0\n\n\nlight_probe source ibl_environment\n0\n0\n4       0       1       0       360\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002638.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "April 20, 2005 at 09:05PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002602", "id": "radiance-general_002638"}
