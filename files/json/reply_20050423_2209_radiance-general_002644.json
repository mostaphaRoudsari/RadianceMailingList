{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\n   I'm a new user to RAD and now I'm using CYGWIN RADIANCE. I tried\nto use xglaresrc command and then it prompted me with \"window seems to\nbe the wrong size\" and \"error reading glare sources\".\n  I'm not sure what this means and how I could solve it. Could anyone\nplease let me know what was the cause of the problem?\n  Thank you very much in advance.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nSiritip H.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002644.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Siritip Harn.", "created_at": "April 23, 2005 at 10:09PM", "created_by": "Siritip_Harn.", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002641", "id": "radiance-general_002644"}
