The answer to the second one is, probably.\n\n\nThe raw truth of using Radiance is that there is no single correct \nanswer for parameterizing your simulations. The proper settings for the \nmyriad options will differ with every single simulation you do, and \ndepend on... pretty much everything.  The good news is that the rad \nutility can be put to good use as you get started with Radiance.  rad \nmakes good guesses about proper parameters for your simulations based \non a few basic assumptions about your scene.  You can even save those \nassumptions to a file and reuse them in subsequent rpict and rtrace \nruns.  Refer to the manpage of rpict for more onfo on that.  There are \nalso some good discussions of this on this list's archives (I should \nknow, since I learned about this from this very list).\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002647.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 24, 2005 at 06:31AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002642", "id": "radiance-general_002647"}
