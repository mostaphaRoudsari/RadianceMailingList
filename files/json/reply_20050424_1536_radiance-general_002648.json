{"body": "Thanks for the helpful info and the warm welcome! I had tried to export the\npath before but it apparently didn't work for some reason (probably put a\ncolon in the wrong place or something, heh), so I did it again and it works\nfine now. \n\n\nOn a side note, I would highly recommend Debian if you are thinking about\nswitching. I haven't had much experience with too many other distributions\n(only RedHat and Mandrake), but I like Debian the best out of them, mostly\nfor it's package management system (to answer your question, yes, the deb\nfiles are like rpms).\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nDave\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002648.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "J.
