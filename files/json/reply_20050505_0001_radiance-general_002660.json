{"body": "Hi Paul,\n\n\nThe calc program has been renamed to \"icalc\" in 3.6 to avoid a naming \nconflict on some Unix systems.  (The new name corresponds to \n\"interactive calculator\" if it helps you remember.)  These are the name \nchanges that were made in 3.6:\n\n\n\tcalc -> icalc\n\tgencat -> gencatenary\n\tlam -> rlam\n\tneat -> neaten\n\trview -> rvu\n\n\nThe \"rvu\" program has a symbolic link to \"rview,\" but still you'll get \nan invocation of the restricted, read-only version of \"vi\" on most \nsystems unless you Radiance binaries are ahead of /usr/bin in your PATH \nvariable.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002660.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 05, 2005 at 12:01AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002658", "id": "radiance-general_002660"}
