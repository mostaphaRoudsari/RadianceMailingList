{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nIf I understand your question correctly, you do not need to worry  \nabout the difference between the minimum voxel size set by -r in  \nobj2mesh and the minimum voxel set in oconv, as they are unrelated.   \nOconv incorporates the mesh created by obj2mesh, as well as instances  \ncreated by other oconv runs, as transformed cubes in the scene, and  \ndoes not subdivide them beyond that unless they intersect other  \ninstances or meshes or geometry.  If they intersect each other too  \nmuch, oconv can take a long time to resolve them.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002671.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 16, 2005 at 05:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002670", "id": "radiance-general_002671"}
