{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nBoth images look like they are suffering from image sampling errors.   \nYou should try rendering these at higher resolution, setting -ps 1 in  \nrpict (or \"set ps 1\" in rvu).\n\n\nI assume you're using the latest version of Radiance (3.6)?\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  If the problem persists and isn't just image sampling, please  \nsend me your .OBJ file (compressed), and I'll have a look.  Don't  \ncopy it to the mailing list, though.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002675.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 17, 2005 at 08:00PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002674", "id": "radiance-general_002675"}
