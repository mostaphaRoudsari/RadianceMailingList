{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI found the problem.  You have a couple of polygons with 105  \nvertices, which obj2rad leaves as is, but obj2mesh has to convert  \nthese to triangles, since that's all the mesh primitive supports.   \nUnfortunately, the algorithm in place to do this only works properly  \nfor convex polygons.  Implementing a proper, general triangulation  \nmethod is a hard problem, and not something I have time for at the  \nmoment.\n\n\nIf anyone out there has a bit of code they'd like to lend to the  \ncause, or a good reference they can recommend, I'd be happy to hear it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002676.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 18, 2005 at 06:53PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002674", "id": "radiance-general_002676"}
