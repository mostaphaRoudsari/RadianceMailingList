I had been \ntrying to find errors in the geometry for quite a while, so this was \nreally a great help. I use a dxf file now, and convert that with Georg \nMischler's dxf2rad.\n\n\nThere is a \"GNU Triangulated Surface Library\" \n(http://gts.sourceforge.net/), I am not sure if it can be useful ?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002678.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
