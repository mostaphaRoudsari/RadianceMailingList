{"body": "Hi  Federico,\n\n\nyour task cries for using photon-mapping...\n\n\nYou should model your shading system geometrically and use dielectric as \nmaterial (be careful about the surface orientation!). The diffusing \nmaterial can be modeled by trans material. If you have a complex \nscattering material, you can adapt the trans material by an cal \nfunction. (Don't use BRTF-func or data with the current photon-mapping \nversion).\n\n\nTo be more efficient using the diffuse sky, you should define a \nphoton-port, where all the photons are emitted to. Usually the \nphoton-port material is the window pane.\n\n\nThen you can simply run the simulations, direct and diffuse \ncontributions should be calculated correctly.\n\n\nLast but not least, there exist also a version of daysim containing \nphoton-mapping, so you can run these simulations also hourly (or other \ntimesteps) if you want. Unfortunately, the latest daysim version didn't \ncompile with the photon-mapping extension - but if you need it, you can \nuse also the older version, Christoph could provide it.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002683.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "May 19, 2005 at 04:07PM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002681", "id": "radiance-general_002683"}
