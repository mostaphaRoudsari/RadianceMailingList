{"body": "you may also consider to have a look to radzilla\n\n\n ;-)\n\n\nThis is a not official, not bullet proof, version of radiance that incorporates all new additions + some really crazy Carsten optimisations/changes/addons...\n\n\nIt seems really consistent and stable and I already modelled some prisms with pmap within it (like a 500 modular prisms wall).\n\n\nIt works well!\n\n\nI believe it's worthy to try and I have been really impressed by the latest development.\n\n\nThe advantage over traditional radiance for me is that photon mapping is performed through the rpict command without having to use mkpmap... but they might be some bugs here of there.... watch out!\n\n\nciao,\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002684.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "May 19, 2005 at 05:31PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002681", "id": "radiance-general_002684"}
