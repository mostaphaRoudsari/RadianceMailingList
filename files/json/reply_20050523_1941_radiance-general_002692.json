{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nWithout the benefit of photometric measurements, or having seen the  \nmaterial of which you speak, it is quite impossible to usefully  \nspeculate as to its behavior.  All I can say is that far-field  \nreflectance should be an average of near-field behavior that is  \nappropriately computed (averaged) in Radiance.  There can be issues  \nwith noise depending on the model, but you shouldn't require two  \ntypes of model for near and far field.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002692.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 23, 2005 at 07:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002686", "id": "radiance-general_002692"}
