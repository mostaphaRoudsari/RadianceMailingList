{"body": "Tarik,\n\n\nYou will likely have to create your own mask to clone out the  \nfeatures you want to eliminate (as opposed to using the one in the  \ntutorial).  Creating the mask is easily done in Photoshop or similar  \napp that will permit you to create an 8bit grayscale image where  \nblack is no pass and white is full pass.\n\n\nTake your HDRs and convert them to LDRs and bring them into  \nPhotoshop, etc. as reference for creating your mask.\n\n\nI assume that you kept the camera at the same elevation and simply  \nmoved it 90 degrees from its original position, orbiting in the  \nhorizontal (ground) plane.  Then, it should just be a matter of  \nmarking the reference points systematically and consistently.  If you  \nwant, send me your two probe images and I'll take a look.\n\n\nGood luck,\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn May 23, 2005, at 10:44 AM, Tarik Rahman wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002695.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "May 24, 2005 at 02:07AM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002689", "id": "radiance-general_002695"}
