{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nThanks for the very helpful advice. Unfortunately I cannot access the link\nyou gave me as it says 'object not found', what's the name of the paper?\n\n\nApologies if my email was confusing, to simplify, I wish to illustrate to an\naudience the dynamics of artificial light in providing a warm and cool\nenvironment relative to mixing light from 2000 to 6000K as is presented by\nPhilips\n(http://www.lighting.philips.com/gl_en/index.php?main=global&parent=global&i\nd=global&lang=en under' a new concept in office lighting ' and then to\ncompare that with actual warm (morning or evening) and cool (midday) light\nfrom a window.\n\n\nThe lamp colour defaults are 0.907 0.863 0.4762\n\n\nI wish to model the same lamp but with a colour of 2200 and 6000K resp.\n\n\nI now understand that the ies2rad program translates the colour from the -t\nand -c options into the .dat file which is used in generating the\ndistributions. The .fmt file must be one just used by DRAD, so not to worry\nbout that.\n\n\nNow when I consider the human eye things get complicated. There is no\nspectral power distribution of the fluorescent illuminant and the spectral\nreflectances of your objects are also not available. It is a very simple\noffice scene with angled desks, yellow chair, and light coloured partition\ndividers. Can you suggest where I can get generic data of this kind? Or can\nyou suggest the best way to approach what I am trying to simulate?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nAnthony\n\n\nP.S. Apologies for attaching the mailing list, hope this one gets through in\nproper format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message has been scanned for content and \nviruses by the DIT Information Services MailScanner \nService, and is believed to be clean.\nhttp://www.dit.ie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002697.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anthony J.
