{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYou need to use the name of the material that actually gets assigned to \nthe geometry. In other words:\n\n\nvoid plastic red\n...\n\n\nvoid alias mat_to_geometry_name red\n\n\nmat_to_geometry_name sphere obj.sphere\n0\n0\n4   0   0   0   1\n\n\nto exclude the material applied to obj.sphere you would use:\n\n\n -ae mat_to_geometry_name\n\n\nHope this makes sense.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nLars O.
