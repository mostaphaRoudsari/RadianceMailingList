What is your light probe \nlike? Does it have a small source of light, or is it spread over a large \narea? If your light probe image has a large source of light, or many \nsmaller ones spread out, then the results you describe sound about right.\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002704.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "May 25, 2005 at 04:08PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002703", "id": "radiance-general_002704"}
