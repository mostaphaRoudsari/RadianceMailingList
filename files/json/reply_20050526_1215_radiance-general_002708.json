{"body": "Stefano,\nit may sound too simple but unless you are about to design the optic\nitself you should be considering to use some assumptions, just to make\nlife easier....\n\n\nIf your aim is to have a nice series of images, some daylight assessment\nwith daylight factor plots, luminance maps...\nthere are good tricks to save time and give reasonable answers:\n\n\nyou may use just a big glowing cylinder.\n\n\nall you need to do is calculate manually the relation between input and\noutput for different time of the year, therefore link the external light\nlevels to the cylinder glow material radiance.\n\n\nyou may also use excel, just one calculation with one cylinder then\nscale up and down based on external illuminance...\n\n\nIf you need to consider also the extinction within the cylinder you may\nuse a brightfunc that changes radiance with the length of the\ncylinder....\n\n\nbut all these are really simplified things... \n\n\nthe ultimate option, as you say, is to go for photon mapping... or\nphotonmapping + radzilla but it is a little longer \n\n\nciao,\nin bocca al lupo ;-)\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002708.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "May 26, 2005 at 12:15PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002707", "id": "radiance-general_002708"}
