A nicer GUI would be good. And the non-X11 (Windows and OS/X) users \nwould probably like a native replacement for rview/rvu.\n\n\n> can it be comercial?  is radiance open source? do you see something bad?\n\n\nThe license (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/misc/license.txt) appears to \nbe something like the BSD license. I'm not a lawyer though, and don't even \nplay one on TV. But it looks like you can take the source code and do \npretty much anything you want, just keep a little copyright notice somewhere.\n\n\nOne thing to remember is that reputation is everything in the Open Source \nworld. Act like a jerk and people here won't help you. But play nice (like \nsay, adding value and providing an actual service) and so will everyone \nelse. Basically don't leach off of the free developers. And giving \nsomething back to the community is always good for relations.\n\n\n> please answer me, i'm a bit disapointed, probably radiance is the most \n> amazing program i've ever seen, and i'm greg's fan.\n\n\nMe too! :)\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-May/000616.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "May 27, 2005 at 11:55AM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000615", "id": "radiance-dev_000616"}
