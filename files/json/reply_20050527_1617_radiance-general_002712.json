As for obtaining the program, since Greg checked it in\nyesterday, I'd guess that all you need to do is download the latest HEAD\nrelease today and recompile.

Idea?\n\n\nProgramming languages/tools are like cars; they all excel at various\nthings, and people tend to gravitate to one or another for many different\nreasons -- availability, cost, features, ease of use, adaptability, etc --\nand everyone has a favorite.  I'd think that the ideal language to use\nhere would depend on the programmer, and of course the exact nature of the\nprogram being created to use RTCONTRIB.\n\n\nThere are plenty of Python People on this list, and Perl People too.  But\nif you poke around in some of the Radiance tools you'll also see that Greg\nhas been putting the C shell to good use in a number of ways.  It's really\nwhatever you're comfy using.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002712.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 27, 2005 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002711", "id": "radiance-general_002712"}
