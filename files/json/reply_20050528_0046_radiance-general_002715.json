{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nGlad to have some eager beavers going at this...\n\n\n> However, when I run\n> the command:\n>\n> vwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf | rtcontrib -ffc \\\n>          `vwrays -d -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf` @render.opt \\\n>           -o c_%s.pic -m light1 -m light2 scene.oct\n>\n> I get the following message:\n> rtrace warning: zero ambient accuracy so \"test.amb\" not opened\n>\n> ...but I did have -aa set to .1 (and this is in my render.opt  \n> file), and\n> there is a valid ambient cache.\n>\n> Two questions:\n> a) Why is this happening?\n\n\nThe -oTW option of rtrace (used by rtcontrib) doesn't work with the  \nambient cache, because information would be lost in figuring ray  \ncontributions.  Therefore, rtcontrib sets -aa 0 to switch caching off  \nin its call to rtrace.  You should adjust your -ad value  \naccordingly.  (It also sets -as 0 for similar reasons.)\n\n\n> b) Is this the only reason for the direct-only component showing up  \n> in the\n> renderings, or is this the intended result of the command?

Can this be done?\n\n\nYes, you should see both direct and indirect contributions from  \nrtcontrib.  At least, that's the idea.  Maybe I should check to make  \nsure of the results, because my test scene didn't contain much  \nindirect lighting.  Let me get back to you on this....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002715.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 28, 2005 at 12:46AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002714", "id": "radiance-general_002715"}
