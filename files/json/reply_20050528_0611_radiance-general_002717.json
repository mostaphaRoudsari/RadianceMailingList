So I dumped the -defaults to a\ntext file for you, and will send it (along with some renderings) to you in\na separate email.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002717.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 28, 2005 at 06:11AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002714", "id": "radiance-general_002717"}
