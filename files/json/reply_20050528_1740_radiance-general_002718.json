{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI found the problem.  It has to do with your -ad 1536 value and the  \nway I'm computing weights, which causes the ambient rays to drop  \nbelow your -lw threshold.  I made a temporary fix that circumvents  \nthe problem in this case, but I haven't checked it into CVS because I  \nneed to think more carefully about how I'm computing ray weights in  \nthis part of the code.  I'll check it in when I'm sure I have it  \nright this times.\n\n\nThanks -- you're my alpha alpha tester!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002718.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 28, 2005 at 05:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002714", "id": "radiance-general_002718"}
