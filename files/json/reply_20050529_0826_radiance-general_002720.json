{"body": "The new version is checked in, and seems to be working.  You really  \nneed to override some of the rendering options, though, as rad's  \noutput is not appropriate for rtcontrib, anymore than it's  \nappropriate for mkillum.  It's a different use of Radiance and you  \ncan't really think of it as rendering anymore.  In particular, the - \nad option should be set to something much smaller, since the ambient  \ncache is disabled.\n\n\nThanks again for helping me find the problem.  I think I worked it out.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002720.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 29, 2005 at 08:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002714", "id": "radiance-general_002720"}
