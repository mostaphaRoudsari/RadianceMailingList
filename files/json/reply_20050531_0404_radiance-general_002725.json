{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nThe fault is mine -- apparently, OS X is more generous with it's  \n#include's than Linux.  Add the following right after the line:\n\n\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n\nat the head of rtcontrib.c:\n\n\n#include <signal.h>\n\n\nHopefully, that should fix it.  I'll check in the change tonight, but  \nyou don't need to wait for it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002725.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 31, 2005 at 04:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002724", "id": "radiance-general_002725"}
