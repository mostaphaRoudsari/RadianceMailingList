{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nRtcontrib required some rather extensive changes to the diffuse  \ninterreflection methods, which definitely introduced one or two bugs  \nthat I have since fixed.  You need to make sure you have the latest  \nHEAD release, as I suspect you picked up a buggy version of src/rt/ \nambcomp.c or similar.  If you recompile with last night's HEAD and  \nstill have problems, send me a list of the options you're using in  \nmkillum and I'll see if I can figure it out.  I did my own test runs  \nthis morning to check that it's behaving correctly, and I couldn't  \nfind anything wrong.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002736.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2005 at 09:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002735", "id": "radiance-general_002736"}
