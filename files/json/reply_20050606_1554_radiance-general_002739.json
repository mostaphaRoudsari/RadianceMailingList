{"body": "Hello,\nIn my experience, Desktop Radiance is quite stable if you don`t use the CAD\ninterface. But it doesn`t include the last release, and not all programs are\nported. Depending on what you plan to do, this could be a problem, but for\nsimple renderings, it should work. (the Radiance tutorial, for example,\nworks fine like in the manual)\nYou could also install the last release on Cygwin using Francesco Anselmo`s\nbinaries. You can find the information in the downloads page of\nradiance-online.org.\nFinally, the option of compiling Radiance on windows using the Borland\ncompiler was mentioned earlier in the list, but I don`t know how that works,\nyou can check in the list`s archives (also in radiance-online).\nHope this helps.\nRegards,\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002739.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "June 06, 2005 at 03:54PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002737", "id": "radiance-general_002739"}
