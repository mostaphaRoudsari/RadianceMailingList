{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nYes, it definitely helps to know what we're talking about.  1000  \nwords/picture, at least!\n\n\nThe problem with the initial frames is that there aren't enough  \nambient divisions to find the few and tiny holes you have.  I  \nrecommend setting a much larger value for -ad at the beginning, and  \nyou can gradually relax this as you get more holes in your space.   \nJust guessing, I'd say you need at least -ad 4096 for the initial  \nframe, which will take 5 times longer to compute.  (I don't think you  \nneed to increase -as -- 512 should be enough.)\n\n\nAn alternate approach is to use illums in your openings with the  \noutside distribution mapped to them, as described in Tutorial 0  \n(Chapter 1 of RwR which is available online if you don't have it from  \n<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book>).  The problem is that you'll  \nprobably want to switch at some point from using illum's to just open  \nholes as you have them once you get a certain number and it stops  \npaying off in the calculation.  With illum's, you can decrease -ab 3  \nto -ab 2 and get the same result.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002745.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 09, 2005 at 07:53PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002744", "id": "radiance-general_002745"}
