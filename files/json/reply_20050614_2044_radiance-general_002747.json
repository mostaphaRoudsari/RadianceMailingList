{"body": "Hi Jay,\n\n\nYou have to offer us some clues as to how you are attempting this  \ncalculation.  The website you give shows a bunch of JPEG thumbnails.   \nAre you converting those?  It seems that the author of this page is  \nconverting them without considering gamma, then computing the log of  \nthe non-linear gray values, which is basically nonsense.  However, in  \nthe interest of reproducing their results, you can use:\n\n\n     % djpeg egret2.jpg | ra_ppm -r -g 1 \\\n         | pvalue -h -H -d -b | rcalc -e '$1=log($1)' | total -m\n\n\nUsing the egret pictures, this then gives:\n\n\n     -2.08354495\n\n\nTo get the final log-average luminance, simply apply the exponent  \nfunction:\n\n\n     % ev 'exp(-2.0835)'\n\n\nThis yeilds:\n\n\n     0.124493721\n\n\nNot exactly the 0.1212 value they give on the website, but close.   \nNote that I didn't use a delta value in my calculation, but adding  \none should raise this value rather than lower it.  A more intelligent  \napplication of log averaging would apply a gamma to get back to a  \nlinear color space, e.g.:\n\n\n     % djpeg egret2.jpg | ra_ppm -r -g 2.4 \\\n         | pvalue -h -H -d -b | rcalc -e '$1=log($1)' | total -m\n\n\nApply the exp() function to this result gives a much smaller result:\n\n\n     0.00687406256\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002747.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 14, 2005 at 08:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002746", "id": "radiance-general_002747"}
