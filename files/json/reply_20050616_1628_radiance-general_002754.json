{"body": "I seem to remember Lightscape having a handy feature that would give you what it thought you should be using based on the individual images.  My guess is that it was simply averaging the pixels together to come up with an average RGB value.  I've done similar things with photoshop, but this method is a far cry from what the actual measured reflectances would be, and is only a visual attempt at getting it close.\n\n\n.8 .8 .8 sounds too high for wood.  I think wood (depending on the type is around ~.2 to ~.4 depending on the wood).  Check your radiance's lib directory.  I believe there are some old materials files that include wood definitions.\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nHi, Dear friends:\n\n\nI am trying to map pictures to simulate the texture of wood, carpet and so on.\nI use ra_tiff to convert a .tif picture into a .pic picture, and then use colorpict to map it such as:\n\n\nvoid colorpict image01\n9 clip_r clip_g clip_b 02.pic picture.cal frac(U) frac(V) -s 500\n0\n0\n\n\nimage01 plastic wood_mat\n0\n0\n5 .8 .8 .8 .02 0\n\n\nI found that the properties of plastic material like \"5 .8 .8 .8 .02 0\" influence the result greatly. how should I set them properly?\n\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n\nYours,\n\n\nHuang\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "June 16, 2005 at 04:28PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002749", "id": "radiance-general_002754"}
