{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nJust like a tessellated surface, a mesh in Radiance is represented as  \nthe individual polygons and the Nx, Ny, Nz, and Rdot variables  \ncorrespond to the actual \"unperturbed\" surface normals.  The only  \ntime the perturbed values are known is during material evaluation,  \nwhich is why plastic comes out looking smooth.  If you want to play  \nwith the perturbed value, you'll have to utilize the NxP, NyP, NzP,  \nand RdotP variables that are available from the brdf primitives.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-June/000623.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 16, 2005 at 06:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000622", "id": "radiance-dev_000623"}
