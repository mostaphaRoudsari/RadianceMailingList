{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThere is a file called grating.cal that models depth of 3-D grids and  \nuses a BRTDfunc type to approximate the ensemble behavior.  I posted  \nit in response to a similar request from Richard Clibborn:\n\n\n     http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005- \nFebruary/002438.html\n\n\nIf you want the actual appearance of the blinds, rather than simply  \nits transmission at a distance, then a mixfunc is required.  I don't  \nhave time to write one right now, or even modify Georg's.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002752.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 18, 2005 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002751", "id": "radiance-general_002752"}
