{"body": "Greg, thanks for the link.. Never actually used a BRTDfunc so I will have to look at that more closely.\n\n\nAnyway, I went ahead tried to put a couple of cal files together since only one of our computers could handle the 3D grid despite my efforts, and got lucky with this one.  It seems to work great even though I'm not completely sure what the mod function is really doing.\n\n\nThanks for responding.\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\n\n\ngrid.cal\n\n\n{\n The cal file for a \"wire\" mesh consisting of vertical cables holding up horizontal rods.\n This file could really be used to make any pladlike combination of two materials.\n The file is written around vertical surfaces.
