{"body": "Hi Zack,\n\n\nIn the Radiance reference manual <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/ \nrefer/ray.html#Surfaces> it mentions briefly that one of the  \nlimitations of instances is that they are not good for light  \nsources.  This is because the initialization step in Radiance that  \ndiscovers light sources does not delve into octree and mesh instances  \nto find potential sources.  It could of course, but since the number  \nof sources should be restricted to something reasonable, I didn't  \nthink it was a good idea to include instanced objects in the source  \nsearch.\n\n\nThere is a simple workaround for this.  Just take the emitting  \nsurface out of your luminaire and instance it separately using  \nxform.  You can still apply replmarks by xform'ing a file that looks  \nlike this:\n\n\n# Output of ies2rad\nvoid brightdata ...\n\n\n... polygon source\n...\n\n\nvoid instance luminaire_geometry\n1 lumgeom.oct\n0\n0\n# End of luminaire description\n\n\nGive the above file to replmarks -x, and you'll get a transformed  \ninstance and transformed source that Radiance will recognize.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002757.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 23, 2005 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002756", "id": "radiance-general_002757"}
