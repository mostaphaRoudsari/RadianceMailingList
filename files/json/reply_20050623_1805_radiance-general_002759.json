{"body": "I have 4 IES files applied to each luminaire octree I want to create, \nwhich I think is adding complexity to this issue.  I have tried what I \nthink is basically the work-around method outlined.  I am testing it \nwith this rad file:\n\n\n### test_oct.rad\nvoid                  alias  l_room                grey_090\n!xform scene/l_room.rad\n\n\n!replmarks -x parts/campo_full.rad l_test_oct scene/l_test_oct.rad\n### end file\n\n\nwhich refers to\n### campo_full.rad\nvoid                  alias  l_reflector           grey_090\n!xform scene/l_reflector.rad\n\n\nvoid                  alias  l_metal               stainless_steel\n!xform scene/l_metal.rad\n\n\nvoid                  alias  l_glow                campo_glow\n!xform scene/l_glow.rad\n\n\n!replmarks -x luminaire/hessamerica+++ca45-71r+++6500.rfl l_ies \nscene/l_ies.rad\n### end file\n\n\nThe \"luminaire/hessamerica+++ca45-71r+++6500.rfl\" file is basically the \noutput of ies2rad (rayfrontized) for a single ies file.  Since I have 4 \nof these, and the default ies2rad output is a box centered around the \norigin, i have this extra replmarks (which has used -x all along) to put \nthese 4 distributions in place relative to the luminaire goemetry ( \nwhich is described by the xformed rad files rather than an instanced \noctree -- does this matter)\n\n\nI still am getting no light. in my test_oct.rad scene description.  What \nam I still missing?  The only octree being made is the final scene \noctree for \"test_oct.rad\".\n\n\nThis url shows a low-quality rendering of the fixture I am dealing with:\nhttp://www.archenergy.com/services/sda/tools/campo/\n\n\nThanks!\nZack\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002759.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "June 23, 2005 at 06:05PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002756", "id": "radiance-general_002759"}
