{"body": "Hi Zack,\n\n\nIt looks like you are getting light in your image. There seems to be a \nlot of light on the floor. Perhaps it is not working the way you expect?\n\n\nOne thing to do that might help at least verify the spatial location, \nwould be to edit luminaire/hessamerica+++ca45-71r+++6500.rfl and make \nsure that the light source is \"light\" rather than \"illum.\" This way you \ncan see its location in the image. Then make a scene that only includes:\n\n\n!replmarks -x luminaire/hessamerica+++ca45-71r+++6500.rfl l_ies \nscene/l_ies.rad\n\n\nplaced in the room. This way you can see if the distribution is working \nthe way you expect (without the interference of actual fixture \ngeometry). The problem that you might be facing is the size and location \nof the geometry that the distribution data is applied to vs the size and \nlocation of the fixture geometry. You may end up needing to custom build \nthe geometry that represents the sources that the data is applied to. \nOne option to assist in this is to use the -i feature of ies2rad. This \nproduces a sphere with an illum material type applied to it (modified by \nthe distribution function). You can specify the radius of the sphere so \nthat it can enclose the relevant geometry of the fixture.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers wrote:\n\n\n> I have 4 IES files applied to each luminaire octree I want to create, \n> which I think is adding complexity to this issue.
