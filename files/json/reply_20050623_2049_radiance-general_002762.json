Just that each of your 4 elements must be treated\nas a seperate luminaire, by actually placing 4 markers instead of\njust one.\n\n\nBut then, I'm not sure which surface in your example is supposed\nto serve as an emitter, so it may be too tricky for the builtin\nmechanism to handle it correctly. Is that the reason why you're\ntrying the manual approach?\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002762.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "June 23, 2005 at 08:49PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002756", "id": "radiance-general_002762"}
