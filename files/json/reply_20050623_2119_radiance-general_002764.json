Zack, you mention that you have\na bounding box for the illum, but you don't mention that you have applied\nlboxcorr.  Perhaps this is causing problems?  Honestly, I haven't use\nbounding illums (yet), but I remember reading that this correction must be\napplied to non-spherical illum boundaries...\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002764.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 23, 2005 at 09:19PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002756", "id": "radiance-general_002764"}
