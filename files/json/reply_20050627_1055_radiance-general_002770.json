{"body": "Hi Lebele,\n\n\nSounds like you have a compatibility issue between different versions  \nof X11.  Try changing the \"-I/usr/include/X11\" in your rmake to \"-I/ \nusr/X11R6/include\" and see if that works.  (You'll have to run  \n\"makeall clean\" beforehand.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002770.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 27, 2005 at 10:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002769", "id": "radiance-general_002770"}
