{"body": "Hi Greg, \n\n\nThanks for your reply, I tried your suggestion, but that did not change\nanything. I got the same errors during the process of makeall.\nHowever, your reply inspired me to look more closely in /usr/X11R6\n(/usr/include/X11 is just a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6 ), where I found\ntwo different 'lib' directories:\n/usr/X11R6/lib \n/usr/X11R6/lib64   (the one to use for 64bit machines)\n\n\nI changed my rmake file as below and everything compiled witout errors\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nexec make \"SPECIAL=\" \\\n        \"OPT=-m64 -O3 -mfpmath=sse -DSPEED=200\" \\\n        \"MACH=-Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib64\n-I/usr/X11R6/include -DNOSTEREO\" \\\n        ARCH=IBMPC \"COMPAT=bmalloc.o erf.o getpagesize.o\" \\\n        INSTDIR=/usr/local/bin \\\n        LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/ray \\\n        ESUFFIX= \\\n        CC=gcc \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting binairies are now available at:\nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/R31P6_Fedora4_AMD64.tar.gz\n(without trad, I don't have wish installed).\n\n\nThanks, \n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 2005-06-27 at 09:55 +0100, Gregory J.
