{"body": "I am happy to say, after minor brain damage, that I successfully created \nmy luminaire block.  My problem, initially, was due to the Radiance \nlimitation that light cannot be included in an instance.  My problem \nwith the workaround, any of those discussed I think would work - just \ndifferent ways of assembling the pieces, was that I was refering to a \n*.rad file in a my \"./parts\" directory.  However, inside the *.rad file \nwere references to my \"./scene\" directory which is not a subdirectory of \n\"parts\" but at the same level.  My RAYPATH definition has the current \ndirectory \".\" as a path and so it was simply not finding the files...a \nmistake I probably would have noticed sooner had I not been using a \nRadiance interface (rayfront) and a mistake I probably would have never \nnoticed had I not jumped behind the scenes.\n\n\nDon't know if this will help anyone, but thought I'd post to resolve \nthis thread.  Thanks for all the help!\nZack\n\n\nBTW- Georg, in Rayfront if people try to create \"parts\" as rad files \nrather than octrees and then replmark them I think it will result in the \nsame problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002778.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "June 28, 2005 at 01:49AM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002756", "id": "radiance-general_002778"}
