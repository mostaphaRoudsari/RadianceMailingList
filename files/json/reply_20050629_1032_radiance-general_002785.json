{"body": "Sorry my previous answer was just irrelevant to your question...\nIn fact you need the inverse transformation. Here it is:\n\n\nX=0.5142*r + 0.3240*g + 0.1618*b;\nY=0.2652*r + 0.6702*g + 0.0646*b;\nZ=0.0240*r + 0.1229*g +  0.8531*b;\n\n\nx=X/(X+Y+Z);\ny=Y/(X+Y+Z);\nz=Z/(X+Y+Z);\n\n\nHope this will help you.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n\n\nAt 28.06.2005 17:25, you wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002785.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Raphael Compagnon", "created_at": "June 29, 2005 at 10:32AM", "created_by": "Raphael_Compagnon", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002782", "id": "radiance-general_002785"}
