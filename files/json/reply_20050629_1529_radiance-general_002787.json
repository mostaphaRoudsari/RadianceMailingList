{"body": "Hi Nina,\n\n\nRaphael gave the equivalent formula as you get from xyz_rgb.cal  \nunless you change the primaries or white point in there.  To use the  \nformulas from xyz_rgb.cal, try:\n\n\nrcalc -f xyz_rgb.cal -e 'iR=$1;iG=$2;iB=$3' -e '$1=X(iR,iG,iB);$2=Y \n(iR,iG,iB);$3=Z(iR,iG,iB)'\n\n\nAs you give R G B on input, you'll get X Y Z on output.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002787.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 29, 2005 at 03:29PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002782", "id": "radiance-general_002787"}
