{"body": "Hi Ian,\n\n\nI used your recommended gcc options an got an rendering speed \nimprovement of 1.035. That is 3.5 % (!).\nI used gcc 4.0(etc, I dont know exactly) but did not find any option \nlike \"auto vectorization\". We'll have to wait for that coming up in the \nfuture i think.\nThanks a lot for figuring out these settings so far !\n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Tester wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002788.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "June 30, 2005 at 03:37PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002769", "id": "radiance-general_002788"}
