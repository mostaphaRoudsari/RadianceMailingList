{"body": "this is the usual problem of defining your 'environment variables' or\nputting the libraries somewhere on the disk.\n\n\nThe shortcut is, when compiling radzilla, indicate the location of these\nlibraries and save these files there.\nJust look for rayinit.cal on your disk, is it there? If not you need to\ndownload the libraries (look either on Carsten web site or on the\nofficial radiance web site)\n\n\nIf you have a precompiled version of radiance, just look over the past\nmessages for environmental variables, there should be a full lot of\nmessages about this out there.\n\n\nyou need to, depending on your terminal, define a variable called\nRAYPATH that tells the terminal where radiance libraries are kept\n(assuming you installed them).\n\n\njust try to understand if you are using bash ($) or tcsh (%) first (open\nthe terminal and look for the last character before the blinking cursor,\nis it % or $ ?),\nthen locate the user profile file (that has a different name depending\non the above... it may be ~/.bash_profile for bash and ~/.tcshrc if you\nuse tcsh).\nadd the proper line to define RAYPATH\n\n\nNOW BE REALLY CAREFUL! IF YOU DO A MISTAKE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO BACK.\nso I would suggest you to try using a text editor to change the file...\nand remember to use UNIX line ending. Try with a copy of the file 1st,\njust to be sure.\n\n\nWhen you have done check by\nopening a new terminal\ntyping env\nyou should show the new defined variable:\n\n\nRAYPATH=........\n\n\nciao,\n\n\ngiulio\n\n\nPS which platform are you using radzilla on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002796.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "July 05, 2005 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002795", "id": "radiance-general_002796"}
