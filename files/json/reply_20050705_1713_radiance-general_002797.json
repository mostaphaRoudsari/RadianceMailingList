{"body": "Hi lebele,\n\n\nI don't have a beautiful solution for this, but the following should  \nwork:\n\n\nrlam '\\!vwrays -vf view1.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304' '\\!vwrays -vf  \nview2.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304' \\\n     | rcalc -e 'odd=recno-floor(recno/2)*2-.5' -e '$1=if(odd,$1,$7); \n$2=if(odd,$2,$8);$3=if(odd,$3,$9)' \\\n         -e '$4=if(odd,$4,$10);$5=if(odd,$5,$11);$6=if(odd,$6,$12)' \\\n     | rtrace -fad (etc.)\n\n\nThe rlam command puts rays corresponding to your two views on each  \nline together, and rcalc chooses between them based on scanline  \noddity.  This requires a lot of ASCII/double conversions, which can  \nbe slow, but since rlam doesn't handle binary floats or doubles, this  \nis the simplest way.  A more complex solution that could write  \ndoubles directly would use rcalc alone and two view calculations, but  \nI don't have time to write that one for you.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002797.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 05, 2005 at 05:13PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002794", "id": "radiance-general_002797"}
