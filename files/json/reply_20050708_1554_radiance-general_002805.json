{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI'm not sure what the limit is in the official release, as this is  \nsomething I changed recently, but it's 512 if the latest head.  If  \nyou'd like to change it, you can either edit AMBLLEN in src/rt/ray.h  \nor set a -DAMBLLEN=1024 (or whatever) in your optimization flags in  \nrmake and recompile.\n\n\nIf you are excluding more modifiers than you are including, you can  \nuse the -ai or -aI option instead.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002805.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 08, 2005 at 03:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002804", "id": "radiance-general_002805"}
