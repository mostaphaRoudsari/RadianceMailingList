If it's the \nfirst, there must have been a real change, cause I could exclude around \n6 or seven, not more in my old release (which is something after 3.6).\n\n\n>   If you'd like to change it, you can either edit AMBLLEN in \n> src/rt/ray.h or set a -DAMBLLEN=1024 (or whatever) in your \n> optimization flags in rmake and recompile.\n\n\nI'll take a look at this and compile a new head this week-end.\n\n\nThank you, have a nice week-end, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002806.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
