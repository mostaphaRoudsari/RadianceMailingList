{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks so much for pointing this out for me, and sharing your knowledge \nall the time.\nIt took some time to reply  because I needed to study on rcalc to make \nyour suggestion really work.\n\n\nIt's funny but the commands you wrote results in images with _vertical_ \nfields  :)\nPlease look at http://www.toren.com/radiance/field.jpg for an example of \nthis.\nAfter some time studying what you wrote (and discovering rcalc in the \nmeanwhile!), I spotted the error.\nI changed your commands like this:\n\n\nrlam '!vwrays -vf view01.vp -pa 0 -x 720 -y 576' '!vwrays -vf  view02.vp \n-pa 0 -x 720 -y 576'  \\\n | rcalc -e 'odd=floor(recno/720) - floor ( (recno/720) / 2 ) *2   - 0.5 ' \\\n-e '$1=if(odd,$1,$7); $2=if(odd,$2,$8);$3=if(odd,$3,$9)'  \\\n-e '$4=if(odd,$4,$10);$5=if(odd,$5,$11);$6=if(odd,$6,$12)' \\\n| rtrace -fad  -av 20 20 20 -ab 0 -st 0.01  -x 720 -y 576  -ovpN \nmodel-ani.oct  | imgshader -lf lights.lit | ximage -g 1.7 -e -6\n\n\nand now it works fine!  ( see http://www.toren.com/radiance/fieldsok.jpg )\n\n\nOne problem that remains now, is that the above commands will not work \nwhen oversampling 4 times the image size, to obtain sharper results.\nI have to figure that out soon, and will post the result at that time.\n\n\nThe really good news is that a simple test comparing rendering times \nresulted in 14 minutes rendering time using this 'field' rendering \nagainst 11 minutes when just sending doubles from vwrays to rtrace. This \nmeans that this kind of field rendering is quite a time-saving approach. \nGreat!\n\n\nIebele\n\n\nPS: Please note that where you wrote  '\\vwrays,  I wrote  `!vwrays ( \nomitting the slash)\nThis is because Linux uses bash as standard, while you probably uses csh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002808.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "July 08, 2005 at 08:05PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002794", "id": "radiance-general_002808"}
