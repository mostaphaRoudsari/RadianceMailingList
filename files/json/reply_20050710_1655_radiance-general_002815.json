{"body": "Thomas - First of all, thanks for the effort. This request falls sort  \nof in between lighting and textures, but do you plan to support  \nBlender's IBL capabilities, using HDR images for global  \nillumination?  As Blender already already permits you to set up this  \nenvironment, it would be great to be able to specify this in a  \nRadiance export from Blender.  Can't wait to see what you cook up!\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nOn Jul 10, 2005, at 9:42 AM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002815.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "July 10, 2005 at 04:55PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002814", "id": "radiance-general_002815"}
