Of course these things could be handled with the multiplier\nthat is part of ies2rad as well.  But in rare cases, I need to adjust the\nluminous aperture defined in the ies file, and this can only be done by\nediting those fields in the ies file.  Yes, this is indeed changing the\nfixture from the original photometered luminaire, but it's sometimes done\nin order to simulate a unique fixture.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002829.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 13, 2005 at 06:24PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002814", "id": "radiance-general_002829"}
