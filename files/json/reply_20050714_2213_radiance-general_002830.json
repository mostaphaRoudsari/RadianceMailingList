{"body": "Hi Thomas\n\n\nnice to hear that the info was useful..\n\n\nbtw, two short clarifications:\nmy last sentence was maybe a bit ambigous, of course one can set medium \nextinction and albedo globally, but you still need the mist volume and \nmist material with the source list to show scattering. Otherwise only \nthe extinction will show up, attenuating the light according to the \ndistance the rays have traveled in the scene\nIn this case, a usual way is setting global extinction, for example  \nwith -me 0.07 0.07 0.07 and then define a mist material :\n\n\nvoid  mist fogdemo\nn ... sources\n0\n6  0 0 0  0.5 0.5 0.5\n\n\nthe zeros for the extinction in the mist materials mean to use the \nglobal value without changes, only scattering is calculated in tthe \nvolume then.\n\n\nTo add further complexity and confusion :-), in limited, well defined \ncircumstances also the extinction can be successfully  modified by a \npattern. A 'colorfunc' modifier to the mist material acts on the \nextinction values, however, they aren't changed over the mist volume, \njust the value at the entry point is set and then holds for that ray \nthroughout the mist volume. In special cases, when the gradient of the \nextinction is vertical to the view rays, this can indeed work out well, \nbut only then..\nThink e.g of a fog layer increasing in densitiy with decrasing height \nabove ground, and the looking through it more or less in horizontal \ndirection...\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002830.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "July 14, 2005 at 10:13PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002820", "id": "radiance-general_002830"}
