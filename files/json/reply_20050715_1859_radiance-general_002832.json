{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nAs long as your modifiers are named differently, you can have as many  \nas you like and use the -ae option successfully.  There is no limit  \nto the number of modifiers or the reuse of modifier names in  \nRadiance, but if a modifier appears hundreds of times with the same  \nname, the -ae option takes the one name and translates it into a  \nhundred instances of that name as necessary to form the exclusion set.\n\n\nHopefully, what you have done already should suffice.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I will be out of town and out of contact for the next week, so  \nif you write with a question and get no response, I'm not ignoring  \nyou.  I'm just gone.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002832.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 15, 2005 at 06:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002804", "id": "radiance-general_002832"}
