{"body": "Hey Jelle,\n\n\nJust a few thoughts here. Explaining rendering systems to clients is \nalways difficult. I think that unfortunately clients typically just want \ngood looking images and do not neccessarily care how the images is \n\"made.\" However, I think that you are probably on a good track to \nconsider the results of a Radiance simulation as a virtual prototype, \nwhich means something more than just a \"rendering.\" But in order for \nthis to hold true, the underlying data, (lighting levels, materials, \ngeometry and other fundamental assumptions in the scene) used to \ngenerate the simulations needs to be \"accurate\" to some standard \nsuitable for the given objective. Filtering an image with tone mapping \noffers one way to view the scene in the image.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002842.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 19, 2005 at 05:23PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002840", "id": "radiance-general_002842"}
