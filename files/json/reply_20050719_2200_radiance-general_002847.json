I'm fond of saying that Radiance is a\nlighting simulator which can be used for rendering, rather than a\nrendering tool.  Usually I demonstrate this by showing a simulation\nimage next to a Radiance-generated diagram of numerical lighting\nlevels, emphasizing the point that this is an attempt to approximate\nluminous reality with some level of accuracy.\n\n\n> \n> I think its important to explain how a pcond -h image differs from a\n> non-filtered image (well, pfilt) \n> \n\n\nMy approach here would be to overlay isolux contours on the unfiltered\nimage, and set it next to the filtered image.  Does this sound like\nthe kind of thing you're looking for?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002847.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "July 19, 2005 at 10:00PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002840", "id": "radiance-general_002847"}
