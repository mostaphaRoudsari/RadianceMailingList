{"body": "Hi Huang,\n\n\nOne good resource, is the file: rayinit.cal, which should be in your lib\ndirectory as well as picture.cal. The former will give you some sense of\nwhat frac(x) actually calculates, the latter will help with tile_u and\ntile_v. Picture.cal is the basic procedural function for mapping an\nimage texture onto geometry using the \"colorpict\" material modifier\ntype. The function clip(x) makes sure that the value x is forced to the\nrange [0,1] while the function noop(v) simply return the value v without\nany modification.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002852.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 20, 2005 at 04:51PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002848", "id": "radiance-general_002852"}
