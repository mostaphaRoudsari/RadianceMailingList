{"body": "Hi Giulio,\n\n\nChanging -sj did not resolve the problem (already tried that) , and \nphotoshop is not a solution since it has to be an animation on video.\nPlus it should be more or less physically correct...\n\n\nI just return from an example site, where I have have seen an example \nof  the floor material in a real situation (natural wood finished with a \nwax coating).\nThis floor type does reflect its environment really smoothly but does \nnot reflect lightsources really hard. In other words, it seems that in \nthe real life example there is never a direct reflection from the \nlightsources/lightbeam  to the eye. The reflection seems too diffuse for \nthat to happen.\nSo, in the real world the situation I like to simulate exists, now \nfinding a way to simulate this in Radiance will be the challenge..\n\n\nI am reading the book RWR now,  chapter 12.1 on specular sampling in \nindirect calculations. However I have the feeling that the problem i am \nfacing is in the direct calculation. It just seems that when I could \ncontrol the highlight apart from the reflection , I could model my floor \nmore accurate.\nOr am I totaly lost here ??  Is specularity exactly the same as \nreflection in Radiance?? After 10 years I still have to learn soo much \nabout Radiance. Ok,  that's the fun and the power of Radiance... :)\nAny suggestions remain welcome.\n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\nGiulio Antonutto wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002853.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "July 20, 2005 at 07:02PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002849", "id": "radiance-general_002853"}
