{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nEstimating ambient values is part science and part art as far as I have \nlearned over the years. I don't think that I know of a situation where \nwe have ever used a non neutral ambient value. I suppose if one were \ntrying to more accurately account for certain kind of atmospheric shifts \nthis might be a case to do this....?\n\n\nWithout knowing what your scene looks like (pictures help) it is \ndifficult to help diagnose what is going on. My suscpicion though is \nthat an ambient value of .5 .5 .5  may be too high for the given scene, \nthus the odd looking (\"glowing\") results. A very good option would be to \nuse the \"compamb\" script that Greg wrote. This runs a pass on a small \nimage using fairly high parameters and then does some calculations to \ncome up with a good ambient value for the scene. This is pretty easy to \nuse and does not take that long to return the results.\n\n\nNote the av value affects the whole simulation not just the excluded \nobjects.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002857.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 21, 2005 at 07:55PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002856", "id": "radiance-general_002857"}
