I didn't really use -av in previous projects, but need it \nnow because the complexity of the scene forces me to exclude modifiers \nfrom the ambient calculation.\n\n\nAs far as I understood, the influence of the -av setting (on objects \nnot excluded from the ambient calculation) can be dimmed by the -aw \nsetting, and as I start my renderings with an \"ouverture calculation\" \nthe computed ambient distribution should be stable enough. Am I wrong \nhere?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002859.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
