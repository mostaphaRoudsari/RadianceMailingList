I was to lazy to count the ambient \nvals to find out which number to set for -aw...\n\n\nI think one point is important to consider: setting a constant 'rest' \nambient value -av for the whole scene is a very crude thing which can be \napplied moderately to prevent certain regions appearing unnaturally \ndark, but it will be difficult to use -av as some kind of substitution \non objects otherwise excluded from ambient ray tracing..\nIt quickly looks strange an unnatural either. I remember that it even \nwas difficult to tweak things that way in POVRay, where you could (still \ncan?) set\nan ambient value for each material (resp. finish) separately..\n\n\n-cb\n\n\nPS -btw, the general problem was one of the backgrounds why I \nimplemented such hacks as the secondary ambient material in radzilla for \nobjects with complicated  patterns but still some sort of base color, or \nthe 'scene' with its possibility of setting different ambient \nparameters, etc.\nAll serve in extending the range in which the raytracing ambient calc \ncan still be used without letting rendering times explode. Because in \nthe end the ambient rays are the only really working way of producing \nnice results, all other workarounds will sooner or later reach their \nlimits..)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002863.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "July 23, 2005 at 12:53PM", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002856", "id": "radiance-general_002863"}
