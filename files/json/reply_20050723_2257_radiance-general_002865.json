{"body": "Hi Zack,\n\n\nI cannot think of any particular reason why mkillum would not work  \nwith your frit description, though the output of glaze.csh is likely  \nto be more accurate since it accounts for changes in transmission  \nw.r.t. incident angle.  A mixed material should not mix up mkillum,  \nas it just traces rays through the surface and tallies whatever comes  \nout the other side.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002865.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 23, 2005 at 10:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002854", "id": "radiance-general_002865"}
