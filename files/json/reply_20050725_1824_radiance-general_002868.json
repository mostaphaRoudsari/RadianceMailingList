It could help, anyway.\n\n\n> When it comes to image generation, if you have large scenes with\n> exterior and interior parts both of importance for display in the image,\n> and/or e.g complex stuff like trees etc, you should give the 'scene'\n> feature of radzilla a try, with it's possibility of setting a separate\n> parameter set meaning also separate caches.\n\n\nI really, really should.  I recall reading about that and thinking that\nthat was a very good option for these kinds of scenes.  (I also think that\nyour falsecolor material is just too cool.)\n\n\n> It depends of course on the type of object.
