So \nthere's no need to render multiple images and average them together? I \nhaven't seen any other mention of this new feature. Does rpict simply trace \nmultiple rays for the one pixel?\n\n\nDoes it adapt e.g points in focus only require a few rays, but points out \nof focus require more rays over the area of confusion (or whatever it's \ncalled) ?\nThat would improve the efficiency/speed over the laborious pdfblur method.\n\n\nOh, and thanks to everyone involved in the development of Radiance. It's \namazing!\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002872.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "July 27, 2005 at 06:27AM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002871", "id": "radiance-general_002872"}
