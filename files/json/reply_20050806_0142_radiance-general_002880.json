{"body": "Hi.\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, they seem to have changed Tcl/Tk in some  \nfundamental ways, and the old trad code no longer runs properly.  I  \ndon't have time right now to investigate, unfortunately.  I don't  \nhave the latest documentation on Tcl, and it's been forever since I  \ntouched any of this code.\n\n\nAnyone else have info. on the evolution of Tcl/Tk?  I wish they  \ndidn't keep changing it in incompatible ways.  Every new release  \nseems to break something, and it's been many releases since I made  \nany updates.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002880.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 06, 2005 at 01:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002879", "id": "radiance-general_002880"}
