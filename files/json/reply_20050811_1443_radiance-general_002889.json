{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nThe Radiance mesh file is a compiled format.  The easiest way to it  \nis via Wavefront/Alias .OBJ format.  If you really want to write your  \nown custom exporter directly to .rtm, you'll have to adapt what lives  \nin the src/ot directory.  I wrote the routines to be general, but I  \ndon't have guide to offer in their use.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002889.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 11, 2005 at 02:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002886", "id": "radiance-general_002889"}
