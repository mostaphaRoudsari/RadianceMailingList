But no matter, for \nyou are on vacation.  Have fun, and watch out for the bears, snakes and \nmountain lions.  =8-)\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002891.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 15, 2005 at 07:33AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002884", "id": "radiance-general_002891"}
