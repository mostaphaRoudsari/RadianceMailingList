You can't influence the available default applications\nfor files in any way other than by installing or removing applications.\n\n\nTo change a file's default application, follow these steps:\n\n\n      1. In the Workspace Manager, select the file by clicking on it.\n      2. Open the Tools menu and choose Inspector.\n      3. Choose Tools from the Inspector pop-up menu.\n      4. Select an application's icon from the center of the window.\n      5. Click Set Default.\n\n\n\n\nDon't know if this is any help on a workstation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> I trashed ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\n            ^ looks like this is in your HOME directory\n\n\nIf you only deleted your private copy Preview will use system defaults.\nYou need to change those but as far as I can tell Apple does not want\nanybody to mess with the *.plist file(s). They look like some kind of\nmime-type definition to me and would be the right place to do it.\n\n\n> BTW - Preview now opens hdr and exr files - which may be part of\n> the problem\n\n\n\"Opens hdr and exr\" ... successfully? If so, *.plist definitions have\nbeen replaced (I saw in an article that this would happen during the\nupdate) and OS X simply does not know any more that there is another\napplication for these file types.\n\n\nIf it doesn't work, I think the *.hdr extension gets missinterpreted\nas HDRI TIFF files and the default for TIFFs (Preview) is started.\nI don't know *.exr; some species of JPEG?\n\n\n\n\nOT: I was going to buy an iMac in the near future. But this short\n    trip into Apple user information did put me off a bit. Everthing\n    that looked halfway technical wasn't even mentioned on any of\n    the pages. But that's exactly the kind of information I'm looking\n    for when I have to consult manuals.\n\n\n    I know there are a few MaxOS X user out there. How are your\n    experiences with Radiance etc. on OS X? Do the Unix apps work\n    in a one-mouse-button environment?\n\n\n\n\nAny feedback is welcome,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002893.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 17, 2005 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002892", "id": "radiance-general_002893"}
