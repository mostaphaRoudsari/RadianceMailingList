{"body": "You know Greg, I am always impressed with the all that you know. You are \nlike the wise old man on top of the mountain (not that you are old).\n\n\nAny solution to my problem that would allow for me to use the \"stock\" \nRadiance without any code modifications would always be preferable. One \nconsideration that I have to make is how would the suggested technique \nimpact renderings for surfaces that pick less color than others. I tried to \nemploy the method that you previously suggested but I received an error \nmessage stating \"exposure out of range\" or something to that effect. What's \ncause of this error? Also, the technique that you decribed would work well \nif I have gray surfaces to use as a some sort of baseline. Are there any \ntechniques that exist for performing a white-balancing if I could not select \nany white surfaces within a particular view?\n\n\nFor conceptual method that I previously suggested, why would dubious results \nbe produced. I know that I have 0.0000001% (I am probably over estimating) \nof the Radiance knowledge that you have but I thought that if the overall \nreflectance of the material would be unchanged (i.e. grey(r,g,b)) but only \nthe color of the material (as seen by an ambient ray) would be changed, I \nthought the result would remain valid. Why is this not the case?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000630.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "August 17, 2005 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000628", "id": "radiance-dev_000630"}
