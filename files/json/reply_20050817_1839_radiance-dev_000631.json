{"body": "Marcus,\n\n\nYou share my admiration for the rendering master.\n\n\nYou asked if \"there any techniques that exist for performing a white-balancing if I could not select any white surfaces within a particular view?\"\n\n\nOne emprical technique to find the white point that I've considered implementing in Radiance scenes mimicks a traditional lens-and-film photographic technique.  First render the scene in low resolution with one or more \"white card\" or \"grey card\" surfaced added to your scene temporarily within the field of view, perhaps close to the center of view...or the direction you think the viewer will be gazing most frequently...or scattered throughout the scene for a good average.  Measure the white point on these temporary surface(s).  Re-render the image without the \"white cards\" and adjust with pfilt post-processing using the pre-determined whitepoint correction factors.\n\n\nThis discussion probably should be moved back to the general category because it does not really involve code development issues.\n\n\n-Chas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000631.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "August 17, 2005 at 06:39PM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000628", "id": "radiance-dev_000631"}
