{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nDid you try doing a \"Get Info\" from the Finder on a .pic file and  \ntelling it to set the default application for all files of this type  \nto Photosphere?  That's what I would try.  It's better to use  \nthe .hdr suffix, because Macintosh PICT files sometimes use .pic  \nrather than .pict as their suffix, and this confuses OS X no end.  In  \nparticular, Tiger is always running it's mdimport application on .pic  \nfiles, which takes forever to figure out that it's not actually a  \nPICT file at all but a Radiance picture.  The details of why this is  \nare hard to explain and I'm not sure I understand them myself, so  \nit's just better to use .hdr for Radiance pictures on the Mac.  I  \nshould probably change rad to use this suffix by default, but it's  \nhard to change a convention like that without breaking a lot of  \nthings other people have built on it.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Regarding Thomas' comments *.exr is the OpenEXR format, and  \n*.hdr is usually interpreted as Radiance format under OS X.  The  \nlatest mouse from Apple is 3-button, and there is generally good  \nsupport for third-party three-button mice.  The one-button mouse  \nworks using the control- and option- keys, but it's a pain that way.   \nThere is a good set of OS X books available from O'Reilly, which may  \neven be found as free PDFs online.  My favorite is \"Mac OS X for Unix  \nGeeks,\" which I found on the web somewhere.  I have the hardcopy as  \nwell, but I can't seem to locate the link at the moment -- maybe it  \nwas a fluke.\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 16, 2005 at 10:08:31 -0700, Fitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002894.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 18, 2005 at 05:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002892", "id": "radiance-general_002894"}
