{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThanks for putting together a new benchmark.  I agree that the dark  \nareas are concerning -- there may be a bug in the irradiance gradient  \ncalculation, since this is the only thing that could have such an  \neffect.  I made a number of changes to the ambient calculation to  \naccommodate the new rtcontrib program, and it may be that I broke  \nsomething along the way.  I plan to investigate this weekend to see  \nif I can find an error.  I performed a test of the ambient  \ncalculation including the irradiance gradient calc. when I made the  \nchanges, but perhaps I missed something.\n\n\nI shall get back to you regarding what I find by Monday.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000634.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 20, 2005 at 06:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000633", "id": "radiance-dev_000634"}
