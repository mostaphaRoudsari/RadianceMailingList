{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nI am sorry if I am responsible for ruining your weekend. Does the \nbenchmark scene look OK to you (exercise the proper calculations, \ninclude enough interesting stuff to be general, etc.)?\n\n\nWould it help your work if I ran more cases with older \nRadiance versions?\n\n\nIt's a bummer I missed you all at the conference. Hopefully when \nI get my degree (and a job), I'll be more able to attend.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Sat, 20 Aug 2005, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000635.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "August 21, 2005 at 12:35AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000633", "id": "radiance-dev_000635"}
