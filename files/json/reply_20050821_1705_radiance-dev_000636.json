I've run the test on 4 machines and here\nare my pictures:\n\n\nhttp://www.blastwave.org/~james/bench4.cthuga.pic\nhttp://www.blastwave.org/~james/bench4.hastur.pic\nhttp://www.blastwave.org/~james/bench4.ra.pic\nhttp://www.blastwave.org/~james/bench4.zeus.pic\n\n\nMy times are here:\nhttp://www.blastwave.org/~james/bench4.results.html\n\n\nThe best is 3454 seconds.  With 4 CPUs in the Sun Fire V440 and 2\nin the V20z I look forward to an rpiece benchmark test!\n\n\n\n\nI can't seen what is causing the black shadows.  Next I will try\nsome different settings - and rpiece for multi-CPU speed.\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "August 21, 2005 at 05:05PM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000633", "id": "radiance-dev_000636"}
