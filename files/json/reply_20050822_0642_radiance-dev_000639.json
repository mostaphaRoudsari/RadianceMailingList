{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\n> I am sorry if I am responsible for ruining your weekend.\n\n\nWell, it was a difficult weekend on many counts, and I'd rather hear  \nsooner when a new release is broken than later.\n\n\n> Does the benchmark scene look OK to you (exercise the proper  \n> calculations, include enough interesting stuff to be general, etc.)?\n\n\nI really like the fact that you incorporated many of Radiance's  \nfeatures in a single test.  It is really impossible to be  \ncomprehensive, but I appreciate your effort and I think you did an  \nadmirable job.  This is certainly a lot more challenging than any of  \nthe test scenes I usually run, which I think is why this problem  \nshowed up here rather than in my own prerelease checks.\n\n\nI may have some tweaks to suggest once I get this bug fixed.  I think  \nI've found the problem, and it wasn't the gradient calculation after  \nall but a ramification of some changes I made to accommodate Russian  \nroulette ray termination.  There were really quite a few changes to  \nthe core renderer in this release, and that's the danger of altering  \nsomething as complicated as Radiance, even for the original author....\n\n\n> Would it help your work if I ran more cases with older Radiance  \n> versions?\n\n\nNo, that's not necessary, thanks.  I resurrected 3.6 and verified  \nthat it works properly with this scene, unlike 3.7.1.\n\n\n> It's a bummer I missed you all at the conference. Hopefully when I  \n> get my degree (and a job), I'll be more able to attend.\n\n\nYes, we definitely missed having you there.  Christoph showed off  \nsome of your artistic Radiance renderings to an appreciative  \naudience, and I related how they were even more impressive in a full- \nsized print, like the one I saw at SIGGRAPH last year.\n\n\nThanks again for your help in discovering this bug.  I am running a  \ntest now with my hopeful fix, and if that's working, I'll put  \ntogether a 3.7.2 patch release tomorrow and make an announcement to  \nradiance-general.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000639.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 22, 2005 at 06:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000633", "id": "radiance-dev_000639"}
