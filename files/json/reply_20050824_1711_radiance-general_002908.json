In there, it says that for plastic with \nroughness greater than zero, where a reflected ray hits a light source, \nthat ray is not used in the calculation because that would be \ndouble-counting.  I believe this is the cause of your two distinct \nrenderings.  Perhaps someone else has some ideas as to how to get a \nrougher material that still renders a decent reflection of an area light?\n\n\nP.S.\nI had a look at your website Ian, any chance you might want to share \nthose perl scripts you have that generated your sphereflake and water \ngeometries?  I'm always interested in seeing geometry generators that \npeople have created.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002908.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 24, 2005 at 05:11PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002904", "id": "radiance-general_002908"}
