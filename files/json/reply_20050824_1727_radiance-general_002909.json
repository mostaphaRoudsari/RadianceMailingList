{"body": "(Meant to copy this to radiance-general, but I guess I missed.)\n\n\nHi Ian,\n\n\nThis behavior is the same as for Radiance 3.6.  (I just checked.)   \nYou can increase the -dj parameter to 1 and get a better result.   \nDecreasing -ds also helps somewhat, but setting -ds 0 makes it look  \nunnatural.  Increasing the roughness also alleviates the problem --  \nit's just when you're on the boundary that you'll have trouble.\n\n\nAn alternative is to use a perfectly smooth material modified by a  \nrandom texture function that simulates roughness without applying the  \nBRDF model in Radiance, like so:\n\n\n# A glossy surface\nvoid texfunc ball_roughness\n4 gloss_dx gloss_dy gloss_dz gloss.cal\n0\n3 0.01 0.01 0.01\n\n\nball_roughness plastic white3\n0\n0\n5       0.9     0.9     0.9\n         0.05    0.0\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  There are two relevant references for materials in Radiance, as  \nRob mentioned:\n\n\nSIGGRAPH '92:    http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg92/paper.html\n\n\nMaterials reference:    http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ \nmaterials.pdf\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002909.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 24, 2005 at 05:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002904", "id": "radiance-general_002909"}
