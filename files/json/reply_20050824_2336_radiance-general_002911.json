I tried your texfunc suggestion but it didn't seem to\nbe giving the effect I was after. Then I read about \"plastic\" in\nmaterials.ps:\n\n\n\tIf the surface roughness (a5) is zero or the specularity (rs) is\n\tgreater than the threshold (ts) then a ray is traced in or\n\tnear the mirror direction.\n\n\nSo I set -st to just below the specularity of the balls (0.05) and set\ntheir roughness to the value I wanted (0.03). This gave a better effect and\nseemed faster. I'm still using the texfunc modifier on a dielectric\nmaterial I need to match with the plastic (the transparent window over the\nnumbers on the billiard balls). So thanks for that.\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002911.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "August 24, 2005 at 11:36PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002904", "id": "radiance-general_002911"}
