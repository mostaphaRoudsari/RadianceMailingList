I'll look at adding more scripts\nlater. The problem is that I've written a few Perl modules for\nvector and matrix maths, and simple radiance scene reading/writing. Most of\nmy perl scripts for Radiance use these modules. I'm not sure how much of a\nhassle this will be for other people wanting to use my per scripts. Is it\neasier for people to install a few small modules of mine, or for me to\nmodify my scripts to not use these modules?\n\n\nI have my newer renderings up in my deviantART gallery along with some\nphotos:\nhttp://imroy.deviantart.com/gallery/\n\n\nHere's an older version of the billiard balls from about a month ago.
