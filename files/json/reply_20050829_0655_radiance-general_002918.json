{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nIt is normal due to gamut issues for some saturated colors to be out  \nof gamut.  Even if macbethcal issues a warning about some moderate  \ncolors being out of gamut, it may not be a serious problem, and you  \nshould judge based on your results.  If you have access to a  \ncolorimeter, you could check the RGB values against it with the  \nxyz_rgb.cal file in the ray/src/cal/cal directory using icalc or  \nrcalc as described in:\n\n\n     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n8_1b.html#COLOR_AND\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002918.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 29, 2005 at 06:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002917", "id": "radiance-general_002918"}
