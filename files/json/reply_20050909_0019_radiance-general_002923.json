{"body": "Hi Alexa!\n\n\nThanks for responding my email. I've been `playing\u00b4 with the \"pvalue\"\ncommand and I assume I obtain the x-y position of the pixel of any picture\nand the R, G, and B value of that pixle. You told me in your e-mail that\nis up to me how I interpret this RGB data. When I use the pvalue I obtain\ndata like this (for example):\n\n\n\n\n   xposition     y position      R            G              B\n\n\n      345            240       7.495e-02    7.495e-02     3.495e-02\n\n\nHowever, which type of units are this? Are there no units at all? Is this\nilluminance? Also, in most of my pixels, the R,G, and B data is the same,\ni.e, 7.495e-02 in the three (RGB). Does this means that that pixel has a\nneutral color?\n\n\nThanks for your help,\n\n\nAdriana\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002923.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Adriana Lira", "created_at": "September 09, 2005 at 12:19AM", "created_by": "Adriana_Lira", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002910", "id": "radiance-general_002923"}
