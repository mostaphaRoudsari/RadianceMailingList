{"body": "Hi Adriana,\n\n\nUnless you use the -o option of pvalue, the output is not in any  \nparticular units.  With the -o option, the reported RGB values are in  \nradiance units, i.e., watts/sr/meter^2.  However, it is probably  \nbetter for you to work directly in photometric units, which you can  \neasily do with the ra_xyze command,  like so:\n\n\n% ra_xyze rendered.pic | pvalue -o [other options]\n\n\nThe \"RGB\" values reported will then be in calibrated CIE XYZ  \ncoordinates (i.e., the Y channel will be luminance in cd/meter^2).\n\n\nThe only caveat to the above is if the pictures are rendered using  \nthe -i option of rpict, then the output will be in units of  \nirradiance (watts/meter^2) in the first case, and illuminance (lux)  \nin the case where you apply ra_xyze.\n\n\nBest of luck,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002924.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 09, 2005 at 05:22AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002910", "id": "radiance-general_002924"}
