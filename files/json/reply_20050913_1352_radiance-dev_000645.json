They would have to extend the\nsystem libraries, as far as I can tell.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-September/000645.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 13, 2005 at 01:52PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000641", "id": "radiance-dev_000645"}
