If you've \ninstalled Radiance 3.7, then you should be able to call up the scene \npreviewer with \"rvu\";  rview is no longer used (to call up the scene \npreviewer-formerly-called-rview, that is).  =8-)\n\n\nSounds like you have a clean install of Tiger and then you compiled the \nlatest Radiance source.  Assuming you saw no errors during compiling, \nand you have your PATH and RAYPATH set, then rvu should work for ya.  \n(let us know if it doesn't.)\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002928.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 13, 2005 at 09:55PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002927", "id": "radiance-general_002928"}
