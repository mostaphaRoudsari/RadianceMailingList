{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nI agree that the SPEED macro has outlived its usefulness.  I will go  \nin and make the appropriate changes to remove it from makeall and the  \nsource tree, and you can follow by removing it from your SCons  \nconfiguration.\n\n\nIt is possible within rvu to detect the machine speed using a timer  \nfunction or something of the sort, but as you say, it's probably not  \nworth the effort.  I'll just fix it at something reasonable and allow  \nthe user to redefine it if they like.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-September/000652.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 19, 2005 at 04:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000650", "id": "radiance-dev_000652"}
