Doing so, I saw some more\noutdated flags listed:\n\n\n-DALIGN is not used anymore in the current sources.\n\n\n-DBSD lost most of its former purpose, although it seems we can't\nremove it completely yet.\n\n\nI hope my shortened description of the latter is at least half correct.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-September/000653.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 19, 2005 at 01:35PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000650", "id": "radiance-dev_000653"}
