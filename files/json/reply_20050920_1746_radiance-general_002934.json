{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nThe mksource manual page is part of the official release, so you  \ndon't have to get it from HEAD.  Even if you download the binaries,  \nyou still need to grab the official release to get the current  \nversions of all the library files.  I.e., you must run \"makeall  \nlibrary\".  The manual pages sit in ray/doc/man with each release.\n\n\nI'm not always good about keeping radsite.lbl.gov updated with the  \nlatest man pages, as it's a bit of a pain to convert everything to HTML.\n\n\nTo access the online CVS system, you don't need to know anything  \nabout CVS.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002934.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 20, 2005 at 05:46PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002931", "id": "radiance-general_002934"}
