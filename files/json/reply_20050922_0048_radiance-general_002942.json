The reality is a whole lot different!  In fairness, they do \nprovide a bunch of excellent command-line tools for managing the samba \nsupport in OSX Server, it's just that they make it look like you never \nneed anything but the GUI, which is pure fantasy.  But this is a \nRadiance list so I'll stop talking about Windows and XServes...\n\n\nKirk, I hadn't seen this xGrid before; this is something they added with \n10.4 (I'm still on 10.3 and an OLD Powerbook) and it looks interesting!  \nHowever, there is a long history of file locking issues with Radiance \nand multiple machines.  The archives probably contain two or three \nthreads about this topic with respect to Linux.  I'd be really \ninterested to hear what Greg thinks of this new Apple tool, and its \npossibilities, though. \n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002942.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 22, 2005 at 12:48AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002941", "id": "radiance-general_002942"}
