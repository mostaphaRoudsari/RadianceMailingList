{"body": "Well, I really have nothing to say about xGrid as I've never tried  \nit, so let me just say it.\n\n\nI think it would be nice sometimes to have something that's  \nmonitoring system use so it would send my jobs to the right machines  \non LBNL's render farm.  Usually, I just put the jobs there manually  \nwith ssh -f and coordinate with other users, but it's a bit haphazard  \nand things don't usually finish together.  That said, I'm not sure  \nhow it works or if  it kills and restarts jobs or just stops them or  \nexpects small ones or what.  Many Radiance jobs of course take hours  \n(or even days).\n\n\nHistorically, there haven't been any problems with NFS or the lock  \nmanager under OS X (or any BSD-derivative).  It's only Linux that's  \nbeen finicky on that count.  Arguably, we should really replace the  \nNFS lock manager with something more reliable, and we've gone back  \nand forth on how to do that, but I keep hoping the problem will go  \naway.  Are people still struggling with it under Linux, or is it just  \nthe Windows version we have to start thinking about?  Last time I  \nspoke with Jack (of Visarc), I think he said it was still a problem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002943.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 22, 2005 at 01:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002941", "id": "radiance-general_002943"}
