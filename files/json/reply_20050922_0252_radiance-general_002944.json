NFS file  \nlocking is not a priority to any vendor or fropen development group I  \nam aware of, so its operability is catch as catch can.\n\n\nI don't have any time to work on this (sigh), but it really is an  \nissue that needs attention.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002944.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "September 22, 2005 at 02:52AM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002941", "id": "radiance-general_002944"}
