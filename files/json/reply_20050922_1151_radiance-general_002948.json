At the moment\nthe relevant candidates are unix and Windows systems.\n\n\nIn this situation, I think the final conclusion must be that only\nlockfiles will give us reliable and portable protection.\nAnd since Windows systems *will* become our most popular front-end\nas soon as we support them, such a lock file solution is a\nnecessary part of porting Radiance.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002948.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "September 22, 2005 at 11:51AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002941", "id": "radiance-general_002948"}
