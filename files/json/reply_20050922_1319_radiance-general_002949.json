{"body": "Thomas,\n\n\nthanks for that. I had tried it in the past but rtrace returns values of  \nzero!!\n\n\nI was confused about this, until I remember that for a uniform, or  \novercast sky (the types I am testing), the sky is a glow source, which I  \nbelieve is not tested in the direct calculation.\nwhich means I am back to the drawing board.\n\n\nI thought about subtracting the ambient values from the total illuminance  \nvalues, but this is no help either as sky glow falls in the ambient file.\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nregards\n\n\nnick\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 8\nDate: Thu, 22 Sep 2005 11:36:57 +0200\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002949.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "nick devlin", "created_at": "September 22, 2005 at 01:19PM", "created_by": "nick_devlin", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002945", "id": "radiance-general_002949"}
