For your final\nrtrace calculations you can use -ab 0 again and only\nget the \"direct\" contribution of the window illum.\n\n\nI have to admit that I don't know what causes your\nproblems and therefore this approche may fail as well.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002950.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 22, 2005 at 01:57PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002945", "id": "radiance-general_002950"}
