{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nI hadn't realized that Mark Stock had finalized his new benchmark.   \nIt's really nice.\n\n\nI gave it a try today, and also found my G5 running 10.4 to come up  \nshort in the tests.  I have a 1.8 GHz G5 PowerMac, which performed  \njust slightly bettern than a 1.6 GHz P4-M running Linux and compiled  \nwith gcc 3.3.2 -O3.  (My copy was compiled with gcc 4.0.0 -O2.)   \nWhat's even more surprising is that 1.5 GHz G4 laptop is about 13%  \nfaster than my G5, when by the clock it should be at least 17%  \nslower!  I suspect there's something really wrong with gcc 4.0 on the  \nG5, and since it's just come out, it hasn't been fixed.  Compiling  \nwith -ffast is not usually a good idea, as that's always broken  \nthings in the past, but you could try it just to see what happens.   \n(I wouldn't trust it on any paying jobs, though.)  I might try -ffast- \nmath tomorrow if I get time.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002952.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 23, 2005 at 04:12AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002941", "id": "radiance-general_002952"}
