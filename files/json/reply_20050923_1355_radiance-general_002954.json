Are you calculating paticipating media?\n\n\n> rtrace -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3  \n> -sj 1 -st .01 -ae Zero_Ref -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -av 0 0 0 - \n> lr 12 -lw .0005 -af scene2.amb mkscene2.oct < mk1.pts > existing3.dat\n\n\nI wouldn't use the same ambient file for the mkillum and\nthe rtrace process. One (mkillum) contains the outside,\nthe other only the inside of your room geometry.\n\n\nI don't think any of -sj, -st, -lr, -lw have much influence\non the calculation given your sky-only-setup.\n\n\nI hope someone with more experience with mkillum and\nrtrace can give you better hints. I'm just speculating\nhere.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002954.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 23, 2005 at 01:55PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002953", "id": "radiance-general_002954"}
