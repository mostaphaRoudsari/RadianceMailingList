You should chose\nthe right type for each lamp if you plan to mix them in one environment.\n\n\n> But actually people do feel different in space with different lamp  \n> color.

But this\nis AFAIK only a small factor if you try to calculate ie. illuminance at\nworkplaces in an office. I think it is very difficult (if not  \nimpossible)\nto decide about the effects of a chosen lamptype based on a small image\ndisplayed on a (probable uncalibrated) monitor.\n\n\nWhat you can do is estimating the difference between two designs. But I\ndon't think there are fixed criteria for this.\n\n\n> If so, what are the lamp colors I should use? and what are the  \n> parameters should I use in pfilt?\n\n\nAccording to the man page you're looking for the \"-t\" option. The\ntable used for the lookups by default is called \"lamp.tab\" in the\nbase directory of your RAYPATH.\n\n\nThe first column in this file are the patterns Radiance knows about\nby default. If you have more detailed information about your lamps\nyou can create your own lookup table and use the \"-f\" option in\npfilt to specify your table. See the comments at the top of lamp.tab.\n\n\nAn example would be:\n\n\n     pfilt -t \"warm white\" neutral.pic > warm.pic\n\n\nIf you use a type that's not listed in the table pfilt will tell\nyou about it.\n\n\nI think you have to start with a white balanced image or the results\nwill be usefull. I tried it on my benchmark pics and the \"warm\" filtered\nimage turned out blue ...\n\n\nHTH,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002959.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 26, 2005 at 06:27PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002958", "id": "radiance-general_002959"}
