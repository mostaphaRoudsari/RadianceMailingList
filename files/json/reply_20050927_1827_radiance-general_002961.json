{"body": "I'm not a mathmatical type, so I can't advise you on a cal file, though I'm\nsure there's a way.\n\n\nBut you could use a 2 color pic file and project it on sideways.. say 7/8 is\nred and 1/8 is white.  That should give you a white circle on a red ball.\nGive the pic enough resolution so the color boundary is crisp.\n You'll have to make it an octree and use it as an instance if you want to\nmove it randomly.\n\n\nHTH \nRob F\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002961.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Fitzsimmons", "created_at": "September 27, 2005 at 06:27PM", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002960", "id": "radiance-general_002961"}
