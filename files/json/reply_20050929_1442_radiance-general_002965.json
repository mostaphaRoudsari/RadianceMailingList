{"body": "Dear Niloofar,\n\n\nthere are two aspects, you should take into consideration:\n1. Direct glare from the facade (-> discomfort glare). This aspect could \nbe considered by using the daylight glare probability DGP. The DGP does \nnot take into account reflection glare on computer screens, only the \ndiscomfort glare caused by the facade. Of course, it is derived from \nuser assessments doing a visual task on VDUs. But due to the design of \nthe experiments, the results of the DGP should be more general. \nTherefore I would say it can be used also in other environments (e.g. \nclassrooms).\n2. Contrast reduction on the blackboard by having specular reflections \nand veiling luminance. For this aspect, a detailed modeling of the \nreflection properties of a blackboard is necessary first. Then, a \nvisibility and contrast study should be done on hourly basis or at least \nfor typical daily profiles.\n\n\nEvalglare will be public soon (next weeks, as soon as our new Web site \nis ready) - in the meanwhile I send it directly to you in an extra email.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002965.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "September 29, 2005 at 02:42PM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002930", "id": "radiance-general_002965"}
