{"body": "Hey Rob,\n\n\nI follow-up on that. I probably could have used a more robust cup of jo \nthis morning as I repeated the word in every darn sentence. Ack!\n\n\nIn general, I think that if you learn one of these things then entry \ninto the next becomes easier. I started out with csh, sed and awk, ages \nago, and while it worked it is ugly, I had to learn how to use three \ndifferent tools (heck, I think that you can by an O'Reilly book for each \nof these). Nevertheless, shell scripting is definitely the most quick \nand dirty way to get things done.\n\n\nRob is correct. A hugely confusing element to Perl (for which you can \nbuy a lot more than 3 O'Reilly books) is the fact that there are lots \nand lots of way to do things, this can be both a pro and a con. Though I \nthink in general looking at other peoples code is always painful unless \nit is extremely well documented. I cannot really speak for Python, \nthough I think it is probably a bit \"cleaner\" than Perl.\n\n\nI think the crux of it all though is having an actual problem that you \nare trying to solve and access to some good books with examples. This is \nthe best way to learn that I have found.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002971.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 29, 2005 at 08:05PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002966", "id": "radiance-general_002971"}
