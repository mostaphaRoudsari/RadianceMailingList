{"body": "I like Blender, because it is open and it is Python accessible.  This  \nwas partially why I started to learn Python.  Poser, a 3D figure  \nanimation package also has a Python API.  It turns out that several  \nother things I am interested in are accessible through Python,  \nincluding ODE (the open dynamics engine for physical simulation, etc).\n\n\nTo answer your question, Blender has a nice set of modeling and  \nrendering tools - I haven;t used it in a while, but am getting back  \ninto it because of the natural potential for tying it to RADIANCE  \nobject generation (not as slick as b/rad or some of the exporters,  \nthough).\n\n\nSo much to do.\n\n\nI was considering bash as the next shell to learn, as i too have  \ndissected some of Greg's shell programs and have begun to understand  \nthe significance of scripting and programming RADIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
