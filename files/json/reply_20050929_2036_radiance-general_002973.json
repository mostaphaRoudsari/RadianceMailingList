{"body": "Another vote for Python here - you could certainly do what I've done\nhere in a shell script, but I chose to use (and learn) Python. If you\nstick with Python you can eventually add a GUI relatively easily to your\nscripts using Glade and pyGTK. \n\n\nI used Python to automate the creation of illuminance calculation grids.\nThis is a budget example, but this snippet is what I've done in the past\nto calculate illuminance by repeated calls to rtrace. I used the\nos.popen() call in Python to call rtrace as I would on the command line.\nMy apologies if this example is too trivial, but here it is anyways, in\ncase you find it useful: \n\n\nfor i in range(len(Grid1.CalcPoints)):\n\t    #call to rtrace returns 3 values, each representing the\nirradiance for r,g,b.\n\t    #first prepare the string representation of the point:\n\t    point_str = \"\\'\" + str(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].x) + \" \" +\nstr(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].y) + \\\n\t\t\t  \" \" + str(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].z) + \"  \" +\nstr(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].xdir) + \\\n\t\t\t  \" \" + str(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].ydir) + \" \" +\nstr(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].zdir) + \"\\'\"\n\t    rtrace_str = \"echo \" + point_str + \" | rtrace -I -ab \" +\nstr(options.ab) + rad_opts + \" -h -w \" + options.octfile\n\t    print rtrace_str\n\t    fd = os.popen( rtrace_str, 'r', -1 )\n\n\n\t    buffer = fd.readline()\n\t    rgb_irrad = buffer.split()\n\t    illuminance = 179*(float(rgb_irrad[0])*0.265 +\nfloat(rgb_irrad[1])*0.670 + float(rgb_irrad[2])*0.065)\n\t    Grid1.CalcPoints[i].illuminance = illuminance\n\t    print \"( \" + str(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].x) + \", \" +\nstr(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].y) + \", \" + \\\n\t\t  str(Grid1.CalcPoints[i].z) + \" ): \" + str(illuminance)\n+ \" lux\" \n\n\nIt's ugly but seems to work OK.  This snippet is part of a larger script\nthat takes in some user options, grid size, and prints out illuminance\nvalues.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMark Shewfelt\nElectrical Engineering Intern\nEnermodal Engineering Ltd.\nph: 519 743 8777 x232\nfx: 519 743-8778\nmshewfelt at enermodal.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002973.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Shewfelt", "created_at": "September 29, 2005 at 08:36PM", "created_by": "Mark_Shewfelt", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002966", "id": "radiance-general_002973"}
