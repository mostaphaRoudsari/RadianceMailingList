{"body": "While Python and other more powerful languages than shell scripting can\noffer additional benefits such as GUIs and the like, much of the same sort\nof thing can easily be accomplished in bash, csh, or a number of other\nshells. For instance, I use a similar script to the one described below\nexcept it is written as a bash (my shell of choice) script. You can\naccomplish the same thing both ways, but if you're already familiar with\ntcsh and don't want to have to learn a whole new language, shell scripting\nis very easy to pick up and use in conjunction with Radiance. That being\nsaid, there are many things that are either difficult or impossible to do\nwith shell scripts that higher level languages allow, so if you have the\ntime I would definitely recommend picking up a second or third language such\nas Python or Perl.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002974.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "J.
