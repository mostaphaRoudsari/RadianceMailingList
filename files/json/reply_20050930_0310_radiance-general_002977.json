{"body": "There is also two different commercail tools that let you run Radiance \nunder Windows, and might be better if you're just getting into Radiance \nbut don't want to have to learn a Unix command line: Rayfront, a \nstand-alone lighting design package, and there's also a plug-in for 3D \nStudio Max that lets 3D Studio Max use Radiance just like any other \nrendering engine available to Max (ala Mental Ray).\n\n\nHowever, with that said, I simply went with Cygwin. Your issues with \ncrashing & resuming and such, well, you're right that Cygwin doesn't \nhave the ability to resume, but Radiance actually does. If you crash or \nthe system goes down, you just restart the job and Radiance picks up \nwhere it left off. One of the nicer things about it.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002977.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "September 30, 2005 at 03:10AM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002963", "id": "radiance-general_002977"}
