{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nYou are correct that the real arguments cannot be expressions.  The  \ndefinition of a diffuse component is one that does not change with  \nangle, so there should be no need to define these parameters as  \nvariables.  If you have some varying portion to your BRDF, then put  \nthis in the directional-diffuse component, which are string arguments  \n7-9 for BRTDfunc.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  On my mailer, the first message came through better than the  \nsecond.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002983.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 30, 2005 at 06:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002980", "id": "radiance-general_002983"}
