{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for your response. So, what I tried does not work with BRTDfunc \nat all... I used more or less the same cal file in combination with \ncolorfunc and brightfunc, which works  fine for the moment.\nJust for understanding more of it: according to the documentation args \n7-9 are functions. Are there any examples of how to use a function in \nBRTDfunc ?\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/002985.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "October 01, 2005 at 01:16AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002980", "id": "radiance-general_002985"}
