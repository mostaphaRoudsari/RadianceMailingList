{"body": "Hi Jeppe,\n\n\nCheck out \"He.cal\" in the ray/lib directory of the standard  \ndistribution.  It's a bit complicated, but you'll probably end up  \nwith something similar if you're building a parametric BRDF model.\n\n\nYou should be aware that Radiance doesn't do all it should with BRDF  \nmaterials, in that the indirect component is approximated as  \ndiffuse.  Only highlights use the BRDF, not secondary rays, for  \nefficiency.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/002989.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 05, 2005 at 07:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002988", "id": "radiance-general_002989"}
