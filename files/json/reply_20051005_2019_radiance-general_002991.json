{"body": "Sorry, but this is one of those design decisions that is built into  \nthe code.  Of course, the C source is all there if you want to modify  \nit, but there's quite a lot to figure out along the way, like how to  \nsample the hemisphere for an arbitrary BRDF.  This is a difficult  \nproblem, and one that has been tackled by various people over the  \nyears, so there are some precedents.\n\n\nIf I were to do it myself, I would investigate something like a  \nmedian cut algorithm or kd-tree on the hemisphere, which would  \nrequire presampling the BRDF or performing lazy evaluation.  For  \nsomething like the He-Torrance model, you would likely spend hours  \nand hours (perhaps days) just computing the BRDF before you ended up  \ntracing your first ray.  This is why Radiance doesn't make the attempt.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/002991.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 05, 2005 at 08:19PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002988", "id": "radiance-general_002991"}
