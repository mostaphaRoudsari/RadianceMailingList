{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nMea culpa.  It seems I introduced a bug in the total command when I  \nadded the ability to read binary data back in June, and didn't notice  \nit because it only happens when the -p and -m options are combined,  \nas they are in compamb.\n\n\nDownload and compile the latest total.c from CVS by following the  \nlink below:\n\n\n     http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ \nray/src/cal/total.c?rev=1.5&content-type=text/plain\n\n\nPut it in the ray/src/cal directory and rerun \"rmake install\" there.\n\n\nSorry about that, but thanks very much for finding this bug.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/002996.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 08, 2005 at 06:21AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002995", "id": "radiance-general_002996"}
