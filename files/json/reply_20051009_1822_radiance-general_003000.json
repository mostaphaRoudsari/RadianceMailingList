{"body": "Hello again.\n\n\nI have to ask this in a more general way. I have used mkillum to add \nsome illum planes in front of the windows of my scene, and sealed the \nsides using zero-radiance illums. I am rendering the illums with -s=8 \n-d=8, and in total there are about 400 calculated illums (and many more \nzero-radiance illums).\n\n\nNow, I am experiencing even slower calculation with rpict. I guess it \nis because of all the illum sources. I think that I can reduce the -ab \nbounces because of the illum useage, which will give faster rendering \ntimes. But still I wonder if there is some kind of a magic limit of the \nnumber of illums to use. I mean, is there a number of illums where \nrendering speed decreases instead of increasing by the useage of the \nmkillum-tool ?\n\n\nAre there any other ambient-parameters that I can change now that I \nhave illums? I am thinking of ad, ar, aa, as the light environment is \nquite different now?\n\n\nYou see, I am still quite a beginner in this mkillum stuff, and a bit \nworried. Thanks for any help and hints, CU\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003000.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
