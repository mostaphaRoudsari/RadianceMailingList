{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nPutting illum surfaces inside of your windows rather than using a  \nseparate surface for each window pane is one way to reduce  \ncalculation times if your mullions are not particularly large or  \nprominent.\n\n\nAll else being equal, you can reduce -ab by 1 and decrease -ad and - \nas (by a factor of 2 or so) and even increase -aa by 50% and still  \nget similar results.  However, you may also have to set -dj .8 and - \nps 1, which will undermine the calculation speeds a bit.  Overall,  \nillum's pay off most when you have smaller windows or skylights and/ \nor complex goings on outside.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003001.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 09, 2005 at 06:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002998", "id": "radiance-general_003001"}
