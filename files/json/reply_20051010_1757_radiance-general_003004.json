{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nok, I found the problem, not the solution. I have a cad model for the \nfaces, and they are all polygons. Now, if I use obj and obj2rad, they \nare all triangulated. And if I use dxf and dxf2rad, only 3- or 4-sided \npolygons are possible. One way would be to use polylines (closed) with \ndxf2rad, but somehow, this gives me just an empty rad file. At the \nmoment I have really no idea how to get my illum surfaces (=polygons) \nfrom cad to radiance...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003004.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
