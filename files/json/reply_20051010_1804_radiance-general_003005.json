Also make sure that they are really closed\nwith the \"closed flag\". It is not enough to just place the last\nvertex on top of the first one.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003005.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "October 10, 2005 at 06:04PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002998", "id": "radiance-general_003005"}
