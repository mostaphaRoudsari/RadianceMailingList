I read again the obj2rad manpage, and \nfound out that the obj geometry is triangulated ONLY if not planar OR \nif there is surface normal information included in the file. So I \nswitched off the normals - et voil\u00e0, I got the polygons!\n\n\nI have just started the next run of mkillum now, which is much more \npromising, cause there is really nothing worse to feed to mkillum than \ntriangulated faces. I hope the normals will still be right, as the \nfaces were editet correctly, but you never know what cad / modelling \nsoftware is doing to your scene...\n\n\nSo thank You, and sorry for some of my questions which were a bit \nmisleading cause the problem was completely different than I had \nguessed, but I am just getting crazy with that mkillum step in my scene \nat the moment ;-)\n\n\nCU, greetings to Munich, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003006.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
