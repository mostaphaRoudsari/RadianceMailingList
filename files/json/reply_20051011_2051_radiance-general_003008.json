But if you have polygonal surfaces \n(which means that there may be more than 4 vertices), 3dfaces cannot \nrepresent these any more without first splitting them to triangular or \nquadrangular faces, if I understood the dxf-faces right. Am I wrong \nhere? And triangular faces are the worst to use for mkillum.\n\n\nClosed polylines might work, but as you can see from Schorsch's mail, \nthere is again a difference between 2d and 3d polylines. And here, if \nyou are not working with Autocad, it is really difficult to find out \nwhat kind of polylines are written to your dxf...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003008.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
