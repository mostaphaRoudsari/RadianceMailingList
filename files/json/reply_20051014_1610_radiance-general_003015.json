{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe case you give below will start 2 processes on localhost from the \ndirectory ~/example for the user name lars. On a normal system (eg non \nopenmosix) this would start rpict processes with the -PP option enabled \nto share memory (as indicated in the man page). However in your case \nthis is a problem with openmosix. Not sure what a good solution is. You \ncould try breaking your animation down into a set of separate sequences \nand have sepearte ranimate files for each. Then you might be able to use \nthe \"runon\" command from openmosix. to specify where (what node number \nin the cluster) each job should be started. I cannot remember though if \nrunon locks the processes to the indicated node in the cluster or still \nallows for migration from the node. You may need to figure out how to \nforce the processes not to migrate.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nLars O.
