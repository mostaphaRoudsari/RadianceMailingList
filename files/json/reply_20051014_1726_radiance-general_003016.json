{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nthank you for the reply. I will try to use more than one host-line per \nmachine, I guess that ranimate won't catch that and will start one \nprocess per host-line, without giving -PP to rpiece. So the processes \nwill be started via ssh on the localhost. Hope this works... I am \ndesperatly needing a way to speed up rendering times at the moment... \n;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003016.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
