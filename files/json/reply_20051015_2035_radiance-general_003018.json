{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nIt may just be that you need to use the -PP option rather than -P,  \nwhich doesn't do parallel processing.  (The -P \"persist mode\" is a  \nrelatively little-used option that permits serial execution without  \nthe associated startup costs -- it's more valuable for rtrace than  \nrpict.)\n\n\nAlso, each of your rpict -PP commands should be handed the same set  \nof views on the standard input.  Otherwise, nothing will happen.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003018.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 15, 2005 at 08:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003017", "id": "radiance-general_003018"}
