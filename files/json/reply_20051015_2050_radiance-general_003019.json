I \nforgot to pass the view file, as I read that command line parameters \ndon't have to be passed. Of course, I don't pass views as command line \nparameters, but from stdin, so I have to feed the view file for each \nprocess, right? ;-)\n\n\nI think that if I start more than one -P process, they WILL run \nparallel (even if they use much more memory than the shared -PP \nprocesses), right?\n\n\nThank You, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
