{"body": "There's no sense in using the -P option if you're after parallel  \nruns, because -P insists on serial runs -- it's a mechanism to  \nconnect sequential invocations to the same process.  It's exactly the  \nopposite of what you need.  Just use multiple rpicts if OpenMosix  \ndoesn't support shared memory.  It will be the same as using -PP in  \nthat case, since there's nothing about the -PP option that *requires*  \nshared memory.  It just ends up using it if it's available.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003020.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 16, 2005 at 04:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003017", "id": "radiance-general_003020"}
