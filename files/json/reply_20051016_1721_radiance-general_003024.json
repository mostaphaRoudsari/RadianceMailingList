{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYou don't need the -P or -PP option to synchronize rpict using -o.   \nIf you read the man page carefully, you'll see that the coordination  \nhappens simply because rpict -S skips -o outputs that are already  \nstarted.  This is the same way -PP works, so the two functions are  \northogonal.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  You could use ranimate for this purpose, but there's no real  \nadvantage, and you would have to turn frame interpolation off.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003024.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 16, 2005 at 05:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003017", "id": "radiance-general_003024"}
