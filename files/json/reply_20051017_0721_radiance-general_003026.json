{"body": "Hi Terry,\n\n\nThe reason for the change is because the glass primitive takes into  \naccount internal reflections, which use the transmission value to  \ncompute transmittance as a function of angle.  In contrast, the illum  \nprimitive doesn't account for these, which are reintroduced using the  \nwinxmit.cal pattern.  This pattern is normalized to 100%  \ntransmittance, and must have normal transmittance as a multiplier on  \nthe material.\n\n\nI don't know how to make it clearer than that -- I realize it's a bit  \nconfused, but it is correct.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003026.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 17, 2005 at 07:21AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003025", "id": "radiance-general_003026"}
