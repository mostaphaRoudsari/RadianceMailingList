{"body": "Hello Greg,\n\n\n>The reason for the change is because the glass primitive takes into  \n>account internal reflections, which use the transmission value to  \n>compute transmittance as a function of angle.  In contrast, the illum  \n>primitive doesn't account for these, which are reintroduced using the  \n>winxmit.cal pattern.  This pattern is normalized to 100%  \n>transmittance, and must have normal transmittance as a multiplier on  \n>the material.\n\n\n>I don't know how to make it clearer than that -- I realize it's a bit  \n>confused, but it is correct.\n\n\nThe missing link in the documentation! Quite clear!\n\n\nMany thanks.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003027.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance McMinn", "created_at": "October 17, 2005 at 08:26AM", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003025", "id": "radiance-general_003027"}
