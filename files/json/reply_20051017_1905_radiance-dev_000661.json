{"body": "Hello Mayur,\n\n\nThank you for your generous offer of help.  In Radiance, what we  \nmostly need assistance with at this point is porting work to the  \nWindows platform.  Specifically, we need to replace some of the Unix  \nsystem facilities, such as subprocesses, interprocess communication,  \nand file locking, and make these work under Windows via system- \nindependent interfaces.  In addition, we have a few programs that  \nproduce graphical output using OpenGL or X11, which we need to get  \nported to Windows.\n\n\nHere is a partial list of separable tasks we need to complete, for  \nwhich we have scarce resources (quoting Georg Mischler):\n\n\n  lock files\n    Very easy to split as a seperate subproject with a clearly\n    defined and simple API. High priority in my opinion.\n\n\n  Persistence for rtrace and rpict\n    Introduce an abstract level in rt/persist.c, so that fork/exec\n    can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent on Windows.\n\n\n  Parallel rendering\n    Introduce an abstract layer in rt/raypcalls.c and rt/r[pt]main.c,\n    so that fork/exec can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent\n    on Windows.\n    Among other things, this would make it possible to port ranimove.\n\n\n    Introduce an abstract layer for next_process() in rad.c, so that\n    fork/exec can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent on Windows.\n\n\n    Introduce an abstract layer for putpiece() in rpiece.c, so that\n    fork/exec can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent on Windows.\n\n\nFor the graphics porting, we have three programs, the third of which  \nwould be significantly more challenging:\n\n\nrvu driver\n     Need to be able to write out 24-bit colored rectangles and take  \ntextual user input.\n\n\nximage\n     Need to port X11 picture display program to Windows\n\n\nrholo\n     Need to write OpenGL display driver for interactive holodeck system\n\n\nIf any of these seem interesting or doable to you, let us know and we  \ncan fill you in with more details and provide you with a starting  \npoint in the source tree.\n\n\nIf you are principally interested in lighting simulation and graphics  \nalgorithms, as opposed to the more systems-related work we have  \nslated, you are welcome to take the source code and experiment with it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-October/000661.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 17, 2005 at 07:05PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000660", "id": "radiance-dev_000661"}
