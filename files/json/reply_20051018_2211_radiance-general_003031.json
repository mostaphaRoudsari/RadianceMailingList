{"body": "I am not much help at the moment, as I have just swapped over my graphics\ncard in anticipation of a new computer, so 'faint' colours are all white\non my screen.\n\n\nPlease give\nhttp://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/student/resources/radiance/colourcalc.shtml\na try. It's been some time since I wrote it, but the range of Y that I\nused (references are within the JS source code) is 0..100, which seemed to\nbe most commonly used, not 0..1. I realise that Y should only change the\nbrightness, not the hue, but anyhow--so far it has worked for me... kinda\nrightish...\n\n\nHaving said that, don't knock the easyrgb crowd. All formulae are\npublished on their site. Well done.\n> http://www.easyrgb.com/calculator.php\n\n\nJust my 2 pence.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003031.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "October 18, 2005 at 10:11PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003029", "id": "radiance-general_003031"}
