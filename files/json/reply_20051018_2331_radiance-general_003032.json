{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nThe formula you pulled out of the archive, which was a reply by  \nRaphael, is correct.  I don't know why you expect a color with an  \n(x,y) of (.3304,.3582) to be more red than green, since (.3333,.3333)  \nis neutral and you have slightly decreased red and increased green.   \nA slight green is what I would expect to see, not a slight yellow.\n\n\nI'm not sure where the slight difference between the color  you  \nobtain with the Radiance matrix and the one you obtained from the  \ntutorial arose, but the first matrix you have below is the correct one.\n\n\nThere are subtle issues having to do with white point as well, which  \nyou may not be taking into account.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003032.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 18, 2005 at 11:31PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003029", "id": "radiance-general_003032"}
