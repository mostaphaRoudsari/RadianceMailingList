{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nYou must ensure that there are no lighting or gain changes between  \nthe scanning or capture of the Macbeth chart and the swatches,  \notherwise you will have an absolute calibration error.  If you are  \nusing a flatbed scanner, set the exposure to manual and fix it at a  \nsingle value.  If you are using a camera, set it on manual mode and  \nuse a constant illumination with the chart in the same position as  \nthe swatches in your two photographs.  I often shoot outdoors to  \nassure even illumination.\n\n\nThis is the most likely culprit.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003033.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 18, 2005 at 11:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003030", "id": "radiance-general_003033"}
