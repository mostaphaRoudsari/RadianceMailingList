{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThis is one of those nasty internal errors you should never see,  \nbecause it means something is wrong with the code.  I spent a couple  \nhours just now pouring over it, and I can't figure out how or why it  \nmight be happening.  I think I need you to send me your scene to try  \nto debug this.\n\n\nI assume your octree is up-to-date with respect to your scene files,  \nright?  I don't see how that could cause this error, but just wanted  \nto be sure.\n\n\nYou might try upgrading to 3.7 just to check that it's not something  \nI fixed before without knowing it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003035.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 19, 2005 at 06:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003034", "id": "radiance-general_003035"}
