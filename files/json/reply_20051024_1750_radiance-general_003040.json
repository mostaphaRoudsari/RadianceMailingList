{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThe -oo option and -od option report the origin and normalized ray  \ndirection (respectively), but only with -I-.  When you set -I+, then  \nrtrace fudges the calculation by creating a ray 1 unit above an  \nimaginary Lambertian surface, and this is why the origin (and  \ndirection if you check) do not match your input.  Instead, the  \nintersection point (-op) and surface normal (-on or -oN) will match  \nthe origin and direction given.\n\n\nThis is not a new bug in 3.7, but something that's been there since I  \nenabled reports of parameters besides ray value with -I+ in the 2.3  \nrelease.  Perhaps you weren't using the -I+ setting in your previous  \nscripts.\n\n\nI think I could fix this behavior if it's really screwing you up.  I  \nagree that it's confusing to have the -oo and -od options change  \ntheir apparent reporting depending on the -I setting, but they are  \nreporting the values on the ray actually traced.  You don't start out  \nat the surface and direct the ray straight up in order to compute  \nirradiance.  That wouldn't work.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003040.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 24, 2005 at 05:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003039", "id": "radiance-general_003040"}
