{"body": "> Let me repeat this:\n> - rtrace -defaults: -i- (so illuminance is off, hence luminance)\n\n\nAlso defaults to -I-.

Two -I options would turn it off again.\n\n\n> - with i/I set to on, the origin should be set to the input, no?\n\n\nWIth -i the origin will match the input, as the rays are traced from  \nthere.  With -I, the origin will not match the input, as I said.\n\n\n> I think I understand the subtlety of measuring luminance vs.  \n> illuminance,\n> so the added '1' and the inversed direction doesn't worry me.

Think of - \nI as superseding the -i setting.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 24, 2005 at 07:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003039", "id": "radiance-general_003043"}
