{"body": "Francesco,\n\n\nI too was very happy to see some windows binaries!  It would certainly make life easier to have these, working in a Windows environment.\n\n\nHave you been able to get mkillum to run correctly?  I'm having some PATH issues and it seems the only way for mkillum to work properly is to go in and manually add the full path to the dat files referenced in mkillum's output rad file.  This is very strange.  Has anyone tried to use mkillum with the windows binaries?  Any problems?\n\n\nI appreciate any feedback.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003044.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "October 28, 2005 at 12:43AM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002997", "id": "radiance-general_003044"}
