{"body": "Hi Tom,\n\n\nThanks for the links.  If you think the current license is in some  \nway inadequate, I suggest you write to Steve Selkowitz at LBNL  \ndirectly, as I don't understand licenses or care about them much.   \nThe current license came from the patent office at LBNL, and I had  \nnothing to do with it other than to stuff it into the distribution.   \nI know the general purpose is to provide for the free use of the  \nsoftware for any purpose, and to protect LBNL and the UC Regents from  \nany liability.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-October/000669.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 30, 2005 at 06:03AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000662", "id": "radiance-dev_000669"}
