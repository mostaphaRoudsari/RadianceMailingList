{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nI wish I could offer you some words of encouragement, because I  \nappreciate the difficulty you face applying rtcontrib to daylight  \ncoefficients.  The truth is, you really need some scripts to help out  \nwith the task, and I haven't yet had a chance to write a general set  \nof scripts or an executive program for DC analysis.  I am working on  \nthis project currently, as a matter of fact.\n\n\nAll I have at this point is a few test scripts I assembled for a  \ndaylight simulation study, and I can make these available for you if  \nyou need an early start on this.  If you can wait a few weeks, I will  \nhave something much better, I hope.\n\n\nJust to answer your question, adding together the rtcontrib outputs  \ndirectly gives you the result for a uniform sky.  To get a particular  \nsky, you must multiply each image by the average radiance of the  \ncorresponding sky patch.  To compute this, a simple rtrace  \ncalculation using the desired sky model and a set of randomly  \ndistributed rays over the hemisphere will do the trick.  Such a set  \nof rays is given in the file \"ray/lib/tregsamp.dat\", where there are  \n64 rays per sky patch.  The command to compute pcomb arguments from  \nthis file is:\n\n\nrtrace -h skymodel.oct < tregsamp.dat \\\n         | total -64 -m \\\n         | rcalc -o '-s ${$2} c_${recno-1}.pic'\n\n\nI realize this is just a clue, but if you wait a few weeks, hopefully  \nI can provide a complete solution.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003047.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2005 at 03:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003046", "id": "radiance-general_003047"}
