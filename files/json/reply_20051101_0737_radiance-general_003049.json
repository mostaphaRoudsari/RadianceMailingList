{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nI am sending you the scripts in a separate message, as I don't really  \nwant to share these with the whole mailing list.  My intention is to  \nreplace them with something more general and robust in the coming  \nweeks, and I don't want to create a lot of confusion beforehand.\n\n\nThe noise you are seeing can be reduced with different parameter  \nsettings or high resolution sampling, but it will never go away.   \nRtcontrib, unlike rtrace and the other Radiance tools, produces an  \nunbiased Monte Carlo sampling, which shows variance (noise) which is  \nan honest estimate of the uncertainty at each pixel.  You can try  \nrunning it through a noise reduction filter if you find it offensive,  \nbut we can't use the irradiance interpolation algorithm with rtcontrib.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003049.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 01, 2005 at 07:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_003049"}
