{"body": "Hi Jack,\nThank you for the fast answer.\n I just have few comments:\n\n\n>> PROCEDURE1\n>> Problem:\n>> *Glass reflectance is calculated implicitly, and values from Optic5\n>> database don't have any effect.\n>> This can be solved by using trans.cal functional file, and changing index\n>> of refraction to obtain appropriate reflectance.\n\n\n> As I read \"trans.cal\" this is for converting from transmittance to\n> transmissivity, the latter value is used for the radiance \"glass\" material\n> type.

My idea was to use a trick I've found in\nsome Greg's mail:\nTo define glass with transmittance .85 and reflectance 0.5, run \"calc\ntrans2.cal\" in the ray/src/cal/cal directory and enter:\n       Tn = 0.85\n       Rn = 0.05\nTyping in \"n\" and \"tn\" will give you these results:\n       n\n       $1=1.39992615\n       tn\n       $2=0.894736842\n\n\n> Note though, quoting Greg from the file, that trans.cal is for an\n> \"infinite series solution for an uncoated pane of glass.\" This is a\n> solution for a single pane only.

Glaze script doesn't report error, but new material isn't added to\nlist of available surfaces!? Do you have an idea why it is happening?\n\n\nThanks again,\nmarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003053.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Cvetkovic", "created_at": "November 02, 2005 at 07:01PM", "created_by": "Marija_Cvetkovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003051", "id": "radiance-general_003053"}
