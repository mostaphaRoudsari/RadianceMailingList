Do you have an idea why it is happening?\n\n\nMake sure you have a final end-of-line character in your file.  A lot  \nof editors don't bother with it, but most Unix utiliities require a  \nfinal EOL (linefeed).  I checked the script, and I think this is the  \nmost likely problem.\n\n\nRegarding more than two layers, the math gets exponentially more  \ncomplicated with each layer, so I'm not likely to  add capability in  \nthis area any time soon....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003055.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 02, 2005 at 07:33PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003051", "id": "radiance-general_003055"}
