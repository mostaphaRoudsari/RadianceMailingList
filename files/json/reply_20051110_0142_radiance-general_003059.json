{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThis is one of those errors that's never supposed to happen, no  \nmatter what input you give to Radiance or how you set the parameters,  \nand indicates either a bug in the code or corruption on its input  \n(e.g., a messed up octree).  I don't know what is causing the problem  \nin your case, but you could try sending me your scene (to me not to  \nthe group) and I can have a look.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003059.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 10, 2005 at 01:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003058", "id": "radiance-general_003059"}
