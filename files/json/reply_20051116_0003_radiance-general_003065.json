{"body": "Photoshop does indeed offer this capability.  Unfortunately, it  \ndoesn't do any absolute calibration on the images, and the camera  \nresponse it derives is terribly inaccurate.  You are much better off  \nwith HDRshop from <www.debevec.org>.  The one advantage is that  \nPhotoshop will align the images if you're starting from hand-held  \nexposures.  It doesn't work quite as well or nearly as quickly as  \nPhotosphere or hdrgen, but at least it's available for Windows.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 16, 2005 at 12:03AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003064", "id": "radiance-general_003065"}
