I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find \nfunction file \"rayinit.cal.\" I searched through the mailing list \narchives and found a few items on the placement of library files and \nsetting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I \nhave my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make \nsure \nthat rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables \nare \nexporting properly as I can see the paths when I \"echo $PATH\" and \n\"echo \n$RAYPATH,\" however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for \nsome \nreason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave \nMaino\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general \nmailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-\nonline.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003067.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pillo Pillo", "created_at": "November 17, 2005 at 10:13PM", "created_by": "Pillo_Pillo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003066", "id": "radiance-general_003067"}
