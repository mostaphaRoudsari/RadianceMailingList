{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nActually, -ar 0 just turns off the limit to value spacing, so you'll  \nbasically get one interreflection calculation per pixel on inside  \ncorners.  Interpolation still takes place when surfaces are farther  \napart.  To turn off interpolation altogether, you'd have to set -aa  \n0, which is another (somewhat more drastic) approach to the scaling  \nproblem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003071.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 19, 2005 at 01:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003068", "id": "radiance-general_003071"}
