{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI have downloaded some nice (and very complex)  furniture-geometry from \nthe internet that I like to render in Radiance, but when I create an \noctree I get the \"set overflow in addobject\" error. The -r -and -n \noption do not help.\n\n\nIs there a way to just skip the 'wrong' geometry (that is causing the \nerror) in oconv ?\nAny other options (instead of modelling the furniture myself) ?\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003076.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "November 21, 2005 at 05:18PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003077", "id": "radiance-general_003076"}
