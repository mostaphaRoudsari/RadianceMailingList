{"body": "Hey all,\n\n\nThere are a couple of things here. You should probably try to take a \nlook at the geometry and see if there is any extra/duplicate geomery. \nDoubled up geomery can oftern be a cause for a set overflow like this. \nYou should be able to control a lot with -r.\n\n\nGuilio's suggestion is also an excellent one. I have found that I can \ndeal with much more complex geometry sets with obj2mesh. And it looks \nlike the file size of the rtm is typically smaller than a corresponding \noct file.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n\n\n> atelier iebele abel wrote:\n>\n>> Hi,\n>>\n>> I have downloaded some nice (and very complex)  furniture-geometry \n>> from the internet that I like to render in Radiance, but when I \n>> create an octree I get the \"set overflow in addobject\" error.
