{"body": "Hi Nicholas,\n\n\nThere are many ways to run Radiance with multiple processors\nand multiple machines. Some programs like rad and rholo have\nsupport for multiple processors (-N option), rpiece can be used\nto split a picture into tiles and have them rendered by different\nprocessors or computers over a network (for instance sharing\nthe scene files with nfs).\n\n\nPersonally, I like to use openmosix with Radiance, and you can\nread about my experience in a previous message to this mailing list:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001992.html\n\n\n__\nFrancesco\npisuke at blueyonder.co.uk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003081.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "November 22, 2005 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003080", "id": "radiance-general_003081"}
