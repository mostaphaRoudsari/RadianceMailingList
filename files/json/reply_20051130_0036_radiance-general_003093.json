{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nThe set overflow error includes a hint as to the problem in the form  \nof a surface id.  Most likely, the trouble in your geometry is near  \nthis surface.  If it's not overlapping or collapsed geometry, then it  \nmight be a disk that's been converted to hundreds of triangles, all  \nculminating at a single point, which cannot be resolved by oconv  \nbecause there are more than 511 surfaces in an infinitesimal volume.\n\n\nIf you can identify all the triangles associated with this disk, you  \nshould be able to replace it with a single \"ring\" primitive, or if  \nthe edges need to match exactly, with a many-sided face primitive.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003093.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 30, 2005 at 12:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003077", "id": "radiance-general_003093"}
