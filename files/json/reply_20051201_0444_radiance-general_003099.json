{"body": "Hi Francesco and all,\n\n\nI've read through the mailing list archives and experimented with \"rad\n-N\" and rpiece.  I'm using multiple CPUs and multiple machines on\n'standard' linux distros - cannot use openmosix.\n\n\nTwo questions:\n\n\n1. \nIf I do this:\n>rad -v single_view -N 5 myscene.rif\nRad will *not* split up my scene for me (using rpiece).  However, if I\nspecify multiple views, rad *will* run rpict multiple times\nsimultaneously (ie. as forked/backgrounded processes).\nIs this expected behaviour? I was hoping it would split my scene!\n\n\n2.\nUsually I use RIF files to store my \"scene=\", \"illum=\", \"zone=\"\nvariables, and to let rad handle calling oconv/rpict/pfilt/etc correctly\nwith appropriate settings.  \n\n\nTo divide up a scene, it seems I must use rpiece which calls rpict.\n(Let's *assume* my NFS lockd is working okay).  Therefore I cannot use\nrad and my rif files?  So I have to do what rad does *manually* and\nincorporate rpiece into this process?\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nBrett Beeson\n\n\nCUNDALL\nHSBC Building Level 20\n300 Queen Street\nBrisbane QLD 4000\ntel:   +61 (0)7 3023 5048\nfax:  +61 (0)7 3023 4000\nwww.cundall.com.au\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brett Beeson", "created_at": "December 01, 2005 at 04:44AM", "created_by": "Brett_Beeson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003080", "id": "radiance-general_003099"}
