{"body": "Hi Brett,\n> Two questions:\n>\n> 1.\n> If I do this:\n>> rad -v single_view -N 5 myscene.rif\n> Rad will *not* split up my scene for me (using rpiece).

I was hoping it would split my scene!\n\n\nThis is the current behavior of rad.  I did not implement calls to  \nrpiece with the -N option, only parallel rendering of multiple  \nviews.  Running rpiece properly and handling all the border cases,  \nrecovery, etc., is a bit complicated.  It would be nice to do in rad,  \nbut I haven't put it in there, yet.  Maybe when I have a 4-processor  \nmachine, it will seem worth my while.\n\n\n> 2.\n> Usually I use RIF files to store my \"scene=\", \"illum=\", \"zone=\"\n> variables, and to let rad handle calling oconv/rpict/pfilt/etc  \n> correctly\n> with appropriate settings.\n>\n> To divide up a scene, it seems I must use rpiece which calls rpict.\n> (Let's *assume* my NFS lockd is working okay).

You can then pick  \nup the job with rpiece at that point.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003101.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 01, 2005 at 07:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003080", "id": "radiance-general_003101"}
