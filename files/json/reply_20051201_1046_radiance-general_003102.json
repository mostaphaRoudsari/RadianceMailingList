{"body": "Hi Brett, \n\n\n>1. \n>If I do this:\n>>rad -v single_view -N 5 myscene.rif\n>Rad will *not* split up my scene for me (using rpiece).  However, if I\nspecify multiple views, rad >*will* run rpict multiple times\nsimultaneously (ie. as forked/backgrounded processes).\n>Is this expected behaviour? I was hoping it would split my scene!\n\n\nAs Greg already explained, this is the expected behaviour, but if you\nneed to render\nmore than 1 view you can always share the ambient cache and save some\ntime.\n\n\n>(Let's *assume* my NFS lockd is working okay).  \n\n\nThere shouldn't be any problem with NFS lockd if you're using a recent\nlinux distro.\nOf course you will need to login to each machine or use some kind of\nremote login \nto launch your rpiece processes.\n\n\nFrancesco\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003102.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "December 01, 2005 at 10:46AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003080", "id": "radiance-general_003102"}
