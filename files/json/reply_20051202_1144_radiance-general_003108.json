You can copy the  \nnecessary\nrpict options to a file (ie. \"rpict.opts\") and include them in the  \nrpiece\ncommand line with \"rpice ... @rpict.opts\" (see the man page of rpiece  \nfor\ndetails).\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003108.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 02, 2005 at 11:44AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003080", "id": "radiance-general_003108"}
