{"body": "Dear Group\n\n\nIn some of my recent renders, I have encountered some very specious \nartifacts. I generally specify a high number of ambient division (usually \naround 3072) and ambient super samples (500-1000) for my renders.\n\n\nThe first ones are these mysterious dark splotches:\n\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=4bcbre2.jpg&.src=ph\n\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=c76fre2.jpg&.src=ph\n\n\nI really can't figure out what's causing these. I am unsure if this is \ncaused by poor interpolation. Also, occasionally I have come across the \nfollowing bright spots:\n\n\nhttp://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/detail?.dir=b3e9&.dnm=e02ere2.jpg&.src=ph\n\n\nNo matter how many ambient divisions that I specify (I went up to 16,000 \nambient divisions with 2000 ambient super samples),  I can't get rid of \nthese bright spots. The problem with these particular artifacts is that I \ncan not predict when it will occur. What I need the most when performing \nrenders is predictability. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003113.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "December 05, 2005 at 07:07PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003112", "id": "radiance-general_003113"}
