{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI'm not exactly sure why I put this in there, it was so long ago.  I  \nmay have simply been duplicating someone else's algorithm, or I may  \nhave found problems related to the sun at zenith.  The whole sky  \ndistribution is normalized to the zenith value, so having the sun too  \nnear could be a problem, or it might have been paranoia on my part.\n\n\nYou can try removing lines 218-225 in gensky.c and recompiling without:\n\n\n\tif (!overcast && altitude > 87.*PI/180.) {\n\t\tfprintf(stderr,\n\"%s: warning - sun too close to zenith, reducing altitude to 87  \ndegrees\\n\",\n\t\t\t\tprogname);\n\t\tprintf(\n\"# warning - sun too close to zenith, reducing altitude to 87 degrees \n\\n\");\n\t\taltitude = 87.*PI/180.;\n\t}\n\n\nTry a few data points where the sun is at the zenith and see what  \nhappens.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003118.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 07, 2005 at 11:39PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003117", "id": "radiance-general_003118"}
