{"body": "Hi Ignacio,\n\n\n From my experience, there are memory problems associated with  \nCygwin, and these are unrelated to Radiance (other than the fact that  \nRadiance uses a lot of memory).  A backtrace isn't much help in this  \ncase, I'm afraid, as it is not a problem with the program, but with  \nthe system under which it is operating.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003125.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 11, 2005 at 05:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003124", "id": "radiance-general_003125"}
