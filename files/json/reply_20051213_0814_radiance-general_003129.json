{"body": "Dear Greg:\n\n\nI am very sorry for posting images to the mailing list.\n\n\nThanks very much for your suggestion.I have fixed the problem by setting the roughness of floor to 0.01. \nAnd I have speed up the rendering process by increasing the -aa value. \n\n\nThe AMBFILE seems can help to get better rendering results, and greatly increase the rendering speed \nfor the same model. But I think when I change materials of the model, I should delete the old ambient file \nand let Radiance generate a new one, otherwize the result will be incorrect. Am I right? Or maybe the \nambient file can be reused by models with similar materials?\n\n\nbest wishes.\n\n\nHuang\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003129.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Huangwx", "created_at": "December 13, 2005 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "Huangwx", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003120", "id": "radiance-general_003129"}
