{"body": "Bob,\n\n\nYour guess is right. Radiance's triangles, even with normal\ninterpolation, are still flat. To use the normals to present a \ntrue curved surface would (I think) require an implicit \nrepresentation of the surface.\n\n\nThis particular example, with a low-res mesh and direct sunlight, \nis the \"poster-child\" of this problem.\n\n\nI usually avoid this problem by a combination of higher \nresolution (I use tri meshes up to 1M elements) and more ambient \nthan direct light.\n\n\nSo, I see no way to completely avoid this for some problems.\n\n\nMark\nmstock at umich.edu\n\n\nOn Tue, 13 Dec 2005, bob coyne wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003131.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "December 13, 2005 at 03:49PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003130", "id": "radiance-general_003131"}
