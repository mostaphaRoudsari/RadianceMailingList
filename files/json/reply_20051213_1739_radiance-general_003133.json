{"body": "Mark is right.  To get the correct appearance out of a triangle mesh,  \nyou actually need to use a displacement map to give the underlying  \nmodel the correct appearance w.r.t. grazing shadows such as this  \none.  Implementing displacement maps in a ray tracer is pretty  \ndifficult, and in the end it costs more to render them than simply  \nincreasing the resolution of your T-mesh as Mark suggests.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003133.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 13, 2005 at 05:39PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003130", "id": "radiance-general_003133"}
