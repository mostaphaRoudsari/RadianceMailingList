{"body": "Hi Huang,\n\n\nIf the average reflectance of large surfaces change in your model,  \nthen reusing the ambient file will result in under- or over- \nestimation of the interreflected component.  If the average  \nreflectance (and color) of your surfaces changes little, then  \nremoving the ambient file is not necessary.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003134.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 13, 2005 at 05:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003120", "id": "radiance-general_003134"}
