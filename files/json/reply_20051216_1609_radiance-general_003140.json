{"body": "He Greg,\n\n\nI just have a G5 for editing video my last project, and I was surprised \nhow well a G5 is rendering with rpict. The G5 was one of the best \nworkhorses this month!!\nOn my G5 the deafult processor performance is already set on  \"Highest\".\nBesides that, removing the -DNICE= arguments in rt/ Rmakefile is \nsomething I like to check out, but I am fearly new with OSX, and I \nhaven't found any development tools yet.\nWhere do I find development tools for OSX, so I can run make?\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003140.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "December 16, 2005 at 04:09PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003138", "id": "radiance-general_003140"}
