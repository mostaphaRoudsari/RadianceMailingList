{"body": "Hi Ilya,\n\n\nMy guess is that you are seeing sampling areas associated with your  \nexterior obstruction, which will be translated into the window's  \noutput distribution by mkillum as a fairly sharp cut-off since it is  \non the other side of the street.  Basically, I recommend reducing  \nyour -ds setting even further (to 0.1 or 0.08) in your final rtrace,  \nin hopes of reducing the parallax error of the window sampling.  Even  \nbetter would be to set -dj 0.9 and give the same point to rtrace many  \ntimes, then average the result in a post-process.  This will  \neliminate any direct sampling errors, which I suspect are the problem  \nin your particular case.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Very nice analysis and presentation of your results, by the way.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 16, 2005 at 08:46PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003145", "id": "radiance-general_003146"}
