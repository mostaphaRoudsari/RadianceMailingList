{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nThanks for the hint as to what options to set on the G5!  I had  \nplayed around with these some time ago -- using gcc 3.3, I think --  \nand never found a combination that both sped up the process and  \navoided problems.  I'm sure I tried removing one at a time, but not  \nwith the latest compiler.  Indeed, this combo seems to be a winner,  \nat least for the G5 -- about 20% faster than -O3 by itself.\n\n\nRunning Mark Stock's bench4 on the HEAD release on my 2.5GHz G5, I  \nget a user time total of 4956.56 seconds, which is maybe a few  \npercent better than what one might expect just from the clock speed  \ndifference.\n\n\nI also ran the new smp test, and got about 95% linearity (a 3.8  \ntimes) speedup using all four processors.  This was good news to me,  \nas I had some concern that the dual core processors would have a  \nbottleneck with memory access.  Apparently, the enlarged caches deal  \nwith this pretty gracefully, and the fact that rpiece shares memory  \ncan't hurt.  It's too bad Apple is going with Intel instead of AMD --  \nI might have waiting if that had been the case.  As it is, I don't  \nthink they'll better the G5 quad for some time.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003149.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 19, 2005 at 12:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003148", "id": "radiance-general_003149"}
