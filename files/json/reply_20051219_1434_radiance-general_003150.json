{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nGreg's email is not only relevant for Mac users but also for the\nfriendly but frequently overlooked WINDOWS crowd:)\n\n\nFor the Daysim Windows version, I am compiling a number of Radiance\nprograms. Specifically, I am calling rtrace via a C-Program called\ngen_dc to calculate a whole set of daylight coefficients. In case rtrace\nhas been compiled with NICE=, it runs with a \"low\" priority whereas\nwithout the NICE=, it runs with \"normal\" priority. In the latter case,\nthe simulation times can become substantial as just about any other job\nunder Windows runs with \"normal\" priority. In case you are using\nRadiance under Windows (cygwin etc.), this might be worthwhile looking\ninto as well. One of my students reported that the Lightstudio Radiance\nbinaries run significantly faster than Desktop Radiance (but this may be\nthe case for numerous other reasons as well).\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003150.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "December 19, 2005 at 02:34PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003138", "id": "radiance-general_003150"}
