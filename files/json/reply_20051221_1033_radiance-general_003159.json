In which case, the report may have  \nnothing to do with the missing geometry.\n\n\nSorry I can't be of more help, but I thought it worth pointing out  \nthat this seems to be normal behaviour for 3ds2mgf.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "December 21, 2005 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003151", "id": "radiance-general_003159"}
