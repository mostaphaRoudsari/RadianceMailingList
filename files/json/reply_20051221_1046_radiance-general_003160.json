{"body": "Jeffrey,\n\n\nI also get the same behaviour as John reports.  In my experience going \nfrom dxf -> 3ds -> mgf -> rad (works better than dxf -> rad directly) \nmissing surfaces are due to errors in the original cad model or small \nerrors in curved surfaces being triangulated.  I would recommend \nchecking the original model.\n\n\nApart from that could there be any 3ds primitives that are not \ntranslated by 3ds2mgf?\n\n\nIain\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic wrote:\n\n\n>> I then export out a nice\n>> 3DS file from 3D Studio, and run the 3DS2MGF -> MGF2RAD style of\n>> conversion, and it gets most of the way through the conversion but  then\n>> hits a 'Unexpected EOF'.
