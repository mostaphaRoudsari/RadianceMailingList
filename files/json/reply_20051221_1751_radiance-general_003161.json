{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nHere are a few more thought to add.\n\n\n    * 3ds - this format has some limitations in data size/allocation. I\n      have noticed on big models that have a lot of geometry, 3dsout\n      from Autocad will stop on large entities. One thing to consider\n      would be writing a script (autolisp) and using 3dsout on a per\n      layer or per color basis, though this still may not work on large\n      entities.\n    * Max and objects converted to 3ds - there are lots of objects out\n      in the 3D marketplace that are sold in multiple formats, some of\n      these are actually modeled in Max and then converted to other\n      formats. One problem that I have noticed with models created in\n      Max is that because of the way Max deals with coordinate systems\n      on a per object basis, models exported to other formats such as\n      3ds do not always have things transformed correctly. I think that\n      this must be a problem with the way Max deals with exporting to\n      other formats. For example, I bought some nice 3D car models in\n      3ds format, in a few of them the wheels where not in the right\n      location when I viewed the model.  PLEASE NOTE - I am not a Max\n      user, but I have worked with customers who use Max, and it is a\n      huge @#%$%^#$% pain in the @#%$$#$% to get things converted into\n      something useful.\n    * Polytrans - my latest effort at find a decent 3D conversion tool\n      finally lead me to purchase Polytrans from Okino\n      (http://www.okino.com/conv/conv.htm) along with the cad-pak\n      module. I have used this for a few different things (though there\n      are some minor problems with the native autocad dwg as they use\n      opendwg vs native dwg). The nice things is that I now have a\n      reliable way to export directly to obj!\n    * 3Dwin4 and Accutrans3d - I have used the former with some success\n      and heard of the latter. You will have to do a search on where to\n      find them. These are shareware\n    * Revit - As far as this is concerned, I have always thought that\n      this must be a pretty great tool. However, I have never used it\n      for production for the very reason that it seemed extremely\n      difficult to get geometry out. This being said though, I have\n      heard from relatively reliable sources that they are working on\n      this, on the other hand though I think that in the bigger picture\n      they are trying to determine the best way to fit Revit into their\n      overall product mix.\n    * Outsource Development of custom exporter - Depending on need and\n      how much you use Revit it might be worth it to consider\n      outsourcing the development of a native exporter. I have no idea\n      what the Revit api is like though so not really sure what would be\n      involved.
