While I've got access to Viz right now, I could get access \nto Max instead, so I'll check out that plug-in.\n\n\n> Also here is something that I grabbed off of the following list: \n> http://www.formz.com/forum/forum_archive/forumC/general/186.html\n>\n> There are a number of limitations and features of 3DS format that we\n> must keep in mind.

I'll look up the number of \nfaces in the model when it's brought into 3D Studio, but this is a big \nol' problem with Revit in general: that it allows you to make huge, \nhighly detailed models of buildings that work very well in Revit but can \nchoke other 3D software that's not meant to take models with so many \nsurfaces...\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\n\nBecause We Can, LLC\n(415) 505-4689\nwww.becausewecan.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003166.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "December 21, 2005 at 07:35PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003151", "id": "radiance-general_003166"}
