{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nJack de Valpine or John Mardaljevic may know more about this than I  \ndo, as they have experience using different ambient settings in  \ndifferent runs, whereas I tend to stick with the same settings I  \nstart with.  In general, it's safe to run with reduced ambient  \nsettings in subsequent renderings when you share an ambient file.   \nSpecifically, it's OK to relax the -ad and -as settings, and -aa and - \nar as well.  You can reduce -ab (though -ab 0 won't use the ambient  \nfile values at all), but I wouldn't recommend changing -av or -aw.   \n(There is no speed advantage to doing so, anyway.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003170.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 22, 2005 at 06:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003169", "id": "radiance-general_003170"}
