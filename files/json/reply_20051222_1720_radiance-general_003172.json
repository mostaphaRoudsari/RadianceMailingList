{"body": "Hi Greg and Rob,\n\n\nThe strategy that we have always used is based on John's recomendations \nin RwR. For example:\n\n\nparameter\n\tfirst pass (overture at 64 or 128 pixels)\n\tsecond pass (whatever your next resolution is)\n-ad\n\t1024\n\t512 (1/2 of first pass)\n-as\n\t512\n\t256 (1/2 of first pass)\n-aa\n\t.15\n\t.25\n\n\n\n\nIn RwR, John does not recommend changing the other ambient parameters. \nHowever, I am intrigued to hear that Greg indicates that it would be ok \nto reduce -ar as well as -ab. It would be interesting to run some test \nand determine what good reduction parameters would be.\n\n\nNow, we use the parameter reductions mainly for \"pictures.\" I am \ninterested to consider what kind of parameter reductions would work when \nmoving from a tight grained high -ab quantitative simulation to \nsomething that could still use the ambient cache for producing \n\"pictures,\" which is more clearly what Rob is thinking about.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003172.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 22, 2005 at 05:20PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003169", "id": "radiance-general_003172"}
