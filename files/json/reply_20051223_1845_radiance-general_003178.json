I \ninquired with the President of the company a while back, about the \nability of Maxwell to both work with actual photometric files and to \nsupply real illuminance & luminance results. I received vague replies \nabout this.  It's the same old story, us lighting people don't get any \nrespect; we're the Rodney Dangerfields of the computer graphics world.  \nA friend of mine who runs a CG news website has been asking similar \nquestions of them and getting similar runaround.  A similar fate \naffected another well-known physically-based rendering tool \n(Lightscape).  Maxwell does look very nice, but so far the promise of \nbeing able to use it for lighting analysis remains a promise, a \npotetially broken one, and I'm an excellent skeptic, even during this \nholiday time. =8-)  That said, I have not looked at their website in a \nwhile or made any inquiries.\n\n\nThat website link you sent was interesting; the Maxwell engine does \ndefinitely look like it uses similar algorithms as Radiance -- noise and \nall.  Have a look here:\n\n\nhttp://www.wahn.demon.co.uk/Maxwell/Images/\n\n\nHe's done a bunch of renderings of the tutorial scenes from RwR.  Very \ninteresting!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003178.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 23, 2005 at 06:45PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003177", "id": "radiance-general_003178"}
