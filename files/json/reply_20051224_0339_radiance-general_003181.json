{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nWithout seeing your swatches or having a reflectance measurement to  \ncompare to, it's difficult for me to guess whether the calibration is  \nworking or not.  Certainly, the debug output from Macbethcal  \nindicates that it was able to do a reasonable job of inverting your  \nscanner's response.  However, it's still possible that some kind of  \nauto-exposure is changing the results from one scan to the next, so  \nit may be that your absolute levels are off.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003181.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 24, 2005 at 03:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003030", "id": "radiance-general_003181"}
