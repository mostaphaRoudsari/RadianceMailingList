I wish I could answer some of your interesting \nquestions, but in lieu of that,  I at least restored the page you were \nlooking for, albeit to a different (and temporary) location:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/static/rad-mkillum/rad_01.html\n\n\nIt's basically a long-winded journey toward mkillum enlightenment.  One \nof these days, I'll get totally organized, but let's just say I'm not \nmaking it a new year's resolution.  ;)\n\n\nNow's a good time to also wish the entire list a happy end-of-the-year.  \nMay you all have holidays filled with light (and if the light source is \nsmall relative to the scene, use mkillum to render it). \n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003182.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 24, 2005 at 07:20AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003112", "id": "radiance-general_003182"}
