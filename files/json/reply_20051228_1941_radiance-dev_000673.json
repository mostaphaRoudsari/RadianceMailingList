{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nRadiance scene files were really meant to be read with scanf() and  \nwritten with printf().  If you want help with the loading of  \narguments, I suggest using the routine in src/common/readfargs.c, and  \nfgetword() and fputword() for the modifiers and identifiers.\n\n\nI hope this helps!\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Your letter prompted me to fix not only the misspelling in  \nrad2mgf, but also the reading and writing of id's with spaces in  \nthem, which are discouraged even though they're allowed in Ratiance.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-December/000673.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 28, 2005 at 07:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000672", "id": "radiance-dev_000673"}
