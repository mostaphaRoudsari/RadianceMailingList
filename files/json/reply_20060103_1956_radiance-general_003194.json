If you click on any of the .hdr images\non this page:\nhttp://athens.ict.usc.edu/Probes/\nthe web server tells you it's a BIN file. Assigning a default application\ntherefor depends on the extension. This is .hdr on the page you quoted,\nbut no-one can stop me from serving HDR images with an extension .axl .\nThis is where the MIME type kicks in: Once my web server knows that both,\n.hdr and .axl (and maybe .pic) are of type X-HIGH-DYNAMIC-RANGE, for\nexample, it will dish out the proper MIME type, and not say it's a BIN\n(which is kinda saying \"I've no idea what I'm delivering here...\")\n\n\nThanks for the link.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003194.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 03, 2006 at 07:56PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003186", "id": "radiance-general_003194"}
