{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nThanks for writing to let me know all is well with trans, if a bit  \nconfusing...  (But we knew that!)\n\n\nWhile I agree that the -i option would be better to show arriving  \nirradiance on some trans surfaces, it's a hack to begin with, and the  \nbehavior is more predictable if it switches based on material type  \nrather than material parameters.\n\n\nYour formulas for the trans arguments look correct, except your A5  \ncalculation, the specular roughness:\n\n\n> A5 = (rs * rs_a _ ts * ts_a) / (rs + ts)\n\n\nPerhaps you meant:\n\n\nA5 = (rs * rs_a + ts * ts_a) / (rs + ts)\n\n\nThis seems a reasonable way to compute an average value for the  \nroughness.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\n------------------ Off-list messages:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003196.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 04, 2006 at 12:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003187", "id": "radiance-general_003196"}
