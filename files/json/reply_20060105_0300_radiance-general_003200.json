{"body": "Martin,\n\n\n> Most Nikon cameras record the focal length in the Exif header\n\n\n.. just to confirm what Greg said: I've put a text file with the EXIF info\nof a 4500 up under:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/pickup/NIKON__E4500.exif\n\n\nI don't have a 5400 in my little collection. This is as close as it gets.\n\n\nJust pulling three lines out of this file:\nFocalLengthIn35mmFormat => 38\nFocalLength35efl => 7.8mm (35mm equivalent: 38.0mm)\nFocalLength => 7.8mm\n\n\nVoila! Your're in business.\n\n\nYou might want to take a look at the Reveal software which is available\nfor LINUX, MacOS, and even Windows:\nhttp://albumshaper.sourceforge.net/index.shtml\nIt's a GUI thing allowing you to read and edit the EXIF info.\n\n\nAnd of course there's alwas Perl::Image::Exiftool, if you're into\nautomating and scripting... Look on CPAN.org\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003200.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 05, 2006 at 03:00AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003198", "id": "radiance-general_003200"}
