{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nI've just been playing around with this, myself.  To get a good  \nresponse curve, it is best to start with a scene that has a daylight  \ncolor balance, as this is the design point for most cameras, and some  \nmodels end up boosting the blue too much if you calibrate under  \nincandescent lighting.  For this reason, I prefer calibrating with  \nnatural light, as opposed to a controlled condition with incandescent  \nor fluorescent lighting.  In any case, you should fixed a white  \nbalance setting on the camera appropriate to the test lighting.   \n(Memory aid:  If the white balance isn't fixed, then it's broken.)\n\n\nColor charts are of limited use, except as a means to verify your  \ncalibration.  The more images you take in a sequence, and the more  \nclosely they are spaced, the less you rely on the recorded camera  \nresponse function.  This is because the overlap of the images serves  \n(together with the known shutter speeds) to give you an accurate  \nresult, regardless.  It is more important to have an absolute  \ncalibration value if you are after real numbers, and for this a  \nluminance measurement on a reference card of known reflectance is  \ninvaluable.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003204.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 09, 2006 at 08:56PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003203", "id": "radiance-general_003204"}
