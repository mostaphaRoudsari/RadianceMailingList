{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for the follow-up on this. I think that I have gotten the white \nbalance part correct. I always set it by hand (for example to the sun \nicon) so the auto white balance feature is effectively off. And I have \nused aperture priority on the camera however I have used auto \nbracketing, so maybe I am not getting enough samples? It sound like \nperhaps the best thing to do is set the aperture manually and vary the \nexposure time manually as well in order to generate your suggested ~10 \nsamples. Although doing everything manually involves a lot of \nunnecessary touch of the camera.\n\n\nSo as to scene, clear sunny sky conditions would be ideal I suppose with \na range from shadowed features to direcly illuminated features... Sorry \nfor this next... So how do you use the luminance measure from the \nreference card to further calibrate the response curve?\n\n\nOnce a response curve has been generated is there some way to check or \nvalidate it (if that makes any sense)?\n\n\nIn the book (the new one;-) you also indicate that the darkest exposure \nshould have no RGB values greater than ~200 and the lightest no values \nless than ~20. I could certainly figure out a filter routine with pcomb, \nhowever there must be a simple way to do this with ImageMagick. The \npoint being to run a quick preprocess check on the the bounding images. \nAny takers or suggestions for how to do this easily?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGregory J.
