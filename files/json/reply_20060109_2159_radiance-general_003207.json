Multiply\nthis with your calibration factor. This CF will be roughly one, but not\nquite.\n\n\n> In the book (the new one;-) you also indicate that the darkest exposure\n> should have no RGB values greater than ~200 and the lightest no values\n> less than ~20.

I use this in\nWebHDR: For each uploaded image, the histogram is plotted, and the\nexposure value given. Give it a try, if you like.\n\n\nI understand that ImageMagick can also give you histograms.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003207.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 09, 2006 at 09:59PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003203", "id": "radiance-general_003207"}
