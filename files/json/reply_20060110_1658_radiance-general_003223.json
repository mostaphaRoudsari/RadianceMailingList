{"body": "Greg et al -\n\n\nRegarding Photosphere and the creation of HDR images from multiple  \nexposure LDR images:  is there any advantage to the process by using  \nhigher bit RAW or TIFF (12-16 bit) linear LDRs when combining them  \ninto an HDR, or does it not matter or actually make the process  \nharder or less efficient, etc.?  Just curious.\n\n\nI've been reading and rereading the Tone Mapping chapters in the new  \nbook trying to get a theoretical and physical basis for the machinery  \nworking behind the scenes in Photosphere/hdrgen.  Pretty cool stuff.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
