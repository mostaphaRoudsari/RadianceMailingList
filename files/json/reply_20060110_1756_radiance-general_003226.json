{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nThere generally isn't much difference between camera RAW and JPEG in  \nterms of resolution.  The main difference is that we don't need to  \nsecond-guess what the camera is doing or figure out the response  \nfunction (in most cases).\n\n\nWorking on the NYSERDA project again, I've developed a prototype  \nscript based on Dave Coffin's dcraw.c that converts camera RAW  \ndirectly into 24-bit BMP with a known gamma, then takes this into  \nhdrgen to compute the final HDR image.  I have done numerous  \nexperiments with this process and compared them to dealing only with  \nJPEGs, and there's not a lot of difference between the two methods.   \nIn general, I would say that the RAW translation offers better color  \nfidelity, but suffers from greater noise.  The color difference is  \nattributable to the odd color manipulations that happen in the  \ncamera.  The noise difference no doubt has a lot to do with the noise  \nreduction that happens in many digital cameras, which is bypassed  \nusing RAW directly.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Bear in mind that although most RAW image files are 12 bits,  \nthey are 12 bits of linear range, which isn't really any better than  \n8 bits using a standard 2.2 gamma.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003226.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 10, 2006 at 05:56PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003203", "id": "radiance-general_003226"}
