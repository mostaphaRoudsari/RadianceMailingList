{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nRadiance should definitely be recompiled for the Intel platform, and  \nI will endeavor to supply binaries for both architectures in the next  \nrelease.  Photosphere can be cross-compiled using Xcode 2, and I will  \nbe testing that just as soon as someone I know picks up one of the  \nnew Intel-based Apples.  (It seems very strange to use \"Intel\" and  \n\"Apple\" in the same sentence without \"versus\" in between.)  The iMac  \nis supposedly out as of today, but the Mac Book Pro isn't shipping  \nuntil February.\n\n\nThe main difference from a programming standpoint between the two  \nmachines is that the PowerPC family is BigEndian while Intel is  \nLittleEndian (different byte orders).  This can affect binary files  \nthat are not machine-independent.  In Radiance, this includes  \nholodeck files and depth buffers (-z option of rpict).  I think  \nthat's it.  All the other standard file types are designed to port  \nacross architectures.  Photosphere uses a byte-ordering translator on  \nits binary catalog file, but I haven't had the chance to actually  \ntest it up until now.  It will be working when I make an universal  \nversion available.\n\n\nYou can see <http://www.apple.com/rosetta/> for more information.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I'm kicking myself a bit for having bought a new PowerBook last  \nSummer.  Hopefully, Rob Guglielmetti held off with his Christmas  \npurchase.  Everyone said that the iBooks would be the first to  \nswitch, but apparently not.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003232.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 11, 2006 at 05:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003231", "id": "radiance-general_003232"}
