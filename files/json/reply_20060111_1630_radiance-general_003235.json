{"body": "Greg - thanks for the explanation and your dedication to staying  \nahead of the curve and supporting all of the RADIANCE user communities.\n\n\n From what I read leading up to this release, it was clear that Apple  \nwanted to finally move its laptops to the next level, hence the Intel  \nchipset.  I have a feeling that, as with most things Apple, there  \nwill be issues - but the Apple faithful (me included) are willing to  \nbe beta testers and see the bugginess as a badge of honor in some  \nconvoluted way (paying money to be a beta tester will do that to your  \nrationalizing psyche I suppose).  It is weird to mention Apple and  \nIntel as complements, but I think all Mac users (again, me included)  \nrealize Apple's shortcomings, even if we tend to defend the brand to  \nthe death.\n\n\nAs Rob said:\n\n\n> Dual core laptop?  Yes, please...\n\n\nI imagine that a 17\" version of the Intel dual core laptop can;t be  \nfar behind, given the performance-oriented, graphics-driven market  \nthe new platform will benefit.....  Wouldn't it be interesting if  \nApple offered a 17\" HDR display laptop someday? [wink]\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
