The other ones cost $100-$200 more for incremental cpu \nspeed increases and a DVD burner (which you probably already have). \n\n\nOf course, once you start using OSX, you'll want to keep on using it, \nfor more than just Photosphere. Honestly, the only thing keeping a \nWindows machine on my desk at work is AutoCAD.  Everything else is much \nmore pleasant to do on OSX, especially Radiance and all things command \nline.  But I know you have a well-established workflow, so if you truly \nonly want this Mac hardware for Photosphere, I'd go for the basic $500 \nMini. \n\n\n- Rob \"is it February yet?\" Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003239.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 11, 2006 at 06:39PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003231", "id": "radiance-general_003239"}
