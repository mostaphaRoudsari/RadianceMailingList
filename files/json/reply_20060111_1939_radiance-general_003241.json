But I guess there\nare as many requirements for AutoCAD compatibility as there are  \ncompanies\nusing it.\n\n\nAbout the Mac mini:\n\n\nYou can stick with the base model but you should increase the memory\nto at least 512 MB (base for the smallest mini was 256 MB, don't know\nwhere it's now).\n\n\nYou could always bribe Greg to add the new features to the Linux\nversion of Photosphere, too.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003241.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 11, 2006 at 07:39PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003231", "id": "radiance-general_003241"}
