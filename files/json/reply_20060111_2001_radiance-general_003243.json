There is no Photosphere for Linux  \n(or Windows), unfortunately.  Maybe in half a year or so, if things  \ngo as planned.  I won't be doing the development myself, but I'm  \nscheming to get BrightSide to pay for porting Photosphere to Windows,  \nwhich they would offer commercially.  Out of it, we would also get a  \nfree Linux version.  It's all very iffy at this point, though...   \nSort of like counting on running Windows apps. natively on the new  \nIntel-based Macs.  It could happen.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003243.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 11, 2006 at 08:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003231", "id": "radiance-general_003243"}
