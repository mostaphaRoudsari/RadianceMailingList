A, in press.\n\n\nfor a free download of the non-typeset version go here:\nhttp://josaa.osa.org/upcoming_pdf.cfm?id=63954\n\n\nIn particular we've looked at accuracy for different colour coding variants:\nRGB, sRGB and spectral rendering with a strong emphasis on colour accuracy (and\nluminance of course). For validation we compared rendering results with\nmeasurements from the real-world counterpart scene.\n\n\ncheers,\n\n\nalexa\n\n\nQuoting Martin Moeck <MMoeck at engr.psu.edu>:\n\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> Can you please list a few peer-reviewed journal and conference papers that\n> deal directly or indirectly with the validation of Radiance?
