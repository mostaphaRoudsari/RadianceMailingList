{"body": "Hi Erico,\n\n\nyou probably should use the current version of photon-mapping(4.3), \nwhich is for the RADIANCE 3.7. Roland made this new version some weeks ago.\nI'm not sure, if this helps in your special case, but I never had such \nproblems with using photon-ports and I used it several times without any \nproblems (I always used the 3.28 version for RADIANCE 3.5).\n\n\nWe are actually reorganizing our web-pages and unfortunately the English \n(web)version is not available and the German version shows a bug in \ndirect linking. That's the reason, why I haven't posted it to the \ncommunity yet.\n\n\nAnyhow, it is already on a Web-page for downloading.\nYou can get it on:\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/german/fields/field6/mb4/index.html then \nfollow link on \"Lichtsimulation\", then \"RADIANCE\", then \"p-map\"\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003255.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "January 14, 2006 at 07:29AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003254", "id": "radiance-general_003255"}
