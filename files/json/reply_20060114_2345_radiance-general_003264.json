{"body": "Hi Will,\n\n\n> i am trying to use radiance to render a relatively simple model\n> geometrically - just a simple room, with a box sitting on the floor -\n> but with up to 100 or so light sources. but the difference is that i\n> want to get a separte image file for each light source - i.e.  hundred\n> or so images, with only 1 light on in each. i will then use\n> superposition and recombine the images later, allowing me to vary the\n> intensities of each light source.\n>\n> is there any kind of built in functionality in radiance to allow me to\n> do this, or do i have to write a shell script or something (and if so,\n> can anyone point me towards a good place to learn how! i come from a\n> very winndows based background)\n\n\nShell scripts would work, but Greg has recently added to Radiance rtcontrib:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtcontrib.1.html\n\n\nThis man page contains already a good starting example:\n\n\n\"\nTo generate a pair of images corresponding to two lights' contributions:\n\n\n         vwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf | rtcontrib -ffc `vwrays -d -x\n         1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf` @render.opt -o c_%s.pic -m light1 -m light2\n         scene.oct\n\n\nThese images may then be recombined using the desired outputs of light1\nand light2:\n\n\n         pcomb -c 100 90 75 c_light1.pic -c  50  55  57  c_light2.pic  >  com-\n         bined.pic\n\"\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003264.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "January 14, 2006 at 11:45PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003258", "id": "radiance-general_003264"}
