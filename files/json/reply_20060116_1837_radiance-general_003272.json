{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nPeter is quick.  He has just set up a new mailing list, hdri at radiance- \nonline.org, which I suggest you subscribe to and we will move the  \ndiscussion there.\n\n\nHDRI generation is a separate issue from tone-mapping, and although  \nPhotosphere attempts to do both, it only makes a weak effort in the  \ntone-mapping department.  Hdrgen makes no effort to tone-map images,  \nand it should not.  In fact, I don't recommend tone-mapping HDR  \nimages into HDR, but directly into the destination display's color  \nspace, as an HDR image should maintain it's scene-referred color  \nspace.  Some of these issues are discussed and spelled out on  \nhdrsoft's excellent FAQ page:\n\n\n\thttp://www.hdrsoft.com/resources/dri.html\n\n\nSince you bring up RAW (also discussed by hdrsoft), I should mention  \nthat although it is tempting to shoot RAW in preparation for creating  \nHDR images, I have found it not to be helpful in most cases.  The  \nadditional range/resolution obtained is modest, and the confusion  \nresulting from the many \"development\" options you mention means that  \nreproducibility is an issue.  Unless you have a method to go straight  \nfrom RAW into HDRI, you are better off shooting high-quality JPEGs on  \nmost cameras.\n\n\nI'll make an announcement under a new topic about the HDRI mailing  \nlist, and let's continue the discussion there.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003272.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 16, 2006 at 06:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003267", "id": "radiance-general_003272"}
