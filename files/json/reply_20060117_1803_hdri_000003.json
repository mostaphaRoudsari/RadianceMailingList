{"body": "Martin,\n\n\nPhotoshop CS2 has a Lens Correction filter that will help correct  \nchromatic aberration, vignetting and barrel/pincushion distortion.   \nFilter>Distortion>Lens Correction\n\n\nHowever, I opened a HDR image (*.hdr) and the Filter>Distortion menu  \noption was not available, leading me to believe that it will not  \noperate directly on HDR 32 bit images.  Thus, it would seem that you  \nwould apply it to your LDR sequence images before converting to a HDR  \nimage.  The filter permits the applied settings to be saved, so you  \ncould open one image, applying the correction and then save the  \nsettings for the subsequent application to the rest of the image  \nsequence, permitting automation in a batch action.  If your sequence  \nis taken with a tripod and the images are registered prior to  \ncorrection, I would guess that applying the same correction through  \nsaved settings should displace the same pixels in each image and  \npreserve image registration.\n\n\nI just upgraded to CS2 so I haven't played with it yet.\n\n\nkirk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000003.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "January 17, 2006 at 06:03PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "hdri_000002", "id": "hdri_000003"}
