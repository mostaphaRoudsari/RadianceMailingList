I've got some friends who are into Maxwell, and apparently their first non-beta of the product, their '1.0' or whatever, was a real dog. Didn't work very well. Seeing that they got a bunch of people to buy the beta, with the promise of giving them the offical release when it came out, and then having the first offical release be so bad, well, I think it caused a lot of bad blood. Also I've heard that they keep making promises in regards to increasing the speed of Maxwell and such that aren't happening as quickly as everyone would like. So there's some crankyness there to begin with.\n\n\nbut yes, a big thanks to everyone here for Radiance! Open source, and still great after all these years...\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\n\nBecause We Can, LLC\n(415) 505-4689\nwww.becausewecan.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003276.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "January 17, 2006 at 06:51PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003275", "id": "radiance-general_003276"}
