Radiance sucks!\"\n\"no, you suck!\"\n\n\nThe Maxwell forum likely suffers from a few immature folks stirring up \ntrouble.  This afflicts most of the CG forums I've participated in \nunfortunately, save for the radiance-online lists.  The Radiance user \nbase is a class act.  I've made many friends here, and learned a lot.  \nAs usual, I feel we all owe the biggest debt of gratitude to Greg Ward \nand Peter AB for this, but there are many many people who contribute in \nbig ways to make this the resource what it is.\n\n\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003278.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 17, 2006 at 07:30PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003274", "id": "radiance-general_003278"}
