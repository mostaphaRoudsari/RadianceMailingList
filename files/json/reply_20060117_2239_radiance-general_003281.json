{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nIt is interesting to see some of these comments. I am not exactly clear \non the problem that they are trying to solve though. But I think one \nthing to keep in mind is that a lot of people (architects, designers and \nthe architectural rendering folks) have a lot of pre-conceived ideas \nabout how light should behave and how a scene should appear. These \npreconceptions can lead to a lot of problems when it comes to evaluating \nor simulating physical performance.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003281.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 17, 2006 at 10:39PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003274", "id": "radiance-general_003281"}
