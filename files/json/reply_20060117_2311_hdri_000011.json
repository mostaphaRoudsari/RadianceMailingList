{"body": "Haha.  Very funny, indeed!\n\n\nI just tried the lens warp with Photoshop CS2 on my Mac, and it did  \npreserve the Exif information, so I think that process could work.\n\n\nPcomb does support limited filtering, which could include some  \nwarping, but you have to keep the scans within 32 pixels of each  \nother (or so), and that might be a problem.  You would also want to  \nimplement a bicubic filter, I suppose.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000011.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 17, 2006 at 11:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000002", "id": "hdri_000011"}
