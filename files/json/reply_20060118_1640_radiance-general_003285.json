{"body": "Giulio and Jack,\n\n\nI agree as well.  I do not think the M-R users are angry because the  \nsoftware is not quantitatively accurate enough for their liking, it  \nis obvious that the users of M-R want photoreal renderings, not  \nphysically accurate, quantitative data.  The mob appears to be  \nrestless because of the unfulfilled promises that M-R appear to  \nmarket - I think the users have various but specific 2nd or 3rd order  \ndesired effects for the renderer (caustics, sun behind glass or  \nwhatever) -  things they believe add photorealism to their renders  \n(things that \"look cool\").  I don;t think they really care about or  \nappreciate the quantitative physical accuracy of the solution, they  \njust want all of the subtle physical phenomena to be present in their  \noutput.  Trying to mollify that kind of user amidst many other  \nsimilar requests is almost impossible I would think, regardless of  \nhow M-R market their renderer.  Then multiply that by the number of  \nplatforms and 3rd party 3D modeler plug-ins they tout and you have a  \nrecipe for ... well what they have on the forum.\n\n\nMan, that is an angry crowd on the forum though.\n\n\nIf anyone is interested, here is a thread that demonstrates the  \nsunlight through glass \"problem\" that started this whole discussion.\n\n\nhttp://www.maxwellrender.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11102\n\n\nkirk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003285.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "January 18, 2006 at 04:40PM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003274", "id": "radiance-general_003285"}
