What the hell does that mean?  Well, I asked him, \nand he said he spent a full day with Stu Feldman (one of the two \nfounders of Lightscape), and that was what he walked away with.  I told \nhim he didn't get his money's worth on the half-day seminar.  We went \nback and forth on this, I told him he was doing his readers a great \ndisservice, and in the end I was made to feel like a loser for being in \nsuch a small industry that no one cares about.  Something about \"if you \nwant to stick with Lightscape, good luck, it's not going to be supported \nanymore, blah blah...\"  The good news is, it forced me to finally learn \nRadiance.  =)  The problem is that that review went into Cadalyst \nmagazine, which is read by lots of Architectural CAD drafters and \nrenderers, and as you mention they aren't necessarily concerned with the \ngoings on under the hood.  And then you have people showing renderings \nto clients and saying \"oh yes, that's what it will look like, we used \nsoftware that's 95% accurate!\"  Which is amazing, since many of these \npeople driving the program don't know how to read a polar curve on a \nluminaire cutsheet.

That \nwas a lot of the complaining I saw on the M-R forums, was how slow it \nwas.  It's comments like that that really give you insight into how \nlittle these people understand the problem of solving GI. \n\n\n>\n> It seems to me that the one commercial product that showed some hope \n> in its original (pre-acquisition) form was Lightscape.

I was merely trying understand the product's limitations \nbecause I wasn't ready to commit to learning radiance in production.  \n=8-)  And you are right about the developers.  At least in the case of \nRod Recker (the other Lightscape developer), I definitely felt like he \nwas interested in giving the world a tool.  Sure, getting rich off it is \na nice bonus, but he seemed to be interested in taking that Cornell \neducation and channeling it into a lighting tool.  He's a really nice \nguy and wish him the best of luck at Autodesk.  It's truly unfortunate \nwhat happened to that product, but then again it was severely limited in \nwhat it could do.  Of course, who knows what it'd be like today had the \nright people stayed in the decision-making seat.  Then again, how far \ncan one go with radiosity?  (Well, I guess the folks at Lighting \nAnalysts can answer that one, and the answer is \"pretty damned far\".  \nTheir AGI product continues to improve, and with people like Martin at \nPSU doing validations with it, it becomes more and more robust.  But I \nstill prefer Radiance.) \n\n\nInteresting thread; sorry for the somewhat off-topic verbiage, but I \nthink we all learn from these exchanges too.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003287.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 18, 2006 at 07:09PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003274", "id": "radiance-general_003287"}
