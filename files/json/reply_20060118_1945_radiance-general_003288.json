{"body": "Hi Anthony,\n\n\nThere is a problem under OS X, which doesn't have a /usr/tmp  \ndirectory.  This has been fixed in the latest release (I think), but  \nmaybe not the one you have.  The solution is to execute \"sudo ln -s / \nvar/tmp /usr\" and enter the administrator's password.\n\n\nThere should have been a note about this spat out by makeall, but  \nmaybe you missed it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003288.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 18, 2006 at 07:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003286", "id": "radiance-general_003288"}
