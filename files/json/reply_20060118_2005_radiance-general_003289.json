Type these commands:\n\n\nwhich csh\nwhich mkdir\n\n\nAlso check the output of\n\n\necho $PATH\n\n\nYou realy should fix this csh problem but here is a quick\nworkaround:\n\n\nCreate a new directory (with \"Finder\") or - if this works -\nfrom the BASH prompt:\n\n\nmkdir /tmp/falsecolor\n\n\nAnd change the first line (after the comments) in falsecolor\n(probably the file \"/usr/local/bin/falsecolor\"):\n\n\nfrom:     set td=/tmp/fc$$\nto:       set td=/tmp/falsecolor\n\n\nand the last line:\n\n\nfrom:     rm -rf $td\nto:       rm -rf $td/*\n\n\nYou can only run one instance of falsecolor at a time now\nbut it will help until you found and fixed the real problem.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003289.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 18, 2006 at 08:05PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003286", "id": "radiance-general_003289"}
