On the Canon website the list is:\n\n\nEOS-1D\nEOS-1Ds\nEOS-1D MkII\nEOS 20D\nEOS-1Ds Mark II\nEOS 350D\nEOS 5D\nEOS-1D Mark II N\n\n\n(For beginners: The EOS 350D is the current low end of the list\nand available for about 500 $).\n\n\nURL for the (Windows) EOS Capture:\n\n\nhttp://software.canon-europe.com/software/eos_captures22671.asp?model=\n\n\nBTW: Canon has a SDK for these cameras which is probably what Greg\n      has used for his HDR capture. Nice to have something for OS X,  \ntoo.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000018.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 21, 2006 at 12:14AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000018"}
