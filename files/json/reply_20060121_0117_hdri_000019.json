{"body": "There is a semi-working version of EOS Capture for OS X as well, but  \nof course you are left to manually control the camera.  It avoids  \nhaving to touch the camera, but it takes a while to get through the  \nexposure sequence (as clouds move, etc.) and it doesn't really save  \nyou any effort.  CanonHDRcap gets through the exposures as quickly as  \nthey can be downloaded, which is pretty fast on the newer cameras  \nthat have Firewire or USB 2.0 support.  It might have been faster  \nstill if I had written the images to the card then downloaded them,  \nand perhaps I will in some later version, but it's a lot more work  \nfor me and only really makes a difference for RAW captures on the  \n5D.  (I found RAW captures not to be the way to go for HDR merging,  \nfor various reasons.)\n\n\nRob G. asked about Nikon cameras, and we did look at them originally,  \nbut there were two things that led us to use the Canon 5D.  One was  \nthe fact that we needed to capture full 180-degree circular fisheye  \nimages, and this requires a full-frame sensor.  The second was the  \nway Nikon created a separate SDK with a different programming  \ninterface for every model camera, which makes supporting more than  \none a real pain.  It's a shame, though, because we have this really  \nawesome f/2.8 Nikkor fisheye lens, and the adaptor ring that's  \nsupposed to mount Nikon lenses on Canon bodies doesn't work for this  \nparticular lens.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 21, 2006 at 01:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000019"}
