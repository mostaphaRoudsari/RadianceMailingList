I've been using the FC-E9 spherical fisheye with my 5700 and getting some nice results with a custom made pano bracket designed just for the lens.   I would love to be able to automate the capture and/or processing of the images...Nikon capture doesn't and won't ever (according to the reps I've talked to) include fisheye unwarping for this lens.  Which is a shame really...it's a brilliant piece of glass.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000020.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "L.Yimm", "created_at": "January 21, 2006 at 02:39AM", "created_by": "L.Yimm", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000020"}
