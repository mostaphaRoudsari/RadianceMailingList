{"body": "So I got it to run and shoot a sequence of images, but it only keeps  \n2 of the JPEGs ( i shot in JPEG mode).\n\n\nHere is the log file text:\n\n\n\n\n/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793328.jpg\n/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793086.jpg\n/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793328.jpg\n/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793086.jpg\n/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793328.jpg\n/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793086.jpg\n.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems as if it keeps writing those two files over each other - is  \nthis correct?  These are the two files in the folder.  I am shooting  \ninside at night, so there may not be a huge range of exposures.   \nCould this be the issue?  I break things really well, so I like being  \na beta tester!\n\n\n\n\nAlso, it took a while for me to repeatedly launch the app and finally  \nestablish a connection.  I have the communications settings on my  \nDigital Rebel set to normal, not PTP.  My camera is sort of an older  \nDigital Rebel - i wonder if this makes any difference.\n\n\nHere are my Capture Parameters:\n\n\n1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t; verbose output?
