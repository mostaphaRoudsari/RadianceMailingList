{"body": "Hi Will,\n\n\nHere are some ideas (although you probably know most already)\n\n\n- make sure you have a recent head version\n- make sure that the definitions of the materials are ok (if you want  \nto separate 100 lights you need to define 100 light materials and use  \none material in each light)\n- the actual names of the materials replace the \"light1\" \"light2\" in  \nthe example\n- sometimes the image is too dark and you need to use \"a\" (for auto  \nexposure) in ximage\n- make sure the resolution is the same in both commands (I got this  \nmistake)\n- after \"-fcc\" is a backtick ` and the same after \"best.vf\" (in Unix  \nthis means \"execute the command inside and return the result\" or  \nsomething like that)\n- if you have too many lights, could be you don`t have enough  \ndescriptors, try the command \"csh\" (to enter cshell) and then \"limit  \ndescriptors\" (the result should be higher than the number of  \nmaterials you want to define, but it`s probably more than 100)\n\n\njust some ideas. it is probably none of the above. and it would  \nsurely help more information: what command you actually used, what  \nresult you get (any error message?) which OS, Radiance version, etc\nHTH\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan 24, 2006, at 11:48 PM, william reynolds wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003303.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "January 24, 2006 at 04:37PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003302", "id": "radiance-general_003303"}
