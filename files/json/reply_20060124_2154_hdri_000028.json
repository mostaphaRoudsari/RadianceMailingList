{"body": "Same thing on my computer at work - I used the absolute path, I have  \nthe latest firmware ... going to go out on a limb and guess that the  \n(or my) Digital Rebel (300D) is not compatible?\n\n\nThe app logs that it writes 6 files - the number I have specified in  \nthe Param file.  however, it actually writes the same two files three  \ntimes alternating between the two, effectively causing capture 3 to  \noverwrite 1, capture 4 to overwrite 2, capture 5 to overwrite 3 and  \ncapture 6 to overwrite 4, leaving two files (captures 5 and 6) in the  \ncapture folder.  it always writes the same two files as shown below  \n(fun444793328.jpg and fun444793086.jpg).  i suppose these file names  \nmean something specific to the image, capture settings or something?   \nI wonder why they would alternate repeating, resulting in successive  \noverwrites.  The images that are written are actual JPEG images, so a  \nvalid file is written, presumably each time.\n\n\nOh well, I'll keep at it.\n\n\nAlso, it sometimes takes a few attempts for communication to be  \nestablished with the camera (I exit and relaunch the app and it  \neventually works.\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
