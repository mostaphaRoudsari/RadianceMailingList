{"body": "Hi Kirk (and other EOS 300D users),\n\n\nI've uploaded a new version of CanonHDRcap for Mac OS X to my  \nwebsite, same URL:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/CanonHDRcap.tar.gz\n\n\nI've put in a workaround that should hopefully fix the problem with  \nthe Canon EOS 300D (Digital Rebel).  The image file name is made from  \nthe sequenceID returned by the camera, which seems to be garbage in  \nthe case of the 300D.  I simply reset to 1 any values over 9999, and  \nstart doing my own count.\n\n\nTo make this work, I've added a new line to the CaptureParams.txt to  \ncontrol whether or not the program will overwrite existing image  \nfiles.  This must be set to 0 for proper operation with the 300D, and  \nyou'll probably want to set it to 0 for most other situations as well.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000031.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2006 at 12:08AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000031"}
