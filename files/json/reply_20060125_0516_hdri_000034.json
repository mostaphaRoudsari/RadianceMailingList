{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nGlad this works.  I really appreciate all the detailed reports of  \nyour problems with the Digital Rebel -- it made it obvious what was  \ngoing wrong, and it helps a lot to have complete information, since I  \ndon't have your camera to play with.  I think it's important to  \nsupport what I can, and the 300D is probably the most popular in  \nCanon's EOS line, so I wouldn't want to leave those people out if I  \ncan help it.  I'm just glad it wasn't something more serious in the  \nSDK, since there's no real support for it outside Japan.  I may have  \nto ask Santiago to help me if I ever need to communicate with  \nheadquarters....\n\n\nI have put together some scripts, including the RAW -> HDR converter  \nI've been playing with in a more complete package on my website.   \nIt's linked into my front page <www.anyhere.com> where the old hdrgen  \nlink for Mac OS X used to be.  (You may have to hit your browser's  \n\"Reload\" button to see it.)  I just finished a \"canoncap\" script that  \nruns CanonHDRcap and hdrgen for you.\n\n\nCheck it out:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/html/gward/pickup/HDRcapOSX.tar.gz\n\n\nI figured it was easier just to put it all together for OS X users,  \nrather than maintaining a whole bunch of separate links.  A  \nREADME.txt file hopefully explains enough to get you started.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000034.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2006 at 05:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000034"}
