{"body": "Hi Trent,\n\n\nI believe one of the problems with the Nikons is that each camera uses a \ndifferint API. I quote below from an earlier post from Greg on the topic:\n\n\n> Rob G. asked about Nikon cameras, and we did look at them originally,  \n> but there were two things that led us to use the Canon 5D.  One was  \n> the fact that we needed to capture full 180-degree circular fisheye  \n> images, and this requires a full-frame sensor.  The second was the  \n> way Nikon created a separate SDK with a different programming  \n> interface for every model camera, which makes supporting more than  \n> one a real pain.  It's a shame, though, because we have this really  \n> awesome f/2.8 Nikkor fisheye lens, and the adaptor ring that's  \n> supposed to mount Nikon lenses on Canon bodies doesn't work for this  \n> particular lens.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Trentacoste wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000036.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 25, 2006 at 05:03PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000036"}
