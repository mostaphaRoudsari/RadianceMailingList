{"body": "Hi Trent,\n\n\nThe other thing I didn't mention about Nikon is that they deliver  \ntheir software APIs on about 15 CDs, after having you sign a long non- \ndisclosure agreement and mailing it in, making it a bit of a pain to  \nget started.\n\n\nI wouldn't bother to make a plug-in architecture for what I have, but  \nI'm happy to supply source code to anyone who is interested in  \ndeveloping an interface for their camera.  There isn't much to the  \nprogram, really.  The only thing that it does that's worth anything  \nis the code to extract pixels from the thumbnails.\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic pointed out that I misquoted the URL for the capture  \nsoftware, which is actually at:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/HDRcapOSX.tar.gz\n\n\nAlso, I forgot to include the README.txt file, which I've appended to  \nthis e-mail for those who found the link and download what was there  \nalready.  (I added it to the archive just now, so new downloads  \nshould get it.)  As the README explains, only the CanonHDRcap  \napplication and the canoncap script are Canon-specific.  Of these,  \nthe canoncap script is easy enough to modify, but you need a  \nscriptable program to operate your camera remotely for it to do  \nanything useful.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000041.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2006 at 11:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000017", "id": "hdri_000041"}
