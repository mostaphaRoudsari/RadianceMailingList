{"body": "Hi Lisa,\n\n\nWhat I've noticed in Photoshop CS2's \"Merge to HDR\" function is that  \nthey try to preserve some of the \"character\" of the original image.   \nTo do this, they would have to maintain the camera's tone curve,  \nwhich is impossible if your goal is to obtain a scene-referred HDR  \nresult. In other words, they set conflicting goals for their process,  \nand the result is something that satisfies neither goal very well.\n\n\nI do HDR captures with my Olympus 4040 all the time, but I don't  \nattempt to do stitching.  The biggest problem with non-SLR cameras is  \nthat they tend to suffer much more from lens flare, since their  \noptics are not up to 35 mm standards.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000042.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2006 at 11:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000039", "id": "hdri_000042"}
