{"body": "Martin,\n\n\nUnfortunately, the plug-in I have is a commercially unavailable beta. It was written to test the viability of using the Nikon FC-E8 and FC-E9  spherical lenses for spherical HDR capture.   I obtained it as part of the research I was doing as the Team Leader of the Pixel Corp's 2003 HDR Team.\n\n\nI do my cropping and dewarping in Photoshop (still using V7)...I keep everything in registration by stacking my exposures for each position on top of each other, each on it's own layer.   Then I crop to a square that just hugs the spherical image, de-warp each layer, and save out to a TIF.   This gives me the perfectly registered and identically cropped images necessary to use Stitcher.\n\n\nLisa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "L.Yimm", "created_at": "January 26, 2006 at 12:27AM", "created_by": "L.Yimm", "parent_id": "hdri_000040", "id": "hdri_000043"}
