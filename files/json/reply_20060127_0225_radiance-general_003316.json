{"body": "I agree, nice resource...\n\n\nI ordered a CDROM myself :)\n\n\nOnce upon a time i had a cdrom from a 'parts' vendor, that offered all their \nproducts in DXF format, so you could order the right part. ( screws, pipe, \nfittings.. etc )\n\n\nLeft the CD behind when i left the job, damned if i can remember who they \nwere. Having a 'standard library' again would be great.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003316.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tony", "created_at": "January 27, 2006 at 02:25AM", "created_by": "Tony", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003310", "id": "radiance-general_003316"}
