{"body": "Hi Erico,\n\n\ndid you erase the p-map files(pipe80.gpm,pipe80.cpm) between the two \nvariants(with and without the diffusor)?\n\n\nIf not, you used the same photon distribution for both cases and \ntherefore end up with the same illuminance values.\n\n\nIf you erased the files, what are the parameters for trans you used?\n\n\nJan\n\n\nErico Rosa wrote:\n\n\n> Hi folks,\n>\n> I have built a scene where a 5.6m tall cylinder is piping sunlight \n> (solar altitude: 80) inside a 5-meter radius sphere (bubble).
