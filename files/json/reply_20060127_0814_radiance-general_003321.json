{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\n  Those images are so kewl!  Amazing.  But, they just whet my appetite for more information.  What is the polygon count?  Rendering time?  Size of .amb file?  Origin of software used to generate the model?  Any more?\n\n\n  And, what is the link to your benchmark web site again?\n\n\n  Thanks,\n  -Chas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2006 20:35:13 -0500 (EST)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003321.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Charles Ehrlich", "created_at": "January 27, 2006 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003317", "id": "radiance-general_003321"}
