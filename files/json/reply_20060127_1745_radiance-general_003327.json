{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nWhen I say \"same measurements\" for every point, I meant that I have the\nsame number (around 140 lux) for every point.\nSince rtrace is running fast, I actually make new octrees, and photon\ndistribution files for every round (new file names) so I don't mix\nthings up and keep track of the changes. Rtrace - without the diffuser\nand the same parameters from the first message - returned (by degree): \n\n\n00 > 11.1955674\n10 > 8.8419795\n20 > 8.90784897\n30 > 6.83318662\n40 > 7.42337007\n50 > 6.62742577\n60 > 9.50036401\n70 > 14.0475395\n80 > 1939.93779 (hot spot)\n90 > 23.4809313\n100 > 1893.626 (hot spot)\n110 > 18.7999635\n120 > ...\n\n\nThat's about what I expected. Then I ran another (new) rtrace with the\ndiffuser/trans material below (I tried to keep it simple) and rtrace\nreturned the 140 lux for every point mentioned above:\n\n\nvoid trans mat_dif\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0.8 0\n\n\nSo, my guess is that trans is scattering light evenly inside the sphere,\nwhich is odd since the diffuser is pointing down.\n\n\nErico\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003327.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erico Rosa", "created_at": "January 27, 2006 at 05:45PM", "created_by": "Erico_Rosa", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003318", "id": "radiance-general_003327"}
