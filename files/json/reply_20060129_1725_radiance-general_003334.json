{"body": "Hi Will,\n\n\nYou are correct that attachment sizes are limited on the mailing  \nlist, and people usually post JPEG images on a website somewhere when  \nthey want to share, if they have the option.\n\n\nPlease do send me your .pic file, so I can see what you're talking  \nabout.\n\n\nRegarding pfilt, unless you use the -1 option, pfilt makes two passes  \non the file and applies and automatic scaling factor, which the -e  \noption can modify.  This should be explained in the man page, which  \ncomes with the distribution or may be found on the Radiance website at:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/whatis.html\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003334.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 29, 2006 at 05:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003302", "id": "radiance-general_003334"}
