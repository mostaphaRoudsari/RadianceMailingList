{"body": "Hi Will,\n\n\nThe reason you are seeing jagged edges to your spot is because the  \ndefault \"direct jitter\" or \"-dj\" setting for rtcontrib is 0.5.  (You  \nmay discover all the default values by typing \"rtcontrib - \ndefaults\".)  For spotlight's, the edges can be particularly strong,  \nand I don't generally recommend this type unless you couple it with a  \nlight output distribution and set the cut-off past the natural cut- \noff of the fixture -- unless of course you are simply going for an  \nartistic effect.\n\n\nThe -u+ option is recommended for rtcontrib, particularly when you  \nare using it to render images, because the correlations between  \nvalues will show up in odd ways on a 2-D image that would not be  \nnoticeable in a 1-D sample sequence.  This is why your original  \nrendering looks so odd.\n\n\nAs for the -e option of pfilt, it is used as an additional multiplier  \nif auto-exposure is employed with the default -2 (pass) operation, so  \nit is not completely overridden.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003336.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 29, 2006 at 07:46PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003302", "id": "radiance-general_003336"}
