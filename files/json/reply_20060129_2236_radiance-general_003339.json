So you should not use a spotlight if you want\nto create a downlight in your scene and get realistic results.\n\n\nYou can modify the output distribution (and with this the \"edge\"\nof the beam) of a spotlight with measured data and get a better\nrepresentation of a real world fixture. But you have to use a\nspotlight angle that exceeds the angle of the fixture the data\nwas taken from or anything beyond the angle of the spotlight\nwill just be black.\n\n\nExample: If your data shows a beam angle of 30 deg for the\nfixture use an angle of more than 30 deg for the spotlight (add\n5 or 10 deg to be sure you won't cut of small amounts of light\nat the rim).\n\n\n\n\nhth,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003339.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 29, 2006 at 10:36PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003302", "id": "radiance-general_003339"}
