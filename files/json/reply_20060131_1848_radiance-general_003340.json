{"body": "What's the best way to get a sky with a cloud texture map in Radiance \n(assuming\nthe cloud texture map is already \"sphericized\")?  I've tried applying a \nCOLORPICT pattern onto\nthe sky SOURCE  but it doesn't work (I get black).  I assume this is \nbecause the UV\ncoordinates aren't available in the same way (with Lu, Lv) that works \nwith mesh objects.\n\n\nI've also tried making a polygonal mesh sky dome. That's easily textured \nbut creates other problems\n(shadows and other lighting effects on the sky) .\n\n\nThanks for any help or guidance on how to do this sort of thing! \n\n\n\n\n- Bob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003340.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bob Coyne", "created_at": "January 31, 2006 at 06:48PM", "created_by": "Bob_Coyne", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003341", "id": "radiance-general_003340"}
