After some housecleaning, maintenance and the usual backup I  \nsuccessfully upgraded to 10.4.4.\n\n\nSurprise! Your HDRcapOSX.app worked right away... (okay, there was a  \nconnection hiccup at first, but I power-cycled the DSLR and then it  \nwas golden). Pretty minimal, but it got my tethered Canon clicking  \naway in no time. I have some questions about the operation, but that  \nwill be a separate email.\n\n\nSomething I also noticed when I unarchived the TAR in 10.4.4 was that  \na particular file (CanonHDRcap.app.BdF) was mis-named on extraction  \nin 10.3 and 10.2, resulting in *two* \"CanonHDRcap.app\" files (one of  \nwhich would be appended with a \".1\" or \"_1\" depending on the  \nextraction method).\n\n\nThinking the extraction might be the culprit, I copied this 10.4  \nextracted set of files to 10.2 and had the same old error of  \n\"Application Launch Failure. The application \"(null)\" could not be  \nlaunched because of a shared library error: \")<CanonHDRcap>  \n<CanonHDRcap> <RCSDKCarbon> <>\". So I think there is something in  \nthe .app that is not cool in 10.2.8 (and maybe not 10.3.9, but that's  \ngone now...)\n\n\nLet me know if anyone else can get CanonHDRcap.app to work under  \nanything other than 10.4! But, hey, it's working! Supercoolness...\n\n\n-Mark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-February/000054.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Banas", "created_at": "February 03, 2006 at 03:07AM", "created_by": "Mark_Banas", "parent_id": "hdri_000051", "id": "hdri_000054"}
