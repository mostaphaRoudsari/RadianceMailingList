{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nI thought I had explained this at some point, but I guess not....\n\n\nCanonHDRcap works as you surmised, but only looks at the image  \nthumbnails, not the whole image (which would take too long).  As a  \nresult, it doesn't always pick the right exposure to start with -- if  \nyour bright spot takes up less than a pixel in the thumbnail, it may  \nchoose a shutter speed that's slower than it should to start.\n\n\nThe application actually keeps the exposure right before the one that  \nwas blown out, so sometimes you can capture this by setting a  \n*larger* search step.  This also makes the capture sequence faster.   \nYou may end up with a bit of a jump between the shortest exposure and  \nthe next-longest, but you're more likely to capture that peak.  I  \nwouldn't recommend a search step greater than 4, in any case.\n\n\nI could be persuaded to add a parameter for the starting shutter  \nspeed.  If set to some positive value, CanonHDRcap would then start  \nfrom the specified speed rather than doing its search.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-February/000056.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 03, 2006 at 04:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000055", "id": "hdri_000056"}
