{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI suspect that the corners of your image are not specified in the  \nproper coordinates, or are not the right corners -- assuming you used  \nthe -p option to macbethcal.  Remember that the y-coordinate from  \nPhotosphere is reversed from that produced by ximage, which is what  \nmacbethcal expects...\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  If you're still stuck, send me your image and I'll see what I  \ncan do with it.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003353.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 05, 2006 at 07:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003352", "id": "radiance-general_003353"}
