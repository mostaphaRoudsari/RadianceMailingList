{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nGlad you got it working.  My experience with macbethcal is that the  \nsimple linearization plus 3x3 matrix transform employed works well  \nwith common scanners, but less so with digital cameras, who seem to  \nuse more exotic color mappings (probably 3-D lookup tables).  My  \nefforts to make a more general tool based on lookup tables didn't go  \nso well, so I tabled it (haha).\n\n\nMy best advice is to shoot in RAW mode if you want precise color.   \nThere is much less to go wrong, as dcraw.c and Photoshop use a simple  \ncolor matrix transform to go from the sensor space to sRGB, and  \nproduce fairly consistent colors in my tests.  I know I said a lot of  \ndisparaging things about RAW, and I still don't care for it as a  \ngeneral concept, but unfortunately the camera manufacturers don't  \nprovide any other reasonable path for accurate color at the moment.   \nThey're much more focused on getting the consumer \"preferred\" look.   \n(That will be my next rant.)  I've also found RAW to be a good path  \nto absolute luminance values, but only for some cameras.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003356.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2006 at 02:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003352", "id": "radiance-general_003356"}
