{"body": "Dear Alex,\n\n\nI am resending to the group since this might be of wider interest.\n\n\nA new Daysim version will be out within the next two weeks that should\nequally work under Windows and Linux. We had a really inspiring 3 day\nworkshop on Ecotect/Radiance/Daysim at MIT last week, and I learnt from\nover 30 individuals first-hand what can go wrong during a Daysim\ninstallation. I have put in some more tests to make sure that the new\nrelease will install properly. During the workshop, we used a beta\nversion of Ecotect ver5.5 that Andrew Marsh kindly provided for workshop\nparticipants. I can assure all of you that Andrew did a splendid job\nwith the new interface. The new Ecotect release should help to\nconsiderably widen the Radiance community. He put in a direct export\ninto Daysim so that it becomes easier to use as well.\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "February 06, 2006 at 04:37PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003305", "id": "radiance-general_003360"}
