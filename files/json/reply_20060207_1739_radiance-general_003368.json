{"body": "Jack-\n\n\nThere is a paper in the SIGGRAPH 2000 proceedings called \"Towards a\nPsychophisically-Based Light Reflection Model for Image Synthesis\" by\nPellacini, Ferwerda, and Greenberg that looks at using visually\nevaluated measurements to formulate a model for gloss.\n\n\nThey relate their visually measured parameters to the phyically based\nparameters used in Radiance.  I'm not sure how it relates to other gloss\nparameters or how it would actually work if you tried to use it (I\nhaven't), but it might be worth a look.\n\n\nLet me know if you can't get hold of the paper...\n\n\n-Matt\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003368.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Matt Franks", "created_at": "February 07, 2006 at 05:39PM", "created_by": "Matt_Franks", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003363", "id": "radiance-general_003368"}
