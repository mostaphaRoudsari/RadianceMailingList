{"body": "Jack,\n\n\nActually, my knowledge of Perl is also rather limited, at least as far \nas anything too complex goes, but file manipulations I can do just fine. \nMainly what I'm trying to do is just take a simple text file that \nrtcontrib spits out and then manipulate that data. I'm not sure if I'm \njust not parsing the data correctly or if the file is just too large and \nmy computer is dying trying to run my inefficient algorithms, but Perl \nseems to be failing me for the moment. I'm sure there are faster/easier \nways to do this than what I'm currently trying, but for now I'm kinda \njust sticking to what I know how to do. Perhaps I will try Python \nthough. Can anyone direct me to any good books about programming with \nPython? Also, I will have to look into trying to directly interface with \nrcalc as this sounds much easier and much more efficient than all the \nintermediate steps I'm taking.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave\n\n\nJack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003371.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "J.
