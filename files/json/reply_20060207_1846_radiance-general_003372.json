{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nI don't want to discourage you from reading this paper, because it's  \nreally nice, but I don't think it will help in getting meaningful  \nvalues from gloss measurements.  I almost mentioned it myself in my  \nreply, but was too rushed to go look up the reference.\n\n\nAs for material type, you are better off using \"metal\" if the  \nmetallic paint has a strong color to it, as they usually do.  If you  \nwant to see the clear coat as well, you can try a mixfunc between  \nmetal and plastic.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003372.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 07, 2006 at 06:46PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003363", "id": "radiance-general_003372"}
