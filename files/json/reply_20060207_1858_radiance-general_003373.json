{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI can think of a few things to consider:\n\n\n   1. first off rather than using a big/huge data file to test your\n      script, it would be much better to use a very small data set (10\n      lines of data perhaps) that you can use to check that your script\n      is working\n   2. I am not sure that switching scripting languages is necessarily\n      the best thing to do as this just means there is more to\n      learn/control. Note though that the O'Reilly books on Perl and\n      other languages are really good.\n   3. perhaps there is a way to do what you want more simply (eg such as\n      directly with rcalc), if you can give us more of an idea of what\n      you are trying to do then you may get back some good suggestions\n      for doing what you want. rcalc is the real radiance workhorse for\n      processing data. The issue may be in figuring out how to code up\n      you algorithm in radiance's native functional language.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003373.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 07, 2006 at 06:58PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003365", "id": "radiance-general_003373"}
