{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nThere are no curves. It\u0092s a straight 6-meter-long hollow mirror pipe\nwith a diameter of 1 meter (fairly large). I've based these\ntransmittances on a study by Zastrow and Wittwer:\n\n\nTransmittance of pipe = radius of pipe ^ [(length of pipe/tangent of\nsolar angle)/(pi x diameter of pipe/4)], which gave me the numbers I've\nmentioned.\n\n\nThanks for the pointers! I actually requested TracePro sometime ago but\nthe trial version doesn't allow me to attach any materials, which was\nquite upsetting. I could try to contact them for a sponsorship for this\nfairly expensive piece of software, although I was hoping the photon map\nwould do the job...\n\n\nErico Naves Rosa\nDoctor of Design Candidate\nHarvard Design School\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003376.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erico Rosa", "created_at": "February 07, 2006 at 11:43PM", "created_by": "Erico_Rosa", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003374", "id": "radiance-general_003376"}
