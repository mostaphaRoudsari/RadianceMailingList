{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nThanks again for the help. I realize early on the need for the surface\nand my measuring points match the ring surface (plastic, 0.1 0.1 0.1 0\n0) on the bottom of the pipe. On the other hand, the pipe is open at the\ntop (well, there is the antimatter ring port on the top). Would clear\nglass do the job on the top?\n\n\nI am reading some of the early threads on the issue and on a previous\nmessage you mentioned:\n\n\n\"The quick instruction is:\n\n\n0. You can use the standard radiance description (except user defined \nBRDFs). ->rad and oct\n1. To distribute photon and store them in files (global and caustic\nphotons separately). e.g.\n~/bin/radiance/pmap/mkpmap  -apg f81_z.gp 700000 -apc f81_z.cp 700000 \ntest.oct\n700000 is the number of the photos emitted, gp : global photons, cp\ncaustic photons\n2. Count the photons, make a density estimate and generate a picture\nwith the modified rpict:\n~/bin/radiance/pmap/rpict -apg f81_z.gp 500 -apc f81_z.cp 500 -ab 1 -x \n1200 -y 1200 -vf test.vf -o test.pic  test.oct\"\n\n\n\n\nHow would I 'count' the photons and make a density estimate?\nErico\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003378.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erico Rosa", "created_at": "February 08, 2006 at 01:09AM", "created_by": "Erico_Rosa", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003374", "id": "radiance-general_003378"}
