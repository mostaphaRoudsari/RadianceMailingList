{"body": "Hi Dave,\n\n\nI`ve also been using Perl to handle rtcontrib recently and it worked,  \nalthough I used 10 illuminance points at most, and was only using  \nmonochrome scenes, so I was using only one of the three values.\nBut AFAIK , Perl should be quite efficient handling lots of data. If  \nit is a memory problem you are having, maybe Python won`t be the  \nsolution either.\nBelow is part of the script I used. I`m not really a programer  \n(you`ll see), but this worked for me.\nhope it helps,\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsystem (\"time rtcontrib -I+ -h -ab 5 -ad 10000 -as 100 -lw 0.0001 - \naa .1 -ar 300 -dt 0 -ds 0 -b 0 -o suncomp.dat -M suns.lst -f  \ntregenza_h.cal -b tbin -o skycomp.dat -m skyglow scene.oct < test.dat\");\n\n\nopen (SUC, \"$base/suncomp.dat\") or die \"cannot open SUC $!\";\nopen (SKC, \"$base/skycomp.dat\") or die \"cannot open SKC $!\";\n\n\n# there are two points @test.dat > #0 vert illum, #1 horiz illum\nfor $i (0..1) {\n\n\n\t$lsuc[$i] = <SUC>; chomp $lsuc[$i];\n\t$lskc[$i] = <SKC>; chomp $lskc[$i];\n}\n\n\nclose SUC; close SKC;\nsystem (\"rm suncomp.dat skycomp.dat\");\n\n\n# weather data > calculated average luminance from each patch for  \neach hour, etc.\nopen (TKI, \"tokyo_contribs.dat\") or die \"cannot open TKI $!\";\n\n\nwhile ($line=<TKI>) {\n\n\n\tchomp $line;\n\t@meteo = split (/,/,$line);\n\n\n\t# HORIZ ILLUM #\n\tfor $i (1..1) { # test point #1 for horizontal illuminance, add  \nother points here\n\n\n\t\t@soles = split (/\\t/, $lsuc[$i]); # array with contribs from suns\n\t\t@cielo = split (/\\t/, $lskc[$i]); # array with contribs from sky  \npatches\n\n\n\t\t# calculate illuminance from sun\n\t\t$horz = $soles[$dato*3] * $meteo[116]  / 0.00005981;\n\n\n\t\t# add illuminance from sky patches\n\t\t# sky was divided in 113 patches > diff from tregenza\n\t\tfor $j (1..113) {\n\n\n\t\t\t#depends on the definition of the weather file\n\t\t\t$horz += $cielo[($j*3)+1] * $meteo[$j+3];\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb 8, 2006, at 2:40 AM, J.
