If so, all you \nshould have to do is install the developer tools (called XCode now, and \navailable on Apple's website), INCLUDING the X11 dev stuff, and run the \nmakeall script specifying OSX as the operating system.  The Macs don't \ncome with all the compilation stuff outta the box because most Mac users \ndon't compile software.  But the beauty of the Macintosh/OSX marriage is \nthat if you do want to do that stuff, it's all supported.  Let me know \nif you still have trouble, but it should be pretty easy once all the \ncompilers & libraries are installed (which is a simple download and a \ndouble-click).\n\n\n>PS: Windows forever:)\n>  \n>\nBlasphemy!   Boooo!   Hissssss!!!!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003387.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 08, 2006 at 09:47PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003386", "id": "radiance-general_003387"}
