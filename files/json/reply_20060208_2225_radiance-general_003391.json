I suppose it's OS X and it's\na more recent version (10.3 or 10.4).\n\n\nYou should install the XCode 2 application \"bundle\" (probably on\nthe second DVD or via download from Apple). I don't remember\ninstalling any additional software for compiling Radiance.\n\n\n> Also, when I use the pre-installed binaries, 'ximage' is missing the\n> file /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib.

It's not installed by default.\nI use the one bundled with OS X (on the first DVD, you have to\nselect it manually). IIRC you can use another X11 server like\nX.org as well. I wouldn't bother, though.\n\n\nBefore you start rvu or any other X11 application you have to\nstart the server first or the app will not find a server to\nconnect to.\n\n\n> Christoph\n>\n> PS: Windows forever:)\n\n\nJehova, Jehova ...\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003391.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 08, 2006 at 10:25PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003386", "id": "radiance-general_003391"}
