{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nI came across this problem when compiling Radiance under Interix.  I\nresolved it by commenting out these three lines near the top of the file\npersist.c:\n\n\ntypedef void (sighandler_t)(int);\nstatic sighandler_t sig_io;\nstatic sighandler_t sig_alrm;\n\n\nI should warn you that I didn't look into the problem too deeply, so\nthat may or may not be the best solution!\n\n\nThere are a couple of other problems you might want to watch out for (I\nran into these when compiling an older version of Radiance so maybe\nyou'll be ok with the most recent version).  \n\n\nI had a problem compiling the tiff library (in ray/src/px/tiff).  The\nproblem was caused by the config.guess file which didn't recognise\nInterix.  I found an updated version elsewhere which I can send to you\nif you need it.  \n\n\nFinally, I found that I was getting some very strange results from rpict\n(see\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/0002\n53.html).  The problem seemed to be caused by Interix's implementation\nof the frexp() function.  At the time there was an alternative version\nof that function with the Radiance source which fixed the problem.  It\nseems that the alternative was removed from the Radiance source at some\npoint since then, so that option is no longer available.  You might have\na more recent version of Interix that does not require the fix (you will\nknow if you have the problem because all of the images produced by rpict\nwill be obviously wrong).  Personally I switched to using Cygwin.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nAndy Stone\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000676.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy Stone", "created_at": "February 10, 2006 at 12:24PM", "created_by": "Andy_Stone", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000675", "id": "radiance-dev_000676"}
