{"body": "Thanks for the info Andy. I did do a keyword search on 'Interix' and it \nseemed like Greg and yourself took your correspondence out of this forum so \nI am unsure of what became of this. Hey, at least you had some success in \ngetting your code to compile. I am not even there yet.\n\n\nI do not know if I want to start commenting out statements within the source \ncode. This is like having a rattling bolt in your car engine or suspension \nand just haphazardly removing it in order to alleviate the situation without \nknowing if you removed a critical part. I do want a stable, robust solution \nto this problem (if it exists at all). I asked a question some time ago \nabout compiling programs on SFU on Interop System's forum. One of the gurus \nthere said \"Read through the FAQ's about porting stuff; what options to \ndefine (\"-D\") etc. It makes a big difference, particularly WRT to header \nfiles. Interix aims to be SUS compliant.\"  The section in the FAQ that he \nwas alluding to I believe is this:\n\n\n\n\nUsing GNU\u0092s configure\nWhen using GNU's configure script to configure a build environment for an \napplication it is suggested that you set the following environment variables \nbefore running configure.\n        CFLAGS=\"-D_ALL_SOURCE -D_REENTRANT\"\n        CPPFLAGS=\"-D_ALL_SOURCE -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/local/include\"\n        LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\nIf GNU's configure complains that the type of system is not recognized then \nyou need to update the file \"config.guess.\" Some applications have multiple \ncopies of \"config.guess\" so be sure to find all of them. An updated \n\"config.guess\" can be downloaded from \n\"ftp://ftp.interopsystems.com/pub/config.guess\". You may also need to update \nyour LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS if you are using shared object libraries (DSOs), but \nthis is likely already done for you if you have installed a /Tools packaged \nlibrary.\n\n\nI don't know if this will help but I guess it\u0092s worth a shot. Can anyone \nprovide some insight as to what all of this means?\n\n\nI assume that you compiled Radiance using gcc. I am doing the same although \nI may try to port it to Windows using Microsoft\u0092s C compiler later in the \nfuture (if it is at all possible). There is also a beta version of gcc 4.0 \navailable for Interix on Interop System's FTP site. This is something worth \nlooking in to but I do not believe that this will help my situation. I think \nthe problems that I am having are related SFU's standard libraries.\n\n\nBefore giving up on this all together, I really would like to evaluate \nInterix as a Windows solution for Radiance. Since it does support a NFS, I \nmay be able to finally utilize multiple processors via rpiece. Thanks for \nyour suggestions.\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000678.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "February 10, 2006 at 10:21PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000675", "id": "radiance-dev_000678"}
