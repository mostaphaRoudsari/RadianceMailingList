I tested obj2mesh recently and it work for my\nfile (tested smooth shading only).\n\n\nDoes your CAD app provide vertex normals and uv texture coords?\nobj2mesh does not generate it's own coordinates but only translates\nthose found in the file.\n\n\nI don't know much about the *obj file format so the following\ninstructions may not be correct:\n\n\nTo check vertex normals open your *.obj file with a text editor.\nFor every line starting with \"v \" there should be a \"vn \"\nline for the vertex normal direction. This alone is no\nprove but it shows the normals are exported. I don't know\nif *.obj _requires_ normals for each vertex. They still could\nbe face normals which would show no smoothing effect.\n\n\nTo check UV-coordinates check the lines starting with \"f \".\nThe three or four sets of numbers have the form\n\n\n<vertex index>/<uv-coord>/<vertex normal>\n\n\nIf no uv-coord is present the field will be empty (like \"1//1\").\n\n\n\n\nIf your app does not provide uv-coords and normals you could\nuse a 3D modeler with DXF import to convert your geometry to\n*.obj files. For simple DXF files Blender (www.blender.org)\ncan do that.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003401.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 15, 2006 at 01:57PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003400", "id": "radiance-general_003401"}
