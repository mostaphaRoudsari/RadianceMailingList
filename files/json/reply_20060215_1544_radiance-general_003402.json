Sorry to nitpick, but all of the numbers in the face 'f' lines are\nindexes. The preceding 'v' lines define vertex coordinates (x,y,z), the\n'vt' lines defined texture coordinates (u,v), and 'vn' lines defined\nnormals (x,y,z).\n\n\ne.g\nv 0.485127 -1.896 1.33107\n...\nvt 4.03466 -0.392051\n...\nvn -0.0165774 -0.999061 0.0400231\n...\nf  352/1/1 358/2/1 364/3/1\n\n\nAll indexes start from 1. If there are no texture coordinates or a surface\nnormal for a face, those fields are left blank like you showed.\n\n\ne.g\nf 352// 358// 364//\n\n\nIs this what you're seeing, Nicholas? If it is, you have to find a way to\nproduce a .obj file with this information. I can't be of much help\nthere. Otherwise obj2mesh and Radiance have nothing to work on. Then your\nonly option is to write your own functions for texture mapping and normal\nsmoothing.\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003402.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "February 15, 2006 at 03:44PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003400", "id": "radiance-general_003402"}
