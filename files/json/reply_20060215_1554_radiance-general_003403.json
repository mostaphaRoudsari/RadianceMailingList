If you are not \nconcerned with texture coordinates, you could use a small tool \nof mine to generate surface normal vectors on a OBJ file. The \nprogram is called \"rocksmooth\" and it is in my \"rocktools\" \npackage, available at:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/rocktools/\n\n\nIf you find that your modeller does not output texture or normal \nindexes, rocktools can read it and create just the normal vectors \nand indexes.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003403.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "February 15, 2006 at 03:54PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003400", "id": "radiance-general_003403"}
