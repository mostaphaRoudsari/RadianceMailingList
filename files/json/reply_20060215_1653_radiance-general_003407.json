{"body": "Cool!  Yeah - UV Mapper is pretty nice - try playing around with the  \nactual UV maps that it can create too - the export of the map itself  \nis a nice feature (no need for taking screenshots of the UV mesh to  \npaint textures and patterns on).  I have not actually tried the \"Pro\"  \nversion (that costs money) but I am going to look into its additional  \nfeatures.  Unwrapping a complex object by hand so the UV map is  \nminimally distorted is sort of a drag.\n\n\nGlad it worked,\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
