{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nThis may be my fault -- I made a recent change to clean up the build  \nprocedure in src/common, and it might not be working on your machine  \nfor some reason.  Please send me the output of \"rmake install\" in  \nyour src/common directory, so I can figure out what's going on.  It  \nworks for me under OS X.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000680.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 15, 2006 at 05:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000679", "id": "radiance-dev_000680"}
