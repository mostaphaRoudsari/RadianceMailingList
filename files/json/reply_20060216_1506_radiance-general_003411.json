{"body": "An alternative approach would be to use \"transdata\" or \"transfunc\" to model the roller blind using a single polygon. Of course, this would require one to measure or estimate the angle dependent direct hemispherical transmittance of the system. This information can be retrieved through integrating sphere measurements. Ad hoc, I do not see why a roller blinds system should exhibit the angular transmittance properties of a single glass pane. Maybe someone more qualified could comment on this?\n\n\nIf you are not sure how to use trans or transdata, we have done a Radiance validation study for this kind of work, comparing the trans and transdata models to measurements in a full scale mock-up. The results will be most likely be published in a special issue on 'Daylighting' in Energy and Buildings in June 2006. Anybody interested in a sneak preview of the paper, drop me a line.\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003411.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "February 16, 2006 at 03:06PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003408", "id": "radiance-general_003411"}
