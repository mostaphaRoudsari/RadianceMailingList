{"body": "Hi Christian,\n\n\nSorry for the slow reply.  I was hoping someone else would field  \nthis, then I forgot about it.\n\n\nRadiance does not use the NTSC color space.  By default, it uses the  \nprimaries you found after the NTSC ones in color.h.  There is a  \nhistory to the WHTEFFICACY value, which is explained (more or less)  \nin the old Radiance Digests.  See:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n0.html#LUMFACTOR\n\n\nThe bottom line is that the peak efficacy of 683 lumens/watt is only  \nthe right value at 555 nm, and a poor approximation to the efficacy  \nover the visible spectrum.  In the end it doesn't matter what factor  \nyou use, as you divide by it going from photometric units to radiance  \nand multiply again coming out.  In other words, the factor goes away.\n\n\nIf you want to change the notion of what RGB colors Radiance uses,  \nthere is no formal way to do this.  You just do it.  You specify your  \nsources and materials in your desired RGB space, and Radiance doesn't  \nreally care what color space it's working in.  To work properly with  \nvarious programs that properly interpret Radiance RGBE images, you  \nshould probably add a line of the form:\n\n\nPRIMARIES= .603 .352 .289 .590 .146 .066 .319 .348\n\n\nwhere these numbers correspond to xr yr xg yg xb yb xw yw,  \nrespectively.  To add a line to a Radiance image, you can use the  \nvinfo script.\n\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003412.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 17, 2006 at 08:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003398", "id": "radiance-general_003412"}
