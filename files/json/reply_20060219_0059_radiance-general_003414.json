{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI am not sure that I can answer everything here. But I will offer what I \ncan. I believe that the recovery mode does operate as one (1) process \nnot multiple. It would be too difficult to keep track of what is being \nrecovered if there were multiple processes, rather with one process it \njust steps through to pick up anything that is unfinished. I believe \nthat it is checking for .unf frames not .pic filtered frames.\n\n\nHope this helps a bit.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003414.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 19, 2006 at 12:59AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003413", "id": "radiance-general_003414"}
