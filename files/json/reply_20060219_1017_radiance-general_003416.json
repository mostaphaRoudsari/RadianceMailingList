{"body": "Hello,\n\n\n> In your case, it might be better to manually start rpict -ro on each\n> of the failed frames on separate nodes in your cluster, so the\n> processes are not run in serial.\n\n\nI agree with Greg, and I think you can launch rpict -ro directly\non your \"master\" node and wait for automatic migration, \nor use the \"runon\" or \"migrate\" scripts to move the jobs to your\npreferred nodes, if necessary.\n\n\nIn my experience, for separate single frame renderings with radiance\nand openmosix I launch the rendering jobs from the same machine\nwith shell scripts or rad -N.\n\n\nI use a sequence of rpiece commands like this\nmosrun -t 1 -d 700 rpiece @args &\nmosrun -t 1 -d 700 rpiece @args &\n...\n\n\nto distribute a large image rendering over my cluster.\n\n\nHTH,\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003416.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "February 19, 2006 at 10:17AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003413", "id": "radiance-general_003416"}
