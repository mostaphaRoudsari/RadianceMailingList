{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> I agree with Greg, and I think you can launch rpict -ro directly\n> on your \"master\" node and wait for automatic migration,\n> or use the \"runon\" or \"migrate\" scripts to move the jobs to your\n> preferred nodes, if necessary.\n\n\nI usually start all jobs on my local node and let them get migrated. \nThis will usually take some minutes, but as the rendering time for a \npicture is better described in weeks than days at the moment, the \nstartup time is not important as longs as the nodes do not run out of \nmemory. Also I think I should write a small how-to, as this way of \ndistributing renderings works really nice (as long as the network is \nstable, else the ssh or former rsh way is more fault tolerant).\n\n\nI started the rpict processes just the same way ranimate would do, as \nfar as I know rpict -ro will find out which view to use from the \nviewfile as this should be containes in the image header, right? So the \ncommand is\n\n\nnohup /opt/openmosix/bin/mosrun -c /opt/radiance/bin/rpict \n@stills/render.opt -w0 -ro stills/frame003.unf scene_illum.oct &\n\n\nfor the third frame. In fact, it is amazing again and again how \npowerful these small little radiance tools are, e.g. that I can recover \nthat easily...\n\n\nOne other question, did anyone use openssi with radiance? It should \neven allow to use rpict with shared memory (-PP), but I could not \ninstall it so far because it like to live in it's own network, and my \nmachines have to integrate in an existing network.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003418.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
