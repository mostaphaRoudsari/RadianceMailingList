Francesco, you had posted a \nlengthy analysis of your use of openmosix a while back, but I thought \nyour conclusion was that the performance was not worth the hassle.  I \njust re-read it and I see that my recollection is a little off.  It \nseems that if you have enough (fast) machines to dedicate to the effort, \nyou can set up a really killer rendering cluster.  I will have to delve \ninto this a bit more.  Lars & Francesco, I'd love to hear more about \nyour process(es) for doing distributed renderings.  I recently started \nusing rad -N on multiprocessor machines at work, but of course now I \nwant more. =)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003419.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 19, 2006 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003413", "id": "radiance-general_003419"}
