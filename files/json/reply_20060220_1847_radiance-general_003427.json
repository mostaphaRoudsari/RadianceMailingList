So I messed with the uv coords directly.\n\n\nNow I've tried it again after your affirmation and - voila -\nimage mapping as desired. (I think I had an additional material\ndefinition somewhere in the scene during my first tests that\nredefined all my manual changes so they never had any effect\nI could see.)\n\n\n\n\nThanks again. I knew it had to be something simple like that.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003427.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 20, 2006 at 06:47PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003417", "id": "radiance-general_003427"}
