{"body": "Interesting thing - I recently started using Blender 2.41 (from 2.37)  \nand I hadn't gotten around to reinstalling b/rad.  So I downloaded  \nthe latest and copied brad.py into the ./blender/scripts folder and  \ncp -R copied the \"brad\" directory into the ./blender/scripts  \ndirectory as well, per the install instructions.  Now, when I go to  \nBlender's \"Scripts\" interface to update the menus, the only scripts  \nthat appear in the scripts menus are the ones that are alphabetically  \nbefore brad.py, (brad is not included).  As soon as I rm brad.py and  \nthe brad directory, the Blender Scripts menu is back to normal, with  \nall of the available scripts as before.\n\n\nAny thoughts on why this happens?  if I manually load brad.py in  \nBlender (into the test window) from the Scripts directory and then  \nAlt-P (well, Option-P on the Mac) I get a console error telling me:  \nImportError: No module named brad_i18n - etc.\n\n\nMac OS X 10.4.4, G4 dual 1.25, Blender 2.41, Python 2.4 - brad.py is  \nRev 1.8 from Aug 11, 2005 (from CVS) and the rest is from brad 0.1b.   \nThe same thing happened with the brad.py file original 0.1b release,  \netc.\n\n\n\n\nThomas - pretty neat interface to brad from within Blender - I'm  \ninterested to see how this turns out.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
