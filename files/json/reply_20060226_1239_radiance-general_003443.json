{"body": "Hi Greg, hi group.\n\n\n> The other thing that costs is transforming the ray before and after \n> intersection, similar to having an octree instance (which it is).\n\n\nHm, as we are on that topic... why do we need an extra primitive for \nthese precompiled meshes? It would be so nice to treat them just like \ninstances. Obj2mesh is just some kind of a different oconv, that allows \nto get some information into the octree that would be lost if we used \nobj2rad, because radiance scene has no vocabulary for it, right?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003443.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
