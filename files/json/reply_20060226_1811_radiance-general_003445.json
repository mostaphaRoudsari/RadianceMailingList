{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI don't know quite understand how changing the struct's to union's  \nwould help in vectorizing the code -- you'll have to give me an  \nexplicit example, and this is probably one for radiance-dev.\n\n\nAs for clustering rays, this is not as easy as it may sound.  We  \nwould have to reorder the entire ray calculation in order to generate  \nbundles of dissociated rays, as otherwise you naturally get a tree  \nwith many daughter rays generated for each parent diverging in all  \ndirections in your scene.  Grouping daughters together you get almost  \nno coherence, and techniques for getting good ray bundles are fairly  \ncomplicated.  (See for example, Matt Pharr, Craig Kolb, Reid  \nGershbein, and Pat Hanrahan, \"Rendering Complex Scenes with Memory- \nCoherent Ray Tracing,\" Proc. SIGGRAPH 1997 <http:// \ngraphics.stanford.edu/papers/coherentrt/>.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003445.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 26, 2006 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003438", "id": "radiance-general_003445"}
