{"body": "OK, I see what you mean, now.  I haven't profiled the code recently,  \nbut relatively little time is spent in the matrix routines.   \nOptimizing a ray tracer is really challenging, because bottlenecks  \nare not easy to isolate.  A lot of time is spent in the various  \nmaterial shading routines, which are spread all over the place and  \nnot easy to simplify.  The only place where you can really focus  \neffort is in the actual octree traversal code, and this doesn't  \nvectorize at all.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000684.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 26, 2006 at 10:53PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000683", "id": "radiance-dev_000684"}
