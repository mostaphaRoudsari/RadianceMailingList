{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nYou mentioned that the Moller-Trumbore method required two divisions.  For \nthe code that I implemented,  I only needed one division at the end to \ndetermine the ray length. Here is the page for various versions of the \nsource code.\n\n\nhttp://www.cs.lth.se/home/Tomas_Akenine_Moller/raytri/raytri.c\n\n\n\n\nI used the one without early division. If I am correct, this code without \nearly division supports two sided objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000687.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "February 28, 2006 at 01:54AM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000682", "id": "radiance-dev_000687"}
