{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nI believe the version with one division is when you have stored the  \nsurface normal, which is fine for normal polygons in Radiance, but  \nnot for the mesh code.  For the mesh code, I would be using the  \noriginal version, which doesn't require any additional storage.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000688.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 28, 2006 at 02:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000682", "id": "radiance-dev_000688"}
