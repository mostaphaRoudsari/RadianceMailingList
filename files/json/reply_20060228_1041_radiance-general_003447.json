Didn't work but it would have been a nice shortcut for\nmaximum performance settings. Does your Intel gcc have a similar\noption (see man page)?\n\n\n> I got some errors, but at this point everything seemed to compile.\n> I'd be happy to share the errors if someone wants to tell me how\n> the heck to save the make output to a file (the errors scrolled off\n> the screen before I could read them).\n\n\nsudo ./makeall install | tee makeall.out\n\n\n(I'd include a \"man tee\" as well but the BSD man page for tee is\nrather concise.)\n\n\n> Then I installed X11 from the included CDs, and created  \n> a .bash_profile\n> file that looks like this:\n\n\nQ1: Did you have the X11 development stuff installed when you compiled\n     Radiance? IIRC it has to be selected manually.\n\n\n> PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\n\nWord of warning: It is common on Unix systems to place the non-system\npath (\"/usr/local\", \"/opt\" etc.) in front of the system path. As long\nas your only installing Radiance that's no problem. Fink or any other\npackage that provides file utils (\"mv\", \"cp\", \"rm\" ...) should be listed\nonly _after_ the system path on OS X. These tools have special knowledge\nof the OS X file system (resource forks) that common Unix/GNU binaries\ndon't have. It would cause no damage but if you copy a file on the\ncommand line you want it to appear in Finder as well. This would not\nhappen if your bash selects the fink \"cp\" because it's the first in\nthe search path.\n\n\n> RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray\n> export PATH RAYPATH\n>\n> # if we're not SSH'd in\n> if [ ! ${SSH_TTY} ]; then\n> # make sure X is running\n> if [ \"`ps -x | awk '{print $5}' | grep X11`\" = \"\" ]; then\n> open /Applications/Utilities/X11.app &\n> # then refocus Terminal.app\n> osascript -e 'tell appliction \"Terminal\" to activate'\n> fi\n> # if DISPLAY isn't set\n> if [ x${DISPLAY} = x ]; then\n> export DISPLAY=:0\n> fi\n> fi\n\n\nAny reason why you don't use\n\n\nif [ ! ${DISPLAY} ]; then\n\n\nas you did with SSH_TTY?\n\n\n> Then I was able to run some test scenes from the obj directory\n> (I haven't even begun to move all my files from my old computer),\n> and they ran fine (and fast).\n\n\nMy cat recently peed on my laptop which is the reason I have to look\nfor a new one now.
