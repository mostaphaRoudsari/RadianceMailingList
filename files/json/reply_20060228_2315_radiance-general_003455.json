{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nAlthough I agree it would be nice to have a facility for either  \ntransforming .OBJ files directly or as part of obj2mesh, there is a  \nsolution with replmarks you may not have thought about.  Rather than  \ncreating your mesh instances directly with replmarks -I, instead  \ncreate a single Radiance scene file for each mesh with the  \nappropriate scale factor.  E.g., if you had a mesh called filecab.rtm  \nthat needed to be rotated in x and scaled, you would also create a  \nfile called filecab.rad that contains:\n\n\nvoid mesh filecab\n5 filecab.rtm -rx 90 -s 0.3048\n0\n0\n\n\nThen, you can use replmarks -x filecab.rad instead of -I, and  \nreplmarks will load this file and add the other rotation and  \ntranslation arguments necessary to put the object in the right place.\n\n\nDoes this help?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003455.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 28, 2006 at 11:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003454", "id": "radiance-general_003455"}
