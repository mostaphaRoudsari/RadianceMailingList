{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nIt seems that you have the following possible options:\n\n\n   1. scale the obj file the way you want on export from what ever the\n      modeler is generating\n   2. you can add scaling and other transforms directly to the mesh\n      primitive, why not script this\n   3. can you figure out a way to guarantee that you get unit markers\n      (eg 1 unit long in x), we use unit markers all over the place and\n      do not have problems, perhaps this is a modeling/software issue?\n   4. you should be able to pipe things together so that you do not have\n      a bunch of intermediate files such as:\n\n\n        replmarks -I object.rtm  origin origin.rad | xform -s <your\n        scale factor>  > tmp.scale.rad\n        replmarks -x tmp.scale.rad new-location new-location.rad >\n        final.object.rad\n\n\nThis is not nearly as elegant as I had hoped. I cannot see how to \nconstruct one single pipeline. But nevertheless it may get the job done. \nYou would need to construct a marker object called origin in origin.rad \n(a right triangle with x of 1). The first line gets you the scaling. The \nsecond line get you the transform of the scaled object to the desired \nlocation. The ordering here is to get the scaling to occur before the \ntransform. Then tmp.scale.rad can be discarded by the script or just \noverwritten by subsequent calls for other object transforms.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003456.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 28, 2006 at 11:39PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003454", "id": "radiance-general_003456"}
