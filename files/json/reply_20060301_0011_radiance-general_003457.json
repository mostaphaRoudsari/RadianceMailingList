{"body": ">> I was thinking of writing my mesh primitive in a small file, apply \n>> xform to this and use it than with replmarks -x.\n\n\nThis was basically what Greg proposed in clear text (the \nxform-arguments of the mesh primitive, I just somehow managed to \ndescribe it 100x more complicated ;-). Jack's ideas are all right, my \nproblem is that I have existing files (many) and thus cannot change all \nmarkers. I also have files containing markers for some instances and \nreferences that come already scaled (as both obj2rad and dxf2rad \nprovide a scale option), with mappings fitting to those. So I cannot \npipe the output of replmarks. I will add a line to my script to write a \nsmall rad-file for each mesh, including the scale transformations, and \nuse that one with replmarks -x than.\n\n\nThanks, CU and good night, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003457.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
