{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThis would seem to fit within the \"non-commercial\" restrictions of  \nthe JPEG-HDR software license from BrightSide Technologies.  You can  \ndownload compiled tools for Linux, Windows, and OS X to go between  \nJPEG-HDR and Radiance RGBE formats from their website:\n\n\n\thttp://www.brightsidetech.com/products/process.php\n\n\nI have a program for OS X that reads and writes all the formats  \nunderstood by Photosphere, and allows simple resampling and  \nbrightness scaling.  It would be possible to compile it under Linux  \nwith a little work, but Windows of course is a pain in the arse...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-March/000062.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 01, 2006 at 07:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000061", "id": "hdri_000062"}
