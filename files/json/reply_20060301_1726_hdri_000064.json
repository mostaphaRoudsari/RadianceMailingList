{"body": "Hi Greg & Rafal,\n\n\nThank you both for pointing out those resources! I will definitely be  \nplaying around with them to see what I can come up with. It looks  \nlike pfstools will do most of what I need (as long as I can handle a  \nmakefile or two -  hey, I'm just an artist), and I think I'll contact  \nBrightside just to make sure I'm on the non-commercial side of the  \nfence regarding JPEG HDR.\n\n\nSo outside of Photosphere and pfsview, are there any other JPEG HDR  \nviewers available yet? (Not that I mind recommending that visitors  \nget Photosphere, but building pfsview.exe might be a bit much for  \nsome Windows users...)\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\n-Mark\n\n\nOn Mar 1, 2006, at 2:33 AM, Rafal Mantiuk wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-March/000064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Banas", "created_at": "March 01, 2006 at 05:26PM", "created_by": "Mark_Banas", "parent_id": "hdri_000061", "id": "hdri_000064"}
