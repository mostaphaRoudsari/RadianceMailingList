{"body": "Greg\nGood timing 'eh!\nI was hoping to find IES data, but I have heard of EULUMDAT -> IES \nconverter somewhere, so that would be possible too. failing that, i \nfigured anything was better than nothing, and i'd work out how use the \ndata once i got it if it was a different format!\n\n\nthe HDR idea sounds really interesting though. unfortunately i know \nnothing about it as yet, but i'll try google as my next step!\nAny help you could give me would be really appreciated - this input \nmethod sounds very helpful as i do have access to the lights, a dark \nroom and a camera!\n\n\nI dont quite understand how you would get the data into radiance though \n- the only idea I can think of at he moment would be to somehow convert \nthe pixel brightness information into a .dat file that you then used \nwith a source as normal. So I guess you would need to turn the photo \ninto .pic file, and then somehow extract the pixel brightness data into \nanother file and interpret it, perhaps converting it to ies format? or \neven stright to .dat?\n\n\nam i wildly out, or somehow along the right lines. i'm thinking on my \nfeet, and there my well allready be something with in radiance to do all \nthis!\n\n\nthanks for the suggestion. off to look up HDR now!\nwill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory J.
