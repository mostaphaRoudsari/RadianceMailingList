I am working on a luminaire database for\nbrad and was looking for the converters a few days ago:\n\n\nOne (DOS) is available here (link at the bottom of the page):\n\n\nhttp://www.helios32.com/resources.htm#Formats\n\n\nAnd Carsten Bauer has another one for Linux/Unix:\n\n\nhttp://www.cb-d.de/rzgoodies.html\n\n\n\n\nBTW: Is any one on this list in the situation (read: in possession of\n      and allowed to) to share file format specs for the IES 2002 and\n      Eulumdat/2 data files? I've only a description of the 1995 version\n      of IES and the first Eulumdat version and my database could use  \nthe\n      additional information in the new files.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003463.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 03, 2006 at 02:51PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003459", "id": "radiance-general_003463"}
