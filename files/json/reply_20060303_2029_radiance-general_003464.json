Rob Shakespeare  \ndefinitely has some data but I don't think he's ever distributed it.   \n(Greg, see what you can do; that symposium sounds really  \ninteresting.)  A detailed process for obtaining datasets for  \ntheatrical fixtures, including sharp & soft focus, is presented  \n(again by Rob S.) in the Rendering with Radiance text.  I know you  \nsaid you don't have facility access to make these measurements, but I  \nthought you'd find it interesting nonetheless.\n\n\nIf you need color filter info, I have a spreadsheet that lists the  \nrgb values for the Roscolux color filter line.  Rob S may have  \nsomething similar.  I got mine from a guy at ETC a few years ago, but  \nmust admit I have not used it at all (one of many back burner  \nprojects), and can't vouch for its validity.\n\n\nThomas, sorry; the only electronic info I have on the ies format is  \nfrom Ian Ashdown,s great paper \"Thinking Photometrically\" -- actually  \ncoursenotes froma lecture he did a number of years ago -- and this  \ndetails the earlier format.  I do own a copy of the latest spec  \n(LM-63-02), so if there are any specific questions you had, I may be  \nable to answer them.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 03, 2006 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003459", "id": "radiance-general_003464"}
