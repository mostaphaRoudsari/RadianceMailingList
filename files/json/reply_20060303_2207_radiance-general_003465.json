Shapes are \"encoded\" as negative dimensions in\nx,y,z. If you could compare how this is done now or how the\nshapes are \"encoded\" in 2002 vs. 95 this would be a great\nhelp. That's the only place where I fear that the new standard\ncould be interpreted wrong. Everything else is just a more\nstrict interpretation of old rules AFAIK.\n\n\nBTW: It's the same for EULUMDAT/2: They just squeeze more\n      information into an already existing field. If you don't\n      know about it you get funny names for the manufacturer\n      and the report; But that's all.\n\n\nTIA,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003465.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 03, 2006 at 10:07PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003459", "id": "radiance-general_003465"}
