{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nThe oconv error probably relates to a problem in the scene definition \nfor the room. Unfortunately I do not have the book handy so I cannot \ncheck description. I would suggest double checking against what is \nindicated in the book.\n\n\nSince the scene does not compile (oconv: fatal ....) you will not be \nable to rvu it anyway. It also sounds likely that you do not have X \ninstalled with Cygwin. I would suggest checking to see of X was \ninstalled as part of the cygwin installation. If not you should be able \nto run through the cygwin setup program to get additional \nprograms/software such as X.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003467.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 05, 2006 at 12:24AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003466", "id": "radiance-general_003467"}
