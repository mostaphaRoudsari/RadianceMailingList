{"body": "Hey,\n\n\nThanks Kirk, I had made the \"void bright light\" mistake which I corrected to\nsuccessfully create the octree file.\n\n\nComing to the second error:\n\n\n$rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct\nI get a windows pop up error message saying rvu.exe - Unable to locate\ncomponent, This application has failed to start because cybX11-6.dll was not\nfound. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.\n\n\nMy installation folder \"C:\\radiance_stuff\\cygwin\\usr\\X11R6\\bin\" contains\nonly a run.exe file and nothing else. I rerun the setup with X11R6 selected\nand the message at the end says \"nothing needed to be installed\". Does that\nmean the file is missing from the installation itself? What can I do to\ncorrect the situation?\n\n\nRamana.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003469.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ramana Koti", "created_at": "March 05, 2006 at 01:18AM", "created_by": "Ramana_Koti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003466", "id": "radiance-general_003469"}
