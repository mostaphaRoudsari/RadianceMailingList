{"body": "I'm not sure if this applies to Windows, but is your DISPLAY  \nenvironment variable set to launch X11 when you invoke rvu?  I'm way  \nout of my league here, but I know that if I try running rvu from my  \nMac OSX Terminal app without the DISPLAY variable set, no dice.  If I  \nrun rvu from my X11 app, it works - I assume it is because in X11,  \nthe default display is X window.\n\n\nAgain, I ain't no Windows person, so I'm shooting from the hip here.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn Mar 4, 2006, at 7:18 PM, Ramana Koti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003472.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "March 05, 2006 at 04:21AM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003466", "id": "radiance-general_003472"}
