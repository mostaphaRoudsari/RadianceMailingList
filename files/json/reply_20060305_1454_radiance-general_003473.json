{"body": "hi everyone\ni've been trying out this hdr stuff, and i've run into a bit of a dead \nend with my understanding!\n\n\ni've left this on the general list, as it seems a slightly more general \nuse of hdr imaging. correct me if im wrong!\n\n\ni've tried what you suggested greg, using an image i found (its not hdr, \nthoug i converted it to .pic) rather than a photo of the real lantern i \nwant to use (hopefully i'll be able to go in and take some photos early \nin the week). but the images i can generate are turning out a bit messy \n- i wasn't sure that its just noise because the patteern seems very \nregular, and there are 2 sorts of \"mess\" on the image as well. i've put \nmy files up at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~orie1226/rad/ if someone wouldn't \nmind having a quick look at what i've done. (files.txt explains what \neverything is).\n\n\nbasically i've used the image to define the output distribution of a \nsource, and am then using that to light a room. the likely problems seem \nto me to be either:\n-some badly set arguments in my .rif file (i dont feel like i completely \nknow what im doing, so this seems quite possible!), or\n-a problem with the quality of the image im using to describe the source \ndistribution. it's not that good quality, but i didn't think it was that \nbad.\n\n\nalso, all i've been able to find about using hdr images in rendering is \nabout using an image showing the light distbution across a whole scene \nso that a entire scene can be lit by a single, large sperhical source \nsurrounding it. (at least, i think thats the idea!).\nwhat im trying to do is define the complete output of source as i'm \ntrying to model the effect of different combinations of sources on my \nscene. does anyone know of any literature out there that might be \nrelevant to this (i think simpler) approach?\n\n\nthanks for your help.\nwill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory J.
