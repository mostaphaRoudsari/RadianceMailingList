{"body": "Hi Ramana,\n\n\nWhen you are running rvu/rview there are a range of interactive \ncommands. Typing view or v in the window will enter into a \"dialog\" that \nlet you control view parameters. You can try it out and just step \nthrough the parameters by hitting return, it will not change anything \nunless you type in something. When you get a view set up the way you \nwant you can save the setting by typing:\n\n\n    v my-viewname.vf\n    or\n    view my-viewname.vf\n\n\nwhen you want to use a view that you have saved you would type the \nfollowing:\n\n\n    l my-viewname.vf\n    or\n    last my-viewname.vf\n\n\nHope this helps it can be a bit confusing early on but it is worth it. \nYou may want to learn to check and explore the man pages as well for \nexample:\n\n\n    http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rvu.1.html\n\n\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003476.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 06, 2006 at 02:43AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003475", "id": "radiance-general_003476"}
