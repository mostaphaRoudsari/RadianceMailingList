{"body": "greg\nthanks for the suggestion for the mapping.\ni'm afraid i dont quite understand it though!\n\n\ni've put a rendering up at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~orie1226/rad/ again. \nits called lantern_2.2.pic (or .jpg) using your suggestions for the .cal \nfile. it seems to go a bit strange though, making a sort of star pattern!\n\n\nthe idea seems right - that the brightness of a ray is dependant on the \nangle to the normal of the source (rather than on the point it leaves \nthe source from, as i originally had), but i'm lost with the idea of a \nsquare picture covering 20 degrees! what does this mean?\n\n\nplease could you also explin the bit of code you gave? particularly the \ndivisor, and why there is an offset. also, what does the DEGREE word do? \ni guess its a constant - perhaps to convert deg -> radians?\n\n\nthanks very much\nwill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003477.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "william reynolds", "created_at": "March 06, 2006 at 04:01PM", "created_by": "william_reynolds", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003459", "id": "radiance-general_003477"}
