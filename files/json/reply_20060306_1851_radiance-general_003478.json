{"body": "Hi Will,\n\n\nI don't really have time here to offer a complete tutorial on  \nRadiance .cal files.  There's Chapter 4 of RwR and some useful  \ninformation in <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf>.\n\n\nYour results are actually OK.  If you reduce the exposure, you'll see  \nthat your source pattern is coming through.  The odd streaks at the  \nedges are due to the fact that you have no cut-off in your fixture,  \nbut the distribution data is not quite zero at the edges.  Radiance  \nis extrapolating the distribution function, which is a bad idea in  \nthis case.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003478.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 06, 2006 at 06:51PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003459", "id": "radiance-general_003478"}
