{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI don't know what's going on with Version.c -- try removing it and  \nrunning \"rmake Version.c\" in your src/rt directory.  Send me the  \noutput if there's an error.\n\n\nAs for nanosleep(), it's probably in some odd library.  Run \"man  \nnanosleep\" and see what library it says it's in.  If you can't add  \nthe appropriate link option to the Rmakefile in src/hd, try removing  \nthe calls from rhd_ogl.c and rhd_x11.c.  They aren't essential.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000693.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 08, 2006 at 10:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000692", "id": "radiance-dev_000693"}
