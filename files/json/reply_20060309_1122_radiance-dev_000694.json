They aren't essential.\n\n\nnanosleep for Solaris is in lib rt:\n\n\n$ nm -D /usr/lib/librt.so | grep nanosleep\n[76]    |         0|       0|FUNC |GLOB |0    |UNDEF  |__nanosleep\n[104]   |     10848|      36|FUNC |GLOB |0    |10     |_nanosleep\n[170]   |     10848|      36|FUNC |WEAK |0    |10     |nanosleep\n\n\nSo I think you can see a problem, the name clash this the radiance\nrt lib.  To compile I patch to change the name of the radiance librt.a\nlib to libradrt.a and -lrt to -lradrt throughout.  As the static lib\nis temporary this affects build only.\n\n\nWould be great if similar renaming was made to the distribution's\nmakefiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000694.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "March 09, 2006 at 11:22AM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000692", "id": "radiance-dev_000694"}
