{"body": "I seem to recall running across this problem under Solaris years  \nago.  I can't believe they haven't renamed their library by now, so  \nit doesn't conflict with mine!\n\n\nAn easy workaround is to put it on the compile line explicitly as \"/ \nusr/lib/librt.so\" instead of the shorthand -lrt, which is  already  \nthere.  Since no other system uses it and I can't add -lrt  to the  \nRmakefile anyway, you might as well give the full path for Solaris.\n\n\nIn other words, I could rename my library, but it would only save you  \nand other Solaris users from typing 14 characters, while requiring  \nthat I alter every makefile in Radiance.  Even if I make the changes,  \nyou still need to go in and edit your src/hd/Rmakefile to add the  \nreal-time library link.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000695.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 09, 2006 at 05:29PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000692", "id": "radiance-dev_000695"}
