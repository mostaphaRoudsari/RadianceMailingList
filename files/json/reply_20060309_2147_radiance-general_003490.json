{"body": "Hi Will,\n\n\nYou may have run out of stack space or some related problem in  \nCygwin, but I'm afraid neither the error nor the stack trace provide  \nany clues as to what's going on.  Cygwin is far from reliable in its  \nability to run long, complicated processes.  (Polite way of saying  \nthe system is buggy.)  I've had lots of problem reports on this, but  \nthere's nothing whatever I can do about it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003490.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 09, 2006 at 09:47PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003489", "id": "radiance-general_003490"}
