I will cope as I have been, I edit the\nmake files for other reasons anyway.\n\n\nMore importantly, I hope anyone else with the problem will read this\nand now know what to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000696.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "March 10, 2006 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000692", "id": "radiance-dev_000696"}
