I'm sure people will start to\nscream soon, should I have broken anything in the proces...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000698.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 10, 2006 at 08:44PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000692", "id": "radiance-dev_000698"}
