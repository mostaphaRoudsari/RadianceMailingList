{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nWelcome back -- a lot of folks have been asking after you, wondering  \nwhere you went.  Madagascar, again?\n\n\nThanks for updating the library links.  I tested out your changes,  \nand from what I can tell it all seems to work.  (Of course, I had to  \ngo and fix my external projects that link to the Radiance library,  \nbut that wasn't such a big deal.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000699.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2006 at 09:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000692", "id": "radiance-dev_000699"}
