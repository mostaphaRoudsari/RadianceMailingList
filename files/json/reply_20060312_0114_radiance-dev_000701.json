{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI can give this a try, but debugging is a real pain these days  \nwithout the help of an IDE.  If you can get a backtrace with symbols  \nshowing where the program crashed from your core dump, I might be  \nable to find the error by inspection.  Basically, no one has used the  \nSMLFLT flag for ages, and the code hasn't been tested with it for at  \nleast 10 years.  The cracks that appear in geometric objects are  \nenough to scare anyone off this option in practice.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000701.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 12, 2006 at 01:14AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000700", "id": "radiance-dev_000701"}
