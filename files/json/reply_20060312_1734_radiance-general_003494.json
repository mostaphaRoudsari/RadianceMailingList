{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nIf you lights are clustered together, you might be able to put them  \nin an enclosing sphere and use mkillum to determine their collective  \noutput distribution, using only as many spherical illum's to light  \nyour space.  (Spheres are in general faster to use as lights because  \nthere is only one sphere per source.)\n\n\nWhat is the exact configuration of your oil lamps?  Are they all the  \nsame?  Do you have any close-ups you can post somewhere?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 12, 2006 at 05:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003493", "id": "radiance-general_003494"}
