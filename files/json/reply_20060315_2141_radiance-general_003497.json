As I recall, Mr. Chalmers could not attend \ndue to a last-minute conflict, and a very nervous Duncan Brown delivered \nthe lecture instead, and the material was so engrossing that he blew us \nall away.  He played an animation of the oil lamp flame at the end, and \nthen asked if there were any questions. The first question shouted out \nby an audience member was: \"could you play that again?\"  =8-)  Cool stuff.\n\n\nCan't believe that was 3.5 years ago; man time flies!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003497.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 15, 2006 at 09:41PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003493", "id": "radiance-general_003497"}
