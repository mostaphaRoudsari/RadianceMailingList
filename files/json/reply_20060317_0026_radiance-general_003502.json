However, this would output your entire scene, only  \nmodifying the surfaces with that modifier.  You could have to take  \nthe entire output of mkillum in this case as the input to your new  \noctree.  There are ways around this using the o= setting, but they're  \ncomplicated.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003502.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2006 at 12:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003501", "id": "radiance-general_003502"}
