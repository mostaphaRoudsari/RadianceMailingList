{"body": "Hi Ian,\n\n\nI didn't realize they only had a Windows version -- they should have  \nat least have a Linux edition, since that was where it was developed  \n(as I understand it).  Hopefully, they will add MPEG-HDR encoder  \nlibraries for Linux and OS X in the near future.  Don't let this stop  \nyou, though.  You can always generate a sequence of HDR frames and  \nfigure it out later.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003512.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 24, 2006 at 05:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003510", "id": "radiance-general_003512"}
