{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nAfter upgrading to the latest HEAD release I've been running several \ndifferent runs over the past day and it seems that the seg fault is \ngone, but now there is another message that I am getting:\n\n\n*** glibc detected *** realloc(): invalid next size: 0x08060248\nAborted\nrtrace: signal - Broken pipe\n\n\nIt seems to work OK when I split my sensor input file up into smaller \nsegments (of 100-200 calculation points) but when I try the whole file \n(around 2000 points) is when it has problems now. I'm running the latest \nHEAD release on Ubuntu Linux (Breezy Badger) just for reference. For \nnow, I'm fine with using the \"split\" command as a workaround and \ncalculating the contributions in segments, but I was wondering if there \nis again perhaps something that I'm doing wrong?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave\n\n\nGregory J.
