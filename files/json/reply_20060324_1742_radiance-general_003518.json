{"body": "Hi Peter!\n\n\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/survey1/survinput.html has been there\n> since Jan 2005, but presumably remained largely unknown.\n\n\nI knew it (my \"again\" was for that ;-), but I did not know that is is still\ngoing on. \n\n\n> Maybe I should split \"package type\" into MacOS, Linux (IMHO splitting it\n> into dists won't generate much insight) and Unix-other.\n\n\nAnd the Windows guys that are brave enough to visit radiance-online... :-)\n\n\nOne problem I see with this type of ongoing polls is that the results do not\nreflect a certain time. E.g. I guess I entered using Linux and being in an\nacademic environment at the time. This both changed, but I cannot edit,\nwhile the poll is going on and there are still new entries added. So I\nprefer a time-limited poll to reflect the community at one certain time or\nsomething more dynamic (editable and thus correctable) to reflect always the\nmost recent state. This is quite a bit of work of course, the Linux Counter\nProject is an example for such an approach.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the most interesting ressource for these issues is the\nmailing list, the questions and contributions posted show a lot of the\nuseage, maybe more then a poll will ever show.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003518.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
