{"body": "Hi Dave,\n\n\nThis appears to be a glibc internal error (consistency check), which  \nindicates a bug in the malloc library on your system.  I don't think  \nthere's much I can do about it if that's the case.  If someone has a  \ncopy of the malloc.c module from glibc, I can take a look to see  \nexactly where this check is happening, but that still doesn't give me  \nmuch chance of fixing the problem if I can't reproduce it on my  \nsystem.  There's nothing particularly funny or strange about my use  \nof realloc() in rtcontrib.\n\n\nThe only possibility I can think of is that I'm passing an invalid  \npointer to realloc(), which is somehow generating this error rather  \nthan the expected one.  I checked my code, though, and I can't see  \nhow this could happen.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003519.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 24, 2006 at 07:18PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003507", "id": "radiance-general_003519"}
