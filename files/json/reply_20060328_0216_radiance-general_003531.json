{"body": "greg\ni think i'm starting to follow you now!\njust a couple more things...\n\n\n-converting radiance RGB to sharp RGB (all my material reflectances are \nin RGB, eg from the materials file in lib/) and i'm not sure how to \nconvert them to sharp rgb. i thought i could use xyz_rgb.cal, by \nconverting RGB to XYZ, then the XYZ values to sharp RGB. but i thought \ni'd check my idea by converting RGB to XYZ, and then converting it back \nagain, thinking it should be the same, and its not.\n\n\n-you say that a white popint adjustment is effectively made during the \nrendering. is this just the shift needed to account for the different \nviewing conditions (ie being in the room, and looking at the monitor)?\n\n\n-premultiplying surface reflectances. the RGB values i am geting for the \nXYZ data i have for the filters are much bigger than 1, so \npremultiplying will give reflectances much bigger than 1.\nfor example:\n\n\nthe RGB values for a certain red filter = 55, -3.6, -0.7 (from \nX,Y,Z=21.3, 9.1, 0) [i thought the range for these values was (o:inf)?]\n\n\nthe RGB reflectance for a white painted wall = 0.9, 0.8, 0.8\n\n\nso the compensated RGB reflectances would be 49.5, -10.08, -0.56 (ie. \n55*0.9 etc) But these should all be between 0 and 1 shouldn't they?\n\n\nshould i simply normalise the filter's RGB values to sum to 1, or am i \nmissing something more important here?\n\n\nthanks again\nwill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory J.
