{"body": "Hi Christian,\n\n\n> If i use ies2rad with the '-t' option referring to a specified  \n> lamp, how are the x,y values in 'lamp.tab' transfered into RGB? Is  \n> the basis 'color.h'?

The Y value in lamp.tab  \nis the lumen depreciation factor.\n\n\nChanging the white point in the _second_ set of primaries in color.h  \n(not the first set, which is only used if NTSC is defined), should  \ndefinitely affect the output of ies2rad, but you would have to rerun  \n\"rmake install\" in the src/common directory, then remove ies2rad and  \nrun \"rmake install\" in the src/cv directory (in that order).\n\n\n> On the other hand, if i calculate the RGB (D65)  values on my own,  \n> assuming Y=1, i get not the right illuminance value after applying  \n> rtrace and rcalc with the correct factors. e.g. $ echo \"0 0 0 0 0  \n> 1\" |rtrace -I -h lux_test.oct | rcalc -e '$1=179*(.22200431*$1+. \n> 70665477*$2+.07134092*$3)'\n\n\nIt should work.  You would have to give more details about how your  \nvalue was unexpected, or your scene files.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003538.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 29, 2006 at 08:22PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003537", "id": "radiance-general_003538"}
