{"body": "Hi Christian,\n\n\nLooking at your IES file, you say you want a distribution with 12 Vertical\nAngles of data and 27 Horizontal angles of data.  Looking at your angles,\nyou have indeed provided 12 Vertical angles, but you have only provided 22\nHorizontal angles, (unless my eyes are deceiving me).  I have checked a few\nIES files I have used and converted successfully and these quantities should\nmatch.\n\n\nAlso I am not sure if you have cut your lumen data up within the e-mail to\nsave space, but when you write the lumen data should you not have 12 x 27\n(or 22) numbers, i.e. 27 (or 22) lines, each with 12 numbers in them.\n\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003540.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "April 03, 2006 at 10:17AM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003539", "id": "radiance-general_003540"}
