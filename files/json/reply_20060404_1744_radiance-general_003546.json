{"body": "Hi Christian,\n\n\nThe normalization of the spectral power distribution is unimportant,  \nbut I believe mgfilt outputs something that sums to 1.0 when  \nintegrated with the photopic curve.  Whatever it comes out to, the  \nactual value is normalized by the reflectance or emission it's  \napplied to.  Since you aren't applying it to anything, it doesn't  \nmatter.\n\n\nSpectral power per wavelength can be any non-negative value (0 to  \ninfinity).  See also the previous thread entitled \"specifying sources\".\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 04, 2006 at 05:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003543", "id": "radiance-general_003546"}
