{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nThe 0.5 degree value in gensky is approximate, and could be corrected  \nto 0.533.  This is not difficult to do.  The current radiance is  \nfigured using the 0.5 degree value, and could be adjusted.  I see no  \nreason not to make such a correction in the next release.\n\n\nOther opinions?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003547.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 04, 2006 at 05:47PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003544", "id": "radiance-general_003547"}
