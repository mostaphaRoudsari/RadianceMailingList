Usually, it is derived from measurements of direct normal  \nirradiance or illuminance (commonly found in climate files).  Rarely  \nis the solar radiance or luminance measured directly.  Provided the  \nsolar radiance is determined in a consistent fashion from  \nmeasurements of direct normal, then there is negligible practical  \ndifference as far any evaluation is concerned - the flux will be the  \nsame whatever the solid angle used for the sun.\n\n\nIn any case, the best measurements of direct normal are taken using a  \ntracking device that commonly has an acceptance angle of 6deg (with,  \nI recall, a fairly flat response).  This is because it is impractical  \nto attempt to track the sun using anything with a much smaller angle,  \nlet alone an angle that matched exactly the solar disc.  So, when  \nusing these data from climate files etc., the difference between 0.5  \nand 0.533 is made pretty much irrelevant because the sun radiance is  \nbeing calculated from a measurement that includes a lot of  \ncircumsolar region also.\n\n\nIntriguingly, in practical terms, this matters more for overcast  \nrather than clear sky conditions (I can almost hear the gasps of  \ndisbelief).  For clear skies, the solar radiance dominates the  \nbrightness of of the circumsolar region -- so the \"contamination\"  \nthat results from basing the solar radiance on a measurement that  \nincludes the contribution of the circumsolar region is small.   \nHowever, when a sky is overcast, the measurement of direct normal (in  \nthe climate file) is that which results from a (sunless) 6deg patch  \nof sky.  Say that value is used routinely in an annual calculation  \nprocedure to determine the radiance of the 0.5deg sun.  Then, for  \novercast days, the solar radiance will be about ~144 times the  \nradiance of the background sky (i.e. [6/0.5]**2).  So, a brightish  \nsun will be a permanent feature in all your overcast skies.  If your  \nevaluation is very sensitive to the magnitude of the sky and sun  \nradiance or luminance (as I suspect Jan's is), then this may be an  \nissue.  It's probably wise to play around with a threshold value  \nbelow which the sun radiance is set to zero.\n\n\n-John\n\n\nPS.
