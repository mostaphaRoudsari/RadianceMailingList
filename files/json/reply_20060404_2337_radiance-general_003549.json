I think that I might have used a different\nand older source package when I compiled the first cygwin version,\nwhich also doesn't include the -G option.\nAt least I've understood that I didn't change the gendaylit code :P\n\n\nI also agree with John about the weather data measurement accuracy,\nand usually totally discard the direct normal solar component if lower\nthan 120 W/m2, as recommended by the WMO. I think S at tel-Light uses\na similar threshold to decide whether there is direct sun or not.\n\n\nCiao,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003549.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "April 04, 2006 at 11:37PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003544", "id": "radiance-general_003549"}
