{"body": "Thanks for your answer Greg,\n\n\nThe normalization of the spectral power distribution is unimportant,  \nbut I believe mgfilt outputs something that sums to 1.0 when  \nintegrated with the photopic curve.  Whatever it comes out to, the  \nactual value is normalized by the reflectance or emission it's  \napplied to.  Since you aren't applying it to anything, it doesn't  \nmatter.\n\n\nThe problem is, i am applying the spectrum of this lamp to a color filter spectrum.\nThe spectral data of this filter is normalized to 1 or 100%. There are values from 0,0000 up to 1.\nIf i multiply these two spectra as shown in \"Rendering with Radiance\" p.435, i think the data should be normalized\nto the same standard, or am i wrong?\nMy output is a combined spectrum and then i convert it back to CIExy values, then with xyz_rgb.cal to RGB.\nThats why i want to know how mgfilt works and what it is capable of. Is there any man page?\nRegards,\n\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Fusenig\nDiplomand, Medientechnik\nUndergraduate, Media Technology\nHamburg University Of Applied Sciences\nhttp://www.mt.haw-hamburg.de\n\n\naddress: Beim Schlump 27/07\n              20144 Hamburg\n\n\nemail:    christian_fusenig at gmx.de\n\n\nmobile:  ++49 179 5975845\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003553.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Fusenig", "created_at": "April 06, 2006 at 11:39AM", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003543", "id": "radiance-general_003553"}
