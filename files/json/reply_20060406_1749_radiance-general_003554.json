In  \nfact, you can multiply the cspec output by mgfilt by the lumens of  \nyour light source and the transmission of your filter (between 0 and  \n1 at each wavelength) and get something related to the lumen output  \nover the spectrum.\n\n\nMan pages for MGF can be found on the website -- I assumed you had this:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003554.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 06, 2006 at 05:49PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003543", "id": "radiance-general_003554"}
