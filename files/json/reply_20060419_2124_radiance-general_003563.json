If you set the -dj option to something between 0.5  \nand 0.8, you will sample over a larger subregion.  (A setting of -dj  \n1 is allowed, but only works if all the sources in your scene are  \nrectangular.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003563.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 19, 2006 at 09:24PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003562", "id": "radiance-general_003563"}
