{"body": "Hello,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your answer Christoph, I have done what you said but I fear that my problem is something about installation. I already have a Windows-based version of Radiance but it was telling me: \"C:\\Adeline3\\bin\\rad.exe: error running rview\"\n\n\nI think the Radiance program is not well-installed because it does not work with Ecotect neither.\n\n\nCould this message appear because the view is not well defined too?\n\n\nMoreover, does anyone has used Adeline before and think it is reliable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabienne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nDe: radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org] En nombre de Reinhart, Christoph\nEnviado el: mi\u00e9rcoles, 19 de abril de 2006 19:10\nPara: Radiance general discussion\nAsunto: RE: [Radiance-general] import from Ecotect to Radiance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Fabienne,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to install Desktop (or another Windows-based version of Radiance) before you can use it with ECOTECT. In order to install Desktop Radiance, you can follow these instructions -> http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/arch447/fall2005/Radiance/InstallDesktopRadiance.html. Good luck,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fabienne Sallaberry", "created_at": "April 20, 2006 at 11:32AM", "created_by": "Fabienne_Sallaberry", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003559", "id": "radiance-general_003565"}
