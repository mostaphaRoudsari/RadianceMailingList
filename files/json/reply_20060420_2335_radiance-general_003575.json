{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThe Desktop Radiance version of Radiance does not contain some of the \nnew features of the current release of Radiance. However DR does have a \ngui of sorts whereas Radiance is really a toolset of applications that \nare typically utilized via the command line on unix/linux/osx type \noperating systems. There are a few other frontends including Rayfront \n(www.schorsch.com).\n\n\nDepending on what you are going to end up doing with Radiance it can be \nvery worthwhile to learn how to use the command line version on \nunix/linux/osx as the os.\n\n\nYou will also need a modeling application such as Autocad, Rhino or some \nother application that can output the correct geometry format (.obj \nformat files for example).\n\n\nHope this helps as a starting point.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nChris Jessee wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n> Are there any advantages or disadvantages to running Desktop Radiance \n> as opposed to a compiling it on OSX (or other OS)?\n>\n> Thanks,\n>\n> Chris Jessee\n>\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n>\n>\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003575.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 20, 2006 at 11:35PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003574", "id": "radiance-general_003575"}
