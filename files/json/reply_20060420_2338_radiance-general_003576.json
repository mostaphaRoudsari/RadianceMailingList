{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nAs Vangelis pointed out in an earlier post, Desktop Radiance is out  \nof date -- about 7 years and counting.  Unfortunately, there's no way  \nto bring it up to date, and the current effort is to put out a  \nWindows edition of the current version.  Large parts of the system  \ncompile, but there appear to be some problems remaining with the  \nparallel processing bits and rvu, which needs a user interface or a  \nworking X11 server.  This is why some people are using the Cygwin  \nbinaries, which run in a subenvironment to Windows.\n\n\nPersonally, I think you're 10 times better off with FreeBSD, Linux,  \nor OS X if you want to run Radiance.  The latest iMac's and MacBook  \nPro are basically as fast as the PC's, if a little more expensive.   \nThey're also better built, unless you're willing to spend the time  \nbuilding your own machine, as some people like to do.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003576.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 20, 2006 at 11:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003574", "id": "radiance-general_003576"}
