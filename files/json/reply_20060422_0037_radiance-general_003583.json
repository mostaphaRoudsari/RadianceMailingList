I've also inquired with \nNextLimit about the possibility of illiminance & luminance info being \nextracted from the program and only gotten vague replies in return.  \nDunno what's going on there, really.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003583.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 22, 2006 at 12:37AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003582", "id": "radiance-general_003583"}
