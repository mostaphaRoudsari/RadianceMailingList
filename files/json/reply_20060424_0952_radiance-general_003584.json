I still have the some\nproblem to export from the files Ecotect to Radiance. I have the\nproblem: \"Error: some line(s) with code 73 define a non quadrilateral\npolygon\".\nI do not know if it is because the work surface is not well-defined or\nbecause it is not possible to define a non quadrilateral surface.\nDoes anybody had the error before?\nThanks,\nFabienne\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003584.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Fabienne Sallaberry", "created_at": "April 24, 2006 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "Fabienne_Sallaberry", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_003584"}
