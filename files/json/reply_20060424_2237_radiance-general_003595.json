{"body": "Hi Adriana,\n\n\nWhat do you want your surface to look like?  What do you want your  \nnormals to do?\n\n\nThe string arguments of the \"texfunc\" primitive define expressions  \nfor a \"perturbation\" of the surface normal, i.e., a value to be added  \nto the default surface normal.  In your example, depending on the  \nvalues of A1, A2, and A3 (and assuming \"PZ\" should have been \"Pz\"),  \nyou would get a surface normal that would change gradually according  \nto the position in 3-dimensional space, forcing whatever object was  \ncovered to have a surface normal resembling that of a sphere the  \nlarger the object became.  This seems a very strange goal to me.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003595.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 24, 2006 at 10:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003590", "id": "radiance-general_003595"}
