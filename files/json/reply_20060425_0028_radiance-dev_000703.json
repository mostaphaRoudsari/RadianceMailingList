{"body": "Hi Francesco,\n\n\nWhat is the date on your compile?  I notice I made a change on Oct.  \n11th, where I paid more attention to zero normals on the input.  I'm  \njust speculating, but if your view is a hemispherical fisheye, then  \nall its border rays will be zero vectors, which could accumulate in a  \nbad way using binary i/o and the earlier version of rtcontrib.c,  \nperhaps causing some kind of buffer confusion.  I'm not exactly sure  \nwhy it would show up in one mode and not the other, though.  Can you  \nreproduce the problem under Unix?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-April/000703.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2006 at 12:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000702", "id": "radiance-dev_000703"}
