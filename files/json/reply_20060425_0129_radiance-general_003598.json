{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nIn effect, what I get is the resemblance of a shpere the larger the\nobject. For this reason, I feel that I'm using \"texfunc\" in an improper\nway for what I need. My objective is to modify the x, y and/or z normals\nof a surface in order to analize how much R, G and/or B is being\nabsorbed/reflected. I know that depending on the texture of a surface, for\nexample, shortwavelenghs of the spectrum are more reflected than the short\nwaves of the spectrum. What I need is to create a \"bumpy\" surface in order\nto see how much blue is reflected depending on the scale of this\n\"bumpiness\" ( from very small scale-microscale, if possible, to\nmacroscale) and by having control of the perturbation of the x, y and z\nnormals. Is there a logic way in how to do this?\n\n\nAdriana\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003598.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Adriana Lira", "created_at": "April 25, 2006 at 01:29AM", "created_by": "Adriana_Lira", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003590", "id": "radiance-general_003598"}
