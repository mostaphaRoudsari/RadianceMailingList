{"body": "Hi Adriana,\n\n\nIf you are hoping to model diffraction effects -- where geometric  \noptics break down and wave optics take over -- you will be  \ndisappointed to learn that Radiance does not handle this case.  Few  \nray-tracing systems do.  Diffraction becomes important when the scale  \nof surface variations (texture or thin films) is on the order of the  \nwavelength of light, less than a micron or so.  For this, you need a  \ntool such as Code V from ORA:\n\n\n\thttp://www.opticalres.com/news/cv96.html\n\n\nI believe they have student pricing for their tools.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003599.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2006 at 04:08AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003590", "id": "radiance-general_003599"}
