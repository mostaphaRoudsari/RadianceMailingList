{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> Can you reproduce the problem under Unix?\n\n\nWith Unix everything is working well, that's why i'm thinking of a\nwindows shell pipeline problem or directly of mingw gcc.\nBTW, the view specification in my test is not a hemispherical fisheye,\nso the problem you're referring to should not happen in this case.\nIn any case I'll recompile a fresh radiance tarball and let you know.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-April/000704.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "April 25, 2006 at 09:57AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000702", "id": "radiance-dev_000704"}
