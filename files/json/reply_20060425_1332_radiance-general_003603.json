So now every\ntalentless hick with a digital camera and tripod is making badly\ntone-mapped images and calling it \"HDR\". Just look at the comments on the\nWikipedia HDRI article:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:High_dynamic_range_imaging#Flickr_HDR_group.3F\n(I'm 'Imroy', BTW)\n\n\nI seem to have been successful in keeping the link to the Flickr \"HDR\"\ngroup out of the article. But people keep adding their own tone-mapped\nimages and I'm trying to explain to them that they don't accurately\nrepresent HDRI. I'm not really sure of an alternative though. Any\nsuggestions from the list?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003603.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "April 25, 2006 at 01:32PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003602", "id": "radiance-general_003603"}
