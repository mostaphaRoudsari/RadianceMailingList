{"body": "This discussion probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, as opposed  \nto radiance-general, so I'm cross-posting.\n\n\nYou might mention in your postings that Photosphere can output JPEG- \nHDR images suitable for web sites, which people who use Photosphere  \nwill then see as full HDR images.  You can even e-mail them -- there  \nare quite a few examples buried on my site, such as:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/Tuolumne2005/img/ \nTuolumneRiver4_lA64.jpg\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/hawaii05/img/OutriggerLobby_lC7E.jpg\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/hawaii05/img/RefugeWall_lA30.jpg\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/hawaii05/img/KonaSunset1_l5EE.jpg\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/GrandCanyon2006/img/ \nGrandCanyon3_lC21.jpg\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/GrandCanyon2006/img/Sedona3_l1AF.jpg\n\n\nUnfortunately, you just have to dig through my recent snapshots to  \nfind them...  Also, not everyone has Photosphere, being as more than  \nhalf(!) the computing world is still using Windows, but the JPEGs  \nview as tone-mapped images on other software, and you can download  \nfree converter programs from BrightSide Technologies to get you  \nbetween JPEG and Radiance format images:\n\n\n\thttp://www.brightsidetech.com/products/process.php\n\n\nSince Photoshop CS2 (and I believe Photomatrix) can output Radiance  \nformat images, you can go from there to JPEG-HDR using the BrightSide  \nconversion tools, and back again on the receiving end.  Hopefully,  \nwe'll have a plug-in for Photoshop before too long.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003607.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2006 at 05:51PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003602", "id": "radiance-general_003607"}
