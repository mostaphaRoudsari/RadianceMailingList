{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\n> out of curisosity: has someone got a Nikon (model 8400/880/4500)\n> remotely controlled (shutter speed etc. for HDR) under Linux  ?\n\n\nE995:\n- USB interface shows up as hard drive, so is no good for remote control\n- RS232 cable (available for E990) allows for remote control, BUT not\nsetting of shutter/aperture, so you are limited to the +/- 2 EV AEB which\ncan be combined with +/- 2 EV MEC to give in theory +/- 4EV.\n\n\nE990:\n- Starting with this model, Nikon have systematically removed remote\ncontrol funtionality (hence 995 problems)\n- Both, USB and serial may be used to change settings (USB will not show\nup as HD)\n- my particular model hangs when remotely pushing the trigger via USB, but\nserial works. This seems to be a general problem with 990s.\n- AEB only +/- 0.7 EV\n- no built-in noise reduction!\n- full remote control over aperture and shutter speed\n\n\nE4500:\n> Reading images on a 4500 with PTP mode works, remote trigger works, but\n> mostly likely the firmware doesn't support setting of the shutter speed:\nSame problem as 995 -- Nikon deliberately crippled this functionality,\nprobably to force people to go D-range ($$$!)\n\n\n> Someone I talked to mentioned  some undocumented pins on the 4500 USB\n> connector, which  are supposed to be RS232 with remote control\n> features.  Apparently he'd be testing this soon.\n\n\nWhat appears to be a USB connector is on fact a combination of USB and\nRS232. There are enough pins to break out both. I'd be terribly surprised\nif the MC-EU1 serial remote control would not work with the E4500.\nHowever, unless you get one given to you, I wouldn't recommend buying one\n(at least not for the full RRP). It only gives you zoom, trigger and a\nsorta time lapse that can't go below 2 mins, and doesn't even display the\ntime remaining until the next shot.\n\n\n> Anyone aware of 3rd party companies selling something like an HDR\n> firmware for NIkons (or other cameras) ?\n\n\nTechnoTeam in Ilmenau, DE have teamed up with Rollei to produce a camera\nthat has a special firmware for HDR (-9T, -3T, T, +3T, +9T). This gizmo\nalso comes with a complete set of calibration files and some Windoze\nsoftware. Don't know about the pricing, though.\n\n\nI've recently got myself a 5 Pound (price, not weight!) Palm pilot on\ne-bay.  They have a serial interface and can control CoolPixes. There is\nsone stuff on the web:\na) http://vyskocil.free.fr/cool (closed source)\nb) http://timeguy.com/cradek/palmshotcom/ (GPL)\n\n\nBased on b), I intend to hack together 'PalmHDR', once I've got some time.\nI'll keep you updated.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003611.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "April 26, 2006 at 05:29PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003116", "id": "radiance-general_003611"}
