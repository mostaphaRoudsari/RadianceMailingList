{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI've just finished recompiling a fresh radiance tarball with mingw, and\nalso under cygwin and linux.\n\n\nThe behaviour of vwrays+rtcontrib is similar with both cygwin and\nlinux, that is -fa and -ff work perfectly.\n\n\nIt is only with the mingw binaries that I have problems, or I should\nprobably say that it is a limitation of the windows command shell,\nthat doesn't seem to handle concatenation of binary input/output ...\nThe more I use windows, the less I want to use it ...\n\n\nI think I only need to test the mingw binaries from the cygwin shell\nto identify the problem and prove what my intuition is suggesting ...\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-April/000705.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "April 27, 2006 at 12:01AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000702", "id": "radiance-dev_000705"}
