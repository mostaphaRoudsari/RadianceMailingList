Does it have a rough texture  \nthat scatters light?  If it is solid and transmits light, then it  \nalso reflects light.  It might have a low index of refraction if it  \nis a gel filter, similar to water with n=1.3, whose surface  \nreflection is around 2%.  You can give the index of refraction to the  \nglass type as a fourth argument.  (If you give a value of 1.0, there  \nwill be no reflection at all.)\n\n\nWhether you end up using 'glass' or 'trans' as your material, be sure  \nto leave a small gap between the surface you use for your filter and  \nthe surfaces you use for your cylinder.  Otherwise, the rays will see  \none or the other surface at random.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003622.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 28, 2006 at 05:49PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003617", "id": "radiance-general_003622"}
