Not as easy to use as Sketchup, mind you, but still, \n100% legal GPL 3D software is out there. And the 'full' version of \nSketchup is $500, much cheaper than anything else.\n\n\nSketchup Pro uses Ruby as an API. So I don't see why someone wouldn't be \nable to make an export plug-in for it to talk with Radiance. Ruby is a \ngreat language, from what I've seen it a lot simpler than many other \nones, and if I was a Sketchup user I think I'd dig into it. It looks \nlike a lot of fun...\n\n\nJeffrey\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003623.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "April 28, 2006 at 05:54PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003619", "id": "radiance-general_003623"}
