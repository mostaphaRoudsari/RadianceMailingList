I assumed that the Ruby API would have been \none of the things they crippled with the free version, but no, it's \nthere!  =8-)  Problem is, what I do not see in there is the ability to \nset up object snaps, snap grids or direct coordinate input -- things I \nuse all day long.  Bummer.  There is a user-definable coordinate system, \nbut entity creation seems to be limited to drag & drop and some default \nobject snaps (that are always running). \n\n\nAm I just missing something?\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003626.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 28, 2006 at 09:29PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003619", "id": "radiance-general_003626"}
