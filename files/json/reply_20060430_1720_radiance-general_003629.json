Window will allow you to create  \ncustom assemblies.\n\n\nHere are some links:\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/default.htm\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html\n\n\nJohn, I see you are now working at Atelier Ten in New York City?   \nCool!  You are only 12 blocks from my old office, and are _very_  \nclose to where I worked before that.  You are also dangerously close  \nto Duke's, purveyors of excellent cajun food and weapons-grade  \nmargaritas.  That is a great neighborhood and I wish you the best of  \nluck there. Say hi to Jochen for me.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003629.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 30, 2006 at 05:20PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003627", "id": "radiance-general_003629"}
