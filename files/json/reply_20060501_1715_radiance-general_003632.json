{"body": "Incidentally, I will be working with the folks at LBNL to get a  \nproper Radiance material out of the next version of WINDOW.  I  \nactually wrote the glazing.cal file 12 years ago to handle WINDOW-4  \noutput, and it may still be useful in some cases.  You kind of have  \nto know what you're doing with it, though.  It doesn't handle fritted  \nglazings at all.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003632.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 01, 2006 at 05:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003627", "id": "radiance-general_003632"}
