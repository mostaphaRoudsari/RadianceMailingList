It's running the unofficial AMD64 port of Debian, which is a full\n64-bit port i.e not simply running 32-bit userland programs on a 64-bit\nkernel. Everything is compiled to use the extra registers and SSE2, etc.\n\n\nI simply changed the OPT line in the rmake file:\nOPT=-O4 -march=athlon64 -msse2 -mfpmath=sse -ftree-vectorize\n-falign-functions=8 -ffast-math\n\n\nThat's for GCC 4.0 and is hopefully making some use of SSE2 to speed\nthings up. In simple tests, the little 1800MHz Sempron 64 with 128KB of\ncache is about 10% faster than my 1900MHz Athlon XP with 512KB of cache.\n\n\nAs for memory, it depends on what you're doing. Are you dealing with\ncomplex geometry or large textures?\n\n\nHope that helps,\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "May 03, 2006 at 07:21PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003634", "id": "radiance-general_003636"}
