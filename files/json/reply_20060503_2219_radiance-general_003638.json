When I did use it to do a render it was usually at night or\nrunning with a very high nice level.\n\n\nBTW, Jacks response mentioned adding -m64 to the command line. I don't\nneed that since I'm running the all-64-bit AMD64 Debian port and gcc\ngenerates 64-bit binaries by default. You'll have to check what your\ndistro has set up.\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003638.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "May 03, 2006 at 10:19PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003634", "id": "radiance-general_003638"}
