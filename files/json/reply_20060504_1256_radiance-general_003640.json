If they are 64-bit long, then you can actually expect a speed\nimprovement, me thinks.\n\n\n> It stands to reason for 64bit programs to be slower because they have\n> to use twice the memory to store memory pointers.

The only way of finding out\nwheter your particular application will benefit from going 64-bit is to\nactually test it. Which is what I've done for you.\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/rad_bench_sempron.html\n\n\nSo sit back, have a cup of coffee, and let the little grey cells do some\npondering.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003640.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 04, 2006 at 12:56PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003634", "id": "radiance-general_003640"}
