Still, the whole\n64bit-point is about address pointers. All the old \"32-bit\" cpus support\ncalculations on 64bit values - double floats are not that new (a SSE2\nunit as found in recent 32bit intel cpus can even perform calculations\non 2 64bit values at once). So we are only talking about increasing the\namount of addressable memory here.\n\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong. I am not a cpu expert. But do not compile\nRadiance in 64 bit if you do not need memory. If you do, take a look at\ncompilers. E.g. Sun has a free compiler that is known to produce 64 bit\ncode that can compete with 32 bit in speed.\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003641.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
