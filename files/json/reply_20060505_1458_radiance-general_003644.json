{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> There had been different views, Greg suggested to initiate an\n> automated (or at least semi-automatic) \"knowledge-compiler\"\n> that extracts information from the mailing list archives to generate\n> some FAQ.\n\n\nWell, the problem I see with this is that there are often posts here that\nare based more on guessing than knowledge (and I include most of mine -\nstill, I really like the expression \"educated guess\" - if that sounds\nfamiliar to some... ;-). One of the more recent examples is the\n64bit-thread...\n\n\n> My own view was more relying on a small number of people each\n> being /responsible/ for one (or two) subjects and keeping that\n> sub-tree of the docs up-to-date.\n\n\nI prefer that, too. This will not only ensure (or avoid ;-) a certain level\nof quality, but give also some \"expert\" role to those people. So it would be\neasier to know whom to ask for what ;-)\n\n\n> Plone was my choice since I had used it elsewhere.\n\n\nNo idea about Plone.\n\n\n> Anyway- likely this post triggers comments- that's fine - just don't\n> expect me to reply to well meant suggestions about other systems which\n> are better/spiffier/easier/environmentalfriendlier, I have sank enough\n> time into this thread.\n\n\nThe only CMS that might work and I have experience with would be Drupal, and\nI am able to install it in an hour. Still I will not mention that here now\n;-)\n\n\n> Simply, to make it happen, around 1.4kEUR plus a new (faster, due\n> to much heavier CPU use) motherboard for the server are needed. (ah - do\n> not bother sending me your old motherboard).\n\n\nOK, who will participate, and how much will that per person (I like the\nexpression \"per nose\" we use for that in German)? If it is not getting a sum\nastronomic as the amount of rpict's options, I will participate. Will I get\na Gold-version of oconv handling all my nested instances when I support this\nproject? B-)\n\n\n> happy rendering to all\n\n\nYes, the week-end comes close, good times for render-folks... I will spend\nmy spare time on Radzilla (the new 1.1 release) this week.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003644.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
