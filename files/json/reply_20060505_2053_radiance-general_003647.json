{"body": "Here is a working prototype of a 'RADIANCE WebRing'.\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radring/index.shtml\n\n\nIt's still very rough around the edges, but please comment:\n- Do you think it would be useful?\n- How about a 'house style'?\n- Would be too much work for the site admins to change the links if\none of the members drops out? This could be automated, but would create a\ndependency on the master server.\n- Should the extra navigation be on every one of the site's pages, or just\nthe entry one?\n- Anything else...\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003647.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 05, 2006 at 08:53PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003643", "id": "radiance-general_003647"}
