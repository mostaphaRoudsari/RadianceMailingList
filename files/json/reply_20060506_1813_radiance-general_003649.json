You can still take advantage of the\nbetter chip architecture when using 32bit addresses.\n\n\n\n\n> > It stands to reason for 64bit programs to be slower because they have\n> > to use twice the memory to store memory pointers.

All you 32bit tests were done\non a i386 compatible kernel.  Try a 32bit AMD64 radiance on a kernel\noptimised for the AMD64 chip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003649.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "May 06, 2006 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003634", "id": "radiance-general_003649"}
