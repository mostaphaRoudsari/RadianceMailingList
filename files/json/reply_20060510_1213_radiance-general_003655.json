{"body": "Nick, \n\n\nJohn's recommendations are on the nose. It took me a while to come to the\nsame conclusions, but using Optic to create the .rad description for the\nglazing is the simplest way to go. You just need to be certain that Optic is\nproviding the description for your complete window build-up. I vaguely\nremember recent posts regarding Optic and this topic. \n\n\nGiven the calculation speed, and greater transparency of the settings using\nradiance, I gave up on using Ecotects internal calcs a long time ago. With a\nminimum of tweaks, you can also get Radiance to do VSC or Sky component\ncalcs too. \n\n\nHope that is useful\n\n\nNickd\n\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Tue, 09 May 2006 23:51:53 -0400\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003655.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Devlin", "created_at": "May 10, 2006 at 12:13PM", "created_by": "Nick_Devlin", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003653", "id": "radiance-general_003655"}
