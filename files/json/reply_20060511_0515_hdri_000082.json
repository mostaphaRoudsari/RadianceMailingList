{"body": "Greg - that is pretty cool.  It is fairly easy to get the idea of  \nlinking one to the next image.  Thanks!  Now I have to go out and  \ntake a bunch of panoramic, multiple-exposure images and see what  \nhappens!  What do you think is the lower threshold from a lens focal  \nlength perspective (haha!) that will still give a relatively  \ndistortion-free stitched image?  i assume we can exposure balance the  \nHDRs in Photosphere prior to stitching to get even exposure across  \nthe panorama.  Is there a way to get the panoramic exposure balance  \nautomagically?  I guess I'll experiment with it before I ask any more  \nstupid questions.\n\n\nlater,\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2006, at 10:14 PM, Gregory J.
