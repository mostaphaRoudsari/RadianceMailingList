But with big\nwindow openings, it should not be really necessary to use mkillum.

Still, the obj format is not limited to\ntriangles, it depends more on the modeler (and you must make sure that the\npanes are 100% plain).\n\n\n> > to hear a way to take the exported .MTL file and turn it into a  \n> > starting point for my .MAT (short of having to write my own tool to  \n> > do so...).\n\n\nDo you know obj2rad's -n option?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003662.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
