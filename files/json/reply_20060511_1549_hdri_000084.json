{"body": "So if I do a little experimentation ahead of time and establish a  \nmanual set of exposures, and do that same set across all of the  \nimages I intend to stitch together, it sounds like Photosphere will  \nmake the HDRs and combine them in a way that will take care of  \nbalancing the exposure (tone-mapping exposure) across the panorama.\n\n\nAlso - for anyone trying it out, it took me a few tries to figure out  \nthat you have to select (click-drag) a small portion of the scene  \nwhen designating matching feature points (versus simply clicking on a  \nfeature).\n\n\nRe: barrel distortion - it sounds like if I try to take all of my  \nLDRs into Photoshop and use the Lens Correction filter to remove  \nbarrel distortion, then I will lose important image info that  \nPhotosphere uses to do its magic.  I'll try a couple of different  \nfocal lengths with a simple LDR panorama and see what I get wrt  \nstitching distorted images.  I'll also try varying the overlap amount.\n\n\nPretty cool.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
