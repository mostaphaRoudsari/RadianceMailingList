We want \nrenderings as well as falsecolor images. If we just wanted nice \nrenderings, we'd probably go to vRay, which is kind of our unofficial \nstandard for 'sexy' images. If I can get 'ok' renderings but decent \nfalsecolor images without having to edit the glass or use it as a \nlightsource I could make this whole process very, very easy.\n> Triangles don't work with mkillum.

Revit produces rectangles/polys as \nwell, it doesn't render everything to triangles like some modelers. So I \nthink I'm ok there.\n> Do you know obj2rad's -n option?\nYeah, just being lazy, and hoping for an easy solution.\n\n\nWhat would be the best is to use the new Revit API to write an Radiance exporter, and skip Max altogether. However, this is beyond my abilities and available time currently (and sadly).\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n\n\nBecause We Can, LLC\n(415) 505-4689\nwww.becausewecan.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003666.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jeffrey McGrew", "created_at": "May 11, 2006 at 05:42PM", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003659", "id": "radiance-general_003666"}
