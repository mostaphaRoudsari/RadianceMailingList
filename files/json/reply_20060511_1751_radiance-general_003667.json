The numbers should not change so much\nbecause of mkillum, the image will look nicer in many cases. But the main\nreason for mkillum is the following.\n\n\nIf you have a model where most of the indirect light enters the room through\nsmall windows, the probability that the (random) indirect rays, which are\nsend from the surface to several (random) directions to find out its\nindirect contribution hits the (small) light source is getting low. You can\nincrease the number of random rays, but that won't help sometimes and takes\na lot of rendering time. So, in these cases, it is better to bring the light\nsource closer. Bt as it sounds to me, your model is not the typical case\nwith shading devices etc, right? So, if you have simple, large windows, at\nleast your numbers should be fine.\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003667.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
