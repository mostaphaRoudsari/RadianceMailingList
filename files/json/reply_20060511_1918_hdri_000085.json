{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nJust to clarify -- you don't have to take a matching set of exposures  \nif you're shooting your panoramas in HDR.  Just do whatever you have  \nto to get a good set of exposures in each direction, and they should  \nstitch together fine.  It's only LDR images that require manual  \nsettings, and you only get one in that case, so you need to choose  \ncarefully.\n\n\nI thought about choosing feature points instead of areas, but the  \nfeedback would have been difficult since Photosphere doesn't show you  \nwhat point you've chosen and forgets when you switch between images.   \nI find myself going back and forth to check my feature selections,  \nand if they were missing or always disappearing it would only make  \nthe process more painful....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-May/000085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 11, 2006 at 07:18PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000081", "id": "hdri_000085"}
