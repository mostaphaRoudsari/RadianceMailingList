{"body": "Wow, Rob.  Your friend has some awesome photos, there!\n\n\nThe stitching algorithm I developed can mostly work around parallax  \nerrors in the input images, so a pano head isn't really necessary.   \nI'm a fairly haphazard photographer myself, and rarely find myself at  \nthe top of some mountain with a full compliment of lenses, tripod and  \nattachments.  I just carry my little camera around and occasionally  \nwind up someplace that looks like a good spot for a panorama or an  \nHDR image (or both), and I start shooting.  By no small coincidence,  \nPhotosphere is just right for people like me.\n\n\nFor pros, there is much better software available, and some of it is  \nfree.  Photosphere may be the only one that stitches HDR at the  \nmoment, but I don't expect that to be true for very long.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-May/000089.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 11, 2006 at 11:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000081", "id": "hdri_000089"}
