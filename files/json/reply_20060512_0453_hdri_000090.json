Last I checked it could only open Log-Luv TIFFs, but I  \nbelieve Pablo is adding Radiance and OpenEXR to 0.6. Hugin is  \nopensource and available here:\n\n\nhttp://hugin.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nFor a while Hugin 0.5 was how I transformed stitched HDR spherical  \npanoramas into a form that made it easier to retouch the top and  \nbottom of the maps. Now I use the Photoshop plug-in Flexify 2 from  \nFlaming Pear. It transforms 32-bit files as well into all kinds of  \nuseful remappings...\n\n\n-Mark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-May/000090.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Banas", "created_at": "May 12, 2006 at 04:53AM", "created_by": "Mark_Banas", "parent_id": "hdri_000081", "id": "hdri_000090"}
