{"body": "Regarding Martin's question, I will present a poster in Boston at the  \nSymposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization <http:// \nwww.apgv.org/>.  This symposium happens right before Siggraph and is  \ncollocated, so it's a fun thing to do if you're planning to attend  \nSiggraph anyway, or live in Boston.  I don't know if or when I'll get  \naround to publishing a proper paper on it.  I'm past the CIC deadline  \nthis year, and I'm not up on the image processing literature so I  \nfeel a bit embarrassed about submitting it to the GVIP journal or  \nsomeplace like that.\n\n\nAs for Jack's question on fisheye panoramas, I don't think  \nPhotosphere will work all that well in general.  Mark Banas posted  \nsomething just yesterday where he had managed to \"undistort\" a couple  \nof fisheye images and provide them as input to Photosphere and it  \nworked reasonably well.\n\n\nMy preference when using fisheye inputs for image-based lighting and  \nthe like is to perform the coordinate mappings and corrections  \ndirectly in Radiance, and handle it as part of the rendering  \nprocess.  I posted an example of this in January to the HDRI list  \nunder the grab-bag subject \"Mac-Mini | Photosphere | VNC\".\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-May/000094.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 12, 2006 at 08:19PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000091", "id": "hdri_000094"}
