Leave the  \ntripod in the hotel though; you won't want to haul to up all the  \nsteps, and you won't have room up there to set it up anyway.\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/look/2003london/IMG_0794  (picture taken  \nwith a crappy Canon point-n-shoot; would love to see some HDR action  \nfrom this perch...)\n\n\n> I am not very familiar with the city (i have been there once, when  \n> i was 14) but I will have about 1 1/2 days for non-business related  \n> stuff.
