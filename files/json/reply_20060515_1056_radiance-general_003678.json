{"body": "Hi Ramana,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want to warn you that Optics may not be capable of accurately\nproducing data for a glazing makeup with a diffusing element.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had been using Optics to calculate color rendering index and light\ntransmission values for fritted glazing makeups using data supplied by a\nmanufacturer.  Then about a year ago a colleague informed me that Optics\nisn't intended to be used for glazing with diffuse transmission\nqualities.  At the time the method used by optics for optical\ncalculations was based only on non-scattering glazing.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will find a couple of diffusing laminates in the IGDB, but I was\ntold that these are leftovers from before they stopped accepting data\nfor diffusing products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis said, it's been a year since I looked into the situation.  At the\ntime I was told that the inclusion of scattering data was a priority.\nSo if you know anything different please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003678.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 15, 2006 at 10:56AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003673", "id": "radiance-general_003678"}
