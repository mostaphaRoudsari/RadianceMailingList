{"body": "Christian,\nthat number, M, in your file is:\n\n\n1/A =  PI x r^2 = 3.1415927 x 0.0065^2 = 75.3396\n\n\nit means that in the radiance data file all the numbers are divided by\n179 and are intensities (cd/179).\n\n\nat the end the whole product, datafile numbers x M should be = \n(intensities) x 1/179 x 1/A\n\n\nand you can freely move these products across brightdata, light, or the\ndatafile... what it matters is the overall result.\n\n\nhope it helps\nciao\nG.\n\n\nPS in some cases it is: \nintensities x Flux/1000 x 1/179 x 1/A, \nit depends on the input data, i.e. cd or cd/klm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003679.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "May 15, 2006 at 11:18AM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003676", "id": "radiance-general_003679"}
