{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nI assume that John is referring to a small c-program that comes with Daysim called gen_single_office.exe. It is a very basic but useful program that allows you to write out RADIANCE scene files and sensor grids for single and open plan offices.  I find the script useful for parametric studies as all geometry and material properties are set via the command line. In case I want to get a transmissivity value, I would type something like\n\n\ngen_single_office -o scene.rad -I sensor.pts -t 80\n\n\nIn the resulting scene.rad file you get the transmissivity value in the material description for glazing: 0.871538.\n\n\nI am using the simplified glass model in Radiance because I currently do not trust the Optics/Windows output to Radiance (mainly because (a) I still do not properly understand it and (b) because I am not aware of a proper validation study). Maybe somebody from LBNL could enlighten us? If Windows/Optics output into Radiance was indeed reliable, it would be invaluable for the Radiance community. \n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003680.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "May 15, 2006 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003675", "id": "radiance-general_003680"}
