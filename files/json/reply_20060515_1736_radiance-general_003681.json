{"body": "I share Christoph's concerns. It would be helpful to ses an algorithm and a validation. This is not a criticism. The database is very useful, but we need to understand how glazing definitions are prepared. Then we could even add our own measurments - I have a few data sets for different interesting glazing types that I measured in a black lab with a calibrated light source - and send them to LBNL, along with a description of how they were measured. I guess manufacturers would like this. Some glazings might not the attention that they deserve, but if we measure them and add them to the radiance digest and other repositories, we will be in good shape for daylight systems modeling. We could even define a measurement standard, starting out with diffuse and specular components, etc. \n\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003681.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "May 15, 2006 at 05:36PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003675", "id": "radiance-general_003681"}
