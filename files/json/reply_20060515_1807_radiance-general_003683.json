{"body": "Hi Oskar,\n\n\nI have not had any other reports of any problems with the latest  \nversion of ximage in 8-bit mode, but it's difficult to find hardware  \nthese days that even supports 8-bit color lookups.  There may well be  \na bug, but I can't find it if I can't find hardware on which to  \nreproduce the problem.\n\n\nMaybe you can just continue to use the old binary for ximage, if  \nthat's working.  I can see no reason why not to -- it isn't as if the  \nRadiance picture format has changed in any incompatible way.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003683.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 15, 2006 at 06:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003677", "id": "radiance-general_003683"}
