{"body": "With DAYSIM I believe the sky file is fixed (North = +Y) and therefore to\ntest different building orientations you need to export from CAD or ?\npackage new models, this is a little bit inconvenient and at times\ndangerous, i.e. if you are changing materials manually once exported as you\ncould change say three models and not the forth.  I am not sure if a change\nto the DAYSIM code is possible or if possible is too complex to allow the\nsky file to be rotated as it is with Radiance.\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003685.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "May 15, 2006 at 07:14PM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003684", "id": "radiance-general_003685"}
