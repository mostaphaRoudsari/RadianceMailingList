{"body": "Hello Chris.\n\n\nNice to see a new face.\n\n\nYou might be interested in the RADIANCE course notes linked on this site:\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml\n<http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml> \n\n\nand - if you have trouble getting Radiance to work - LEARNIX\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/index.shtml\n<http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/index.shtml> \n\n\nI think the 'notes' as well as the RwR book are an excellent introduction to\nRadiance and how the tools work. Kudos to Axel Jacobs for this.\n\n\nBTW: You should get used to the feeling of being lost in all the options of\ncountless programs. For most of us it never will end.\n\n\nThomas   \n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003691.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 18, 2006 at 07:39PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003688", "id": "radiance-general_003691"}
