{"body": "Hi Christian,\n\n\nIf you need to pose a figure in a particular way, you will need to use \nPoser. However it is possible that you might be able to buy a posed \nhuman figure online at a site like www.turbosquid.com. You might also \ncheck if poser can export in another format such as obj or 3ds  (obj \nwould be preferable as then you can use obj2mesh).\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nChristian Fusenig wrote:\n> Hi there,\n>\n> i know this is not really a Radiance related question but i guess \n> everyone once needed a human model for a scene.
