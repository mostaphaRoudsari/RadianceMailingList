{"body": "Hey folks - I had some LDR fun with the panoramic stitching features  \nrecently added to Photosphere.  See:\n\n\nhttp://kirkt.smugmug.com/gallery/1473939\n\n\nIt is interesting to play around with choosing the pano orig and pano  \ndest points under various circumstances.  It is interesting to see  \nhow Photosphere fuses the images, especially when there are distinct  \nforeground and background elements with various levels of distortion  \ndue to focal length.  I was using a cheap little foldup tripod.  I  \nfound that it is probably worthwhile to get a tripod with a level so  \nyou don't get a tilt angle and have to crop up significant amounts of  \nthe image.  I will probably also look into the panoramic tripod  \nattachments that permit panning about the lens nodal point.  Cool  \nstuff.  I am pleased with it so far - I will probably try to recreate  \nthe same panos in PSCS2 and see how they work out for comparison.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 11, 2006, at 1:37 PM, Gregory J.
