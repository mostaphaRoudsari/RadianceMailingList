{"body": "Hi Xian,\n\n\nAdding to Jack's comments, I think you will see what appears as noise  \nno matter what you do.  The minification that happens on multiple  \nreflections makes your light source into a dot.  In other words, in  \nthe reflection of one sphere you see more spheres.  The miniaturized  \nimage of the light source becomes a microminiaturized reflection in  \nthe reflected spheres, and micromicrominiaturized in the reflection  \nof reflection of other spheres.  These will look like noise to your  \neye, but that's what the real scene would look like, also.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003706.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 22, 2006 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003704", "id": "radiance-general_003706"}
