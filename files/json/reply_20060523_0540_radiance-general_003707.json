{"body": "Thanks for the speedy and helpful responses, Jack and Greg. It's good to \nknow that there is nothing necessarily wrong with my code, just my \nperception. :) This also suggests that I should probably not make these \nsurfaces \"shiny.\" In response to Jack's P.S., the geometry is designed \nto investigate gloss and the perception of bumpiness, where bumpiness is \ndefined as the variance of bump heights (ellipsoid depths). I was \ninspired by a variety of skin imperfections...and clusters of shiny \nraspberries. If course, if anyone has any better suggestions of modeling \n\"macro-bumpiness,\" I'd be happy to hear them.\n\n\n--xian\n\n\nGregory J.
