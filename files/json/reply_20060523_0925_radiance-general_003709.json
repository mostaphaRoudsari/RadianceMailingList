{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nthanks for your reply - as I have no reservations using the 3.1.11\nximage on\npics created with 3.7.2, that's fine for me.\n\n\nHowever, although in my original post I'd reported that compilaton of\n3.7.2\non my SGI FUEL under IRIX 6.5.28/MipsPro 7.4.4/V12 works \"ok\" [since I'd\nonly \nlooked at the tail of the file into which I'd re-directed the output\nfrom \n<makeall install> and I'd read 'Done.' there, I'd not bothered further\nto wade\nthru all messages], upon closer inspection I did indeed find a few\nentries\nworth of comments - please bear with me for the nonce. First, here is my\n\n\nrmake command:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nexec make \"SPECIAL=ogl\" \\\n\t\"OPT=-O2 -DSPEED=200\" \\\n\t\"MACH=-w\" \\\n\tARCH=sgi \"COMPAT=strcmp.o\" \\\n\tINSTDIR=/disk03/mephisto/source/radiance_3.7.2/bin \\\n\tLIBDIR=/disk03/mephisto/source/radiance_3.7.2/lib \\\n\tESUFFIX= \\\n\t \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\n\nSince 'New rmake command -- running \"makeall clean\"...', that's what is \nexecuted initially. Then:\n\n\n\n\n1. In directory px...\n\trm -f [...]\n\tcd tiff; make distclean\ndon't know how to make distclean (bu42).\n*** Error code 1 (bu21)\n\n\nRight now it escapes me why this doesn't work, as <Makefile> in tiff\n\"does\"\nhave a target \"distclean\" indeed.\n\n\n\n\n2. There are a number of \n\n\nsh: ranlib:  not found\n*** Error code 127 (bu21) (ignored)\n\n\nas IRIX doesn't have/need ranlib at all.\n\n\n\n\n3. More seriously, however,\n\n\nIn directory hd...\ncc-1020 cc: ERROR File = rhd_ogl.c, Line = 367\n  The identifier \"d\" is undefined.\n\n\n  \td = eyesepdist / sqrt(nv->hn2);\n  \t^\n\n\n1 error detected in the compilation of \"rhd_ogl.c\".\n*** Error code 2 (bu21)\n\n\n\n\nSo I wonder why compilaton hasn't just stopped there in the first\nplace???\n\n\n\n\n4. Although I've quite rarely seen a package which produces almost no\nwarnings\n[Radiance is a very satisfactory exception - applause to you!!!], I do\nget a \nwhole bunch of them when\n\n\nIn directory px...\n\tcd ../libtiff ; make install\n\n\n\n\nWhile you seem to use tiff-3.7.3 in Radiance 3.7.2, I've gotten most of\nthese\nwarnings also when I compiled the stand-alone tiff-3.8.2 before - so, I\ncan \nlive with them [and I don't blame you at all there :-)]. On the other\nhand,\nthough, I see\n\n\nLibtiff is now configured for mips-sgi-irix6.5\n\n\n  Installation directory:             /usr/local\n\n\nalthough libtiff is indeed later installed in src/lib as wanted...\n\n\n\n\n5. BTW, upon installation of Radiance 3.7.2, I get a directory\n\n\n<...>/test/test data/\n\n\n[note the blank in the dir name], and I can't access files in there at\nall:\n\n\n\n\nIRIS 121 $ cd /disk03/mephisto/source/radiance_3.7.2/test/test data\nksh: /disk03/mephisto/source/radiance_3.7.2/test/test:  not found\n\n\n\n\nOK, I'd run <makeall clean> - this time I got no error (!) with\n\n\nIn directory px...\n\trm -f [...]\n\tcd tiff; make distclean\n\n\n[although .o/.lo are not cleaned out in tiff/libtiff at all - I deleted\nthem \nmanually], but I got a new error:\n\n\nMaking distclean in man\nmake: file `Makefile' line 292: Syntax error\n*** Error code 1 (bu21)\n*** Error code 1 (bu21)\n*** Error code 1 (bu21)\n\n\nwhich I didn't have when compiling the stand-alone tiff-3.8.2.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, prompted by 3) above, in <...>/src//hd/rhd_ogl.c, I added\n\n\n326a327\n>         double d;\n\n\n[guessed from similiar usages of d in the same .c], and this error went\nupon\na fresh <makeall install>.\n\n\nHowever, as my original ximage problem was still there, I installed\n3.7.2 also\non my SGI INDIGO2 [IRIX 6.5.22/MipsPro 7.4.2/GR2] and afterwards the\n3.7.2\nximage worked on it fine! So, I copied the 3.7.2 ximage as generated on\nthe\nINDIGO2 to the FUEL - but I got only the original problem again. Then I\ncopied the 3.7.2 image as generated on the FUEL to the INDIGO2 but \nunderstandibly it didn't run there at all:\n\n\nksh: ximage: Program not supported by architecture\n\n\nSo, my conclusions are:\n\n\n1. There is something wrong on my FUEL, or\n\n\n2. Radiance 3.7.2 doesn't work properly anymore on the FUEL [to repeat:\n   ximage after recompilation of 3.1.11 on the FUEL works quite well\nthere]...\n\n\n\n\nPresently, I'm just stuck...\n\n\nAnyhow, thanks for wading thru this long post...\n\n\n/oskar\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003709.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Oskar Itzinger", "created_at": "May 23, 2006 at 09:25AM", "created_by": "Oskar_Itzinger", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003677", "id": "radiance-general_003709"}
