{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nsorry if I sounded too complicated. What I meant is simply:\n\n\nI have two machines,\n\n\nA. SGI INDIGO2, IRIX 6.5.22, MipsPro 7.4.2 compiler, \"Extreme\"\n   graphics\n\n\nB. SGI FUEL, IRIX 6.5.28, MipsPro 7.4.4 compiler, \"VPro12\"\n   graphics\n\n\nNow, after re-compilation on A and B respectively, I have on\n\n\nA. Radiance 3.1.11: ximage displays pics *ok\" color-wise\n   Radiance 3.7.2: ximage displays pics *ok* color-wise\n\n\nB: Radiance 3.1.11: ximage displays pics *ok* color-wise\n   Radiance 3.7.2: ximage displays pics *wrongly* color-wise\n\n\nPerhaps something in the way X visuals are selected changed from\n3.1 to 3.7 [my default on B is an 8-bit PseudoColor visual - but\nI could alter that to something else if necessary].\n\n\nMaybe it helps if I recompile 3.7.2 on B with -DDEBUG to see \nwhich visuals are recognized and which one is finally selected in \nx11image.c?\n\n\nBTW, running \"rmake ximage\" in ray/sr/px didn't change any...\n\n\nThanks.\n/oskar\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003715.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Oskar Itzinger", "created_at": "May 24, 2006 at 12:12PM", "created_by": "Oskar_Itzinger", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003677", "id": "radiance-general_003715"}
