{"body": "Hi Oskar,\n\n\nI'm moving this to the Radiance development list, since it is a code  \nissue that's of limited use to others.  Please respond there rather  \nthan replying to this.  (You will need to subscribe first if you  \naren't already on that list at <http://www.radiance-online.org/ \nmailman/listinfo/radiance-dev>.)\n\n\nDefinitely run both versions of ximage on both machines after  \ncompiling with -DDEBUG, because the visual selection code changed  \nconsiderably between 3.1.11 and 3.7.2.  It seems the color table code  \nalso changed, though, and the problem might be there.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003719.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 24, 2006 at 06:14PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003677", "id": "radiance-general_003719"}
