{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThis sounds like a great plan to me -- very much along the lines of  \nwhat Peter and I and others have been discussing.  I guess you didn't  \nsee the proposal I put together last November (attached).  Many  \nobjected to my proposal as impractical, which it probably is.  Your  \napproach sounds like it will work, though.\n\n\nThe keywords you have look good.  You can also mine the old archive  \nlists for other keywords, i.e.:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/topickey.html\n\n\nTo your keywords, you might add:\n\n\n\tCalculationParameters\n\tAnimation\n\tReference (basic references)\n\tPrinciples (method references)\n\tValidation\n\tCommands (man pages)\n\n\nRename these as you see fit to make them understandable.\n\n\nI'm so glad you're doing this!\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\n-------------- November 2005 Radiance Documentation Site Proposal  \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nSince its initial release in 1989, LBNL's Radiance software has  \nsteadily gained in capabilities and popularity to where it is now  \nrespected as the world's most advanced lighting simulation and  \nrendering system for daylight design.  Today, over a dozen commercial  \npackages employ some version of Radiance as their primary calculation  \nengine, and for the past four years, an international community of  \nusers, developers, and researchers have been actively communicating  \non a public mailing list and attending an annual workshop dedicated  \nto this package.  By a recent survey, about half of those who perform  \ndaylighting simulation (knowingly or unknowingly) use some version of  \nRadiance.  The other half employ a variety of different calculation  \nengines, with no close second in terms of overall popularity.\n\n\nThe Radiance package itself consists of over 100 individual programs,  \nwhich are designed to be used in combination following the UNIX  \n\"toolbox\" model.  This power and flexibility comes at a price, which  \nis the time it takes to learn such a complex system.  Although the  \nbasics can be handled with just a few essential commands, even these  \nare subtle and take time to master compared to a more typical menu- \ndriven application.  Even with the help of the book, \"Rendering with  \nRadiance: The Art and Science of Lighting Visualization,\" potential  \nusers are scared off by the learning curve, or give up at some point  \nin favor of simpler tools.  Our most dedicated users are those who,  \nafter one or more false starts, realized that the only way to solve  \ntheir challenging daylighting problems was to buckle down and learn  \nRadiance.\n\n\nBecause people come to Radiance with hard problems to solve,  \noftentimes the basics are not enough.  In many cases, they need to  \nfathom some lesser-used aspect of the system particular to their  \ntask, and for this the primary text may not have the answer.  So,  \nthey browse reference material on the Radiance websites and other  \nsites, searching for relevant information.  Failing that, or perhaps  \nbefore searching, they ask the online community, who frequently know  \nthe answers already or can point to appropriate references where the  \nanswers may be found.  Frequently, a respondent will take the time to  \nwork through another user's problem, to everyone's benefit.  The  \nnature of freeware encourages this sort of interaction, where people  \nfeel indebted to the software developers and to other users for  \nsupport they received when they were starting out themselves.\n\n\nAlthough there is a wealth of information available on Radiance in  \nthe form of manuals, technical reports, tutorials, articles, e-mail  \narchives, and notes, this documentation is loosely organized and in  \nsome cases difficult to track down for the average user.  This is  \npartially compensated by Radiance's active online community, but a  \nmailing list is not always the best or most efficient way to get  \ninformation.  Firstly, the troubled user must understand their  \nproblem well enough to formulate a coherent question, and English is  \noften a second language.  Secondly, the user must be willing to wait  \nfor an answer.  Sometimes, it comes within hours.  More often, it  \ntakes a day or two, and sometimes, if their question is poorly worded  \nor on an obscure topic, they never get an answer at all.  Even when  \nthey get an answer, it frequently begins a conversation between two  \nor more users that takes a week or so to reach a conclusion.  If you  \nare stuck on some problem and facing a deadline, this represents  \nprecious time lost, and it would be better to spend more time up  \nfront searching the archives to find an answer without bothering the  \nonline community, if such an answer exists.\n\n\nPROPOSAL\n\n\nWe propose to develop an online documentation system for Radiance  \nthat gathers together all extant information in a tree structure to  \nfacilitate top-down searches.  At the front page, users will be able  \nto perform keyword searches or choose from a small number of  \ncategories that will narrow their search at each level, drilling down  \nuntil the system either finds a set of relevant materials, or tells  \nthe user that no information exists, suggesting a topic for a message  \nto the radiance-online mailing list.\n\n\nIf the user subsequently composes a question for the mailing list  \nwith the suggested subject, the thread is followed and the outcome is  \nthen placed in the documentation tree at the point where the user  \noriginally reached a dead end.  Online users will be encouraged to  \ncreate a summary or conclusion for each mailing list topic, and  \nprovide additional links to relevant information for the website.\n\n\nIn this manner, the website will be maintained and updated by the  \nuser community in a semi-automatic fashion.  A FAQ could also be  \ngenerated automatically based on repeated queries.  This would  \nprovide new users a place to go before they even know what questions  \nto ask.\n\n\nThe basic goal of this project is to gather together existing  \ndocumentation for Radiance, bringing it together in a system that  \npermits the user community to continually improve and update the  \ncontent over time.  The facilities developed in this project and the  \nlessons learned will have broader application to other LBNL software  \npackages with active online communities, such as EnergyPlus and DOE-2 \n(??).\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\nThe project will require approximately 6 person-months for a web  \ndeveloper to organize the material and create the appropriate pages  \nand link together existing and develop new tools for automatic  \nupdating.  An additional 3 person-months will be required from the  \nsoftware's original author, for expert advice on where to find the  \nraw material and how best to organize it.  The project timeline will  \nallow 6 months from start until the website goes public, followed by  \na 6-month live testing and evaluation period.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000709.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 25, 2006 at 02:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000708", "id": "radiance-dev_000709"}
