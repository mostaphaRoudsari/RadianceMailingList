{"body": "Hi Axel. \n\n\nThanks for your effort to collect all the floating wisdom. \n\n\n> In the meantime, may I ask for your feedback regarding the \n> keywords. While I can easily add new ones as we go along, \n> changing existing ones (or dropping them) is more difficult. \n\n\nSince those are only \"keywords\" I expect there will be a\nlot of them in the long run which could become a problem\nbecause it generates to few or to much hits. Perhaps they\ncould be organized in a tree-like structure to show the\ncoverage of the same topic in \"higher\" levels.\n\n\n> Here is what I thought:\n> \n>     * AddOns\n>     * Ambient\n>     * Daylighting\n>     * Generators\n>     * HDR\n>     * Materials\n>     * Modelling\n>     * Patterns\n>     * Scripting\n>     * Textures\n>     * Tutorial\n\n\nA bit rewritten and adding Greg's and my own new keywords:\n\n\n     * AddOns\n     * HDR\n     * Materials\n       - Basic Types\n       - BRDF\n       - Light Sources\n       - Patterns\n       - Scripting\n       - Textures\n     * Modelling\n       - Generators\n       - Export/Import\n       - Primitives\n     * Reference\n       - Basics\n       - Commands\n       - Methods (for experts)\n     * Rendering\n       - Tools\n       - Parameters\n         -- Ambient\n     * Scripting\n       - Animation\n       - Examples\n       - Patterns\n     * Simulation\n       - Artificial\n       - Daylighting\n         -- Skymodels/Generators\n       - Urban Context\n     * Tutorial\n       - Basic\n       - Advanced\n       - Best Practices\n     * Validation\n\n\nSo if you don't find good information for \"Textures\" you could\nlook up sub-keywords of \"Materials\" and try \"Scripting\" instead.\nCombination of both would be best (\"Scripting\" in the context of\n\"Materials\").\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
