You \nmention a time-dependent wave texture. (!)  This sounds rather like some \nsort of variable texture that modulates the surface normal based on a \ntime input.  One could script up a run of images and for each frame that \nwater material would be modified by a random deformation that is keyed \nto timestep?  This sounds like an interesting application, and I was \nwondering if you had a framework for such a material description.  cal \nfiles are really something I'm trying to understand more, and each \nexample helps a little bit more. \n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003723.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 25, 2006 at 05:42PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003720", "id": "radiance-general_003723"}
