{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI can't say I've done it before, but the usual way to animate things  \nin Radiance is to generate a different model at each time step.   \nThere's no reason you can't modify your material descriptions as you  \ndo this, changing real arguments on your texfunc primitives, which  \nare then interpreted by the.cal file to modify the origin and other  \nparameters associated with a water texture.\n\n\nYou could also modify the .cal file at each step, but I advise  \nagainst that approach, as it won't work reliably with ranimate unless  \nyou gave the .cal file a unique name for each time step, at which  \npoint you will have to modify your material primitive, anyway.\n\n\nSorry I don't have any ready examples for you.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003724.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 25, 2006 at 06:05PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003720", "id": "radiance-general_003724"}
