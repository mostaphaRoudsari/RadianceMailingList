But for you the light\nquality might become more important. E.g. glare would be not acceptable,\nif you are painting, you would want a continous color and possibly light\nlevel. I think that is why these good old atelier windows were directed\nto north - big surface (diffuse-bright rooms), continous (non-direct)\nlight over the day. I am not sure about the sculptures, but I think for\nworking on them, the same applies (directional light will be nice to\npresent them, but while working could be irritating).\n\n\n\n\nI wonder if all these great new materials would not be great for this\nkind of project... just thinking about translucent insulation panels\n(these blocks filled with small glass tubes), giving diffuse light\nwithout the thermal drawback of the old atelier window idea...? I am\njust telling that to you because I would be curious how you render the\ndesign in Radiance... :-)\n\n\nCU + have fun (you are an architect, too, aren't you?), Lars-\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003730.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
