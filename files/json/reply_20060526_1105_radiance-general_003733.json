Were the panels used on all sides or to one direction only? My idea was to have a big diffuse-translucent wall (only) to north. Also Ithink that for an exhibition pavillion, especially for architectural models, a diffuse environment is a terrific idea. All those I know use spots to take fotos of their models and to show them (of course with a diffuse environment around).\n\n\nBut I really wonder on the impact of these panels on color, did you experience any noticable effect? It would also interesting to know what happens after some years, at least with those based on plastics (I would not worry about the glass-based products, but I am also not sure here). Christopher has done validation work on such panels, maybe he has more to say about it.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003733.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
