{"body": "Hi,\n\n\none idea... as this will require generating the octree for every frame, I wonder if it helps to make a frozen octree of the whole scene except the water, scene.oct. Than exporting only the water objects for each frame, lets call them water[FRAME].rtm. Now if you write a script that creates scenes with only two objects, one being an instance of scene.oct, the second a mesh object water[FRAME].rtm. That way you will not have to run octree each time on the whole scene, right?\n\n\nIn fact, I wanted to propose to use the -i option of oconv so that you can type oconv -i scene.oct water[FRAME].rad > scene[FRAME].oct. But who uses obj2rad any more... ;-)\n\n\nWhat do you think folks, I cannot try that at the moment to find if the gain from less work in oconv is worth the overhead. Also instance and mesh would overlap completely.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003734.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
