{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe way I'd recommend creating such a scene is to regenerate the  \nwater mesh, then add the little bit of geometry containing the \"mesh\"  \nprimitive that references to an existing octree, a la:\n\n\n\tobj2mesh water.obj > water.rtm\n\toconv -f -i scene-water.oct water.rad > scene+water.oct\n\n\nWhere water.rad contains the mesh primitive and maybe a material.   \nThe oconv command only takes as long as it takes to read and write  \nback out the octree -- best if it's frozen for that reason.\n\n\nIf you know for certain that your mesh always ends up with the same  \noverall dimensions, you don't even need to rerun oconv, technically.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003735.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 26, 2006 at 04:14PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003720", "id": "radiance-general_003735"}
