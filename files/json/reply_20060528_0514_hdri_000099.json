Greg, how come there  \nis so much color wackiness in the higher dynamic range areas - the  \ncolors get way over-saturated and the contrast goes south pretty  \nquickly - I'm guessing that multiple exposures of the HDR with some  \nlayer masking and compositing may give better results.  I tried  \nmessing with the tone map curve in PShop CS2, but that will take some  \ngetting used to.\n\n\nneat-o!\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2006, at 10:14 PM, Gregory J.
