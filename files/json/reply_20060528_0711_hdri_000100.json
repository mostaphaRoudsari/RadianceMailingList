{"body": "Hi Kirk,\n\n\nNice panos!  The color strangeness is just the usual problem related  \nto a global tone-mapper like the one in Photosphere.  To preserve  \nlocal color and contrast, you need to use a local tone-mapping  \nalgorithm.  Unfortunately, I don't have any to offer at the moment.\n\n\nErik Reinhard has implemented a bunch (including his own) and put the  \nsource code on the HDR Imaging book's DVD-ROM if you want to give  \nthose a try.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-May/000100.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 28, 2006 at 07:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000081", "id": "hdri_000100"}
