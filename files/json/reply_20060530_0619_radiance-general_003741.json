{"body": "Hi Adriana,\n\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no standard metric for radiance independent  \nof incoming direction.  You either need to define a particular  \ndirection, or in your case you probably want the irradiance value,  \nwhich is the integral of radiance over the projected hemisphere.   \nThis also requires you to define a facing direction.\n\n\nPhil Dutre has a nice compendium that explains lighting units, which  \nmay be found at:\n\n\n\thttp://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~phil/GI/\n\n\nSection VI, starting page 25  is probably where you want to look.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003741.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 30, 2006 at 06:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003740", "id": "radiance-general_003741"}
