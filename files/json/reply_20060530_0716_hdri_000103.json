{"body": "Hi folks - Here is another HDR panorama:\n\n\nhttp://kirkt.smugmug.com/photos/72305493-L.jpg\n\n\nI am experimenting with the excellent tone mapping operators on the  \nDVD included with Greg at al's HDRI book - really cool stuff.\n\n\nThe above image was mapped using the <tm_photographic> tone mapping  \non the DVD.  It did a nice job of keeping the color shifts under  \ncontrol so I could play with curves and saturation on the mapped  \nimage without getting too weird results.  If you would like to take a  \nlook at the full size image (5000 px wide) it is here:\n\n\nhttp://kirkt.smugmug.com/gallery/1473939/1/72305493\n\n\nIt really is a testament to Photosphere's stitching ability.  Greg -  \nwhat a great tool, I can't believe how abusive my images are to your  \napp with seemingly little fuss and excellent results.  Awesome.  I  \nwill post another image (not panorama) with all of the tone mapping  \noperators and their DEFAULT output (not necessarily optimal - I need  \nto read the chapters on the book to get a handle on all of the  \nparameters).\n\n\nsweet stuff - thanks Greg.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2006, at 10:14 PM, Gregory J.
