It\nhas never really taken off big time, though...\n\n\nThe concept was implemented later on by Megatron in their 'CIM - Cubic\nIllumination Meter', which to my knowledge is the only instrument of this\nkind.\nhttp://www.megatron.co.uk/homepage.html\nThe idea is to measure the light in the six main directions (+/-x, +/-y,\n+/-z), thus defining a vector of illuminance.\n\n\nThe Advance RADIANCE Tutorial under\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml, pp 43-...\nwill show you how to measure vector illuminance in RADIANCE (lots of shell\nscripts). Since you're after the RGB, just separate the individual\nchannels.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003742.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 30, 2006 at 12:47PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003740", "id": "radiance-general_003742"}
