{"body": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz\n\n\n> Hi folks,\n> \n> sorry to bother you, but I think we'll have some changes with \n> radiance-online in June 2006 :\n> \n> After running this site for 6 years and going from \n> \"guerrilla\" state to semi-official with 300+ subscribed folks \n> on a stable, back-upped system, I feel like I've done my \n> little share and, for various reasons, would like to pass on \n> the torch.\n\n\nThanks for that work, Peter!\n\n\n> The domain had been registered (and paid for) by \n> me at Network Solutions and will expire* 27. July 2006 *, so \n> you guys might want to establish a new way before that date.\n> Someone would have to locate new hardware and a new provider, \n> or re-use other existing servers, as the current server (a \n> 19\" rack mount on loan from pab-opto) and its location would \n> not be available.\n\n\nThe 27. is a fixed date and we have to act rather quickly to\nget a new system up and running before that. I have no idea\nabout the traffic and load of that server but I expect that\na virtual Linux server would do fine for our small group.\nI'm not up to date on current offers and service quality of\nthe providers but others here might have more experience.\n\n\nPeter, can you provide some figures for traffic and the size\nof radiance-online.org (GB of available data, size of archive\nand CVS)?  \n\n\n> Experience with Linux based Internet \n> servers (if iptables ring a bell- excellent!), Apache, \n> Mailman and CVS are useful.

There gotta be a few folks \n> out here, among the 90 people on the dev list, who fit right\n> in.\n\n\nI'm happy to volonteer as a sys admin in the long run. But\nright now I'm in transition myself and have no private internet\nconnection. I doubt I can use SSH etc. from my workplace. So for\nthe immediate future someone else would have to provide some\nknowledge and time (I could offer time if someone in London can\noffer internet connection ...).\n\n\nBTW: It would be a good idea to have 3 or 4 people with access\nto the system. So emergency response time can be very short even\nduring holiday season ;)\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
