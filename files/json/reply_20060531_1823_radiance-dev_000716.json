{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nFirst off, I want to add to what Thomas said. Thanks for all the hard \nwork, Peter! Truly, getting the radiance-online site up and running has \ndefinitely been one of the critical elements to revitalizing and \nconsolidating the Radiance community over these 6 years. We have \nprobably all taken for granted the energy and effort to keep the site so \nwell maintained over the years. I am sorry for that.\n\n\nThe rest I offer just as a way to help get on the table some of the \nissues that we need to consider. I think there are two critical issues:\n\n\n   1. domain name transfer - I am not sure about this but I do not think\n      that someone can just go and sign up for the domain name, is there\n      a process through Network Solutions for Peter to transfer the\n      domain name to another party who would pay for and administer the\n      domain name?\n   2. site content and functionality - would it be worth considering\n      some kind of \"open source\" oriented hosting/project service such\n      as sourceforge or ibiblio?\n\n\nIt is not clear to me whether a commercial hosting service (some of \nwhich can be had quite cheaply) would be able to fulfill the range of \nfunctionality that the site currently has, perhaps others know more. So \nthis would suggest that some kind of co-location solution may be required.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000716.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 31, 2006 at 06:23PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000716"}
