That's why we need to do it first and as\nsoon as possible. If there are any problems in transfering the\ndomain to another ISP (which should not happen because it's only\nbad customer service on the side of one of the providers) I can\nask friends who run a small ISP to help us with this.\n\n\n> 2. site content and functionality - would it be worth considering\n> some kind of \"open source\" oriented hosting/project service such\n> as sourceforge or ibiblio?\n>\n> It is not clear to me whether a commercial hosting service (some\n> of which can be had quite cheaply) would be able to fulfill the\n> range of functionality that the site currently has, perhaps others\n> know more.

What we need now\nis basically (and in order of my personal preference):\n\n\n1) mailing-lists \n2) CVS\n3) download of resources (Workshop CDs, etc)\n4) news and links about Radiance events\n\n\nShort of an academic sponsor for this unofficial site I think hosting\nis the best way for a reliable and troublefree internet presence. \nMy proposal to rent a virtual \"root\" server is based on the assumption\nthat in terms of load and size the above list does not justify a \"real\"\n(hardware) server. Virtual servers are cheaper and provide at least\nthe same level of controll.\n\n\nI'd like to have a dedicated \"machine\" for radiance-online.org because\nmuch more than the above is possible and has been discussed and realised\nin the past by various individuals. Depending on the dedication and\nskill\nof the admins we could set up a Wiki, resources repository or CMS\n(documentation!) to collect all the small bits of information out there\nin one site. \n\n\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
