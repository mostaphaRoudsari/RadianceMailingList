{"body": "> Peter, can you provide some figures for traffic and the size\n> of radiance-online.org (GB of available data, size of archive\n> and CVS)?\n\n\nThe stats are on the site: http://www.radiance-online.org/webalizer/stats/\n\n\nFor May, 25k pages generated 8GB of traffic\n\n\nThis is quite a bit, and hosting will not be cheap. I reckon at least\n300-400 Euros.\n\n\nI don't know if this is only normal web pages, and how much CVS traffic\nthere is. For CVS, SF would probably be a good idea.\n\n\nAltough I'd be happy to offer academic band-width sponsorship, I have to\nadmit that we don't have the resources (time and hardware) to support\nthis. Plus on top of this, our network and power are rather unreliable. As\nan example: luminance, where webhdr and learnix are hosted, is a K6-II\n500MHz. This is as good as it gets.\n\n\nHaving said all that, I would happily dedicate some of my own time setting\nup a box and maintaining it. This would require SSH access, though, which\nnot many hosters are willing to provide these days. It would be much\nbetter if a generous sponsor could bring up a box.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000719.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 31, 2006 at 08:57PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000719"}
