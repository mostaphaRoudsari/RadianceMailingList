{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nI think that what I mean about the domain name transfer. Is not \ntransferring the domain name from one registrar to another this should \nnot be an issue. What I was wondering about is rather than wait for \nexpiration and re-register the domain, if we could not arrange for a \nmore orderly transfer. Actually, I have just gone to my Network \nSolutions account, a preliminary review looks like it is possible to \nrequest transfer from own party to another, so this may be the best \nmechanism.\n\n\nI have a friend who is a networking/security consultant, I will ask him \nfor recommendations for virtual hosting providers.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000720.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 31, 2006 at 09:04PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000720"}
