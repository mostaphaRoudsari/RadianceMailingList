That could be set up in advance of  \nthe physical server change.  Pending LBNL's response to Greg's  \nrequest that they host the site, I can ask my friend who hosts my  \npersonal website if he's interested in picking this up.  He's got a  \nnice server in a colo in Seattle and he is the CTO of a large  \neCommerce site; he knows how to run a website.  He's open to  \ninstalling most software and ssh access is a given, so it could be a  \ngood hosting option of the LBNL thing falls through.  Greg, let me know.\n\n\nPeter, a huge Thank You to you for setting up and running radiance- \nonline.org.  I agree with Jack that your site (and especially the  \nlist) has been instrumental in invigorating the interest and support  \nof this great program called Radiance. Thanks!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000724.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 01, 2006 at 08:22AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000724"}
