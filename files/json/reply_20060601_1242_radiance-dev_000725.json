{"body": "Hi.\n\n\nAs things start to develop rather fast at the moment, I will add some ideas to the discussion.\n\n\nAs some may or may not memember, I asked about some kind of Radiance Knowledge Base some time ago, as I found the wiki to be dead. After that, at least documentation projects were started, one being some kind of keyword-based and directory (Axel's project, I think he will show us more soon ;-) with ranking to make information available, the other an attempt to implement the collaborative writing ideas discussed here I started using the CMS called Drupal, which offers a content type called book that not only can be edited, but also ex- and imported for those working offline and even, still limited, export to docbook. It is also possible to use tex-written content (useful for the maths and not unimportant for Radiance). As I did plan to first stabilize and fill with some content, I had not announced this, but the site's skeleton is available at radiance.free-architecture.org. Actually I would prefer it to be integrated into radiance-online as close as possible.\n\n\nIf a new Radiance site is set up, I offer to move all my existing efforts over to that. So please think over how useful the integration of this documentation effort would be, and consider even taking the installation as a CMS for the new site.\n\n\nSecond, I asked people from my old university if it is possible to host the site. I did not get any answer, but maybe it is one more option to choose. It would add Solaris to the list of platform/OS options. But actually, for web services, I never saw much of a difference between all the unix-likes.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000725.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
