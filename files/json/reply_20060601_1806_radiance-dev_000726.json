As well I'm not sure their admins would be happy\nwith people messing around on one of their machines who are\nnot directly connected to the institute.\n\n\nOTOH I obviously had a wrong idea about hosting prices these\ndays ... From the financial point of view any sponsorship would\nbe preferred. If we can get a liberal (internet) sponsor I'd be\nhappy to help setting things up there. But I'd think twice if\nit includes restrictions about what we can do with the site. \n\n\n> I agree that it would be great to consolidate the old site with  \n> radiance-online.org.\n\n\nIt is a great idea to consolidate any knowledge out there.\nA tidy radiance-online.org would be a good start.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
