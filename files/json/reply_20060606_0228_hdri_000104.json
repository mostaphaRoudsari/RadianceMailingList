{"body": "Here's another panorama - LDR but with a twist.  This panorama is  \ncomposed of 10 macro photos of a charm bracelet.  The image was  \ncomposed by stitching the top row (5 images left to right) and bottom  \nrow (5 images left to right).  These two panoramas were then stitched  \ntogether with a single wave of the magic \"pano orig\" and \"pano dest\"  \nwand.\n\n\nhttp://kirkt.smugmug.com/gallery/1473939/1/73398853\n\n\nThe bracelet was moved underneath the stationary camera - an XY  \npositioning table would have been nice, but a white note pad did the  \ntrick.  There is motion artifact in the upper right of the image,  \nwhere the bracelet must have moved between shots.  Pretty cool.  I  \nresized the image down to 5000 pixels wide.  I can imagine very large  \nmicroscopy panoramas being generated this way, with a flash or HTML  \ncomponent that would permit the viewer to click on a section of a lo- \nres image and get a higher res version of that section - sort of like  \nzooming in.  The lighting was provided during midday, under a patio  \numbrella.  To get sufficient DoF, I used f/32 with 1/2 sec shutter  \nspeed across all images.  The first time I tried to generate the  \nimage sequence, the sun went in, and the exposure got messed up.  The  \nnext time, the clouds cooperated.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2006, at 10:14 PM, Gregory J.
