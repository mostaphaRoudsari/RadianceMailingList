{"body": "Hi.\n\n\nSo after last week's mail traffic peak it got calm here again. Who will \ntake over the domain? Did you ask at lbl, Greg? I did not get an answer \nso far from my ex-university.\n\n\nDid anybody consider my content-management proposal? If you want I can \nactivate some functions that may be necessary for a general web-site \n(and which I have switched off until now to make the environment easier \nfor the documentation-only project). If it sounds interesting to you (at \nleast as an option so that we should play around with and try it), I am \nwilling to give some afternoons to work on it, so that it may become the \nbase for a future radiance-online.org transition. If not, I will spend \nthe time doing some day- and sunlight studies at the sea instead. ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000727.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
