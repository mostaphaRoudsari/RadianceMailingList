{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI inquired with Stephen Selkowitz at LBNL, who expressed an interest  \nin assuming the radiance-online.org domain and revitalizing the  \nRadiance website.  I will attempt to meet with him on the topic this  \nweek, but since I will be gone for a month starting Monday, this  \nisn't the best time for me to oversee such an operation.  Not that  \nI'm the best person to do it, anyway.  I think if we can get Steve to  \nagree and Danny Fuller at LBNL talking with Peter A-B, the wheels  \nwill be in proper motion.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000728.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 06, 2006 at 05:46PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000728"}
