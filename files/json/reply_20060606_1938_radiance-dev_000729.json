{"body": "I guess it's time to crawl out from under my rock once again...\n\n\nIt may make sense to split the job into the following parts:\n\n\n1) CVS\n2) Source and binary downloads\n3) Mailing lists\n4) Mailing list archives\n5) General introduction and links\n6) Workshop data\n7) Knowledge base (future)\n\n\nThe first three can easily be solved on Sourceforge. I already\nrun a project there, and would have no problem to set up another\none. Unfortunately, their mailing list archive functionality\nis suboptimal, so we better keep item 4) on a seperate site.\n\n\nI can host another domain on my account at www.pair.com for 1 USD\nper Month. It should not be too much work (I hope) to maintain\nthe mailing list archives and the general information pages there.\nThe easiest way to distribute the workload would be to turn the\ncomplete site (minus the archives) into a wiki. Most of the\ncurrently static pages could be made dynamic, so that the members\nof the community can help to keep them up to date. The wiki\ntechnology then allows to grow that into a more complete\nknowledgebase collaboratively over time.\n\n\nThe only problem are the presentations from the Workshops,\nbecause of their sheer volume. If we want to keep those CDs\nonline both as ISO images and for direct access, then we need a\nplace to store up to 1.5 GB of data per year. Since this data\nnever changes once it has been posted, maybe Radsite at LBNL\nwould be a good place to host it. That way they could help us the\nmost with the least maintenance effort at their end.\n\n\nI'm still waiting for Peter do divulge a few real life figures\nabout work effort, disk usage, and bandwidth requirements. The\nlatter shouldn't be a problem as I have 200GB/month to burn, but\nknowing more about the first two would make it easier to decide\nabout the best way to proceed.\n\n\nover the last year or so, I have neglected the Radiance community\n(and others) much more than I would have liked. I'm not sure if\nI'll have much more time available for active development in the\nfuture, but I'd be happy to offer some support for the community\ninfrastructure. Keeping an eye on a few mostly automated\nprocedures should be well within my capacities.  I am already\nfamiliar with both Mailman (for the archives) and MoinMoin (for\nthe wiki), so it's just a matter of configuring another instance\nof each for this domain.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000729.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "June 06, 2006 at 07:38PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000729"}
