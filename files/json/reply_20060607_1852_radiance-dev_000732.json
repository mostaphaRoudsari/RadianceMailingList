{"body": "Hi Doug,\n\n\nDocumentation for Radiance source code is scant, and I can't remember  \nhow the stereo mode in the old SGI's worked all that well, other than  \nthe fact that it used two frame buffers and the pixel aspect ratio  \ncould change.\n\n\nIf you search for all occurrences of STEREO in rhd_ogl.c, you will  \nfind the places where code changes may be necessary, but I can't  \nreally advise you on what they should be for the G5 quad's stereo  \noption.\n\n\nIf you get this to work, I'll be happy to do my part and  \nreincorporate it back into the main distribution.\n\n\nBest of luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000732.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 07, 2006 at 06:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000731", "id": "radiance-dev_000732"}
