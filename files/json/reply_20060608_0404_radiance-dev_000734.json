Other than the  \ndozens of mirror sites and mass confusion that results, is there any  \nadvantage to going this route?  Would we lose the nice CVS source  \ntree access Peter's set up at <http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/ \nviewcvs.cgi/>?  I have no problem with read-only CVS access, though I  \ndon't find the system terribly convenient, myself.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000734.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 08, 2006 at 04:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000734"}
