{"body": "BRLCAD (which is a free csg-based CAD) supports both IGES and OBJ. So \nyou could try to convert from IGES to G (the model format in BRLCAD) and \nfrom G to OBJ. As BRLCAD is a unix application, just like radiance, it \nshould be possible to easily integrate this into your radiance workflow \nby piping through the conversion chain (import and export filters are \nstandalone command line tools).\n\n\nCool... I will just try that out myself tonight ;-)))\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
