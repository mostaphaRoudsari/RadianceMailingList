It's just one more\nclick.\n\n\nI don't see LBNL installing, running, continuously updating, and\nadministrating a public CVS server, and I am certainly not in a\nposition to do it myself. Since nobody has presented a workable\nalternative so far, there is no choice but to use Sourceforge or\na similar service. Francesco has suggested Savannah, which seems\nto be something similar, although with much less functionality.\nIt might still be sufficient for what we need, though.\n\n\nThere are a few other (usually smaller) sites that do similar\nthings. I have only worked with Sourceforge myself, so I don't\nknow how well the others work. Obviously, Sourceforge will catch\nthe most flak when something goes wrong, simply because of their\nlarge number of users. On the other hand, thousands of projects\nare still quite happy with them, especially now that the CVS and\nmailing list services have been upgraded.\n\n\n\n\nBut the most urgent question is what happens with the domain.\nIf we get too close to the expiry date, then Netsol will block\nany transfer attempts until after the next period has been paid\nfor. Since Netsol is one of the most expensive registrars, we\nprobably don't want that to happen. So whoever gets assigned as\nthe future host of radiance-online.org should initiate the domain\ntransfer immediately. After that we still have time to figure out\nall the other details.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000740.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "June 10, 2006 at 02:36AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000740"}
