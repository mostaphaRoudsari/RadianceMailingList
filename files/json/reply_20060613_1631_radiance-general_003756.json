{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nOne thing to try would be to use the corrug.cal which simulates \ncorrugations. I know this is not exactly the same but it would give you \nthe linear effect of such a roofing material. One could probably modify \nthis with a step function to great a sharp cutoff versus what the smooth \nfuntion in corrug.cal. Perhaps another option would be to engineer a \nsimple repetitive cal with with perhaps three different value (color at \ntop of metal rib, color at bottom and shadow). Yet another alternative \ncould be to make an image map in Gimp (or photoshop) that can be tiled \nto create the effect you want.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003756.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "June 13, 2006 at 04:31PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003755", "id": "radiance-general_003756"}
