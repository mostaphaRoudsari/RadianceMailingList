{"body": "Just to ensure we don't start heading 6 directions at once, I am  \ncontinuing discussions with Peter and LBL regarding transfer of the  \nradiance-online.org domain to an LBL server.  This won't mean that  \nanyone will be shut out of content management -- quite the contrary.   \nWe will need all the help we can get putting this together and  \ndeveloping it further, the hope being to collate information that's  \ncurrently scattered.  As a start, we plan to transfer what currently  \nlives on PAB's server to an LBL-hosted site.  Once this is stable,  \nwe'll invite others to join in content creation and management, and  \nif someone wants to mirror the site in Europe, that would be great.   \nWe're trying to avoid the situation of burdening people with IT  \nmanagement that isn't all that fun in the long run, while encouraging  \nothers to participate in the content, which is the rewarding part.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000743.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 14, 2006 at 09:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000741", "id": "radiance-dev_000743"}
