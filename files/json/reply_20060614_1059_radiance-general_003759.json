{"body": "These two commands will help you in the task.\n3ds3mgf\nmgf2rad\nOptionally you may use\ntorad or dxf2rad.\n\n\nI use obj (obj2rad and obj2mesh) as an exchange file format but I do not\nthink that autocad has this option. You may investigate blender and brad\nor an alternative commercial solution (maya, cinema, max, rhino...).\n\n\nAdditionally there is a script that eliminates the material descriptions\nfrom 3ds converted files and allows you to use a custom file for them\n(this would facilitate updating the model if using 3ds). Look for it on\nthis email list, it's somewhere.\n\n\nAnyway the strategy is almost the same with all of them: you create a 3d\nfile within your favourite software, save as an exchange format, run the\nconversion command, compile the scene and generate the results.\nEvery time you change the model in a 3d software you need to import it\nagain (this can be automated with a script).\n\n\nhope this is useful.\nciao\nG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003759.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "June 14, 2006 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003757", "id": "radiance-general_003759"}
