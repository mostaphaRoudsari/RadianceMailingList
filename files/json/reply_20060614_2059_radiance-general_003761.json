{"body": "Hi Ali,\n\n\nAs I understand it, the active development for Desktop Radiance ceased \nsome time ago. It uses an older version of the Radiance simulation \nengine than what is currently available in the standard Radiance \ndistribution. If you want something with a front end gui you might take \na look at Rayfront (www.schorsch.com) otherwise there are compiles of \nRadiance binaries  for cygwin (www.cygwin.com) which runs under windows. \nThe current version of Radiance has quite a few powerful new features \nand enhancements that the older version does not.\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nsasa mj wrote:\n> Hi everyone,\n>\n> Thanks alot for the responses that came from Jack de Valpine & Giulio \n> Antonutto.\n> I am currenting experimenting with Desktop Radiance 2.0 Beta.
