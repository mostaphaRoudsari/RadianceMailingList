{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nI am new to this enviornemnt.\n\n\nI have been doing day lighting analysis using IES which has radiance built\nin to it, but the modeling agent that IES caries is very poor. I have\ncreated the geometry in CATIA and would like to use radiance to analyze it.\n\n\nI guess my first question is where can I find radiance?\nDoes it work on windows? If so what version? (currently running windows xp)\n\n\nThanks\nCharlie.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003762.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "charlie portelli", "created_at": "June 14, 2006 at 11:03PM", "created_by": "charlie_portelli", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003760", "id": "radiance-general_003762"}
