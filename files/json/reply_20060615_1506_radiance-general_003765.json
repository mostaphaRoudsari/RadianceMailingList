{"body": "Ali,\n\n\nTo add to what Jack mentioned, if you wish to use the Desktop Radiance \nAutoCad front end and still use a more recent version of Radiance, you can \ntry replacing the Desktop Radiance binaries (usually located in \nc:\\Radiance\\bin) with the Windows binaries compiled by Francesco Anselmo  \n(select \"Mingw Radiance Binaries\"):\n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4\n\n\nI think that these binaries are compiled from either Radiance version 3.6 or \n3.7. You can not run the cygwin binaries directly from the Desktop Radiance \nfront end. You will have to export the geometry from DR and run the binaries \nfrom cygwin's BASH shell. However, if you use the Windows binaries compiled \nby Francesco, you should be able to run these binaries (e.g. rad, oconv, \nrpict, rtrace, etc) directly from DR. However, it should be noted that you \nwill not be able to use DR's winrview with octrees that are built with the \nFrancesco's Windows binaries.\n\n\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003765.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus Jacobs", "created_at": "June 15, 2006 at 03:06PM", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003760", "id": "radiance-general_003765"}
