{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThe Radiance RGBE format is not able to record negative pixel values,  \nso such primary values should be clamped to zero.  Apparently,  \nPhotoshop is not doing this.  Photosphere (and the Radiance tools)  \ncheck for and truncate negative primaries, writing them out as 0's.   \nOpenEXR doesn't have this issue, as it can read and write negative  \nprimary values -- in fact, you are better off using OpenEXR for your  \nintermediates also as it is a higher-precision format.  It doesn't  \nreally make sense to use a lower-precision format like RGBE for  \nintermediate results then write out your final as OpenEXR, as you've  \nlost information along the way.  It would make more sense the other  \nway around.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-June/000106.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 15, 2006 at 08:39PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000105", "id": "hdri_000106"}
