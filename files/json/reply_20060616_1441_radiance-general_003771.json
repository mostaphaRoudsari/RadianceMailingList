The \nprograms that don't come with a Unix release (are you sure about Pro/E \nand Catia?) often have Mac-OS-versions. And that gives you a more or \nless comfortable unix environment without the need to emulate a unix \nenvironment. The difference between Linux, Solaris and Mac OS on the \ncommand line for Radiance users are neglectible.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003771.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
