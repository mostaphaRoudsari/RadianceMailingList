The odd  \npart is that I don't remember having this problem in the past, but I  \nknow that I recently upgraded to 9.0.1 and because of this problem I  \nhave switched to batch HDR-creation with Photomatix instead (despite  \nusing CS2 in my workflow right *after* creating the HDRs).\n\n\nHere is a page (with links to the \"originals\") illustrating the  \nproblem I am seeing with \"ghosts\" in PS CS2 Merge to HDR:\n\n\nhttp://www.mab3d.com/temp/ot3d/HDartifacts.html\n\n\nAt the same time, this is a general query to see if anyone else has  \nseen/ had these problems with Merge to HDR in CS2, and what they have  \ndiscovered.\n\n\n-Mark\n\n\nBTW, for those that are interested, the ZIP archive of stitched  \nexposures includes JPEGs that have the metadata from the pre-stitch  \nimages appended to them by EXIFtool - makes HDR creation a bit  \neasier. Plus, if you peruse this data in a capable image browser you  \ncan get a good idea of how I process my RAWs for HDR creation.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-June/000109.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Banas", "created_at": "June 16, 2006 at 11:30PM", "created_by": "Mark_Banas", "parent_id": "hdri_000105", "id": "hdri_000109"}
