If  \nanyone wants me to try a windows app on it, let me know.  Oh, I'll  \nalso be trying Minesweeper as well.  ;-)\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nOn Jun 16, 2006, at 10:06 AM, Giulio Antonutto wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003777.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kirk Thibault", "created_at": "June 19, 2006 at 12:44AM", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003767", "id": "radiance-general_003777"}
