{"body": "Chris,\n\n\nDid you build the software? It sounds like the build process \ndidn't know where the librt.so.19 file was during the linking \nprocedure. One way to correct this is to make sure that there is \na \"-L/usr/X11R6/lib/\" -type entry on the linker command line \"ld\" \nor the compile command line (if the compile command is \nresponsible for linking, too, as it sometimes is.)\n\n\nUnfortunately, just moving the library to the right place doesn't \ntell the executable to use it.\n\n\nI am sorry that I can't help more.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Tue, 20 Jun 2006, Chris Foster wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003784.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "June 20, 2006 at 04:58PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003783", "id": "radiance-general_003784"}
