Used photographic meters cost much less than a\nnew LS100, and there are many good ones available.\n\n\nSee <http://www.vsg.cape.com/~pbaum/meter1.htm>.  If you really need\nlots of specific info about light meters, see *The Hand Exposure Meter\nBook*, by Hirschfeld, et al. (not seen, but I know one of the authors by reputation).\n\n\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003802.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "June 26, 2006 at 05:40PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003799", "id": "radiance-general_003802"}
