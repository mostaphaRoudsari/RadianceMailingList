{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nwhile I dont know anything about this particular program I am rather sure\nthat this file librt.so.19 is not in your library path.\nOn my system I issue the following commands to find out more:\n\n\n# locate librt.so\n/lib/librt.so.1\n/usr/lib/librt.so\n\n\n# ls -l /lib/librt.so.1 /usr/lib/librt.so\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14  5. Mai 03:40 /lib/librt.so.1 -> librt-2.3.6.so\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20  5. Mai 03:40 /usr/lib/librt.so ->\n../../lib/librt.so.1\n\n\nSo the 'real' file is actually here: /lib/librt-2.3.6.so\n\n\n# file /lib/librt-2.3.6.so tells you:\n/lib/librt-2.3.6.so: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1\n(SYSV), stripped\n\n\nThe other 'files' you find are so called 'symbolic links'. This way\ndifferrent programs looking for this library can find it in different\ndirectories and you still need only one real copy of it, the rest is done\nvia links.\n\n\nI guess you should first find out what and where your application (iges-g)\nis looking for. Just type the folloing in the directory where your app\nlives:\n\n\n# ldd iges-g\n\n\nAs an example if I want to figure out which libraries 'rpict' needs I type:\n\n\n# ldd /opt/radiance/bin/rpict\n        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000)\n        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0xb7efc000)\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7dec000)\n        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7f28000)\n\n\nThis will show you exactlty where your binary finds (or doesn't) the\nlibaries it needs. Then you can just make a symbolic link from the real\nlocation of 'librt.so' to where it is expected by 'ides-g'.\n\n\nHope this gets you started ;-)\n\n\n-Erwin\n\n\nChris Foster wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003803.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "June 27, 2006 at 01:07PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003783", "id": "radiance-general_003803"}
