{"body": "> But many of us have devised a workflow that allows a relatively smooth \n> transition from the modeling side -- usually done on Windows systems \n> -- to the rendering/calculation side, usually done on an OS X Mac or a \n> Linux box and found the benefits to be worth the efforts.\n\n\nJust to mention such a workflow that works fine:\nWe have Refelction-X running on the windows-os machines. This tool \nallows us to open a shell using a variety of protocols on every \nunix/linux/mac machine available on the network. Reflection X allows us \nto intertface with Radiance and other unix tools/scripts using a native \nshell/xterminal from the unix box (bash, csh, etc) on a Windows pc \n(which runs 3d modelling, photoshop etc.). Reflection-X also allows rvu \nbeing displayed on a windows machine. This workflow asks for at least \none 'radiance server' and a windows workstation. Reflection X is \ncommercial software, I bought it for a low price from 2nd hand, but it \nis quite expensive new. There are other, cheaper comparable apps \navailable which I do not recall at the moment.\n\n\nCheers, Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003810.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "June 28, 2006 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003767", "id": "radiance-general_003810"}
