{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nIt sound's like Reflection X is a commercial X server? Some other \napplications to consider that enable X on Windows might be:\n\n\n    * Cygwing with XFree - I know that some people have bashed Radiance\n      on Cygwin a bit, but getting the basic Cygwin plus X has be quite\n      a reasonable solution for running remote X sessions to our Linux\n      Radiance servers.\n    * Mix - this is a commercial application that we have used in the\n      past, it is quite stable. It is just an X server so it does not\n      come with some of the applicaitons that a Cygwin setup might have.\n      The cost is very reasonable ($25 US), check out:\n      http://www.microimages.com/mix/\n\n\nAn alternative to all of this would be to run a VNC server/client setup. \nCheck out http://www.realvnc.com/ where they have free and commercial \nclients and servers. This would provide the whole remote desktop in a \nwindow on the local host.\n\n\nNote also if you want to consolidate resources, instead of having two \npieces of hardware (windows box and linux box), you can try vmware \n(www.vmware.com) to run a virtual instance of one operating system \nwithin another. Thus giving you two \"machines\" on the same (1) physical \npiece of hardware. I think I posted on this earlier.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003812.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "June 28, 2006 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003767", "id": "radiance-general_003812"}
