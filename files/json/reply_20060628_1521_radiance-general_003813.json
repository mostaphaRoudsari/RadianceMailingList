{"body": "> Is there a stand alone version of Radiance that has some sort of interface\n> of which you can in import complex geometery?\n\n\nWhat exactly do you mean? First, you know radiance-online.org?\n\n\nIf you mean stand-alone as independant from a specific cad, but with \nGUI, again, I recommend a look at rayfront from schorsch.com. It CAN be \nstand-alone as well as AutoCAD-integrated.\n\n\nWithout GUI, any Radiance-release for windows is able to import complex \ngeometry over the command-line interface, e.g. the conversion filters.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003813.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
