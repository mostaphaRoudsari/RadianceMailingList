I've had a chance to use SPOT a fair amount since \ncoming to AEC, where Zack wrote the program.\n\n\nYou have hit the nail on the head there, GUIs ease the learning curve \npain at the expense of inherently limiting what you can do with the \nunderlying software.  This becomes painfully evident with a program as \npowerful and flexible as Radiance.  But SPOT does allow one to analyze \nsimple spaces with Radiance (as well as perform some pretty \nsophisticated photosensor correlation analysis), and I believe a CAD \nmodel import tool is on the \"long-term to-do list\".\n\n\nI also believe that Georg has created the ultimate GUI for Radiance with \nhis Rayfront product, as it really allows you to delve pretty deeply \ninto the underlying complexities and capabilities of Radiance.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003818.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 28, 2006 at 05:40PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003806", "id": "radiance-general_003818"}
