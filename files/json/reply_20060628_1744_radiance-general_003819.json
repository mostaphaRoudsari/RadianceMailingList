You raise a good point \nthough, perhaps a third party will take the reins and create a plug-in \nor something that would allow that.  Of course at that point you still \nhave something that has not been extensively validated -- validation \nbeing one of many positive traits of Radiance and a benefit of its being \naround for so long.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003819.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 28, 2006 at 05:44PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003806", "id": "radiance-general_003819"}
