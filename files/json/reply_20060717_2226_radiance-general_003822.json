{"body": "Hi Pete!\n\n\nDid you take a look at the example scenes coming with radiance? They are\nlocated in the obj-directory if you downloaded the sources (are they in\nthe binaries?). There are also scenes in the ftp-directories which you\ncan find on radsite.lbl.gov.\n\n\nIf you want something REALLY simple, either go through the manual that\ncomes with radiance or set up a room in your favorite modeler.\n\n\nGood luck, and feel free to ask! Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003822.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
