{"body": "Hi Jack & Mark (& anyone else who will be there),\n\n\nThis is why I was asking about the HDRI \"birds of a feather\" meeting  \non Tuesday (details below)\n\n\nHigh-Dynamic-Range Imagery BOF\nBoston Convention and Exhibition Center - Room 251\n5 - 6 pm, Tuesday, 1 August\n\n\nI'm also guessing that more than a few of us will be at the full-day  \nHDRI seminar on Sunday, so there is a possibility of meeting up after  \nthat. It might be possible to find a very dark bar/ resto with very  \nbright scenery out the windows...  ;-) With only a few people it  \ncould all be very spur-of-the-moment.\n\n\n-Mark\n\n\nOn Jul 18, 2006, at 1:39 PM, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-July/000113.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Banas", "created_at": "July 20, 2006 at 11:11PM", "created_by": "Mark_Banas", "parent_id": "hdri_000110", "id": "hdri_000113"}
