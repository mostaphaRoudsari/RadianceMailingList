{"body": "Hi Chris.\n\n\nI never checked the angles gensky prints but I remember that Radiance\nunderstands \"+\" as west and \"-\" as east. (Remember that it was written\nin and for America and it's always good for your ego to have a \"+\"\nassociated\nwith you ;) So the output should be fine. You can check the output of an\nhourly\ncycle to see how the value changes.\n\n\nYour main problem can be solved by using a file with the diffuser as a\nvertical\nplane at a position \"south\" of the origin and \"!xform\" it into place\nwith the altitude\nand azimuth as arguments for the \"-ry\" and \"-rz\" options:\n\n\n!xform -ry <altitude*-1> -rz <azimuth*-1> diffuser.rad\n\n\nThe order of -ry and -rz is important!  \n\n\nTo model the \"perfect diffuser\" have a look at Schorsch excelent\nexplanation\nof the trans material at\n\n\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html\n\n\nIf I understand you right you want a material with 100 % diffuse\ntransmittance.\nI'm not sure Radiance does this correctly as it is physically imposible\nbut it's\nworth a try.\n\n\nHave fun,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003832.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 24, 2006 at 08:46PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003830", "id": "radiance-general_003832"}
