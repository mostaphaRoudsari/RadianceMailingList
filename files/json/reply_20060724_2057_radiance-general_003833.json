{"body": "Hi Christiano.\n\n\nIf you have only the geometry you want in one or more\nfiles then you don't need to read them into a modeller to\nuse them in Radiance. Just create a triangular marker in\nyour modeller and use !replmarks to replace it with\nthe contents of the file.\n\n\nIf you know where this file will be in your new project\nyou could use \"!xform\" as well. But this requires that\nyou have to work out position and rotation before.\n\n\nIf it's not urgent for you you can also wait until I am motivated\nto include my old scene file parses in my Blender interface.\nBlender has a 3ds exporter but I don't know much about the\nquality of the files it creates. And your geometry should only\nbe triangles or my scripts would ignore it.\n\n\nFor now I'd look into xform or replmarks.   \n\n\nThomas \n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003833.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 24, 2006 at 08:57PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003831", "id": "radiance-general_003833"}
