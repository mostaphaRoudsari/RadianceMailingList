{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nIf you use the default \"red\" \"green\" and \"blue\" functions for rfunc,  \ngfunc, and bfunc, you will get a bilinear interpolation by default.   \nIt may not look very nice, though, as bilinear interpolations tend to  \nshow \"mach band\" artifacts.  A simpler approach would be to convert  \nyour data into a low-resolution image then upsample it with pfilt.   \nThe conversion can be done using pvalue.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003836.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 25, 2006 at 02:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003829", "id": "radiance-general_003836"}
