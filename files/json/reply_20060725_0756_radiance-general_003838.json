{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> There is also a program distributed with Radiance called mgf2inv,\n[...]\n\n\nI think that is what Christiano tried. There are two point to consider\nusing mgf2inv. The first is, that it creates vrml-1. There are very few\nprograms reading vrml-1 worlds in our days, most vrml-parsers support\nvrml-2 (aka vrml-97), and all development work goes to x3d. The second\nis that I experienced problems with the notation used for floating\npoints in mgf2inv's output. That can be solved with some\nprintf-formatting strings. Note that mgf2inv uses a floating point that\nconforms to the standard. Still, e.g. when I tried to import into formZ,\nI had to change it. If you use those old vrml-1 parsers, be prepared to\nfind lots of bugs - most of these vrml-1 parsers have been more or less\nneglected for years. You know that Blender reads vrml-1? Just break your\nscene into parts, because Blender does not like to import very complex\nscenes at once sometimes. And keep your units so that dimensions are not\nexceedingly big or small.\n\n\nFrancesco, if you really managed to write an obj output-filter, that\nwould be GREAT!!!! Will have a look at it tomorrow. This would be my\nprefered choice!\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003838.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
