{"body": "Chris.\n\n\nGlad you solved your problem, sort of.\n\n\nI just want to add one comment:\n\n\nIf you add the \"-i\" switch to rpict/rtrace the surface properties\nfor the last bounce will be replaced with a Lambertian surface\nwhich is what you are looking for (completely diffuse reflection).\n\n\nFor you it might be the simplest solution to do an irridience\ncalculation with only one bounce. The real properties of the\ndiffuser (your plastic definition) don't make any difference then.\n\n\nFor an illustration of this see the color prints of the reception\ndesk in RwR (plate 15).\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003840.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 25, 2006 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003830", "id": "radiance-general_003840"}
