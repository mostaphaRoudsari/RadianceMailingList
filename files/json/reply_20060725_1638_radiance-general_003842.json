{"body": "Whoops -- that's what I get for not reading e-mails carefully.   \nCristiano's e-mail arrived in such a tiny font that I could scarcely  \nread it, though.  That's my excuse, and I'm sticking to it.\n\n\nI also naively thought that VRML-2 would be upwards compatible with  \nVRML-1.  And I hadn't heard about the problems with floating point  \nvalues before.  I should probably look into VRML-2 at some point.  In  \na parallel universe, I'm sure I have time for that.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003842.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 25, 2006 at 04:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003831", "id": "radiance-general_003842"}
