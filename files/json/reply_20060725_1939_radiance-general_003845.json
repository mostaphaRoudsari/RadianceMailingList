{"body": "Hi Yuni,\n\n\nHere is a description for an HP LCD monitor we measured at LBNL for  \nthe New York Times (work sponsored by NYSERDA).  You can substitute  \nany 1024x768 screen shot you like for \"VDTdisp.pic\".  Make sure the  \nmaximum value is <= 1.0.\n\n\nAs for glare analysis, I don't know how you mean to associate  \ndiscomfort glare with a VDT.  Perhaps you are thinking of veiling  \nglare -- reflections from the screen that reduce visibility?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003845.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 25, 2006 at 07:39PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003844", "id": "radiance-general_003845"}
