{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n  thank you for your quick reply and your attached LCD info.\n\n\n  Yes correct, I am thinking of veiling glare on the screen that will reduce visibility. Before I received your email, I tried mirror as LCD material. Surely, there is glare (as shown in file.pic), but when I calculate all glare parameter in radiance (dgi, ugr, cie, and others) the results are 0. May be those parameter cannot be used to calculate veiling glare on monitor screen? (high contrast occur vertically on the screen)\n\n\n  Thank you very much, Greg.\n\n\n  Best regards,\n\n\n  Yuni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003846.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "erika yuniarti", "created_at": "July 25, 2006 at 08:19PM", "created_by": "erika_yuniarti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003844", "id": "radiance-general_003846"}
