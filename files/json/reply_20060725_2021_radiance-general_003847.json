Actually, my experiments with converting radiance's\nscene language into xml using xslt's were a step to get models OUT of\nradiance, e.g. to (the xml-coded) x3d. I just never managed to write a\nx3d-output stylesheet. I'm sure I did in one of the parallel universes.\n\n\nHowever, my point is that in 2006, I would not spend time on a vrml-2\nfilter, but, if I had, on x3d. It is really close to vrml, but cleaner\nand all development power at web3d is going there.\n\n\nNow I have to hurry, my train to Ankara won't wait, and I have to be\nthere tomorrow morning.
