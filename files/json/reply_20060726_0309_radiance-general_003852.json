{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n  Thank you for your quick reply. \n  I see, so I could not use \"findglare\". \n\n\n  is L_fore the luminance of the monitor screen? is L_back the luminance of the surroundings? So you suggest to compare brightness of the monitor screen against brightness of the surrounding?it that so,what contrast level is acceptable?\n\n\n  However, usually, veiling glare on monitor screen causes very bright portions on the screen that the display on the monitor cannot be seen anymore. Isn't it a brightness comparison between areas on the monitor screen it self (instead of brightness comparison between the screen and the surrounding). Or is it not a matter of brightness comparison, instead it is a matter of too much luminance on the screen that we cannot see clear image anymore? If that so, how to get the luminance values occured on the screen (besides the iso contour and false color, because they dont really show value)?\n\n\n  Many thanks, Greg.\n\n\n  Best regards,\n\n\n  Yuni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003852.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "erika yuniarti", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 03:09AM", "created_by": "erika_yuniarti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003844", "id": "radiance-general_003852"}
