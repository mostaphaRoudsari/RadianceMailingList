{"body": "Sorry, I should have explained better.  L_fore is the luminance of  \nthe character or whatever it is you are trying to read.  L_back is  \nthe luminance of the surround -- on the monitor, not behind it.   \nL_veil is the *additional* luminance caused by unwanted reflection  \noff the screen.  You may have to render the monitor with it switched  \noff to get this value.  You can use the attached VDToff.rad file for  \nthis.  You'll also need the other files I've attached, which I forgot  \nin the first posting.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003853.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 04:03AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003844", "id": "radiance-general_003853"}
