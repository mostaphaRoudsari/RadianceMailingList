My question now is, what is the .oct file and how do I create it? I\nhave been given a series of .HDR images that were created using PhotoSphere\nfrom a series of shots. What do I need to do to convert this to a .oct file\nor do I just substitute my .hdr file where you indicate .oct.\n\n\nAgain, I apologize if this a stupid question.\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n\nMatt\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003858.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Matt Parker", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 02:35PM", "created_by": "Matt_Parker", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003856", "id": "radiance-general_003858"}
