{"body": "Hi Matt.\n\n\nAnswering for Greg here as he may be sound asleep in\nanother part of the world.\n\n\nGreg assumed that you had a 3D scene in Radiance format\nfrom which the HDR images have been generated. So his\nanswer was to use that scene (the input.oct file) to\ncreate a \"luximage.pic\" from the same viewpoint as the\nfirst HDR image. The \"luximage.pic\" file contains the\ninformation needed for contour lines showing lux levels.\n\n\nIf you don't have this information you can't create\ncontour plots of lux level!\n\n\nHowever, you still can create contour plots from the\noriginal images. These lines will have \"Nits\" as unit\nand show the \"brightness\" of an element in the scene\ninstead of the illuminace on that element (i.e. the\nquantity of light reflected from a table vs. the light\nfalling on that table). The command for this is\n\n\n$ falsecolor -cl -s 1000 -i rendering.pic -p rendering.pic > cline.pic\n\n\nAs you see input data (\"-i\" option) and background image\n(\"-p\" option) are the same file here. I think you can omit\nthe \"-p\" option in this case, but I can't check it now.\nYou may have to change the value of the \"-s\" (\"scale\")\noption so it contains all the levels of your image. See\nthe man page of falsecolor for details and further useful\noptions.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003859.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 03:01PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003856", "id": "radiance-general_003859"}
