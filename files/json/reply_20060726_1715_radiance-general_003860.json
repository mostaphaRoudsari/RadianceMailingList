{"body": "Hi everybody...again\n\n\nIm a regular nuisance on here, please dont kick me off Greg!\n\n\nIn addition to my last email, i have a query regarding light measurement within radiance. When viewing an .oct in rvu if i type t and then click on a point, it will give me a few values, the last of which, i assume, is luminance in nits.\n\n\nFirstly is this assumption correct?\n\n\nIs there a way to measure illuminance as opposed to luminance?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003860.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Foster", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 05:15PM", "created_by": "Chris_Foster", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003856", "id": "radiance-general_003860"}
