{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nIf anyone should be kicked off, it's me -- I've been answering e- \nmails when I'm rushed and tired and doing a bad job of it, so  \napologies to everyone.\n\n\nYou are correct that the last value reported (the one with an 'L'  \nnext to it) in rvu is the luminance in candelas/meter^2, or nits.  To  \nget illuminance instead, turn on the -i option via the \"set i y\"  \ncommand in rvu then do the trace again.  You can switch irradiance  \nmode off again with \"set i n\".\n\n\nI hope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003861.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 05:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003856", "id": "radiance-general_003861"}
