{"body": "Chris.\n\n\nYou can find an online version of the rvu man page here:\n\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rvu.1.html\n\n\nFrom the description of \"trace\" I guess your assumption is\ncorrect, for certain values of correct. The man page says the\n\"value\" will be printed as well but I remember vaguely that\nit was split in its red, green and blue component. I can't\nsimply switch to my Radiance machine right now to test it\nso you have to figure it out yourself.\n\n\nFor illuminace simply use the \"-i\" option when you start\nrvu. Again I am not sure rvu supports this but I don't see\na reason why it shouldn't.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003862.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 26, 2006 at 05:50PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003856", "id": "radiance-general_003862"}
