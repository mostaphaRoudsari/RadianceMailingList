RadHub is meant to be\na) fully automated\nb) indexable by keywords\nc) ordered by popularity\nd) community-driven\n\n\nSo somebody will have to sit down and think about the keywords. And who\nwould be better suited than the author of the submitting site?\n\n\nWith regards to submitting a 3rd party site, what I had in mind is that\npeople would get in touch with the author, and e-mail them a copy of The\nMissing Manual cover page (See under Art Work), asking them nicely to have\ntheir pages indexed.\n\n\nOurs is still a fairly small community, and many people know one another\neither personally or from the e-mails they exchange.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-July/000751.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 27, 2006 at 01:17PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000746", "id": "radiance-dev_000751"}
