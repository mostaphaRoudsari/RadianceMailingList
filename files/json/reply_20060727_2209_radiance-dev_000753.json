Don't ask what RadHub can do for you ...\n\n\nSorry, I may read a bit sharp here. I think it's a good\nthing what your trying to do. But this won't stop me thinking\nabout how it could be made better which - for a community site\n- usually means easier to use.\n\n\n> So somebody will have to sit down and think about the keywords.\n> And who would be better suited than the author of the submitting\n> site?\n\n\nAgreed. But what if the author can't be bothered with the idea\nor doesn't have any influence on the way the document is published?\nA good RadHub will not remain restricted to pure Radiance. Think\nabout special HDR cameras or photometers. Companies selling these\nproducts might outsource their internet presence or even use the\nservice of a web designer (shudder)!\n\n\n> With regards to submitting a 3rd party site, what I had in mind is  \n> that\n> people would get in touch with the author, and e-mail them a copy  \n> of The\n> Missing Manual cover page (See under Art Work), asking them nicely  \n> to have\n> their pages indexed.\n\n\nNice cover. Did remind me of the Radiance book I always wanted\nsomeone else to write ;)\n\n\nThis submitting stuff could be simplified (for the submitter)\nwith another form which takes the URL and (ideally) the email\naddress of the webmaster and sends a polite invite along the\nlines of:\n\n\n\"Dear webmaster of shining.site.com\n\n\nYour site has been recommended for addition to the RadHub\nonline database (see http://radhub.luxal.eu). There is nothing\nto be gained but fame, there are no costs but a few minutes of\nyour time.\n\n\nIf you would like to add your site please follow the procedure\noutlined on http://radhub.luxal.eu/submit.shtml.\n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n\nYour RadHub bot\"\n\n\nCombined with some spam prevention and tracking (we don't want\nto spam people who obviously don't have an interest in adding\ntheir sites, do we?) this would make it a one copy-paste-click\naction to submit a good site.\n\n\nIdeally this should be enough for the RadHub bot to jump into\naction and get some sense out of the submitted URL (using meta\ntags or the full text content). You can add admin approval after\nthat if you wish but, in essence, that's what the community rating\nis for.\n\n\n\n\nAh well, these are my thoughts about the topic which are not\nonly RadHub thought but have evolved thinking about the structure\nof our department's image library - which is good as long as you\nknow in advance what you're looking for and where to find it ...\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-July/000753.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 27, 2006 at 10:09PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000746", "id": "radiance-dev_000753"}
