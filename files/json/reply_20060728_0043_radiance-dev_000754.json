{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\n> Um, that IS a \"full\" URL. URL's can be almost anything. They don't\n> necessarily have to point to files and you shouldn't assume they do. Why\n> does your web site have such a silly requirement on URL's anyway?\n\n\nI beg to differ: a URL is the location of a FILE on the Internet. The\nreason why we don't normally have to worry about the last part, i.e. the\nactual file name, is that the web server is configured to serve a default\npage, which is usually 'index.html', 'index.shtml', or 'index.php', if no\npage is explicitly given.\n\n\nIf you remember, I asked for your feedback, and what you all have said has\nshown me that what I've presented is obviously not what you all are\nlooking for.\n\n\nTalking about feedback: Ian, next time, you might want to consider making\nsensible SUGGESTIONS, rather than saying that something is SILLY, when you\ndon't even know what you are talking about. Is it really so difficult to\nsay that the submit form SHOULD gracefully handle choped-off URLs?\n\n\nThanks again for all the feedback. I am pulling the plug on RadHub. I hope\nI haven't wasted too much of your valuable time.\n\n\nLong live Google (which has some good definitions on 'URL'...)\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-July/000754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 28, 2006 at 12:43AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000746", "id": "radiance-dev_000754"}
