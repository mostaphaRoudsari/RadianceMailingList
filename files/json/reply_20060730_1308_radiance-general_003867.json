{"body": "Hi Ramana,\n\n\nI think it will be imprecise to answer your question in terms of black or\nwhite. In fact it depends on several factor such lightshelf type, geometry,\nsize, location, materials, window orientation and size, room dimensions, sky\nconditions (\"luminous climate\"), building maintenance among others.\n\n\nSometimes, controlling the amount of radiation entering a room and therefore\nreducing very high light levels close to the window wall helps creating a\ncomfortable lighting environment, by reducing the contrast between levels at\nthe view window and those at the back of the room, yet sacrificing on\nilluminance levels.\nBest regards,\n\n\nGuedi Capeluto\n\n\nArch.
