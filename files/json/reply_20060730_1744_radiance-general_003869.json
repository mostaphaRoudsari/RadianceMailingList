{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nI attempt to explain why illum's cast shadows on page 573 of  \n\"Rendering with Radiance\" (Figure 13.5).  The best workaround in your  \ncase is to use a combination of direct subsampling (-ds) and direct  \njitter (-dj) to make the shadows less noticeable.  In fact, they  \nshould be there, but they shouldn't be so sharp.  Turning on  \nPENUMBRAS in rad will accomplish the same thing.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003869.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 30, 2006 at 05:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003868", "id": "radiance-general_003869"}
