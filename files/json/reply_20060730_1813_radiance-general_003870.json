{"body": "Hi Ramana,\n\n\nLight shelves do redirect light deeper into a space under both overcast \nand clear sky conditions. Whether they do this effectively and for all \novercast and clear sky conditions depends on building and light shelf \ndesign. They do not necessarily block nor reduce glare. That depends on \ndesign particulars as well.\n\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\nOn Jul 28, 2006, at 12:56 PM, Ramana Koti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003870.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul LaBerge", "created_at": "July 30, 2006 at 06:13PM", "created_by": "Paul_LaBerge", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003865", "id": "radiance-general_003870"}
