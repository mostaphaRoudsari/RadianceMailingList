{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThanks for sharing your files with me.  It seems that your light  \nfixture has a very tight output distribution, which falls off  \ndramatically to the left and right.  The more you subdivide the light  \nsource, the more accurate your results.  Your second Radiance result  \nis the more accurate.  Apparently, AGI32 only sends a single sample  \nto the center of the source, which is what you also get from Radiance  \nwith the default -ds 0.2.\n\n\nI discovered this by looking up from your sample point 120 inches  \nbelow the light source, which is itself 20 inches in diameter.  A  \nperspective view shows that even at this distance, the fall-off is  \nquite noticeable.\n\n\nBottom line, the rtrace -ds 0.1 result is more accurate.  Whew!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003875.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 02, 2006 at 05:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003871", "id": "radiance-general_003875"}
