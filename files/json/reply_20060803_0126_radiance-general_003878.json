{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nI really appreciate you looking into this.  I was going to drop the -ds\nparameter all together, confident with my AGI/Radiance check!\n\n\nThe light fixture in question is a sportslighting fixture for a hockey\nrink.  There will be 200+ fixtures all aimed at slightly different\nspots.  The fixtures as you mentioned have a very strong but also very\nnarrow distribution in one axis.  It sounds like I need to run a -ds\nconvergence checker at 100' to see what the largest value possible\nshould be to get accurate results.  (I typically do this for the ab\nparameter only and just settle on some of the others based on rad's\noutput)\n\n\nDoes the size of the scene affect the -ds parameter?  My final scene\nwill be a large stadium.\n\n\nGiven this distribution, how will having an illum at each fixture\nhelp/hurt renderings or point-by-point calculations?\n\n\nThank you for your guidance.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003878.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "August 03, 2006 at 01:26AM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003871", "id": "radiance-general_003878"}
