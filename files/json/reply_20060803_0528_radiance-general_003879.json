{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nYou can always experiment with smaller and smaller values of the -ds  \nparameter, but I found that the convergence doesn't change much after  \n-ds 0.1.  The size of the scene doesn't affect what -ds value will work.\n\n\nUsing an illum would not help in this case, as far as I can figure.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003879.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 03, 2006 at 05:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003871", "id": "radiance-general_003879"}
