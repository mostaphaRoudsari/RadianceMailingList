{"body": "Hi Mark.\n\n\nI don't know how your going to evaluate your model but if you're\ncalculating\nillumination over an area or even falsecolor image I wouldn't worry much\nabout\nthe accurate contribution of one individual luminiare. You'll have\nseveral luminiares\ncontributing at any given spot which should even out the computational\ndifferences\nof each luminaire.\n\n\nBased on your description the -ds option will probably have no effect\nanyway\nbecause all your light sources are small in relation to their distance.\nIf you want\nto compare results between different applications you'd have to setup\nthe same\nmodel in each and run a standard (for each application) calculation.\nThis will\naccount for the different types of calculation methods (tracing vs.\nradiosity)\nand details (as the -ds effects).\n\n\nPlease note that I have seen a noticeable slowdown in my recent\ncalculations\nof scenes with large numbers of light sources. If anyone has an idea how\nto\noptimise that it be great.  \n\n\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003880.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 03, 2006 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003871", "id": "radiance-general_003880"}
