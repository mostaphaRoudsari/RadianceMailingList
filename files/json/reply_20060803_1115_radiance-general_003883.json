{"body": "Hi Thomas\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me, ill look on the website.\n\n\ni havent actually contacted the manufacturer directly (its arri out of interest; http://www.arri.com/entry/lighting.htm), would be wise to but i thought i would learn more by making my own. They didnt have an ies file on the website that i could find, just this photometric data page. \nafter looking at your suggested website (which is very good thankyou) the description of lumens per lamp isnt given by arri so i'll have to request an ies file afterall\n\n\nThanks again\n\n\nChris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003883.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Foster", "created_at": "August 03, 2006 at 11:15AM", "created_by": "Chris_Foster", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003881", "id": "radiance-general_003883"}
