{"body": "Hello Christian,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me, much appreciated.\n\n\nThe photometric calculator (PC) Arri has looks nice but isnt really much help when trying to make an ies file. I have printed off a graph from the PC and have used a ruler to try and get some angle and brightness values for use in my ies file but it cant imagine that its very accurate.\nThe light i physical and want to model have is the ARRI Daylight Compact 4000W (not the theatre one) with a fresnal lens. HMI 4000 W/SE G38.\nI want to model it in spot, midflood and flood focus range.\n\n\nFor my spot focus my draft ies looks as below\n\n\nTILT=NONE\n\n\n1 [lumens per lamp] 1 12 1 1 2 -.376 0 0 \n1 1 4000\n0 0.5 1.5 3 4 5 6 7.5 9 11 17 90\n0\n1880000 1800000 1600000 1000000 600000 400000 250000 120000 100000 60000 0 0\n\n\ni dont know what value i should use for the lumens per lamp, any suggestions? from what you know am i doing anything else wrong??\n\n\nThanks for your time\n\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003885.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Foster", "created_at": "August 03, 2006 at 12:58PM", "created_by": "Chris_Foster", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003881", "id": "radiance-general_003885"}
