{"body": "Chris,\n\n\nSay you had an initial lumen value of 15,000lm for the lamp you've chosen. All you would have to do \nwould be replace [lumens per lamp] with 15000. The mean lumens will be a lower value than the \nintital lumens. If you are using a light loss factor in your calculations, you should use one of the \nfollowing combinations:\n\n\na) use the initial lumens in your IES file and use an appropriate value for the lamp lumen \ndepreciation in your light loss factor (the lamp lumen depreciation value will depend on the lamp \nchosen)\n\n\nb) use the mean lumens in your IES file and use a value of 1 for the lamp lumen depreciation in your \nlight loss factor, since the mean lumens already take the lamp lumen depreciation into account.\n\n\nHope that helps!\nDave\n\n\nChris Foster wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003890.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "J.
