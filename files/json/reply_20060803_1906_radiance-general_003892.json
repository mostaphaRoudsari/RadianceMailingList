{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI believe the <lumens per lamp> field is used to calculate fixture\nefficiency (notice it is lumens per lamp, not total fixture lumens). If\nyou are not concerned with fixture efficiency, put any value you like\nthere. Osram HMI 4000 W/SE has a total lumen output of 380,000 lm, if\nyou'd like to have a realistic number there anyway.\n\n\nMost photometric viewers can calculate the lumens out of a fixture\neasily. I plugged your file (with an arbitrary number in the lumens per\nlamp field) into a program called Photometric Viewer (from Acuity\nBrands) and it showed the fixture to output 37,982 lumens. Based on the\nnumber of lumens coming out of the Osram lamp, that would be about a 10%\nfixture efficiency. Seems low, but then again, I don't know what a 4000W\nMetal Halide fixture looks like anyway.\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\nHalley\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003892.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Halley Fitzpatrick", "created_at": "August 03, 2006 at 07:06PM", "created_by": "Halley_Fitzpatrick", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003881", "id": "radiance-general_003892"}
