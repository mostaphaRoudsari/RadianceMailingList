{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nI did see this article, thanks.  I was annoyed that they didn't  \nmention Photosphere or even HDRshop, but then neither are really  \ncommercial programs, and the article was clearly targeted at a more  \nmainstream audience.  Judy Lai is in fact working on documenting  \nPhotosphere, and I have another friend working on a port for Windows  \nand Linux.  So, maybe it will be commercial, one day!  In any case, I  \nplan to continue to distribute a free version for the Mac, since it's  \na basic bias of mine...\n\n\nHow are things with you?  Do you think you'll make it to the next  \nRadiance workshop in September?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-August/000117.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 07, 2006 at 09:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000115", "id": "hdri_000117"}
