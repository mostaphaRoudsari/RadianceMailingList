{"body": "Hi Bei,\n\n\nRpict doesn't do any tone-mapping on its output -- what you get are  \nin fact the radiometric values in a floating-point image format.   \nPcond or normtiff can be used for tone-mapping.\n\n\nThe differences between machines may be due to variations in the  \nrandom number generator.  If you set -ps 1, I expect your results  \nwill look more similar, though they still won't be an exact match.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003899.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 09, 2006 at 03:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003898", "id": "radiance-general_003899"}
