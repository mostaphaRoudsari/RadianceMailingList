{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nGreat news about Photosphere (especially about the future free versions:)\nAnd on the same subject, the last improvements were amazing. Thank you for\nthat. The false color images are great, I've been using them a lot. I just\nwish there was a choice of a logarithmic scale.\n\n\nAs for me, I'm afraid I won't be able to get to this year's workshop. I\nreally am sorry since I wanted very much to get your tutorial on rtcontrib.\nAnd the other titles seem very interesting also. And I'll miss meeting\neveryone, for sure. I hope you all have a great time as usual.\n\n\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-August/000119.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "August 09, 2006 at 05:40PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "hdri_000115", "id": "hdri_000119"}
