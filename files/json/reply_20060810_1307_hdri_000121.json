{"body": "Hi Santiago and All,\n\n\nI've just had a look at this article, and the images are\nquite obviously created with a program called Photomatix.\nThis program combines multiple exposures, and also has a\ntone reproduction algorithm built-in.\n\n\nUnfortunately, most people on Flickr using HDR are using\nthis program. My annoyance stems from the fact that the\ntone mapping algorithm produces very unnatural results, and\nis about the poorest algorithm that I know for dynamic range\nreduction. It is very easy to recognize Photomatix output as\na result --- it looks too compressed with too much local\ncontrast.\n\n\nThe apologetic comments at the end of the NYC article about\nthe unnatural look of the Photomatix output makes no sense to\nme. There is no good reason to offer such a poor tone mapper\nas the only choice in any program.\n\n\nAs a result, the Flickr community is starting to equate HDR\nwith non-photorealistic rendering, which in my view is very\nundesirable. The NYC article is not helping in that respect\neither, as it does not present a balanced view of the state\nof the art in HDR.\n\n\nHigh dynamic range imaging is an exciting technology for many,\nas it allows us to take pictures and do image processing that\nwe couldn't do before. However, I feel that Photomatix, in\ncombination with its apparent, but undeserved popularity on\nFlickr, is doing more harm than good to help establish HDR as\na useful technology.\n\n\nRight, that's me finished venting.\n\n\nCheers,\nErik\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-August/000121.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "E.
