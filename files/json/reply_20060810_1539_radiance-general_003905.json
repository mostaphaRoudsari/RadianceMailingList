{"body": "THis may not be the most elegant solution, but if you want more  \ncontrol over how your .obj files are structured, give the utility  \nUVMapper a try:\n\n\nhttp://www.uvmapper.com/\n\n\nIt is available for Windows and Mac and the \"Classic\" version is free  \n(at least for the Mac).  You can load your obj into UVMapper and then  \nexport it with or without normals, UVs, Regions, etc.\n\n\nIf you have a lot of obj's this may not be the greatest solution, but  \ntry it out.  This is a must have if you model in Lightwave and export  \nyour models in obj format and you WANT normals, because LW does not  \nexport normal info.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
