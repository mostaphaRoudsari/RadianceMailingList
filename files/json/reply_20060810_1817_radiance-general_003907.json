{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYou can try it, but if your purpose is to reduce rendering times, I  \ndon't expect you'll see much difference from taking the surface  \nnormals away.  The implementation of normal interpolation in Radiance  \nmeshes is fairly efficient.\n\n\nI also wrote a utility for manipulating .OBJ files (a bit), but it  \nwas written under contract with someone else and depends on some  \nother code I developed that isn't part of Radiance.  I could  \ndistribute binaries, but compiling under multiple architectures is  \nbeyond my abilities right now.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003907.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 10, 2006 at 06:17PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003903", "id": "radiance-general_003907"}
