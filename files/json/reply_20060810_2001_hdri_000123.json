{"body": "Photomatix is really very limited - I think the gallery images they  \nshow are not representative of typical output one can expect.   \nObviously tone mapping is a key ingredient in using HDR images on  \nstandard displays and print media.  I have found the tone mapping  \nalgorithms discussed in the text, and included on the accompanying  \nDVD, of the HDRI book to be a great asset in exploring tone mapping.  \nAnyone who is interested in tone mapping should really take the time  \nto read the chapters in the book dedicated to this topic.   I am  \nespecially intrigued by the \"photographic\" tone mapping algorithm -  \nin fact it inspired me to read all three of Ansel Adams' classic  \nworks on his photographical philosophy (The Camera, The Negative and  \nThe Print).  Implementing the Zone System in HDR tone-mapping is an  \ninteresting approach, especially with a basis on the neutral 17% gray  \ncard (Zone 5).  From a Radiance standpoint, is this 17% gray card in  \nthe macbeth.cal file?  It would be interesting to include it in  \nrenderings and use the Zone System with the photographic_tm tone  \nmapping operator to explore various variations on the original, high- \nbit rendering output.\n\n\nThanks Eric!\n\n\nkirk\n\n\nKirk L.
