{"body": "Hello Eric,\n\n\nI also seldomly use the Photomatix algorithm for the same reason. I had \nseveral talks with the Author of the software about this and i think it \nshould be mentioned that the current beta version includes a new global \noperator.\nThe operator is especially useful for panoramic use as it will do a \n\"matching\" map of several images.\nI used this TMO for a MDR stitch of a panorama (by Wolfgang Stich) and \nthe results are very pleasing:\nhttp://www.austria-360.at/kaernten/page-gletschermuehle.html\n\n\n(Sorry for this commercial break, but i thought, it should be done \njustice to the current development of the software)\n\n\nBest regards\nBernhard\n\n\nE.
