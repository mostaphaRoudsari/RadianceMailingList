{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThere is no explicit setting for the lower limit, but you can use the  \n-log option to falsecolor to specify a number of decades between the  \ntop and bottom of the range, and this number can be anything.  So, if  \nyou want a minimum that is 15 and a maximum of 2000, you would specify:\n\n\n\t-s 2000 -log 2.125\n\n\nSince log10(2000) - log10(15) is 2.125.\n\n\nMake sense?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003911.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 11, 2006 at 06:49PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003910", "id": "radiance-general_003911"}
