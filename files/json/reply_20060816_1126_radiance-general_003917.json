{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nIf you change the order you write the translation/rotation commands in\nxform it should solve the problem...\n\n\nThe IES file is inserted at XYZ co-ordinate 0,0,0. With your command\nyou've translated it approx 1m from 0,0,0 and then rotated it in a big\narc around 0,0,0.\n\n\n!xform -n spot1 -t 1.25 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad\n\n\n...and it disappears out of your view (zoom out and you'll probably find\nit somewhere!)\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is to rotate the luminaire first and then place it in\nposition i.e.\n\n\n!xform -n spot1 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) -t 1.25 1 3.8 spotc.rad\n\n\nHope this helps\nRichard\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003917.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Morris", "created_at": "August 16, 2006 at 11:26AM", "created_by": "Richard_Morris", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003915", "id": "radiance-general_003917"}
