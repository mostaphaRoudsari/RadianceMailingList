{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nA rotation in Radiance is always done using 0 0 0 as the anchor point \nfor the rotation.\n\n\nI cannot see your scene from here, but if you rotate after a certain \ntranslation, you might get odd results.\nI think you should rotate your spot first (and before that make sure its \nanchorpoint of rotation is located at 0 0 0) and then move it.\nso, as an example:\n\n\n!xform -n spot1 -rx 90 -ry 0 -rz 0 -t 1.25 1 3.8  spotc.rad\n\n\nshould work fine\n(instead of: !xform -n spot1 -t 1.25 1 3.8 -rx 90 -ry 0 -rz 0  spotc.rad \nwhich is NOT the same )\n\n\nConsider using replmarks also (see the manpage) , which works also OK \nfor aiming light geometry in a proper direction (and position).\nGood luck,\n\n\nIebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003918.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "August 16, 2006 at 11:33AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003915", "id": "radiance-general_003918"}
