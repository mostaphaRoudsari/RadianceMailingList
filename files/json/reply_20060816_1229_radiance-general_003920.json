The rotations\nare always performed around the origin (0,0,0). If the object isn't centred\non the origin (as it might not be after a translation) then you'll get\nadditional \"movement\". Imagine your lights being on the end of an\nimaginary pole that you're swinging about.\n\n\nHope this helps,\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003920.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "August 16, 2006 at 12:29PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003915", "id": "radiance-general_003920"}
