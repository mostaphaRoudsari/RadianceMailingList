{"body": "Hi all.\n\n\nI'll step in on this:\n\n\nThe basics are spelled out in the man page of  'replmarks'\n(not 'xform' as Giulio wrote).  He has explained the usage\nhimself in the meantime. Just two things to note:\n\n\n1) Check the orientation of the lumiaire or box created by ies2rad.\n    For linear luminaires the 'main luminous axis' runs right across,\n    not along the luminare. If you have a fitting for a 35 W fluorescent\n    tube (about 1.5m long) it will extend from y=-0.75 to y=0.75 while\n    the x dimension may only be 0.1 m. The replmark marker therefore\n    is orthogonal to the luminare body.\n\n\n2) Photometric files are usually created with the luminaire pointing\n    down, even if the fitting is intended and constructed to light up a\nwall.\n    Check a photometic plot and decide wether you have to turn around\n    the luminaire.\n\n\nThomas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  _____\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003923.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 16, 2006 at 04:20PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003915", "id": "radiance-general_003923"}
