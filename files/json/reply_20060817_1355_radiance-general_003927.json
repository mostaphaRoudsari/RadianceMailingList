{"body": "Hi, far from being an expert, at least I have a history of asking such \nquestions on the list (remember my cell-processor thread) ;-)\n\n\nSo the little I understood is as follows:\n\n\n1) It needs double(!) precision power, while most of these 3d \naccelerations give mainly single fp and integer performance.\n\n\n2) It is hard to do the calcution as implemented in Radiance on many \nprocessing units parallel. So if the card has ONE processor that is so \npowerful, one could try to push the code to that core. Most cards are \nbased on multi-cpu or core designs, and than it will be hard to use \nthem. The problem is that one pixel traced results in a \"tree\" of \npixels, with an unknown number of leaves. So e.g. calculating simply 8 \npixels at once would result in an unknown number of parallel calculations.\n\n\nFor 2), I think one might still try to port a complete rpict to the \ninstruction set of the processing units and do parallel processing as on \nSMP machines, at least with e.g. a cell architecture. But than till 1) \nis not solved.\n\n\nSo I doubt that this card will help you much in Radiance. Of course with \nrad -ogl or rshow...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003927.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
