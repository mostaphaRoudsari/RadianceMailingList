{"body": "Martin.\n\n\nCreating a DXF file from scratch might be tricky.\nThe reference states that an application can savely\nskip anything (or nearly anything) it doesn't know\nabout but I guess that's not true for applications\nthat write DXF.\n\n\nIf you realy want to use DXF I'd crate a small file\nwith two 3DFace triangles and look at the DXF file\nthat produces. It should be possible to copy the\nlines of the 3DFace definition and change the values\nof the x,y and z coordinates. There are some binary\nissues you have to be aware of, though.\n\n\nYou can find DXF specs here:\n\n\nhttp://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=5129239\n\n\nYou might have more luck creating an *.obj file\n(which has been discussed in the last months at least\nonce) or a *.3ds/*.vrml/*.whatever _simple_ format and\ncheck if your ACAD installation has an importer for it.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003950.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 05, 2006 at 10:54AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003946", "id": "radiance-general_003950"}
