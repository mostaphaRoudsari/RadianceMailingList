Just create a\ntext file that looks like this:\n\n\n3dmesh\n<m> <n>\n<vertex 1,1>\n<vertex 1,2>\n...\n<vertex 1,n>\n<vertex 2,1>\n<vertex 2,2>\n...\n...\n...\n<vertex m,n>\n\n\nName the file mesh.scr, use the \"script\" command to read it in, and\nBob's your uncle.\n\n\nOf course, this assumes you have a copy of AutoCAD.  If you don't, I\nthink it would be fairly simple to hack sdxf.py to generate the\nappropriate DXF.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003953.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "September 05, 2006 at 08:06PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003946", "id": "radiance-general_003953"}
