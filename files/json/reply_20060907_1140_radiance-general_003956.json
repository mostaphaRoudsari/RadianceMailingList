{"body": "Hi ,\n\n\nI render for PAL anamorphic ( 16:9 - 720x576 ) video.\nI use option -pa 1.42  in both rpict and pfilt for setting the proper \naspect ratio. The output resolution is 720x576.\nThe resulting image indicates (using getinfo) an aspect ratio 1.42 as \nexpected.\nBut  the result of a radiance image converted using ra_tiff  seems to be \na tiff file with square pixels (aspect ration 1:1).\n\n\nWhen I import such a tiff image into a video editing program (final cut \npro) I get a black borders left and right of the image (the image does \nnot fill the entire video screen).\nWhat am I doing wrong here ??\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003956.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "September 07, 2006 at 11:40AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003961", "id": "radiance-general_003956"}
