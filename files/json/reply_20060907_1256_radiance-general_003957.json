You can use it if \none pixel is not like a \"square\", to correct. But in your case, the \npixels have an aspect ratio of about 1/1, so the -pa setting results in \na picture stretched just as far as to get a square picture. In other \nwords: the aspect ratio of the image is determined by vv and vh (or the \nresolution), the pa setting is for the pixel aspect ratio. That is at \nleast how I understood -pa....\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003957.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
