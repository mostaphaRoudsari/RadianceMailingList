{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThanks for your suggestion using image aspect ratios instead of pixel \naspect ratios.\n\n\nAnamorpic Pal is (as I understood) a 720x576 image stretched to 1024x576 \nby the displaying device.\nThis suggests a pixel of which width is 1.42 taller as its height.\n\n\nI tried your suggestion and rendered my image at 1024x576 square pixel \nwith a the vv value calcualted like this:\nvv = vh / 1.42  (where 1.42 is 1024/720 )\n\n\nRendering square pixels at 1024x576 works fine, at least the image fits \nthe videoframe.\nBut I really wonder if the way I calculated the vv value is correct.\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\nLars O.
