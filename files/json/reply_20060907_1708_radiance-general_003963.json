{"body": "Hi Giulio and Mark,\n\n\nI think that this is an excellent question! Although we do have \nAcad2000, I have been using 2004 and this has required changes in \nworkflow, not all of them ideal. I am not sure what the development path \nis for Rayfront and thus radout as these seem to still be at Acad 2000, \nperhaps Georg can provide some input. As an alternative, I purchased \nPolytrans from Okino (www.okino.com). The nice thing about this is that \nwe can read in a dwg and write out an obj file. The dwg import seems to \nbe fine for surface type primitives. I have had some issues though with \nacis solid models. One of the nice things about radout was the ability \nto leverage the other primitive types available such as cylinders and \npolygons with vertices > 3!\n\n\nI am not sure how many Autocad users there are in the Radiance community \n(perhaps we could get some number on this through a survey?) But it \nwould be nice to come up with a geometry translation mechanism that \nwould be easier to grow along with successive releases of Autocad. My \nconcern with 3dsout is the limitation on geometry/objects and control of \ngeometry tessalations. I have been meaning to sit down and look at this \na bit more.\n\n\nIt seems to me that the best solutions would be to have a smooth method \nfor going from .dwg to .obj directly from Autocad.... and that can work \nin successive releases of the Autocad. There is a application called OBJ \nExport from www.fpsols.com for $200US, this might be worth looking into.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003963.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 07, 2006 at 05:08PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003959", "id": "radiance-general_003963"}
