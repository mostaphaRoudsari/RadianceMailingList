{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nIf you have a specific pixel aspect ratio, ra_tiff preserves this  \ninformation in it's horizontal/vertical density tags.  If your  \napplication doesn't understand or interpret these tags, your image  \nwon't be displayed correctly.  Oddly enough, Photoshop doesn't  \ncorrect the aspect ratio on display.  Photosphere does, as does  \nPreview.  I don't know what tool you are using when you say that the  \naspect ratio is lost in the TIFF.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003964.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 07, 2006 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003961", "id": "radiance-general_003964"}
