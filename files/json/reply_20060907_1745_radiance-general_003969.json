{"body": "Hi Iebele and others:\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> Subject: Re: [Radiance-general] aspect ratio problem\n> \n> Hi Carsten,\n> \n> I have a real problem in understanding goniometry :(\n> \n> Do you know how to solve your equotation when the horizontal \n> view angle is known?\n> In other words, how do I get the value of vv when:\n> \n> tan(vv) / tan ( 84 degrees ) = 576/1024\n> \n> Thanks a lot!\n\n\nI'm not repeating the other add ons to this equation\njust one thing everyone seems to miss (and which is\na bit of nitpicking):\n\n\ntan(2*a) != 2*tan(a)\n\n\ntherefore the correct equation is\n\n\ntan(vv/2) / tan(hv/2) = 576 / 1024\n\n\n\n\nMight make the amazing difference of 2 pixels for\nan image of that size!\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis e-mail, (and any attachments) is confidential and may be privileged.
