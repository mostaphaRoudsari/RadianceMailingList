The one that comes with Rayfront is quite \nnice, as it includes some handy view manipulation sliders.  Funny you \nshould ask this question now, as I have been wondering about \nalternatives myself.  We use Rayfront here at my office, but the \nbinaries have not been updated in some time so I like to *start* in \nRayfront/Windows, but ultimately take my scene and .rif files and play \nwith them on a Linux farm. The problem is all my library objects are \ncompiled on the newer radiance and so I cannot view them with that older \nrview that comes with Rayfront.  AFAIK, the only other Windows-based \nalternative is the somewhat recently posted \"nrv\" program that Ignacio \nMunarriz created.  I used it a little bit, and it shows great promise, \nbut in the short term I found it to be very slow and somewhat buggy.  In \nIgnacio's defense, he said he was tired of playing with the code and \nsaid he was posting it with known bugs but still in hopes that it was \nuseful to some people.  I certainly hope he continues work on it.  \n(search the archives for the link.)\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003974.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 07, 2006 at 05:51PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003966", "id": "radiance-general_003974"}
