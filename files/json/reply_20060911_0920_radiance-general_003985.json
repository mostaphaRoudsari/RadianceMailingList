{"body": "Some thoughts of someone not using AutoCAD for modeling so much.\n\n\nInstead of buying obj-exporters, having an iges-export would allow you \nto export your models' geometry to an independent format without loosing \nmuch information, adding the ability to import e.g. into other cad's if \nneeded. From iges, you can create obj's with brlcad, which gives you \ncontrol over meshing etc.\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003985.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
