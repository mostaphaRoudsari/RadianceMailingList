{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nThere are a few ways to get obj from cad. I presume that you are \nprobably using Autocad.\n\n\n   1. use an intermediate package such as polytrans from www.okino.com -\n      we have used this and it works fine for surface models, though the\n      workflow is different\n   2. consider a obj exporter such as from www.fpsols.com - I have only\n      looked into this a bit. I am not sure how the export organizes\n      data, that is are objects determined based on layer/color\n      organization or what.\n\n\nThe two radiance obj converter (obj2rad and obj2mesh) seem to work just \nfine. So once you have an obj format file then I guess this should be \nok. Obviously one issue centers around correct normal orientation. This \nis probably where a full bore translation package such as polytrans can \nhelp out by providing capability to manage the geometry.\n\n\nI guess I had not thought about Torad for quite some time. How are you \nfinding the speed of the export process with Torad? I guess the nice \nthings about this, is that there is probably a group of users who might \nbe able to support this since we can actually see the source code.\n\n\nNevertheless, I would also like to find a good way to deal with ACIS \nbased solids.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003988.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 14, 2006 at 04:14PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003959", "id": "radiance-general_003988"}
