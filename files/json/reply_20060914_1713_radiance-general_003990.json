{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nWell, I think that the ideal solution is in fact not to introduce \nanother package (whether Form Z or Polytrans). However, that being said \nI think that if another package needs to be introduced then cost is a \nbig big issue. Polytrans with the CadPak is ~$540 I think. As Form Z is \na full blown cad/modeling application, I expect it costs ~$2000?\n\n\nI guess if I was using Autocad and wanted/needed to introduce another \npackage I might look at Rhino which does stuff that Autocad is not very \ngood at.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nChris Jessee wrote:\n> You made a intermediary software such as FormZ.\n>\n> DWG > FormZ > OBJ>RAD\n>\n> I would be happy to convert your dwg to obj so you can evaluate the \n> process.\n>\n> Take care,\n>\n> Chris Jessee\n> chris.jessee at kingmill.com\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> On Sep 14, 2006, at 9:58 AM, Mark de la Fuente wrote:\n>\n>> How do you get to obj format from cad.
