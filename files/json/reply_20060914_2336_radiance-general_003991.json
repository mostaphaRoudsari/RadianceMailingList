{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nMy apologies as my last email wasn't clear. Although expensive,  \n($1200) FormZ has proven over time to be a solid tool for repairing  \ntroublesome geometry files from AutoCad and other CAD packages.   \nRhino may also be a good choice but I have no knowledge of it.\n\n\nTo meet your immediate need I offer to process your dwg file through  \nFormZ so you might evaluate it's usefulness prior to spending any money.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nChris Jessee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sep 14, 2006, at 11:13 AM, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003991.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Jessee", "created_at": "September 14, 2006 at 11:36PM", "created_by": "Chris_Jessee", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003959", "id": "radiance-general_003991"}
