{"body": "> I do not think that Autocad has a way to export iges at least not in \n> r2004.

Of course, if there \nis no iges-interface as in native AutoCAD, this has to be purchased.\n\n\nI still use obj in the chain (scripts). If you have a defined workflow \nand are only editing in Autodesk software, then buying an obj-exporter \nmay still be fine of course.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003994.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
