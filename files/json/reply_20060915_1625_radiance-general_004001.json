{"body": "Jack,\n\n\nActually, I have not tried to export any very large models with Torad.  However, exporting less then 100 polygons is pretty instantaneous.  I find that when 3D models are overly complex, they were drawn for architectural renderings and I end up re-drawing parts of them anyway.\n\n\n\"I guess I had not thought about Torad for quite some time. How are you \nfinding the speed of the export process with Torad? I guess the nice \nthings about this, is that there is probably a group of users who might \nbe able to support this since we can actually see the source code.\"\n\n\nAs far as updating and maintaining, are there any legal issues with updating and/or modifying Torad?\n\n\nChris,\n\n\nThank you for your offer.  I may send you a simple model just to go through the process.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004001.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "September 15, 2006 at 04:25PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003959", "id": "radiance-general_004001"}
