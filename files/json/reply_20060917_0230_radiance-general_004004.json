No, I haven't been  \ndrinking, I just was caught by Carsten's quotes there.  Yesterday I  \nsubmitted an application to speak at LIghtfair; they actually  \nspecifically want to host a seminar on Radiance this year.  As I was  \nwriting up the submittal, I was forced to think back through my whole  \nlearning process with Radiance and I have to say, the last five years  \nhave been great.  My discussions with Visarc Jack and Georg Mischler  \ngo back even farther than that (and all I can say is, all hail OS X,  \nas it gives normal people access to a unix command line without the  \nheadaches of linux).\n\n\nAnyway, I guess this is just a Saturday afternoon shoutout to the  \nglobal Radiance community; keep up the good work!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004004.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 17, 2006 at 02:30AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003983", "id": "radiance-general_004004"}
