{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nThank you very much for your highly detailed answer to my question!\nUnfortunately, I'd like to ask you another (this time Ward model\nrelated).\n\n\nWhere can I enter these Ward-Duer fits in Radiance? I have not\nfound any Ward model associated .cal scripts in Radiance. There is\nonly He-Torrence (He.cal, He3.cal) model.\n\n\nThe Radiance materials themself are based on a Ward model I suppose?!\nBut where can I enter these values? BRTDfunc material description\nneeds a corresponding .cal script file to work?! Other material types,\nlike anisotrophic version of plastic, do not have enough parameters to\nspecify associated data.\n\n\nI use Radiance v3.7.2 (cygwin/X build).\n\n\nI'm sorry for taking your time!\n\n\nGJW> Looks like no one replied to this one...\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004007.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ilya Zimnovich", "created_at": "September 20, 2006 at 09:34AM", "created_by": "Ilya_Zimnovich", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003979", "id": "radiance-general_004007"}
