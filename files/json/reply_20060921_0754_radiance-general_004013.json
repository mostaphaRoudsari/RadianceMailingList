{"body": "> missing file function.\n\n\nHi!\n\n\nI guess it doesn't find a required function file (something ending with \n.cal). If this is the case, you should set the RAYPATH environment \nvariable. It must include the path where the files ending .cal have been \ninstalled on your computer, often this is a directory called lib or \nlibrary in your radiance installation.\n\n\nI do not know how to set the variable, as this changes with every \nversion of windows and I am not an experienced user of that system at \nall. If you do not know, find it in the documentation or ask some \nwindows admin.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004013.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
