{"body": "Nick.\n\n\nI've done that a evaluation of that sort of calculation\na while ago.\n\n\nIf you use rtrace you will get a reference value from\nthe horizontal plane calculation. You don't need to create\na new model for that, just select a point higher than the\nscene geometry. This reference value is your 100% VSC.\nYou have to normalise the results of your window calculations\nto that value.\n\n\nYou can also specify a sky with a nice diffuse illumination\n(say 10000 lux, gensky option '-B 55.866') and use the\nresults of the following rtrace calculations directly.\n\n\nFor the model setup:\na) use a 0% reflectance for the geometry in your scene\n   no ground glow or a black ground plane\n\n\nor b) use only one bounce (-ab 1) for the rtrace\n   calculation (you need that one bounce because rtrace\n   creates a virtual plane at the sample point and\n   calculates the light falling on that plane)\n   You still have to eliminate the ground glow.\n\n\nBecause you have a low '-ab' you can increase '-ad'\nquite a bit to suit your geometry details. \n\n\nIf you want to verify your methods, you can calculate\nthe geometric obstruction of a simple setup (like a\nstraight wall) according to established methods and\ncompare that to your Radiance calculations.\n\n\nYou still have to create an input file for rtrace\nthat contains all the centre points of the windows\n(outside wall surface). Getting those will be the\nmost time consuming task.\n\n\nHTH,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004017.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 22, 2006 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004016", "id": "radiance-general_004017"}
