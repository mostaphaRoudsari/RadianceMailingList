{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nThe -a option is supported by xform, only.  When it is applied, xform  \nreplaces a single file with many copies, each using the -i option to  \nindicate how many times to apply each transform.  In short, you need  \nto create a file with a single instance in it and call it using ! \nxform with the -a option to get multiple copies.\n\n\nBe sure to pay attention to the tips in the reference manual <http:// \nradsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Surfaces> about when and how  \nto use instances.  In particular, instances work best with cubicle  \nvolumes (ideal) or at least square-ish pieces to avoid too many  \noverlapping instance boundaries, which are always cubes.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004021.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 25, 2006 at 10:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004018", "id": "radiance-general_004021"}
