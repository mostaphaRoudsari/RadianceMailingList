{"body": "Hi Jelle and Giulio,\n\n\nI may be about to learn something here, but as far as I understand I do \nnot think you can do this the way you are trying to. I know for certain \nwhat will work is the following:\n\n\nstep 1: define your instance such as inst.rad\n\n\nvoid instance test\n1 some-instance.oct\n0\n0\n\n\nstep 2: to deploy your instance in an array use a call to xform perhaps \nin its own file (or in some scene description) such as array.rad\n\n\n!xform -a 10 -t 10 0 0 inst.rad\n\n\nthis will make an array in X of inst.rad repeated 10 time at unit \nintervals of 10.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004022.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 25, 2006 at 10:40PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004018", "id": "radiance-general_004022"}
