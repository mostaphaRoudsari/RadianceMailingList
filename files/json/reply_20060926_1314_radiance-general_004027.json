{"body": "Just if someone is not aware of it yet, there is a nice tool called \nreplmarks in radiance distributions, that replaces triangles by meshes, \ninstances or xform'ed geometry.\n\n\nVery useful for controlling instances from CAD. The only limitation is \nthat you cannot specify mirror transformations using it. And I do not \nknow a converter that writes out instances/references/blocks/symbols in \nCAD files as their corresponding triangle markers, so you have to care \nabout it yourself. In formZ, use the symbol detail level (e.g. detail \nlevel containing geometry, level 2 triangle) and you get the whole thing \nnicely integrated into your CAD/modeler.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004027.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
