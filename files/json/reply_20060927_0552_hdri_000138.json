{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nThat study is a very interesting read. Thank you for the link. And  \nthank you for taking the time to do this elaborate analysis in the  \nfirst place.\n\n\nIt makes me wonder how closely your Mathlab algorithm for calculating  \nthe luminance is related to the Photosphere's algorithm. Does the  \ndetermined 10% average accuracy apply to Photosphere's luminance  \nreadout as well, provided we work off a good calibration curve?\n\n\nAlso, I find it interesting that the error is higher for primary  \ncolors, with Red going up to 40% sometimes. Those really seem to  \ndrive up the average a lot. Could the limited gamut of the Radiance  \nformat itself have an influence here? Or is it really all due to the  \ncameras internal demosaicing and JPEG compression? Could this error  \nbe minimized by shooting RAW pictures instead?\n\n\nRegards,\nChristian\n\n\n\n\nAm 26.09.2006 um 13:33 schrieb Mehlika Inanici:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-September/000138.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Blochi", "created_at": "September 27, 2006 at 05:52AM", "created_by": "Blochi", "parent_id": "hdri_000135", "id": "hdri_000138"}
