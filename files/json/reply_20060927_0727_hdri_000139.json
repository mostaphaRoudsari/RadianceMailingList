{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nThe luminance calculation given in the paper (as Matlab algorithm) should be exactly the same as Photosphere uses to calculate luminance. Greg is the only person to verify this I guess :)\n\n\nThe calculations are based on CIE chromaticities for the reference primaries (sRGB) and CIE Standard Illuminant D65:\n\n\n         R (x, y ,z) = (0.64, 0.33, 0.03)\n \tG (x, y, z) = (0.30, 0.60, 0.10)\n \tB (x, y, z) = (0.15, 0.06, 0.79)\n \tD65 (x, y, z) = (0.3127, 0.3290, 0.3583)\n\n\nIn Radiance on the other hand, calculations are based on equal energy white point. Equal energy (x, y, z) = (0.33 0.33 0.33).\n\n\nThat is the reason for minor difference between original Luminance calculations in Radiance (R*0.265 + G*0.067 + B*0.065) and the calculation in the paper       (R*0.2127 + G*0.7151 + B*0.0722). My two cents is that the difference in between those two equations is quite minor.\n\n\nIt is true that the saturated colors in Macbeth chart yielded increased errors. \nRAW format might result in better results, but I don't have enough data to claim that... My limited trials with RAW formats looked quite promising though.\n\n\nSome of the folks in this group may comment on their experience with RAW format, may be?\n\n\nRegards,\nMehlika\n\n\nOn Tue, 26 Sep 2006, Blochi wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-September/000139.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehlika Inanici", "created_at": "September 27, 2006 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "Mehlika_Inanici", "parent_id": "hdri_000135", "id": "hdri_000139"}
