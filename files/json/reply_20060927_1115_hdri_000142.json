{"body": "No problem.  I also meant to respond to Christian's question about  \ncolor gamut.  While it's true that some colors may fall outside the  \nRGB gamut of sRGB and/or Radiance RGBE files, this is mostly  \nrestricted to saturated purples and aquamarines.  Red, orange, and  \nfairly saturated green are well-covered in an HDR image.  If you want  \nto capture a larger color gamut, I recommend shooting in Adobe RGB if  \nyour camera supports it or shooting RAW and converting to Adobe RGB  \nin Photoshod, then combining exposures with the latest version of  \nPhotosphere (1.6.5), writing the file out either as OpenEXR or TIFF  \nto avoid gamut clamping.  (Versions before 1.6.3 dated 8/19/2006  \ndidn't support Adobe RGB properly.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-September/000142.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 27, 2006 at 11:15AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000135", "id": "hdri_000142"}
