You \nwant some distant object or scenery to be visible out the window, for \nexample, so you put it in your model and then the images seem really \nflat or have light leaks because the -ar isn't high enough. One thing \nyou could do is cheat, and place the objects closer to your area of \ninterest than they really are, scaling them up a bit. This works for \ntreelines and things like that, anyway. Another would be to exclude the \ndistant objects from the ambient calculation with the -ae option, the \nproblem there (and maybe some folks here have input on this) is that \nyour objects are outside, your area of interest is inside, so your -av \nis likely to be too low for the exterior objects (which is how all the \nindirectly lit surfaces derive their radiance information when their \nmaterials are on the -ae list).\n\n\n-ar 5000 would take forever to render!\n\n\nGood luck, Jelle.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004029.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 28, 2006 at 08:00PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004028", "id": "radiance-general_004029"}
