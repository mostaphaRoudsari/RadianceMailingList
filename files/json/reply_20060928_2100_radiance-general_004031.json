Bottom line: there are issues with \nthis approach, especially if you are going for numeric accuracy, but I \nalso think that Greg's mksource addition may have solved some of that \n(as I understand it, mksource is sorta like a \"mkillum for lightprobes\").\n\n\nI still do not have a fisheye lens so my lightprobe experiments... have \nnot begun.  Jack, I was really impressed with your presentation at the \nWorkshop (actually, I was impressed with all of the ones I've read so \nfar!), it renewed my interest in playing around with that stuff.  \nSliding off the topic a bit, has everyone seen the new Canon PowerShot \nG7 that's coming out next month?  It looks really nice, with film \nemulation up to ASA1600, and the all-important autobracket for us HDR \nheads, in a compact size (and a separate film speed dial!).  With a 10mp \nsensor, I'm really curious to see how well the ASA1600 pics come out, \nbut even a low-noise 800 would make me really happy.  Guess I'll wait \n'till the folks at www.dpreview.com put it through its paces...\n\n\nAnyhoo, the thread I mentioned way back in the first paragraph of this \nreply begins here:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000818.html\n\n\nThe discussion spills over into June, so look for those too.  For some \nreason the posts don't appear continuously even when sorted by thread.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004031.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 28, 2006 at 09:00PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004028", "id": "radiance-general_004031"}
