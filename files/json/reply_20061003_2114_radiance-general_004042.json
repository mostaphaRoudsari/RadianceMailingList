{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nIt's up to LBNL and the people who funded it, I suppose.  You should  \nwrite to Eleanor to ask.  I have no problem sharing the model, but  \nbear in mind that it's more like a set of scripts than a model.  We  \nonly ever look at one floor at a time, since constructing the whole  \ntower with all those thousands of tubes would be a waste of  \nresources.  Also, there is the urban model to consider.  I'm not sure  \nwe even have the rights to distribute that.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004042.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2006 at 09:14PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004028", "id": "radiance-general_004042"}
