{"body": "Hi Terry,\n\n\nThis is no help, really, but I would suggest transdata with some  \nappropriate angular measurements.  Are there any?  Plain  \ntransmittance isn't enough to capture the distribution of light,  \nwhich I wouldn't expect to be diffuse.  In the absence of any  \nmeasurements, I suppose you have to assume it's close to diffuse and  \nuse their value of 3% of 88% for 4% fiber volume density.  So, that  \nworks out to a formula of:\n\n\n\ttransmittance = 0.66 * fiber_density\n\n\nYou can then plug this into a trans primitive:\n\n\nconc_pattern trans litracon_TM\n0\n0\n7 {refl+trans} {refl+trans} {refl+trans} 0 0 {trans} 0\n\n\n(Replacing the things in curly braces with appropriate values.)  I  \ndon't know what the reflectance is -- between 10% and 30% I suppose  \nbut they don't say.  As for the concrete pattern, you can use a noise  \nfunction if you like, but I doubt it would look very convincing up  \nclose:\n\n\nvoid brightfunc conc_pattern\n2 '1+0.2*fnoise3({sca}*Px,{sca}*Py,{sca}*Pz)' .\n0\n0\n\n\nYou'll have to pick the scale to suit your coordinates, and you may  \nwant to use different ones for Px, Py, and Pz to get a grain  \nappearance, for example.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\nP.S.  I love the spotlight selector thing on their website -- very hip.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004048.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 19, 2006 at 06:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004047", "id": "radiance-general_004048"}
