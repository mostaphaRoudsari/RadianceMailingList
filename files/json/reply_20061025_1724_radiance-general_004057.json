{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nGood point about installation.  That definitely deserves its own  \ncategory, which I simply forgot.  I've also added a tutorials  \nsection, which we may as well break into categories as well:\n\n\nI. Installation and Set-up\n\tA. Standard (UNIX) distirbution\n\tB. Radzilla\n\tC. Windows alternatives\n\tD. Other packages\n\n\nII. Tutorials\n\tA. Basic\n\tB. General, Advanced\n\tB. Electric Lighting\n\tC. Daylighting\n\n\nIII. Input\n\tA. CAD links and conversion tools\n\tB. Photometry & Sky models\n\tC. Generator programs\n\tD. Scene processing (xform, replmarks, oconv, etc.)\n\n\nIV. Computation\n\tA. Rendering (batch & interactive)\n\tB. Illumination calculations\n\tC. Executive programs (rad, rayfront, etc.)\n\n\nV. Output\n\tA. Image processing\n\tB. Image viewing\n\tC. Image format conversion\n\tD. Graphing & plotting\n\n\nRegarding Wikipedia, I think the discussion we had at the workshop  \nwas leaning towards a more controlled environment, where people would  \nstill be very free to contribute but responsible for particular parts  \nof the documentation tree.  This was the plone-based solution that  \nPeter Apian-Bennewitz proposed last year.  Much hints on getting some  \nseed (and hopefully ongoing) funding for that.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004057.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 25, 2006 at 05:24PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004054", "id": "radiance-general_004057"}
