{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nYou're not the first to make the mistake of using Windows in a  \nmisguided attempt to get some work done...\n\n\nEnd of line in Unix is \"line-feed\" (hex 0A), \"carriage-return\" (hex  \n0D) in pre-X MacOS, and carriage-return followed by line-feed in  \nWindows (inherited from DOS, inherited from CP/M).  This has caused  \nmore headaches over the years than just about all the other divergent  \nstandards combined, including the '/' '\\' stupidity between DOS/VAX  \nand Unix.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004059.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 27, 2006 at 01:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004058", "id": "radiance-general_004059"}
