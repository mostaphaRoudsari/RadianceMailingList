{"body": "Hi Friedemann,\n\n\nI was hoping someone else who knew more about this material might  \nrespond, but maybe no one does...\n\n\nIf you want an accurate model of this material, you need to use the  \ngeometric cross-section and the material properties to create an  \nanalytic estimate of the integrated light transfer.  In other words,  \nit ain't easy.  Better still, you would obtain measurements of the  \nangular transmission of the material, but this poses an even greater  \nchallenge.\n\n\nA couple of years ago, Visarc hired me to create a mathematical model  \nof transmission through a grid structure, simulated as rectangular  \nholes in a diffuse structure.  The associated calculation is  \ncontained in grating.cal in the standard distribution.  If your holes  \nare oval rather than rectangular, this won't be as accurate, but it  \nmight be a start.  If your surface is specular and you wish to  \ncapture the change in specular reflectance with angle, more work is  \nneeded.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2006 at 01:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004061", "id": "radiance-general_004064"}
