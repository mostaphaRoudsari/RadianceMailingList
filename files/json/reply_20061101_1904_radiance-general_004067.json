This still shows 3.7.2 but\nsee:\n    http://ww.blastwave.org/pacakges/radiance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>  I also\n> wonder how much of the speedup is attributable to the use of the new\n> official release of Radiance 3.8.\n\n\n3.8 is slightly faster but I didn't spend long comparing.  I did a\ntest because I wanted to understand if the improvement on my previous\nscore was due to 3.8 or my newer compiler.  The answer is the Sun\nStudio 11 compiler is much better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004067.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "November 01, 2006 at 07:04PM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004066", "id": "radiance-general_004067"}
