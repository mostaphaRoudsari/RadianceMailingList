{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI've checked plone. I am not convinced that this will encourage people \nto work on the documentation. I haven't seen convincing running examples \nyet - maybe others have ?\n\n\nConcerning Wikipedia:\n\n\nPlease have a look at  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki.\n\n\nThis is a free software distribution which requires only MySQL, Apache \nand PHP to run.\n\n\nWhen this wiki software is installed on a server, it /is/ a controlled \nenvironment. Most important feature imho is that only registered users \ncan edit articles.\n\n\nWhat kind of funding is required ?
