{"body": "Hi all,\nI agree, but my simulation should give results for LEED minimal requirements. There it is only one defined sky (midday, equinox, clear sky) and a minimum average illuminance in the room behind the facade (+ turnable but not moveable lamellas) is required.\nThe lamellas I've to simulate are not the perforated mini blinds, but get  a dimensions of 0.5 meter width and a length of about 3 meters.\nThe surface is brushes aluminum (adapted for redirect the daylight into the room). \nWith this starting position, I need a material definition which reflect the daylight (direct and diffuse)  at  85% of lamella area and, on account of the 15% of gaps in the lamellas, a light transmission of 15%.\nDoes anybody have an idea?\n\n\nThanks\nFriedemann\n\n\n\n\n\t-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\n\tVon: radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org] Im Auftrag von Mark de la Fuente\n\tGesendet: Dienstag, 31.

These are like perforated metal mini blinds right?\n\n\n\tMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004072.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Friedemann Kik", "created_at": "November 03, 2006 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Friedemann_Kik", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004061", "id": "radiance-general_004072"}
