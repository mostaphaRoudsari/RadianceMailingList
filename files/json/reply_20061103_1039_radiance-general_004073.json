{"body": "Friedemann,\n\n\nI assume you only try to approximate the effect on the shadowing\nof the room, then, not modelling the real reflectance of the material.\n\n\nYou could start with your base material (aluminium - see the example\nmaterials in the distribution) and add a mixfunc with void as second\nmodifier. Thus the areas defined in the function file should simply\nbe transparent like a hole in the material. \n\n\nThere was a function file that created a dot pattern by Georg\nMischler; I just can't remember the name now. You have to specify\nthe right dimmensions of the dots for your 85/15 ratio. I think\nyou could apply a scale to it so that it created oval dots instead of\ncircles (but that might have been a different function file). \n\n\nhth,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004073.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 03, 2006 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004061", "id": "radiance-general_004073"}
