{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nWe tried a Wiki for Radiance already and it didn't go anywhere, and  \nwas inundated by adware.  I don't really blame Wiki for this -- the  \nproblem was more lack of groundswell and necessary controls, which  \nI'm sure we could remedy if we were a little more organized.\n\n\nI am not versed on the merits of or differences between Plone and  \nWiki, and I know very little about either.  Both Peter Apian- \nBennewitz and Daniel Fuller (the sysadmin for LBL's website) say  \nPlone is better, but you would have to ask them for details.  I'm  \nwilling to trust others' judgement on the matter, as I have no  \nexpertise in the area of web management.  I can make some simple  \nHTML, and that's about it.\n\n\nThe important thing is that we agree to contribute material, and the  \nsite administrator should be happy and/or paid for their efforts,  \nwhich I suspect would be substantial using either system.  In other  \nwords, setting up a Wiki site may be easy, but protecting it from  \nadware while developing useful content may in fact be easier with  \nPlone.  I leave the debate to others.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004075.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 03, 2006 at 06:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004054", "id": "radiance-general_004075"}
