{"body": "Hello all,\n\n\nI recently deployed MediaWiki for use at work and the way we set it up \nwas that a) you must be logged in to edit anything and b) certain people \nor groups of people we're placed in charge of different sections on the \nWiki, meaning that they were the only ones who could directly contribute \nto that particular page (individual users can protect pages with a \nseparate password that will allow only them to edit it). However, we \nalso set up a \"drafts\" page which was linked from the main page that was \nessentially a mirror of each page. Anyone logged in could edit and add \nto this draft page and every once in awhile the person(s) in charge of \nthe section will go through the draft and add things that are relevant \nand correct to the main page. This helps us make sure that there is \nlimited spamming (and NO spamming on the main pages) and it helps us \nensure the accuracy and helpfulness of items within the wiki. I'm not \nfamiliar with Plone, but I would imagine a similar setup could be \narranged with that as well.\n\n\nGranted, this does not solve the issue of actually convincing people to \ncontribute to such a setup, but something like this would help \nsignificantly with quality control and making sure that little or no \nspam makes its way to the wiki.\n\n\nDave\n\n\nGregory J.
