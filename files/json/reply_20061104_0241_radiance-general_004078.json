{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nA radial anisotropy is one of the easiest types to generate.  The  \nvalues for the vector [ux uy uz] are variables for a reason.  These  \ncan be set to [(Px-xcent) (Py-ycent) 0] for a clock face in the x-y  \nplane, which may be rotated and moved wherever you like afterwards.   \nTo make things even simpler, we can assume [xcent ycent] == [0 0] and  \nuse:\n\n\nvoid metal2 brushed_around\n4 Px Py 0 .\n0\n6 .5 .5 .5 .9 .03 .12\n\n\nbrushed_around ring shiny_face\n0\n0\n8\n\t0\t0\t0\n\t0\t0\t1\n\t0\t2\n\n\nUsing xform, you can then move the surface into position.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004078.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 04, 2006 at 02:41AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004077", "id": "radiance-general_004078"}
