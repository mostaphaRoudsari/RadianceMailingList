{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nIt's a fair question.  I was inspired during last year's attendance  \nof the Color Imaging Conference, where I find myself again this  \nyear.  It occurred to me that the original scale in false color  \ndidn't actually traverse that many \"named colors,\" making it more  \ndifficult than it needed to be to differentiate values.  Having seen  \na number of color scales, including spectral scales like the original  \none I used and thermal scales, I decided that some mix of the two  \nmight work better.  So, I essentially chose colors from a palette  \nmoving through the cooler spectral colors, then shifting to a thermal  \nscale in the green-to-red (which became a green-to-brown)  \ntransition.  This then continues on through red and orange to yellow,  \navoiding white at the end as I found it to be confusing.  I can't say  \nthe results are terribly aesthetic, and the images look a bit bloody  \nin some cases, but it is much easier to pick values off the resulting  \nscale.\n\n\nThe curves you plotted are simply a result of interpolating the  \ncolors I chose along the way.  I made some effort and went through  \nnumerous iterations to balance out the perceptual movement in an  \nattempt to keep the scale uniform, again with debatable success.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004090.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 08, 2006 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004089", "id": "radiance-general_004090"}
