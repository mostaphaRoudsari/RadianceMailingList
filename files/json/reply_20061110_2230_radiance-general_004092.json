{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThanks for your feedback.  In retrospect, it would have been smart to  \nadd an option to get back the old color scale, and I can work on  \nadding one.  In the meantime, you can alias your falsecolor to:\n\n\n\tfalsecolor -r '1.6*v-.6' -g 'if(v-.375,1.6-1.6*v,8/3*v)' -b '1-8/3*v'\n\n\nto get back the old scale.  Easier might be to uncomment lines 14-16  \nin your falsecolor script and comment (or remove) lines 17-19.\n\n\nIf anyone has references to a preferred scale that runs through at  \nleast 8 named colors on a natural-appearing scale, I'd love to hear  \nabout it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004092.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 10, 2006 at 10:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004091", "id": "radiance-general_004092"}
