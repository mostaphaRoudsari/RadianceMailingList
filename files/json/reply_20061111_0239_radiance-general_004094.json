{"body": "Hi Christoph,\n\n\nJohn is right.  If you want to see the light beam in the water, the  \nmist material is for you.  Follow the examples and stop the mist  \nvolume right before the light source, and preferably just inside the  \nwalls and water surface of your pool.  List the underwater light  \nsource(s) in your mist's string arguments.  You should specify a high  \nscattering albedo (probably 0.97 0.99 0.99) and a fairly high H-G  \nconstant (0.85 or so).\n\n\nThe water surface needs to be a dielectric as Ignacio indicates.  If  \nyou apply a texture for a natural wavy appearance, you will see the  \ndistorted bottom of your pool and the scattered beam of your source,  \nbut you will be missing caustics from the water's surface on the pool  \nbottom and the surroundings above water, as Radiance doesn't know how  \nto calculate those properly.  Even without a texture, you won't get  \nproper illumination of the bottom from lights above, I'm afraid.  The  \nbest you can hope for is sky contributions from the ambient calculation.\n\n\nAttached is an example description of a 10 by 5 meter pool with two  \n(diffuse) lights.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004094.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 11, 2006 at 02:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004086", "id": "radiance-general_004094"}
