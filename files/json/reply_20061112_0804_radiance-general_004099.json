{"body": "I never put in an option to set the falsecolor scale to the image  \nmaximum because it's usually the wrong thing to do.  There are often  \na few really bright pixels in a scene that may be orders of magnitude  \nabove the rest.  It's better to go in manually with ximage and use  \nthe 'l' key to pick out luminance values in the bright regions and  \nset the scale based on those.\n\n\n-G\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 12, 2006 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004091", "id": "radiance-general_004099"}
