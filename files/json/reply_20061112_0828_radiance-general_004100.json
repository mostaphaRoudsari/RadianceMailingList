If anything, it's a nice starting point, a way to see what  \nyou're dealing with in a given scene.  I don't see how it's much  \ndifferent from defaulting to '-s 1000'; certainly there is potential  \nthere for gross misrepresentation of the luminous environment as well?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004100.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 12, 2006 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004091", "id": "radiance-general_004100"}
