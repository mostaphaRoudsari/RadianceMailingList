{"body": "I ran Mark's Benchmark test on my iMac 10.4.7 Core2Dou 2.14 GHz 1 GB RAM\nwith Radiance 3.8 Universal binary and I got times around 9000 seconds.\nSeems too long. \nI was hoping it would be in the 4K region. Of course I closed the shell\nbefore copying the times, so I don't have the exact number.\nFor a Core2Duo, does Radiance use both processors, or would I have to use\nrad with -N 2?\nI know you have to do that with a render farm or any multiple processor\nmachine, but since the Core2Duo is 2 on one chip, I'm not sure.\nFor the benchmark itself, I saw Mark only wants single processor results.\nRob F\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004103.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Fitzsimmons", "created_at": "November 15, 2006 at 08:20PM", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004066", "id": "radiance-general_004103"}
