{"body": "Rob,\n\n\nAs it stands, rpict will only open one process, which will only \nload up one core.\n\n\nI would also like to begin collecting multiprocessor benchmarks, \nbut there was once confusion as to how to get a consistent \nmeasurement across different platforms. Is rad with \"-N\" a better \nor more consistent tool for preparing multiprocessor benchmarks, \nor is the runsmp script in bench4 better?\n\n\nI already have a handful of benchmark runs using the runsmp \nscript (though it allows more variables such as NCPU and number \nof subdivisions, both of which strongly affect runtime).\n\n\nOr is it likely that rpict itself will soon support pthreads?\n\n\nAny input would be appreciated.\n\n\nMark\nmstock at umich.edu\n\n\nOn Wed, 15 Nov 2006, Fitzsimmons, Rob wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004104.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "November 15, 2006 at 10:59PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004066", "id": "radiance-general_004104"}
