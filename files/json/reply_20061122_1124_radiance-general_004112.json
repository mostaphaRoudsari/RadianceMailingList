{"body": "Nick,\n\n\n-R -B are supposed to specify direct and diffuse contribute.\na quick and easy check is to create a -s (diffuse only) and a +s\n(global) sky with the same -R -B and check illuminances at a point (0 0\n0, 0 0 1)\nNow try without the sky dome and +s (direct only) and see...\nyou should get diffuse and global and direct values.\nPlease try it.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the source primitive, you need it all the time.\nCoefficients can be just (1 1 1) for the sky \nand a reduction like (0.1 0.1 0.1) or (0.2 0.2 0.2) for the ground\ndepending to the model you are working on.\nIf you use your coefficients you will be working with colour but you\nneed to check that the photopic average is correct.\n\n\n\n\nHope this is +s,\ni.e. 'clear' \n:-)\n\n\nCiao\nG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004112.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "November 22, 2006 at 11:24AM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004111", "id": "radiance-general_004112"}
