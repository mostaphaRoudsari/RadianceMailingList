{"body": "Indeed Phil is right!\noops :-)\n\n\nbut be careful when you use the options -i and -s, without the sun\nyou need also to say -R 0.\n\n\nIf not the 20% ratio will not work, because the ground will include the\nreflected sun component anyway...  \n\n\nTry to compare:\n\n\ngensky 12 12 12 -i -B 56 \n\n\nand\n\n\ngensky 12 12 12 -i -B 56 -R 0\n\n\nThe ground is different.... why is it?\n\n\n\n\nPhil, what do you think? Can we call this a bug?\n\n\nI never noticed it before because I do not model the ground with a\nglow...\n\n\nCiao,\n\n\n:-)\n\n\nG.\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004114.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio Antonutto", "created_at": "November 22, 2006 at 12:27PM", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004111", "id": "radiance-general_004114"}
