{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nworn out by the painstaking process of configuring default apps for\nRADIANCE-specific files for LEARNIX in multiple desktop environments, I'm\ncontemplating submitting some new MIME types to\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org,\nto make this somewhat less painful next year. I'v no idea if this is used\nat all on Mac OS, but on LINUX it seems to be the next BIG thing. It is\nalready used by XFCE4, although KDE (still?) seems to do it's own thing.\n\n\nSince my last post regarding the configuration of web servers to put a\nsensible MIME-type to HDR images didn't give any conclusions, I'm making\nanother attempt at this.\n\n\nBasically, what it is is this: When an app is installed that can handle\ncertain file types, it updates the system's MIME configuration. In theory,\nall desktop environment, file managers etc. should then be able to assign\nthe correct double-click action to those files.\n\n\nThe tutorial for submitting MIME types to freedesktop.org is here:\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fAddingMIMETutor\n\n\nThe issues are:\n\n\n- I don't think there is any way of putting MIME magick into the plain\ntext files, e.g. .rad, .rif, .mat, .vf, but since they are opened in a\ntext editor, there is not much of a problem. Yes, different icons would be\nnice, but then...\n\n\n- What we CAN do is do this for the binary files, e.g. RADIANCE images,\noctrees (holodeck?, meta data?)\n\n\n- The MIME type can be determined by two means:\n\n\n-- the first few bytes of a file. This is referred to as MIME magick. This\nshould be straight-forward for octrees and pics\n\n\n-- file extensions\nI won't attempt to work out a common file naming scheme for rad,rif,mat\netc, since they don't have any 'magick' in them, anyway. What I would like\nto do is to just fire off ximage when a .pic file is double-clicked one.\n\n\nSo here is my question: What do you guys use as default file name\nextensions in your RADIANCE projects? Those are my preferences:\n.pic for synthetic RADIANCE RGBE images\n.hdr for HDRs assembled from photos\n.oct for octrees\n\n\nBTW: I know this is a UNIX thing (we don't need no friggin' extensions)\nbut some of the file in the RADIANCE examples, e.g. the cabin scene, are\nnot gonna go through...\n\n\nThere might potentially a bit of confusion with the RADIANCE XYZE, which I\ndon't tend to use. I think that RBGE and XYZE should really have different\nextensions. Do you think there is any way of having a 'RADIANCE standard'?\n\n\nHow about just going for .rgbe and .xyze? Dirty four-letter extensions are\nno-longer a problem, it seems...\n\n\nPlease comment.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nPS: In the long run, it wouldn't hurt have a set of default extensions...\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000759.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 22, 2006 at 09:29PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000759"}
