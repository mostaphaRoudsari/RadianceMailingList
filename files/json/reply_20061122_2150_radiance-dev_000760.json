TIFF  \nsupports many different color spaces internally, and the files all  \nend in '.tif'.  Again, the FORMAT= line in the Radiance header tells  \nyou what data is enclosed.  Since the byte appearance of the data is  \nidentical between RGBE and XYZE, it doesn't warrant a different file  \ntype, following other people's traditions.\n\n\n> How about just going for .rgbe and .xyze? Dirty four-letter  \n> extensions are\n> no-longer a problem, it seems...\n\n\nThis is not an unreasonable suggestion.  Photosphere considers the  \nfollowing extensions all to indicate a Radiance image:\n\n\n\t.hdr\n\t.pic\n\t.rgbe\n\t.xyze\n\t.radiance\n\n\nThe last one is probably a bit much...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000760.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 22, 2006 at 09:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000760"}
