Most seem to have died now, but I've\nfound on my family's Windows machines that Apple Quicktime wants to\nassociate its picture viewer with *.pic files.\n\n\nI'd prefer it if we just stuck to one extension for Radiance images,\nprobably '.hdr' because of the problems with '.pic'. What is the\npoint of using two different extensions for the same format?\nThey're both images. Are we really going to associate different programs\nwith .pic and .hdr?\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000762.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "November 22, 2006 at 10:15PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000714", "id": "radiance-dev_000762"}
