Thanks for this clarification.\n\n\n> I'd prefer it if we just stuck to one extension for Radiance images,\n> probably '.hdr' because of the problems with '.pic'.

Having said that, I haven't included it\ninto LEARNIX (yet?)\n\n\nThere are actually two sides to the MIME coin:\n1) Define what the files are\n2) Configure default apps for 1)\n\n\nIrrespective of the actual extension, with regards to RADIANCE we're\npretty clear as to what the 'double-click action' should be for an RGBE or\nXYZE image file: ximage.\n\n\nIf I wanted to define a default app for an octree, what would be sensible\nthing to do:\n- rvu,\n- a shell with getinfo\n- nothing\n- ???\n\n\nOther then images and octrees, is there a file type that I've forgotten to\nmention, one that has a bullet-proof definition thanks to some standard\nfile header? Like some holodeck stuff?\n\n\nFinally, any thoughts on the actual TYPE I should define? This is the\nbiggest problem I'm facing. On the WebHDR server, I defined the HDR images\nas image/x-radiance. Is this sensible? And what would an octree be?\n\n\nThanks for your feedback\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000763.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 23, 2006 at 12:35PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000761", "id": "radiance-dev_000763"}
