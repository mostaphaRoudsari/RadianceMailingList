An octree is an internal file/format. Do people pass\naround octree files?\n\n\n> Finally, any thoughts on the actual TYPE I should define? This is the\n> biggest problem I'm facing.

Perhaps you can use\n\"model/x-radiance\" for Radiance scene/object files?\n\n\nWhat about the .rif files used by the rad frontend?\nPerhaps \"application/x-radiance-rif\", and fire up \"rad -o x11\"?\n\n\nJust some ideas,\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000764.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "November 23, 2006 at 12:59PM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000761", "id": "radiance-dev_000764"}
