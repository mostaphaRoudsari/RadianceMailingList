{"body": "Hi guys,\n\n\nI've hit the first wall before I've even dug into the full subject. Greg,\nmaybe you can clarify:\n\n\nBoth, RGBE and XYZE come in flat and in RLE flavours. However, the\nofficial file specs only mention two FORMAT= string, i.e. 32-bit_rle_rgbe\nand 32-bit_rle_xyze. How does this work?\n\n\n> I recall that Peter A-B was one of the early adopters.  We\n> should also ask him.\n\n\nI've been in touch with him about rshow on LEARNIX. He appears to be\nextremely busy\n\n\nThe MIME specs have the notion of subclasses. So would RGBE and XYZE be\nsubclasses of RADIANCE HDR?\n\n\n\"A type is a subclass of another type if any instance of the first type is\nalso an instance of the second. For example, all image/svg files are also\ntext/xml, text/plain and application/octet-stream files. Subclassing is\nabout the format, rather than the catagory of the data (for example, there\nis no 'generic spreadsheet' class that all spreadsheets inherit from).\"\n\n\nThey would both go into image/x-radiance\n\n\nFinally, I have only glimpsed at the naming conventions, but as you say,\nIan, there are those model things:\n\n\nmodel/radiance-material\nmodel/radiance-geometry\nmodel/radiance-view\nmodel/radiance-triangle-mesh\n\n\nFinally, octrees and ambient files.\nThey are not strictly speaking model types. Here is what we can pick from:\n\n\n    application\n    audio\n    example\n    image\n    message\n    model\n    multipart\n    text\n    video\n\n\nSo we are probably stuck with 'model'.\n\n\nThe good news is that a MIME definition doesn't seem to require magic,\ne.g. VRML is only defined by the glob:\n\n\n  <mime-type type=\"model/vrml\">\n    <comment>VRML document</comment>\n    <comment xml:lang=\"de\">VRML-Dokument</comment>\n    <glob pattern=\"*.wrl\"/>\n  </mime-type>\n\n\nSo there should be no problem with the old .rad, .mat, .vf\nThose seem to be the more important ones. I won't get too carried away for\nnow (.cal .bgraph .norm etc)\n\n\nDoes any-one uses .sky for gensky generated output? I remember seeing this\nsomewhere a long time ago...\n\n\nI'm leaving for London on Fri, and will be fairly busy. Thanks for your\ninput so far. It might be a few days before I can read up on the subject a\nlittle bit more.\n\n\nWhat I haven't worked out yet is why some types are x-soandso, other only\nsoandso. There are also alias and round robins. Oh, well...\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000766.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 23, 2006 at 11:22PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000761", "id": "radiance-dev_000766"}
