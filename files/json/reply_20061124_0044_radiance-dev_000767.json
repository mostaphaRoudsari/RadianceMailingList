There are also alias and round robins. Oh, well...\n\n\nIt's an old internet convention also used in email and HTTP headers (and\nprobably lots of other places). Anything prefixed with 'x-' is\nnon-standard. I guess it originally stood for 'experimental'. Just look at\nthe source of any of these emails and you'll see lots of headers starting\nwith 'x-'. They were added by the sender's email client and possibly\nsystems the email travelled through e.g your ISP might add spam-detection\nheaders. They're not part of the standard and can be almost anything.\n\n\nIn the MIME world it, types have to be officially approved. For example,\nPNG originally used image/x-png before image/png was officially allocated.\n\n\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000767.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Tester", "created_at": "November 24, 2006 at 12:44AM", "created_by": "Ian_Tester", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000761", "id": "radiance-dev_000767"}
