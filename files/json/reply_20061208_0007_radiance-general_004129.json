{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nI realize this is confusing, but basically you want to put a \"void\"  \npolygon in front of your opening.  Carsten is correct that the  \npolygon needs to point into the room, but some other slight  \nmodifications are necessary as well to work with rad, as identified  \nbelow.  It is probably better just to use a pane of glass instead of  \nan illum initially.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004129.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 08, 2006 at 12:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004126", "id": "radiance-general_004129"}
