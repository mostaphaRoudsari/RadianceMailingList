{"body": "Greg, Carsten - thanks for your help. I really appreciate it. I just\nwanted to make sure I was understanding things correctly, so forgive\nthese two questions:\n\n\nAs I understand it now, there are three ways to wind up with illum\nsources in your .oct file:\n1. Use the illum material type. Run 'oconv' as normal.\n2. Use rad and place all of the 'illums' (using whatever secondary\nmaterial) into a separate file. This runs mkillum automatically.\n3. Use mkillum manually. (This is the same as 2 above?)\nAs I type this out it makes perfect sense. Perhaps I have a tendency to\noverthink things. \n\n\nOne thing I noticed is that the window_dist type is replaced with a\nsimple glass type. Is this because the reflectance/appearance of the\nskylight doesn't matter due to it being mostly hidden? Is it correct to\nassume that if I had a sidelight window in my final scene, I would\ninclude the \"skyfunc brightfunc window_dist 2 winxmit winxmit.cal 0 0\"\nbit to make the window appear as a real window?\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMark Shewfelt\nEnermodal Engineering Ltd.\nKitchener Ontario Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004130.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Shewfelt", "created_at": "December 08, 2006 at 05:24PM", "created_by": "Mark_Shewfelt", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004126", "id": "radiance-general_004130"}
