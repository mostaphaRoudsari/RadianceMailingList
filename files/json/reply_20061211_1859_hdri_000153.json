{"body": "Hi Guilio,\n\n\nI haven't done this myself, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work,  \nat least for Lambertian (or nearly Lambertian) surfaces.  You just  \nneed a suitable reflectance standard to set in the plane of the  \nsurface -- any of the commercially available gray cards would do.  To  \navoid issues with variability in the incident light, you should  \nprobably average surface values all around the gray card, rather than  \nto one side of it, or cut a hole in the gray card and do the  \nreverse.  People have also used polarizing filters to separate out  \nthe specular component if there is one.\n\n\nIf you can get a sample of your material, a scanner combined with  \nmacbethcal works even better.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-December/000153.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 11, 2006 at 06:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000150", "id": "hdri_000153"}
