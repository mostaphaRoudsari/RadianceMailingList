{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nWhat other methods are there besides the one in Photosphere?  I'm not  \nup on other people's software, but I hadn't heard of other commercial  \nor free packages that did this.  Do you have some results to point us  \nto?  Or are you talking about exposure alignment methods?\n\n\nJust curious.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-December/000156.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 14, 2006 at 06:33PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000146", "id": "hdri_000156"}
