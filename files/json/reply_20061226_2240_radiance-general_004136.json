{"body": "I use the -aa setting to get a smoother indirect calculation. This is especially important if the -ad parameter is low, i.e., <=512. A high -aa parameter, such as 5000 or whatever, creates a dense grid of indirect/reflected values. You can check that by making two images, one with a low setting of ad and aa, and one with a low setting of ad and a high setting of aa. That will show you immediately what the ambient accuracy parameter is about. The image contains less blotches. \n\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004136.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "December 26, 2006 at 10:40PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004135", "id": "radiance-general_004136"}
