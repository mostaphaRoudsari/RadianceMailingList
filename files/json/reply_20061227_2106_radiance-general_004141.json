{"body": "Hi Martin:\n\n\nI am not sure what causes your difficulties but I would recommend that you use the MINGW Radiance binaries  from http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4 instead of Desktop Radiance. The binaries are up-to-date and truly stand alone under WIndows (no CYGWIN required).  I recomend to my students to copy the files under C:\\Radiance. Since the students use Radiance via Ecotect, the Raypath variable gets reset by Ecotect any time one runs Radiance since each RADIANCE batch file generated by Ecotect starts with:\n\n\nSET RAYPATH=.;C:\\RADIANCE\\LIB\nPATH=C:\\RADIANCE\\BIN;$PATH\n\n\nIn Daysim I hardwired the LIBDIR varialbe to c:\\DAYSIM\\lib which is why Daysim has to be installed under C:\\Daysim. This causes a limitation for individuals that do not want to or cannot install programs on their c:\\ drive but I have not found a way around this. \n\n\nOne student group used Radiance textures this year but it is pretty painful using the Ecotect GUI. Last year some students used the Radiance plugin into 3D Studio Max from Lichtplaner and the results were very convincing http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/arch447/fall2005/StudentWork/06CountryInn_Presentation.pdf).\n\n\nChristoph \n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004141.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "December 27, 2006 at 09:06PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004137", "id": "radiance-general_004141"}
