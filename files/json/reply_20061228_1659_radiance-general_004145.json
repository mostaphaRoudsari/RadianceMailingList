{"body": "Mark,\n\n\nAwesome pictures.  What are the limitations of your low -ad and high over sampling approach?  When is appropriate and when is it not appropriate?\n\n\nProbably not something you are concerned about in your work, but when you use such a low -ad setting and such a high over sampling rate, I'd like to know what effect there is on overall light level accuracy in a typical interior space with daylighting and/or electric lighting?\n\n\nI guess there is no over sampling on an rtrace calculation, but for an irradiance calculation image, my -ad setting is usually in the thousands and my ambient bounces are at 4 or so (depending on the results of a parameter test)  I'm guessing the -ab and -ad parameters can't be reduced if light level accuracy is important.  Maybe I'm wrong?  Sure would be nice to slash some of those crazy calculation times.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004145.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "December 28, 2006 at 04:59PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004135", "id": "radiance-general_004145"}
