Another problem that occurs more with some pieces \nthen others is speckles caused by particularly bright pixels. \nSince pfilt works on the full dynamic range, a single \nsuper-bright pixel in the full-res image can cause a \nsignificant bright spot in the final reduced-res image. Note the \nspeckles in this image:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/p54.html\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/img54_detail_900.png\n\n\nThat second image is at print resolution, and was filtered down \nfrom a 4x or 6x resolution original. That scene is very \ncontrasty. Some of my more recent work mitigates the speckling by \nrendering in a closed room: allowing enough bounces to provide a \nmore even background.\n\n\nI find that \"-aa 0\" is appropriate when the octree for a scene \nwith little overlapping geometry takes more than a few hundred MB \nto create. Or for scenes in which I want detailed interreflection \namong a great number of very tiny surfaces (probably the same \nthing). It seems to me to be an easy way to get rid of the \nsplotches that plagued some of my earlier renderings.\n\n\n> Probably not something you are concerned about in your work, \n> but when you use such a low -ad setting and such a high over \n> sampling rate, I'd like to know what effect there is on overall \n> light level accuracy in a typical interior space with \n> daylighting and/or electric lighting?\n\n\nI have not studied this at all. I could posit that the low -ad \nwith high oversampling rate allows me to bias the interreflection \ntoward the first (and most important) bounce. Shooting 36 rays \ninto a final image pixel (what 6x oversampling does) but letting \neach of those only spawn 8 child rays (-ad 8) at the second and \ndeeper levels effectively means that I'm doing a more accurate \n1st bounce.\n\n\n> I guess there is no over sampling on an rtrace calculation, but \n> for an irradiance calculation image, my -ad setting is usually \n> in the thousands and my ambient bounces are at 4 or so \n> (depending on the results of a parameter test)  I'm guessing \n> the -ab and -ad parameters can't be reduced if light level \n> accuracy is important.  Maybe I'm wrong?  Sure would be nice to \n> slash some of those crazy calculation times.\n\n\nMy impetus was to slash the computation times and fit the problem \nin memory. Of course, back then I had 2 GB of RAM *at most* and \nno access to anything better than a dual-proc machine. Now I am \nblessed with access to a 32 GB monster 8-core intel box and a \nnumber of medium-sized clusters.\n\n\nOne other advantage of \"-aa 0\" is that one pixel trace does not \ndepend on another, so parallelization is trivial. I use rpiece \nalmost exclusively for my big jobs now. OpenMP or pthreads \nanyone?\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "December 28, 2006 at 09:25PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004135", "id": "radiance-general_004146"}
