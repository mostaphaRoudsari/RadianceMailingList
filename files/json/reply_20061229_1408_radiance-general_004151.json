{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI've just tried this new script and if I understood it well, it \ndetermines whether output material should be glass or BRTDfunc using \nnext conditions:\nabs(back_reflectance - front_reflectance)<0.05 -> glass material\ntransmittance>0.645 and abs(back_reflectance - front_reflectance)>0.05 \n-> BRTFfunc with '*clear' functions\ntransmittance<0.645 and abs(back_reflectance - front_reflectance)>0.05 \n-> BRTFfunc with '*bronze' functions\nRight?\n\n\nFew questions:\n- For Plexiglas\u00ae MC (NFRC ID= 2604), glass material parameters are >1 ( \n1.002 1.004 1.001). I think glass transmissivity should be <=1 ?!\n- For materials that are exported from OPTICS5 and have name like \n\"abc_def\" (with \"_\"), optics2rad doesn't define output radiance \nmaterials, because it doesn't recognize the format.\n-Is window.cal relevant only for one-layer glazings? I suppose for \ndouble layer we should use glaze.csh script as before.\n\n\nMarija.\n\n\nGregory J.
