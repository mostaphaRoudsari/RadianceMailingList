I see the problem, but there's not much I can do to fix it,  \nbecause rcalc uses the underscore character to find the end of the  \nname.  I guess you just have to manually edit the Optics5 output to  \neliminate the underscores in the middle of names.  I could probably  \ncome up with a sed script to do it if it's really a problem.\n\n\n> -Is window.cal relevant only for one-layer glazings?
