{"body": "Hi Jacob,\n\n\nIt's difficult to answer your question without knowing anything about  \nIESve or what it permits.  You also didn't specify what you mean by  \n\"glass blinds.\"  Is this just a window with some odd coating(s) on  \nit, or does it have some structure?  Is there some way to give a  \nRadiance material description to IESve directly?  When is your deadline?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-January/004156.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2007 at 08:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004155", "id": "radiance-general_004156"}
