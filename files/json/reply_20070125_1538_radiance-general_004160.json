{"body": "Hi Andr\u00e9,\n\n\nI forwarded your question to the radiance-general discussion list,  \nasking if anyone there is on the Good Lighting forum.  Since no one  \nresponded as yet, I assume they're either busy or the overlap is the  \nempty set.  It might behoove you to subscribe to radiance-general at  \nwww.radiance-online.org so you can get future questions answered there.\n\n\nRadiance is well-supported on Mac OS X, and the precompiled 3.8  \n\"universal\" binaries with instructions on installation may be found  \nat the main website:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\n\n\nYou should download both the complete distribution with source code  \nand the rad3R8_macosx.tar.gz link.  Once you unpack the main  \ndistribution, you'll want to run \"makealll library\" from a Terminal  \nwindow in the main \"ray\" directory.  Then, move the unpacked binaries  \nto a /usr/local/bin or similar directory and add this to your shell's  \npath.  Radiance is a suite of command-line tools, so if you are  \nunfamiliar with Terminal and X11, they will undoubtedly give you  \ntrouble.\n\n\nThe best reference for the system is still \"Rendering with Radiance,\"  \nedited by Larson and Shakespeare.  Charles Ehrlich, the author of the  \nlighting chapter, worked diligently to make this book available  \nthrough a print-on-demand service, which seems to have dropped us at  \nthe moment, so getting a copy is problematic.  I suggest you write to  \nAmazon (see <http://tinyurl.com/ycajwm>) or BookSurge.com telling  \nthem you would like one if you don't have the book already.\n\n\nBest of luck.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-January/004160.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2007 at 03:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004159", "id": "radiance-general_004160"}
