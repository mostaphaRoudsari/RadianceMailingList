{"body": "Hi all,\nI should simulate a screen material with highly specular reflection\n(0.8) at one side like aluminized matrial  an a totally diffuse\ntransmission of  about 0.1.\nThe parameter of spec for trans material isn't described very well in\n'Rendering with Radiance' so I couldn't understand it. Does a numer of 1\nspec means a totally specularity for diffuse and direct light ? If so\nshould I use somthing like this:\n\n\nscreen trans spec-diff_80-10\n0 0 7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0\n\n\ncorrect? Or does anybody know a BRTDfunc material definition for this\nissue?\n\n\nThanks for help!\n\n\nFriedemann Kik\nTranssolar Stuttgart\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-January/004161.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Friedemann Kik", "created_at": "January 26, 2007 at 12:38PM", "created_by": "Friedemann_Kik", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002116", "id": "radiance-general_004161"}
