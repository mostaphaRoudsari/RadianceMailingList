{"body": "Hi Friedemann,\n\n\nThe trans material is indeed a bit confusing (no offense Greg:)). We did\na validation last year for a translucent material along with some\nmeasurements of a real material. Maybe you'll find the paper useful:\nReinhart C F, Andersen M, \"Development and validation of a Radiance\nmodel for a translucent panel\", Energy and Buildings 38:7 pp. 890-904,\n2006.\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/fulltext/nrcc48165/nrcc48165.pdf\n\n\nAlso, you might want to have a look at\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html to bette undrstand\nthe trans material.\n\n\nChristoph\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-January/004162.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "January 26, 2007 at 02:14PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002116", "id": "radiance-general_004162"}
