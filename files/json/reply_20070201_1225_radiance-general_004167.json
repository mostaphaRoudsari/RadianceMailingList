{"body": "Thanks for help, Jack and Christoph,\n\n\nI know about the wonderful rayfront user manuel from Schorsch, espacially the nice diagram, but\nthe description of trans I found there is a little bit imprecise if \"spec\" is speciefied with   \"Values greater than 0.1 are unusual\". Does \"unusual\" mean impossible for RADIANCE to calculate correct if a greater values is set? Is there an other reason which I should know?\nAn other question about \"trans\" is if it transmits only direct source rays or additionally diffuse one (i.e. from sky hemisphere)\nJack, I wasn't interrested about the absorption caused by color filtering, my focus was only  on reflected specularity. For more realistic renderings I should use other parameters, of course. By the way: I can count myself lucky to say that there are no \"other basic problems\" to assign the matirial to my model...\n\n\nThanks for additional comments!\nFriedemann\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\n\tVon: radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org] Im Auftrag von Jack de Valpine\n\tGesendet: Freitag, 26. Januar 2007 14:59\n\tAn: Radiance general discussion\n\tBetreff: Re: [Radiance-general] trans material\n\n\n\n\n\tHi All,\n\n\n\tYes, trans is very confusing. The link to Schorsch's page is very helpful, particularly the diagram. You should also look at pages 325 and 326 of Rendering with Radiance to see how parameters for the trans material can be derived. It would probably also be worthwhile to do a search on the archives as the trans material is a recurring topic of question, discussion and answer.\n\n\n\tI am a bit unclear though about the makeup of your material. You use the word \"screen\" to describe it, this could be interpreted as a material that actually has holes in it, in which case the material would also need to have a specular transmittance component (arg 7), that is the portion of light that pass un-diffused through the material. I am not sure but this might even need a more complex material description.\n\n\n\tAlso you may have some more basic problems in the definition of your material. You have the following:\n\n\n\n\n\t\tscreen trans spec-diff_80-10\n\t\t0\n\t\t0\n\t\t7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0\n\n\n\n\n\tNote that this implies that there is actually some material modifier called \"screen\" that is modifying the material (of type trans) called \"spec-diff_80-10\". Is this what you intend? Or do you mean:\n\n\n\n\n\t\tvoid trans screen\n\t\t0\n\t\t0\n\t\t7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0\n\n\n\n\n\twhere \"screen\" then gets applied to geometry?\n\n\n\tNote one other item. I believe that it would be extremely unusual for the first three parameters to be 1 1 1. Schorsch's page indicates a realistic range of .2 to .9. The first three arguments are derived based on the interaction of the \"diffuse\" reflectance of the material with the \"reflected specularity\" (arg 4) and along with (arg 6). \n\n\n\tRegards,\n\n\n\t-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004167.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Friedemann Kik", "created_at": "February 01, 2007 at 12:25PM", "created_by": "Friedemann_Kik", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002116", "id": "radiance-general_004167"}
