{"body": "Hi Friedmann,\n\n\nI believe that the specularity of common uncoated glass is around  .06, \nso perhaps this is where this range is coming from. Perhaps if the \nsystem was a translucent glazing system with some kind of additional \ncoating the specular component might be higher.\n\n\nRegarding your comment on absorption. It is actually important to base \nyour material on reasonable estimates for the initial parameters as \ndescribed in RwR, as these have impact on the values used for the \narguments to the material. As you see in the formula's in the book the \nparameters all interact with each other.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004168.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 01, 2007 at 03:04PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002116", "id": "radiance-general_004168"}
