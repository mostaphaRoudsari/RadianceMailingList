{"body": "Hi Kristopher,\n\n\nThe standard distribution of Radiance (which this list is largely \ndedicated to) does not have an \"xform2\" command. Perhaps this is \nsomething special to IES-VE and somehow got messed up with the \ninstallation of DR? Is it possible to \"easily\" reinstall your IES-VE or \nthe Radiance components that come with IES-VE?\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004175.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 08, 2007 at 03:55AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004174", "id": "radiance-general_004175"}
