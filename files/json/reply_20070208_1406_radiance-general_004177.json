{"body": "Nick,\nIs Radiance really the right tool to accomplish what you are trying to\ndo? There is a program www.squ1.com called EcoTect that allows you to\nconduct overshadowing studies and select shadow colors for different\nobjects. A demo is available for download at www.squ1.com. Also, EcoTect\nmodels can be exported to Radiance.\n\n\nEmail me offline if you'd like to discuss further.\n\n\nBest,\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 1\nDate: Thu, 8 Feb 2007 08:15:41 -0000\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004177.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John An", "created_at": "February 08, 2007 at 02:06PM", "created_by": "John_An", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004176", "id": "radiance-general_004177"}
