{"body": "Hi again,\n\n\n   Thank you so much. I got the file to be added finally. One question \nis that, after new types were added to supported surface types, then, \nwhen I select the glazing type, it exits as \"Missing -.\"       I \nselected one clear glass layer (1) and another was from the glazing.dat \nwhich was just added. (My input data was the same as posted yesterday.)\n\n\nThank you so much for your help.\nSiritip\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004193.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Siritip Harn", "created_at": "February 15, 2007 at 02:53PM", "created_by": "Siritip_Harn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004184", "id": "radiance-general_004193"}
