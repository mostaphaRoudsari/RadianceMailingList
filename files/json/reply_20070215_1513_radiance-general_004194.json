In order to fix this (without messing with the \nscript), I made sure that all decimal units are expressed in the form \n\"x.x\" as opposed to \".x\", thus I added 0 to the front of decimals units \n\".x\". Now it seems to work.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nsiritip at umich.edu wrote:\n> Hi again,\n>\n>   Thank you so much. I got the file to be added finally.
