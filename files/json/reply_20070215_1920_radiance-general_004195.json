{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\n   I edited the file as you suggested but still it exits with \n'missing.'. Here's the latest file.\n\n\nSurface Tr      Tg      Tb      Rcr     Rcg     Rcb     Rgr     Rgg     \nRgb     Part\na       0.862   0.890   0.886   0.074   0.077   0.079   0.074   0.077   \n0.079   0\nb       0.756   0.808   0.744   0.042   0.049   0.043   0.065   0.058   \n0.067   0\n\n\nI've been testing other options in the input file like having only one \nline input but it still exits after asking for glazing type. I'll try \nto check with it again to see if I could get it to work :)  Thank you \nvery much for your help.\n\n\nSiritip\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004195.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Siritip Harn", "created_at": "February 15, 2007 at 07:20PM", "created_by": "Siritip_Harn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004184", "id": "radiance-general_004195"}
