{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> For the outside windows, genrad suggests a ground ambient level of 68.5\n\n\nhm, genrad, not part of the radiance distribution? Is it genrad from \nthat old CAD-integration project?\n\n\n> As I am using trad/rad I want to embed the commands within the window\n> rad file rather than in the rif 'mkillum=' line.

You can specify the mkillum settings in the input file, but \nwhat you want to set (av, ar, ...) are the rtrace parameters that \nmkillums uses when starting rtrace processes.\n\n\nDo you really need different av's? I'd increase the overall ambient \naccuracy, set a high ab (not needed for the outer windows, but it is not \nso important in rendering times if only used for the illum generation).\n\n\nGood luck!
