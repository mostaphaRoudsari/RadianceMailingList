{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nthis is a really late follow-up...\n\n\nI am having still these problems from time to time, and while I can \ndebug that, I am curious about the consequences of this overflow.\n\n\nWhen one modifier has been \"instanced\" too many times, what effect does \nthis have for the exclude list? Will all the \"instances\" of the modifier \nup to the limit still be excluded? Will the modifier who has been \ninstanced too often be not excluded at all, but other modifiers which \nare in the range still get excluded when on the exclude list? Or will \nthe whole exclude list be ignored if one modifier causes the overrun?\n\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004201.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
