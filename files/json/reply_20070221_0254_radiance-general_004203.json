{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI had to check the code, myself.  Up to the limit (2047 in the  \ncurrent release), you can add modifiers to include or exclude,  \ncounting each once per appearance on the input.  (Actual instances  \ncontaining materials count only once per, but repeating the same  \nmaterial name over and over does count.)  After the limit is reached,  \na warning is issued and further modifiers that should be on the list  \nare silently ignored.  It still counts the ones up until that point.\n\n\nAs for Terry's question, your answer is correct about the #@mkillum  \nlines on the input.  You cannot have different rtrace settings on a  \nper-illum basis, however.  You can have different ones for mkillum  \nthan the rest of the process, by using a different setting for  \nrender= and mkillum= in the rad input file.\n\n\nHope this clears things up.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004203.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 21, 2007 at 02:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002804", "id": "radiance-general_004203"}
