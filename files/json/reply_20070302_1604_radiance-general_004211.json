{"body": "Jelle.\n\n\nAs Giullio has already explained\n\n\n-i    will return the value for a 'light meter' at (x,y,z) pointing in\ndirection (dx,dy,dz)\n      Only that one point will be calculated.\n\n\n-I    will return the value for virtual light meter at (x,y,z) pointing\nin direction (dx,dy,dz)\n      but it will sample the whole hemisphere around the direction\nvector.\n      Basically rtrace introduces a virtual plane and turns the 'virtual\nlight meter' around\n      to get the value of a point on this plane. You have to increase\n-ab by 1 to get the\n      same number of effective bounces as with '-i'.\n\n\nTry a simple scene with both options and low -ab values (0,1,2).\n\n\nIf you print origin and direction of the rtrace ray as well you will see\nthat '-I' changes\nthem. Quite confusing if you're not prepared for it.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004211.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 02, 2007 at 04:04PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004209", "id": "radiance-general_004211"}
