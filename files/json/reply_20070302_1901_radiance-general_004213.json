{"body": "I guess the man page is pretty confusing.  The '-i' option sends a  \nray into the scene, just as rpict would for generating an image or  \nrtrace would for generating a radiance value, but then computes the  \nincident irradiance at that surface point rather than the radiance.   \nIn other words, it makes most surfaces (with the exception of glass  \nmaterials) look perfectly diffuse, with a normalization factor that  \ncomputes irradiance.\n\n\nThe '-I' option, which is only supported by rtrace, changes the  \nnotion of the input to be interpreted as an illuminance measurement  \npoint as Guilio said, rather than a ray origin and direction.  This  \nmakes it convenient for placing virtual irradiance meters anywhere in  \nyour scene.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004213.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 02, 2007 at 07:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004209", "id": "radiance-general_004213"}
