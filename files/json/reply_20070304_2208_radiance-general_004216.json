{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nThe necessity of the '\\' (backslash) character to escape the '!'  \ndepends on which shell you use.  The C-shell requires it, whereas  \nmost other shells don't.\n\n\nRegarding pcomb and the falsecolor legend, it's possible to cut the  \nlegend off using pcompos and reattach it also using pcompos after  \nprocessing with pcomb, as an alternative method.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004216.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 04, 2007 at 10:08PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004214", "id": "radiance-general_004216"}
