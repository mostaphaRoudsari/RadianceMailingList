{"body": "Hi Mohamad,\n\n\nI believe the best way to do this is by using a triangle marker in your desktop radiance scene and then using the replmarks command to replace that marker with the previously created Radiance monitor model.  I don't think Desktop Radiance has a clean way to do this in the interface so you may have to add this to the created rif and rad files behind the scenes.  This is a more complex process and I would suggest reading the Radiance manual pages on rif and rad formats and on replmarks.\n\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers, P.E., IESNA, LEED AP\nDaylighting Analysis Group Leader\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext. 435\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "March 20, 2007 at 04:31PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004233", "id": "radiance-general_004236"}
