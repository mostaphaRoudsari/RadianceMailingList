{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nThanks so much for your help. You are much appreciated.\n\n\nGreg described my problem exactly right. Mark, I started by drawing my own furniture, but I realized that they won't have accurate photometric data. If there is a possible way to model accurate model in cad (Desktop Radiance), I'm totally open to this option. I master the work in the cad system.    \n\n\nZack, I couldn\u2019t find the replmarks command in Desktop Radiance. I think it's only available in Radiance. Am I right. Also, I don't know if the DR has the Triangular marker option to use. I read all the information available in the Radiance manual pages, but nothing helped on this issue with the DR. \n\n\nBest regard.\n\n\nRespectfully,\nMohamad\n\n\n---- Original message ----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004238.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohamad Tarek Araji", "created_at": "March 20, 2007 at 05:57PM", "created_by": "Mohamad_Tarek_Araji", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004233", "id": "radiance-general_004238"}
