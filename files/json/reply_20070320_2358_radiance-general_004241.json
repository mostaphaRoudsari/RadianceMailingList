{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nIt was easy to follow all the steps you mentioned, expect for the one responsible on how to edit the scale/position of the monitor. The reason is that I wasn\u2019t able to convert the .rad file to .oct file. Basically, I have three .rad files for the monitor, not one. I think one of them is responsible for the positioning/scaling factor, namely VDTon.rad. When typing in the command prompt (oconv VDTon.rad > VDTon.oct), I get error massage. I even tried the option of converting the other .vdt files to .oct, but I got similar/different error massages. Is there a problem that I\u2019m not aware of. \n\n\nI'm attaching these files for your convenience, especially if you are interested in taking a closer look.\n\n\nAgain, thank you so much for your help and you are much appreciated.\n\n\nRespectfully,\nMohamad\n\n\n---- Original message ----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004241.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mohamad Tarek Araji", "created_at": "March 20, 2007 at 11:58PM", "created_by": "Mohamad_Tarek_Araji", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004233", "id": "radiance-general_004241"}
