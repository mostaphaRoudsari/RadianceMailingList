{"body": "My memory of DR is very old, but I seem to remember that it had problems\nwith two issues:\n1) TAB characters in the file - cannot remember if the xform program was\nable to sort that one out.\n2) The LF versus CR/LF end of line terminations.\n\n\nI remember I had some fun trying to use the Unix developed models in the\nMS/DR environment, eventually giving up and using Linux and the latest\nRadiance. (Now I am using VMPLAYER to run the Linux/radiance and sharing\nthe hardware/file systems via samba - works a treat) - Just export your\nCAD model using 3ds or dxf, copy it across to the Linux file system (via\nsamba), convert with 3ds2mgf + mgf2rad or the dxf2rad method. Then use\ntrad as a nice friendly gui to radiance.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004242.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance McMinn", "created_at": "March 21, 2007 at 02:50AM", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004233", "id": "radiance-general_004242"}
