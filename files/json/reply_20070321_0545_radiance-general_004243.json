Reason  \nI ask is that Greg sent me that very same monitor model and I was  \nable to work with it, but when I first tried to use it I got errors  \nworking on Windows.  There are linefeed issues that can create some  \nproblems here, and I suspect that's your problem. I'd send you a  \nfrozen octree, but I can't seem to find the source files here on my  \nlaptop -- must all be at work (looks like I'm getting my priorities  \nstraight).  If you like, I can build a frozen octree tomorrow and  \nmail it to ya, and we can go from there.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004243.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 21, 2007 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004233", "id": "radiance-general_004243"}
