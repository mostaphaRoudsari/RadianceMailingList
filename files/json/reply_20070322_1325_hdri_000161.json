Dev., etc.)\n- making an HDR from images without EXIF info (setting ASA, exposure  \ntime, etc. manually)\n- what functions *can* be \"undone\" and which critical ones (clearing  \na record, etc.) *cannot.*\n\n\n> Lastly, is anyone interested in reading the drafts and giving feedback\n> on what's already written?\n\n\nSure! Send it on over... but be warned, I use lots of red pixels in  \nmy comments!\n\n\n-Mark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2007-March/000161.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark mab3d", "created_at": "March 22, 2007 at 01:25PM", "created_by": "Mark_mab3d", "parent_id": "hdri_000160", "id": "hdri_000161"}
