{"body": "Marija.\n\n\nThe idea is to define a pattern in step 2 and use this\npattern as a base for the material definition in step 3:\n\n\nvoid colorpict pattern1\n7 red green blue picture_norm.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v\n0\n0\n\n\npattern1 plastic material1\n0\n0\n5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0 0\n\n\n\n\nThis will create 'material1' with an average reflectance\nof 0.4. You can use 'material1' directly in your scene, there\nis no need to define an alias.\n\n\nUsing a normalised picture allows you to change the material\nreflectance by changing the rgb-arguments in the plastic\nprimitive (here: 0.4) directly. You don't have to take into\naccount the average of the picture as well because the average\nof the normalised image is 1.\n\n\nYou don't have to use a digital image as source (normpat will\ntake care of that, too). Only if you want to use the image\nas illumination source you need a properly calibrated HDR image\nwhich can only be obtained with a digital camera.\n\n\nI have a few comments on image maps here:\n\n\nhttp://home.arcor.de/tbleicher/radiance/imagemaps.html\n\n\n\n\nHTH,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004248.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 26, 2007 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004247", "id": "radiance-general_004248"}
