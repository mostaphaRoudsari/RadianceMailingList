{"body": "Hi,\n\n\njust to add it to the list of options, take a look at Rayfront \n(www.schorsch.com) which is a great cross platform tool to both organize \nyour project and have a nice GUI for everything you want. There is a \ndemo available on the site, so you can try it out.\n\n\nSecond, as you mentioned that you have to simulate a lot of atriums. \nThis sounds a bit like a lot of serial and scriptable work. Having a \nLinux machine and learning some bash scripting may be more useful here \nthen clicking in GUIs. If you follow some conventions in you models \n(e.g. material/layer names, units, filenames...) then you could automate \na lot of work and concentrate on modeling and interpreting the results \ninstead of starting simulations from a GUI a hundred times. I personally \nlike to use make for such stuff, but there are lots of options.\n\n\nA, and of course, scripting on a Mac is the same as on Linux, Solaris \netc., I am working most of the time on an old Powerbook and send the \nbigger processes to some Linux machines (which are faster and better \ncooled big pentium4s in my case). So I can actually share the club of \nthose encouraging you to set up some nice OS X environment for this \nproject ;-)\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004259.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
