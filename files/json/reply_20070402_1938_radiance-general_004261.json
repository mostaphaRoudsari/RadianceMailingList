{"body": "Hello Iebele,\n\n\nSince you have too many materials in your \"ambient exclude\" list,  \nyou're best hope is to switch to an \"ambient include\" list, instead.   \nCreate a file listing all of the materials, hopefully not xform'ed  \nand duplicated like your leaves, that you would like to include in  \nthe interreflection calculation.  These can be put in a file and  \nincorporated with a single -aI option.\n\n\nThe other alternative is to switch off the irradiance cache using -aa  \n0 and assign other parameters to make the problem tractable over all  \nsurfaces.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004261.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 02, 2007 at 07:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004260", "id": "radiance-general_004261"}
