{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nWell my experience is this. I obtained a trial/demo version of xfrog \nwhich comes with some sample trees. In order to test the geometry in \nradiance I exported a sample tree as obj. When I tried obj2rad, I got a: \nWaverfront syntax error near line <...>: Zero normal. However, if I take \nthe xfrog obj into PolyTrans and re-export it, I get an obj file that \nworks fine.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGregory J.
