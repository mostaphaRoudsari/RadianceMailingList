{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nI can't be much help on this, as I'm not familiar with the model, but  \nthe general idea with local coordinates is that you don't have to do  \nthe mapping yourself.  It's supposedly handled by the mesh generation  \nsoftware, and isn't affected by transformations as a global  \ncoordinate mapping would be.\n\n\nI hope this is a helpful clue, as it's about all I have to offer.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004267.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 03, 2007 at 05:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004260", "id": "radiance-general_004267"}
