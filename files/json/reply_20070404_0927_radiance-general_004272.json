{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nWow, that is a nice tutorial you wrote! Thank you so much, it has been \nof great help, I now have the trees rendered exactly as they appear in \nxfrog.\n\n\nThe obj to obj conversion using Polytrans to prepare the files for \nfeeding them to obj2mesh does not work for all the trees in the Xfrog \nlibraries. The example files that are shipped with the demo version of \nXfrog go well. But some (at least those I happen to work with) of the \nlibrary files do not happily convert to a Radiance mesh using the obj to \nobj conversion in Polytrans. The coordinate mapping is lost somewhere \nduring this proces - some warnings of both Polytrans and obj2mesh \nprobably relate to that.\n\n\nExporting to 3DS in Xfrog, and convert that file to OBJ using Polytrans \nworks fine for obj2mesh, apart from the fact that the whole model is \nrotated, which is solved by adding a transform:\n\n\n        void mesh tree\n        7 tree.rtm   -rx 90 -ry 0 -rz 0\n        0\n        0\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004272.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "April 04, 2007 at 09:27AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004260", "id": "radiance-general_004272"}
