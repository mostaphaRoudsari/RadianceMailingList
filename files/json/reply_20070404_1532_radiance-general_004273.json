{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nYour welcome. It is fortunate that I have also been starting to work \nwith xfrog trees, so this is pretty fresh in my mind.\n\n\nMy experience with different trees in xfrog is pretty limited. I have \nexperimented with one of the example ones, which is what I used to base \nthe polytrans intermediate translation method on. The other one is from \nan xfrog tree that came with a pre-exported obj that I purchased on \nTurboSquid.\n\n\nI am not sure how familiar you are with Polytrans. It does have some \ntools for (re)calculating uv tangent vectors. I wonder if this would be \nworth trying on one of the trees that causes problems.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\niebele wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004273.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 04, 2007 at 03:32PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004260", "id": "radiance-general_004273"}
