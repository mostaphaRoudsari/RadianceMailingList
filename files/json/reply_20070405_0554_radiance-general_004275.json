You need to  \nalso add a RAYPATH environment variable to your setup, just like you  \nhave a PATH variable.  I put these lines in my .bash_profile:\n\n\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray\nexport RAYPATH\n\n\nTHis will allow Radiance to find rayinit.cal (and anything in your  \ncurrent directory that may be of interest to Radiance).  Good luck!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004275.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 05, 2007 at 05:54AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004274", "id": "radiance-general_004275"}
