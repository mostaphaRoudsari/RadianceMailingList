The third  \nline above is not only redundant, but also is including your enire  \nsearch path in the RAYPATH variable.  THis is not necessarily bad,  \nbut bear in mind that Radiance will be searching a lot of additional  \nlocations for cal files, which may not be what you want.  SInce the  \nCWD and then the main lib directory come first on the RAYPATH the way  \nyou have it set up, you should be ok, but II just thought I'd point  \nit out.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004278.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 05, 2007 at 02:53PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004274", "id": "radiance-general_004278"}
