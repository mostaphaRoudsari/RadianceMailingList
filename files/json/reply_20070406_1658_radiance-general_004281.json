I tried to describe how such a \nconfiguration can be used to get code executed with your user rights. \nThis can still cause trouble. And as it is not necessary at all to have \n./ in a PATH, I added this comment to you posted setting.\n\n\n>  *.lum *.vf *.norm *.vp etc..\n\n\nI have to guess as I do not have te possibility to check this right now. \nlum should be luminaires (in in whatever format, open with a text \neditor, might be IES pr radiance), vf is a viewfile, norm is something I \ndo not know now, and vp should be viewpoints, most probably for an \nanimation.\n\n\n>  any link to a consise descriptions of these files would be of help\n>  because running the *.rif I found in the lib folder generate errors\n>  from missing files or includes.\n\n\nThis sound much more like you are still having a problem with the \nenvironment variables. Can you post te errors you get?\n\n\nGood luck ;-) Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004281.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
