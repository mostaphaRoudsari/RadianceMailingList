{"body": "Hi Steve,\n\n\ncongratulations, you passed the gate into the wonderful world of our\nfavourite time- and cpu-cycle consuming application...\n\n\nThe spotlight is a native light, but I guess you want to use a\nphotometric representation of a real-world light source.\n\n\n1) Choose a source, and get the distribution from the manufacturer. You\nshould get a IES-formatted file.\n\n\n2) Generate a radiance description from that file using ies2rad:\n\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ies2rad.1.html\n\n\n3) Include that description instead of the spotlights (keep orientation\nand position, and use !xform to include the source.\n\n\nThe procedure is described in detail in the tutorial that came with your\nRadiance installation. And a great help are the tutorial from\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml !\n\n\nGood luck, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004283.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
