It will contain a list of !xform commands with the \nlocations of luminaires.\n\n\nYou can post your next questions relating to brad to the\nbrad mailing list:\n\n\nhttp://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/brad\n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0\n\n\nCiao,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004284.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "April 07, 2007 at 07:44PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004274", "id": "radiance-general_004284"}
