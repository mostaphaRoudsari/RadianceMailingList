A small\npart of my memory says glow materials are never considered\nin indirect calculations. So your '-ae' will have no effect\non the glow material.\n\n\n\n\n> The scene is listed below.

If you render it with only one\nbounce all faces that are not in direct view of the light source\n_only_ get light from the sky. That's what you can see.\n\n\nYou can try to add a limiting radius to your glow definition\n(forth argument). I think a value of 0 means that the glow\nhas an infinite range (or none at all? - the old doc I have is unclear\nabout that). If you set it to something small like 0.1 it might\nlimit its effect. But I don't know how this works when the glow\nis applied to a source which has no measurable distance to the scene.\n\n\nI assume all you want is to render the object on top of a red\nbackground, right? In that case you could try to render the\nobject _without_ sky which gives you a black background (use\n'-av' to avoid black faces on the object). Then use pcomb to\ncolour all pixels with a value of 0 red. See the 'stencil' thread\nof a few weeks ago for an idea how this might work.\n\n\n\n\nReport any success!\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004286.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 12, 2007 at 12:29AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004285", "id": "radiance-general_004286"}
