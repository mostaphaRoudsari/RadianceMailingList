{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nMy previous message about the loss of mapping coordinates - sometimes - \nusing  Xfrog's obj export was wrong. The reason I jumped into that \nconclusion is related to different (and probably modified) Radiance \ninstallations on different renderingmachines. As far as I can judge now, \nboth obj and 3ds work fine. So there is no need to re-calculate tangent \nvectors, as you suggested.\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004288.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "April 12, 2007 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004260", "id": "radiance-general_004288"}
