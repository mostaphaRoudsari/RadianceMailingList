{"body": "> I cannot compile, and it seams that in the Version.c file everything but\n> the variable content is gone...?\n\n\nI am still having the same problem with today's head when trying to\ncompile on Solaris with gcc. The file rt/Version.c contains only the\nvalue, not the variable. char VersionID[]=\" is simply missing. I am\nediting the file by hand now, but this is a bug in Solaris builds.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-April/000769.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
