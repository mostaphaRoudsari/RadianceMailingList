{"body": "Hi Rob,\nThank you for your suggestion.\nI tried something like that before, and encountered an interesting  \nartifact (well maybe not so interesting).\nI have a perfectly specular object illuminated by a light probe. In a  \nsecond image I used the same shape but made the object glow  \n(material) and the environment black - This created something like a  \nmask. Then I wrote a small program which picks all the non-black  \npixels in the mask and replaces them with the content from the first  \n(specular) image.\nTo my surprise these shapes never matched up perfectly, the mask  \ncreated with the non-specular material was always a few pixels bigger  \nthan the specular shape, as a result there were always a few  \nbackground pixels selected. I tried other materials in combination  \nwith different lights(ambient etc) - always encountering the same  \nproblem.\n\n\nkatja\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004295.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Katja Doerschner", "created_at": "April 19, 2007 at 10:14PM", "created_by": "Katja_Doerschner", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004291", "id": "radiance-general_004295"}
