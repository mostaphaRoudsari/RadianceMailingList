{"body": "Hi Frank,\n\n\nThe transdata function will allow you to specify an arbitrary BRDF on  \na surface, but it won't necessarily do what you want unless you use  \nthe photon-mapping add-on by Roland Schregle.  I plan to work on a  \nmodule that will create \"window sources\" similar to mkillum given  \nmeasured BTDF data, but this won't be ready for some months.\n\n\nI realize this isn't much help, but I'm afraid the options are  \ncurrently somewhat limited.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004300.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 20, 2007 at 11:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004299", "id": "radiance-general_004300"}
