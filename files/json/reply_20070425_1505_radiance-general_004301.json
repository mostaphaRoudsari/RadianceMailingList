{"body": "Hi Greg, Thanks for the reply.\n\n\nI found the Photon Map Manual here http://www.cb-d.de/rz/pmap.pdf and it \nsays on page 5 that transdata is not a supported type of material \"due to \nthe high sampling overhead in conjunction with the photon map. A wavelet \nrepresentation is being developed for these. (But don't hold your \nbreath...)\"\n\n\nIs there any other possible solution?\n\n\nFrank\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004301.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Frank Holly", "created_at": "April 25, 2007 at 03:05PM", "created_by": "Frank_Holly", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004299", "id": "radiance-general_004301"}
