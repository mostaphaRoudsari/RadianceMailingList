Then you also have to generally create some glow polygons \nwithin the fixture geometry to make the geometry appear correct (the \nglow will not be evaluated beyond the illum boundary so you won't affect \nthe distribution of the fixture on the scene).  I would say it's not \nstraightforward, but the procedure is outlined in Charles Ehrlich's \nchapter of Rendering with Radiance. The process is very much streamlined \nwhen you use Georg Mischler's Rayfront interface.  Personally, I am \nusually interested in the calculation result from electric light \nsources, so I tend to just use the simple geometry that ies2rad creates \nfor me.  But the visual result of going the distance and actually \nsetting up the whole illum enclosure can be fantastic.  I have very \nlimited experience with this, but I hope others will chime in here with \nsome tips.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004303.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 25, 2007 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004302", "id": "radiance-general_004303"}
