The sphere ends up so big you \nintroduce inaccuracies.  So those cal files lboxcorr and flatcorr take \nthe ies2rad .dat output -- which is essentially a point distribution -- \nand wraps it around more apporpriate geometry: a box in the case of \nlboxcorr, (for a linear pendant fixture) and a flat rectangular polygon \nin the case of flatcorr (for say a recessed fixture where the luminous \naperture is a single plane).\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004305.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 26, 2007 at 05:31PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004304", "id": "radiance-general_004305"}
