Try '-ab 3'\nor more and see if you get a better result.\n\n\nI hope someone else can help with the prism definition.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004313.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 29, 2007 at 11:56PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004312", "id": "radiance-general_004313"}
