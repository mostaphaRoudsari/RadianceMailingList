{"body": "Hi Charudatta,\n\n\nI'm afraid I can't be of much help, either.  I didn't write the  \nfprism routine and I haven't even tested them recently -- can anyone  \non the list confirm that they are still working in the latest  \nrelease?  I hope so.\n\n\nJust glancing at your file, the length values seem suspiciously  \nsmall.  Also, your angle of acceptance for source aiming (pi radians)  \nis larger than it should be -- perhaps you put this in there for  \ntesting?  What is your reference for which lengths correspond to the  \nfirst four parameters (A1 to A4)?  Also, which face is \"beta\" and  \nwhich is \"gamma?\"  I'm not certain.\n\n\nAny help is appreciated.  (Rapha\u00ebl?)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004314.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 30, 2007 at 02:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004312", "id": "radiance-general_004314"}
