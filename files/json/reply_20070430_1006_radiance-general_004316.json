The picture also shows the naming scheme used for the prism faces (alpha, beta and gamma).\n\n\nIn your scene file, you should decrease parameter A10 to 0.002 (this is the value I always used).

I am having problems with \"prism2\" while trying to render an interior scene with a prism as a skylight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a room 7.85m x 5.85m, 3.0m in height with a rectangular skylight 2.8m x 2.9m in the centre of the ceiling (I have attached with this email the .rad file of the prism I made). I am trying to study impact of prism as skylight on this interior environment, which is meant to be an artist's studio. Please tell me the correct procedure of using prism2 correctly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\tThe opaque face of the prism faces South while transparent face is on North. My rendered image with the prism comes out as dark without any diffused light from North. Why is it so? \n2.\tTo get values of A1, A2, A3, A4, I created the geometry in AutoCAD and measured these values there. Is this a good way of doing this? Or do you suggest some other way? \n3.\tIf I do it correctly, would I be able to see the prism in the rendered image?\n4.\tCan you send me any sample prism.rad file to understand better? Please mention the orientation of the prism and its geometry angles.\n\n\nHere's how I have been doing after editing the .rad files:\n\n\n*\toconv phxsky.rad > phxsky.oct \n*\tmkillum -ab 1 -ad 256 -av 20.7 20.7 20.7 phxsky.oct < mout.rad > iout.rad \n*\toconv flr.rad clg.rad wall.rad sill.rad glass.rad prism.rad phxsky.rad iout.rad > octree1 \n*\trview -vp .1 3 1.7 -vd 7.35 0 0 -vv 78 -vh 90 -ps 1 -ds .05 -ab 1 -ad 256 -av .001 .001 .001 -as 256 -ar 256 -dj .05 octree1\n\n\nI sincerely appreciate your timely help.\n\n\n\n\nWarm regards,\n\n\nCharudatta Joshi (CJ)\nStudent, MS-Building Design, ASU\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004316.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "April 30, 2007 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004312", "id": "radiance-general_004316"}
