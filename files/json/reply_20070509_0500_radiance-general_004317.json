{"body": "Greetings,\n\n\nI've finally made the plunge from running Radiance in Linux on a PC to \nOSX, never thought I'd see the day!  I compiled Radiance using the OSX \nbinaries and all seemed well until using the \"rad\" program with an illum \nsource in the \"rif\" file.  Once mkillum finishes and rpict kicks in I \nget the following rpict error:\n\n\nrpict: fatal - cannot find data file \"illum12.dat\"\n\n\nThe odd thing is that the illum12.dat file was created and is in the \ndirectory.\nThanks ahead for any insight / advice.\n\n\nChris Humann\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004317.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "May 09, 2007 at 05:00AM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004318", "id": "radiance-general_004317"}
