{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for your quick response. Yes, in my conversion to OSX I'd \nforgotten that I was now working with bash and hence had a space in the \npath statement where it should not have been.  Back to basics 101.  \nThanks again.\n\n\nBest regards,\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Chris,\n\n\nThis sounds like a RAYPATH issue.  What do you get when you type \"echo \n$RAYPATH\"?  I'm guessing you don't have '.' in the path for some \nreason.  Either that, or the directory you're in doesn't have the right \npermissions.  (Though I would expect an earlier error in that case.)  \nWhat do you get when you type \"ls -l illum12.dat\"?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004321.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "May 09, 2007 at 07:40PM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004318", "id": "radiance-general_004321"}
