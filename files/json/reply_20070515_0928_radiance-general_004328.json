I was already thinking about \nputting an illum under the dome to achieve some smoothing, which would \nbe more or less faked of course.\n\n\nThanks for the reply, I will keep you informed of any results...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004328.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
