{"body": "c\n\n\nHi,\n\n\nI am just getting started with Radiance and i am attempting to find a\nworkflow which allows the rendering of geometry generated within 3D Studio\nMax in Radiance. With my limited expertise the only way in which i can see\nof doing this is to export to Wavefront object .obj from 3DS and then use\nthe obj2rad radiance tool.\n\n\nThe problem with this approach is that the .rad file which is generated by\nobj2rad does not appear the same as those that i have used before. When i\ntry to render these .rad files oconv reports that the beginning of each of\nthe lines begins with an undefined moodifier.\n\n\nWhen i used the resultant octree file in rview it reported a fatal error\n\n\n\"./rview: fatal - (pot.oct): truncated octree\"\n\n\nAny help that you might be able to offer would be very welcome.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nGareth Beale\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004329.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gareth Beale", "created_at": "May 15, 2007 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Gareth_Beale", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004331", "id": "radiance-general_004329"}
