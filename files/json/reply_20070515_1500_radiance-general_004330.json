{"body": "Hi Gareth,\n\n\nIt sound's like you need to define materials for your geometry. Obj2rad \nwill convert the obj format geometry to radiance format geometry. It \nwill not convert material definitions. To see what materials need to be \ndefined do the following:\n\n\n    obj2rad -n my_geometry.obj > my_geometry.data\n\n\nThe -n switch will set obj2rad to only output material related names \nthat are used by the obj geometry. You should look for the names between \nthe following section:\n\n\n    qualifier Material begin\n    ....\n    end\n\n\nYou can ignore the other sections. These are the names of the materials \nbeing used by the geometry. You will need to define them in a radiance \nmaterial file, for example, if you have a material named: glazing, you \nwould then need to define a material in radiance with the same name:\n\n\n    void glass glazing\n    0\n    0\n    3 .7 .7 .7\n\n\nThis file would then be included before the geometry files when \ncompiling the scene:\n\n\n    oconv my_materials.rad my_geometry.rad > my_scene.oct\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004330.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 15, 2007 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004331", "id": "radiance-general_004330"}
