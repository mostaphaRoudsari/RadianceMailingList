{"body": "Hi Rob!\n\n\n> I believe the latest iteration of pmap is the module Carsten integrated\n> with his Radzilla, yes.  Haven't heard from Roland in a while...\n\n\nI found that there is even no pmap for 3.8? The learnix-distribution\nmentions that pmap is not supported any more in their radiance set-up\nand available only in radzilla (which is in learnix). Seams that I will\nhave to get radzilla on my Mac (used to be difficult because of QT).\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004335.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
