{"body": "Hi Ignacio,\n\n\nBecause the normal smoothing doesn't affect the underlying geometry,  \nside shading such as shown in your image can exhibit unexpected  \nbehavior, where the actual shape of the surfaces determines the  \nshadows.  Some scanline-based renderers are able to compensate for  \nthis with specialized algorithms, but it's almost impossible to avoid  \nin a ray-tracing system.  You need to create a finer mesh to  \nameliorate the problem, though you'll never be able to eliminate it  \nentirely.  The only way to do that is to have the correct geometry to  \nbegin with -- i.e., by using a sphere in this case.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004356.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 25, 2007 at 01:55PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004355", "id": "radiance-general_004356"}
