Are you sure you did not get confused with \nunits somewhere? It is hard to debug a scene we do not know, maybe you \ncould describe the setup or even put a sketch to some public ftp or website?\n\n\nGood luck, and I always thought that man mad(1) should be a redirect to \nman rpic(1) ;-) CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
