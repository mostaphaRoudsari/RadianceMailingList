{"body": "Hi ChenGuang,\n\n\nThis is a nice illustration of the problem.  If you rendered these  \nwith rvu, I wouldn't expect the pixels to match exactly, since the  \nactual point rendered is randomly chosen from within each region, and  \nusing the default parameters of rvu, radiances are only accurate to  \nwithin 15% (see the -pt setting from \"rvu -defaults\").  This is to  \nincrease rendering speed.  To avoid sampling discrepancies, you  \nshould use rpict instead with the following settings:\n\n\n\trpict -ps 1 -pj 0 -dt 0 -sj 0\n\n\nEven so, your pixels will only match within 1%, due to round-off  \nerrors in the pixel encoding itself.  To get better accuracy, you  \nwill have to use rtrace.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004363.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 30, 2007 at 08:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004362", "id": "radiance-general_004363"}
