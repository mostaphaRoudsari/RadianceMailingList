{"body": "Hi Terry,\n\n\nIn brief you need to add a multiplier for the aspect ratio (<ar>) of the \nimage to one or the other of frac(U) or frac(V).\n\n\n    void colorpict image_data_Concrete_Form_4x8\n    9 red green blue textures/Concrete.pic . frac(U) frac(V)*<ar> -s 1219\n    0\n    0\n\n\nFor further explanation you can refer to the following two posts, one \nfrom Giulio Antonutto and the other from me. Both of these deal with \nLu/Lv coordinate mapping as opposed to UV coordinate mapping. But I \nthink that they should still work.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nRE: [Radiance-general] OBJ2MESH - UV Scale and Shift\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-June/004366.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "June 01, 2007 at 06:15PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004365", "id": "radiance-general_004366"}
