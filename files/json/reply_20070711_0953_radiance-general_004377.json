{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nIf you copy the glaze2.cal script and rename it \"glaze3.cal\", adding  \nthe following lines to the end of the file:\n\n\n                                 { simple triple-pane reflectance }\ncr3(r,t) :  r*(1 + t*t*(1 + t*t));\n\n\n\n\nYour glazing definition is then:\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze3_unnamed\n10\ncr3(fr(0.074),ft(0.91))\ncr3(fr(0.074),ft(0.91))\ncr3(fr(0.074),ft(0.91))\nft(0.91)^3\nft(0.91)^3\nft(0.91)^3\n         0 0 0\n         glaze3.cal\n0\n9\n         0 0 0\n         0 0 0\n         0 0 0\n\n\nWe probably should add a third glazing to the glaze.csh script, but  \nit would complicate it by an order of magnitude due to the number of  \ncombinations involved.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004377.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 11, 2007 at 09:53AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004376", "id": "radiance-general_004377"}
