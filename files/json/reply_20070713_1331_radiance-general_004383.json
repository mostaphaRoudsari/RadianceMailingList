{"body": "Simulating Venetian Blinds takes a lot of time if you are using 'pure'\nRadiance but it is possible. See e.g.:Reinhart C F, Walkenhorst O,\n\"Dynamic RADIANCE-based daylight simulations for a full-scale test\noffice with outer venetian blinds.\" Energy & Buildings, 33:7 pp.\n683-697, 2001.\n\n\nIncidentally, for those of you interested, we have developed a new\ndaylight coefficient approach where you can simulate a space without\nblinds and then multiply your resulting daylight coefficients with a\ncorrection matrix to account for blinds. A rudimentary description of\nthe method can be downloaded from:\nhttp://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p461v1.pdf\n<http://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p461v1.pdf>  \n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004383.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "July 13, 2007 at 01:31PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004380", "id": "radiance-general_004383"}
