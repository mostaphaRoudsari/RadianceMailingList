Gensky expects values for the visible \ncomponent only, however I'm assuming the TMY data is for the full \nspectrum of light and, as such, must have an appropriate luminous \nefficacy factor applied to it to.  Is this correct? \n\n\nAlso, I gather that the Gendaylit program will take the weather data as \ninput, however I've been unable to find an active link to the program \nfor downloading. Does anyone have a link for this?  Thanks in advance \nfor any help.\n\n\nChris Humann\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004385.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "July 17, 2007 at 12:47AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004384", "id": "radiance-general_004385"}
