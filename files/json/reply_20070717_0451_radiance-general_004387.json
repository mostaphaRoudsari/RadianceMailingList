{"body": "Chris,\n\n\nBe wary that gendaylit can produce skies with massive distortions  \n(e.g. huge -ve luminance cusps at low altitude) for certain  \ncombinations of direct, diffuse and solar altitude.  The absolute  \nvalues for these tend to be uninteresting for daylight provision  \n(i.e. on the low side), but they could foul-up an automated procedure  \nand/or bias output if they are not picked up.  The distortion  \noccurred in routine application of UK climate datasets, and I believe  \nit has been noted with use of other climate files.  Note that, when  \nit occurs, the normalisation to diffuse horizontal is still correct  \n-- so you can't test for it by comparing predicted diffuse horizontal  \nwith the corresponding value from the climate file.  However,  \npredictions for vertical illuminances (or light through a window)  \ncould be way out.  The only safe way to test is to send out a  \nhemisphere of rays to the sky and check for any returned -ve  \nluminances (replace these instances with CIE overcast).\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004387.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "July 17, 2007 at 04:51AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004384", "id": "radiance-general_004387"}
