{"body": "Hi Derek,\n\n\nI didn't see any responses to this query, so I guess it fell through  \nthe cracks.  Sorry about that.  Some quick, feeble answers:\n\n\n1.  Certain frits will transmit diffuse light, though imperfectly.   \nNote that an ideal diffuser will transmit 50% of the light and  \nreflect the other 50%.  To transmit more than 50% of the light, you  \nwill necessarily deviate from a Lambertian (diffuse) distribution.\n\n\n2.  If you choose a dense enough frit for Lambertian diffusion, then  \na diffuse transmission/reflection model will suffice by definition.   \nA reasonable diffuse transmission to expect is around 40% for a good  \nquality frit, and about the same for refleciton.\n\n\n3.  You will run into problems if you don't use the mkillum command  \nand manually identify your sources.  See the basic tutorials in  \n\"Rendering with Radiance\" on appropriate application.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004390.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 23, 2007 at 08:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004378", "id": "radiance-general_004390"}
