If you use ACIS solids, you can use 3DSOUT (in \nAutoCAD) to export a polygonal model, then bring it back in with 3DSIN, \nthen back out with DXFOUT, then use dxf2rad to convert the geometry to a \nradiance scene description.  A bit circuitous, but it would work.\n\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-August/004412.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 16, 2007 at 08:52AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004410", "id": "radiance-general_004412"}
