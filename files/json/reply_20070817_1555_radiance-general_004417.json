{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\n> This is great, Francesco!  Did I miss a meeting, or did you just set \n> this up??

Great job! \n\n\nI think that the idea of a collaborative effort to put together the\nRadiance documentation has been now around for quite a while, and\nbriefly discussed during the past workshop.\nI just thought it is about time to start working on it ... \nHave you tried to register your account? ;-)\n\n\n> Is the graphic on the masthead a close-up of one of Mark Stock's cool \n> renderings, or is that something you did yourself?\n\n\nAs your eye has already suggested, it is largely inspired by Mark's\nmagnificent work, but it is only one of my naive attempts, I'm afraid \n:-/ \nIt would be nice if each page had some pictures of random Radiance \nartwork, any volunteers?\n\n\nAmong the others ideas discussed, there was the possibility to formalise\nour community by starting a \"Radiance foundation\" (\u00e0 la Apache\nhttp://www.apache.org/ for example), that is a non-profit/charity\norganisation that organises and manages Radiance related projects \n(like further development, setting up a wiki, writing documentation, \norganising workshops and so on ...) and can receive donations:\nhttp://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/SustainableOpenSource\n\n\nBut this is a different story ...\n\n\nCiao!\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-August/004417.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "August 17, 2007 at 03:55PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004415", "id": "radiance-general_004417"}
