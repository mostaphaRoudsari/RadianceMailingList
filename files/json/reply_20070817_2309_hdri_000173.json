{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nMost people use a false color representation to look at luminance  \nvalues.  Assuming you have Radiance installed, the command looks like  \nso:\n\n\n\t% falsecolor -i render.pic -s auto \\\n\t\t| ra_tiff -z - render_fc.tif\n\n\nIf you have Photosphere, you can use the Command-N sequence to get a  \nfalse color display.  Regrettably, it won't save out with the legend  \n(scale).\n\n\nIf you want to look at the values directly, the pvalue command will  \ngive you radiances, which you can convert to luminance using the  \nappropriate efficacy value, e.g.:\n\n\n\t% pvalue -h -H -b render.pic \\\n\t\t| rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=179*$3'\n\n\nThe first and second columns in the output are the x and y pixel  \npositions, measured from the lower-left corner of the image.\n\n\nI was curious to see what a 3-D rendering would look like, so I used  \nthe command:\n\n\n\t% pvalue -h -H -b -d render.pic \\\n\t\t| gensurf void picsurf t s - 254 172 -o \\\n\t\t| obj2mesh > render.rtm\n\n\nThe 254 and 172 values are the horizontal and vertical dimensions of  \nmy example image, respectively.  I then used objview to render the  \nfollowing Radiance file:\n\n\nvoid plastic grey\n0\n0\n5 .5 .5 .5 0 0\n\n\ngrey mesh picsurf\n1 picsurf.rtm\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nThis produced a rather bland result, so I added a pattern  \ncorresponding to the output of falsecolor:\n\n\nvoid colorpict colorful\n7 red green blue electric_x1y1fc.pic . 1.47398844*Py 1-Px\n0\n0\n\n\ncolorful plastic colored\n0\n0\n5 .5 .5 .5 0 0\n\n\ncolored mesh picsurf\n1 picsurf.rtm\n0\n0\n\n\nThe 1.47398844 value is 254/172, as needed to fit the image into my  \nsquare area.  In retrospect, I probably should have used a wider base  \nin the gensurf command to get a rectangular plot.  I can send anyone  \nwho wants to see the images I generated.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2007-August/000173.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 17, 2007 at 11:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000172", "id": "hdri_000173"}
