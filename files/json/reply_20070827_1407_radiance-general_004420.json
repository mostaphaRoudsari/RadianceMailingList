{"body": "Hi Yu,\n\n\nTry starting from here:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n5.1.html#BRDF\n\n\nUnfortunately, Radiance does not compute indirect lighting through  \nBRDF materials except for the direct component.  I am working on a  \nspecialty program, similar to mkillum, to handle cases where a BSDF  \nmaterial covers a window or skylight opening, but that is months away  \nfrom completion.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-August/004420.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 27, 2007 at 02:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004419", "id": "radiance-general_004420"}
