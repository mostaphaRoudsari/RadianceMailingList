{"body": "Hi Patrick,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you put your grid points in a file called 'grid.pts' you can use the\nfollowing rcalc command to generate a file containing a series of\ndirections from the observer point to each grid point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrcalc -e '$1=2;$2=0;$3=5;$4=$1-2;$5=$2-0;$6=$3-1.5' grid.pts >\ndirections.pts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen use rtrace as normal to calculate the luminance values using the\nfile directions.pts. Ore more simply you could pipe the results of rcalc\ndirectly to rtrace like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrcalc -e '$1=2;$2=0;$3=5;$4=$1-2;$5=$2-0;$6=$3-1.5' grid.pts | rtrace\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, your points need to be entered in the grid.pts without\ncommas or parenthesis like this:\n\n\n0 1 0\n\n\n0 2 0\n\n\n1 1 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope that's helpful,\n\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-September/004428.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "September 07, 2007 at 03:02AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004425", "id": "radiance-general_004428"}
