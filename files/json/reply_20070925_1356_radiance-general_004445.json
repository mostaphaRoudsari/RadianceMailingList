In the man page  \nit says:\n\n\n\"The light source geometry will  always  be centered  at  the  origin  \naimed\nin the negative z direction, with the 0 degree plane along the x axis.\"\n\n\nThis is fine for luminaires as they usually have their highest output in\nnegative z direction ('down') but define this in the IES file as 0  \ndegree\nvertical angle (the vertical angles start pointing down and then go up).\nIn your case ies2rad might simply have turned the z-axis around so  \nthat your\n+z is now pointing down.\n\n\nIf you use replmarks to place your windows you have to define the longer\naxis as x and the sorter will be y. This is just how replmarks works and\nis independent of source.cal.\n\n\nI used to check the Radiance renderings of luminaire files against a  \nrendering\nof another application like Dialux or Relux just to check if I did  \nthe placement\nand rotation of the IES file right.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-September/004445.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 25, 2007 at 01:56PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004443", "id": "radiance-general_004445"}
