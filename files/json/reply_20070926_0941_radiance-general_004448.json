{"body": "Thanks for your response Thomas.  I still think IES2rad is reading files differently than the standard (clockwise and with 0 as +y).  \n\n\nI did figure out the Type B photometry issue, seems this is only a problem within Rayfront.  Using IES2rad outside of Rayfront does not have a problem, my apologies.  Everything else shown was also done outside of Rayfront as I was wanting to eliminate this from the equation.\n\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\nZack Rogers, P.E., IESNA, LEED AP\nDaylighting Analysis Group Leader\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext. 435\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-September/004448.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "September 26, 2007 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004443", "id": "radiance-general_004448"}
