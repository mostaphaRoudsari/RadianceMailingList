{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nit works great! The only thing I'd like to propose is to make an own \nsearch option for the mailing lists' archives. For every term you get \nml-posts on the first hits. Something like google's group search may be \nappropriate for this to distinguish between ml and web ressources. A \nsimple exclude of the mailing lists' archives would be fine for the web \nsearch, an exclusive search in the archive pages for mailing list search \nwould complete that. So what I would like to see is two tabs - one for \nthe list, one for web ressources and the rest.\n\n\nThank You!!!\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-October/000780.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
