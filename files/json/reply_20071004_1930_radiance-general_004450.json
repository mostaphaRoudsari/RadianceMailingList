{"body": "Hi Zack,\n\n\nSorry for the late response, but as I mentioned at the workshop, I  \nwas out of the country.\n\n\nHave a look at the following change, made back in 4/93:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/cv/ \nsource.cal.diff?r1=2.5&r2=2.6\n\n\nWhen you say that Type C photometry is measured in the counter- \nclockwise direction, do you mean as seen from below (looking in the  \npositive-Z direction)?  If so, then the comment at the top of  \nsource.cal is correct, but it looks like I messed up on the actual  \ndefinition of phi, which should be:\n\n\n\tsrc_phi = mod( atan2(-Dy, Dx) / DEGREE, 360 );  { 0-360 }\n\n\nrather than what it is, now.  I'm really confused, because this is  \neffectively what I had before I made the \"correction,\" since I also  \nhad a -my transform prior to 4/93.  I don't know where my copy of  \nLM-63 is, if I even still have it, so if the above line works for  \nyou, perhaps I should just change source.cal to agree with its  \ncomment...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004450.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 04, 2007 at 07:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004443", "id": "radiance-general_004450"}
