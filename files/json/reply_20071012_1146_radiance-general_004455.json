{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nI've just been flicking through the presentations of this year's\nworkshop, and I get the impression you did had a lot of fun. Dancing\nand all...\n\n\nExcuse me if I overlooked it, but I could not find a URL for Yu\nSheng's software. Sounds interesting enough to give it a try. I\nparticularly liked that LINUX is one of the supported platforms.\nThat's quite a rarity these days, with all the 'serious' guys (unlike\nme) hacking their Radiance-add-ons on Windoze or MacOS...\n\n\nIf you are into statistics, you will have noticed that the sheer\namount of information/knowledge/wisdom delivered at this year's\nworkshop has reached new heights. The largest presentation tops\n120MB!!! I certainly would have struggled with the intake of so much\nwisdom at such a short amount of time.\n\n\nFulling knowing that I will be stepping on people's toes, I would like\nto point out the rogue (un-official) European mirror of workshop\npresentations. If you are located in Europe, you might save a few\ntrees here and there\nhttp://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/27/2157230\nby using:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_workshops/\nThe speed might not exactly make you dizzy. Our network guys are\nrather consistent in messing things up. Depends on the moon, I guess.\nI'm afraid it's out outside of my control.\n\n\nBackground info:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000741.html\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004455.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "October 12, 2007 at 11:46AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004429", "id": "radiance-general_004455"}
