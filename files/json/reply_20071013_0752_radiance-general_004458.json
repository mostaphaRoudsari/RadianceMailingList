{"body": "Hi Xian,\n\n\nActually dirt.cal uses the fractal noise function: fnoise3(x,y,z). The \nPerlin noise function is noise3(x,y,z). You can look in dirt.cal to see \nhow the function is used there and in rayinit.cal for library functions \nthat are available. There are also additional functions: noise3x(x,y,z), \nnoise3y(x,y,z) and noise3z(x,y,z). As I understand from RwR these \nrepresent the partial derivative of the Perlin noise function at the \npoint (see RwR page 253).\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004458.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 13, 2007 at 07:52AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004457", "id": "radiance-general_004458"}
