{"body": "Hi Xian,\n\n\nJack is correct.  If you want the noise to appear different in  \nsubsequent images, you must alter your scene description.  Probably  \nthe easiest is to add some transform to the material, like so:\n\n\nvoid brightfunc random_dirt\n10 dirt dirt.cal -t ${rand_x} ${rand_y} ${rand_z} -rx ${rand_rx} -ry $ \n{rand_ry}\n0\n1 0.5\n\n\nI am assuming an \"A1\" parameter of 0.5, but use whatever you like.   \nThe above data may be passed in a file (say \"dirt.fmt\") to rcalc and  \ninserted in your scene like so:\n\n\n!date +%s | rcalc -e 'seed=$1/1000 - 1192290' \\\n\t-e 'rand_x=3000*rand(seed*1.901+3817)' \\\n\t-e 'rand_y=3000*rand(seed*-1.627-592)' \\\n\t-e 'rand_z=3000*rand(seed*9.67-5824)' \\\n\t-e 'rand_rx=180*rand(seed*2.083+964)' \\\n\t-e 'rand_ry=360*rand(seed*4.813+371)' -o dirt.fmt\n\n\nrandom_dirt plastic my_plastic\n(etc.)\n\n\nSince \"date +%s\" outputs a different number of seconds every time you  \nrun it, this should give you a new transform unrelated to the last  \none every time -- as long as you don't run them less than a second  \napart.\n\n\nWhy do you want to do this, out of curiosity?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004459.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 13, 2007 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004457", "id": "radiance-general_004459"}
