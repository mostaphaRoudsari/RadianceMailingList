{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nWell at least I was on the right track as I had recommended something \nsimilar to Xian (transforms on the noise). (I guess this was offline \nthough as I just hit reply.) I could not figure out how to generate a \nrandom value like this, so I was recommending that something could be \nscripted where random values could be generated with some other \nscripting language. This is much more elegant as it keeps it all \n(relatively) native and in-line to boot.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004460.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 13, 2007 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004457", "id": "radiance-general_004460"}
