{"body": "Hello All,\n\n\nI have been using trad with my undergraduate students for a number of years.\nLast used with the KNOPPIX_V5.1.1CD-2007-01-04-EN.iso (debian) and built\nwith the makeall script. Worked fine no issues.\n\n\nWould be sad not to see it in there as it is very valuable in weening the\nfancy gui/mouse generation into serious software.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004473.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance Mc Minn", "created_at": "October 14, 2007 at 06:48PM", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004471", "id": "radiance-general_004473"}
