{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n> I have been using trad with my undergraduate students for a number of years.\n> Last used with the KNOPPIX_V5.1.1CD-2007-01-04-EN.iso (debian) and built\n> with the makeall script. Worked fine no issues.\n\n\nshould be easy to provide a Debian live CD with radiance. I'll look into\nthat once radiance is migrated to testing, and all bugs/wishes/... are\nfixed.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004474.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "October 14, 2007 at 11:47PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004471", "id": "radiance-general_004474"}
