I could even ship a script to add links to /usr/local/bin for\ngenbox and rview.\n\n\n\n\n> Asking that packages not have any name collisions is a laudable but not\n> terribly realistic goal.

No?\n\n\nThat was the first name clash since a longer time I've seen (and shame\non me, I should have checked that before). Radiance ships so many utils\nthat it is much more prone to such problems than packages shipping only\none tool. I think in general using a common prefix for utils of one type\nare very useful and common to avoid such problems, like k*/g* for\nkde/gnome tools. Also our tech-ctte is pretty strict if people try to\nuse too generic names. For example packages like libcommon or libconfig\nprobably won't be accepted at all in Debian.\n\n\n\n\n> If we aren't even allowed a symbolic link, one dastardly work-around is\n> to add a check for the \"genbox\" command when parsing scene input,\n> substituting \"genrbox\" and printing a warning of its deprecation.
