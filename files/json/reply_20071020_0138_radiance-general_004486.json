Would that work with Debian standards?\n\n\n/usr/lib/radiance/bin would work fine, too.\n\n\nAlthough I can't install the manpage to the proper place then.\nAlso I'm not sure if it makes sense to have some of the tools in\n/usr/bin and others at some other place. Not having them in $PATH is\nsomething I'd call annoying, too.\n\n\nI'm more in favor of leaving all executable programs somewhere in $PATH,\nas this is what a new user of radiance would expect - and I'm sure\nradiance will attract more users when it is distributed with Debian,\nwhich also means it'll be distributed with Ubuntu at some day. Working\naround the renamed binary is not very hard, in the worst case it means\nto create a symbolic link.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004486.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "October 20, 2007 at 01:38AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004471", "id": "radiance-general_004486"}
