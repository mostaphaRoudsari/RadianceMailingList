{"body": "Hi Bernd,\n\n\nOn closer inspection, my thought to check for \"genbox\" on inline  \ncommands and print a deprecated warning isn't all that workable,  \nsince there are so many places in Radiance where inline commands are  \ninterpreted.  It would require a lot of ugly and temporary code  \nchanges.  A better solution is to insert a \"genbox\" shell script that  \nprints out the deprecated message before calling \"genrbox.\"  However,  \nthis still leaves an executable in the Radiance binary directory with  \nthe \"genbox\" name conflict, at least temporarily.  Unceremoniously  \ngetting rid of genbox altogether would break 3/4 of the scene files  \nout there.  This is not just a command entered by users -- it's in  \nall our scene descriptions, and changing it means changing thousands  \nof user files.  Even if it's only a simple substitution, that's a lot  \nto ask for everyone to go in and change their data to accommodate a  \nmolecular modeling system that in all likelihood hasn't yet caused a  \nconflict for any of us.\n\n\nI'm out of ideas.  Anyone else with a brainstorm on this?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004491.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 22, 2007 at 01:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004471", "id": "radiance-general_004491"}
