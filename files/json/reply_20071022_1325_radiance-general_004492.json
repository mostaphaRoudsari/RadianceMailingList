{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> On closer inspection, my thought to check for \"genbox\" on inline\n> commands and print a deprecated warning isn't all that workable, since\n> there are so many places in Radiance where inline commands are\n> interpreted.

Anyone else with a brainstorm on this?\n\n\nQuestion: Do the tools search in $RAYPATH for executables, too?\n\n\nOne idea: While installing the package I could ask the user if he'd like\nto have compatibility links created and add those links. I'd have to\ncheck if something like that would be allowed by the policy, though.\nAt least I can warn them.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004492.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "October 22, 2007 at 01:25PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004471", "id": "radiance-general_004492"}
