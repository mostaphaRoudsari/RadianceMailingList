{"body": "Hi Bernd,\n\n\nI'm moving this discussion to radiance-dev, since that's where it  \nreally belongs.  (Feel free to subscribe if you aren't.)\n\n\nHaving compatibility links as an option during installation is fine  \nwith me if it defaults to \"yes\" or provides a clear explanation of  \nthe pitfalls of not installing the links.  I guess we only need a  \nlink for genbox at this point, though I would like to keep \"rview\" in  \nthere as well for consistency with extant documentation.\n\n\nNone of the tools look in the $RAYPATH directories for executables,  \nand I don't store any there.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004493.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 22, 2007 at 02:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004471", "id": "radiance-general_004493"}
