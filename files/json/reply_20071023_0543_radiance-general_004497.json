{"body": "Hi Tom,\n\n\nOne workflow option, much as I dislike suggesting it, is perhaps to use \nSketchup as an intermediate. It looks like Vectorworks will save out an \nskp. Sketchup (commercial version) can then save out an obj format file, \nwhich can be converted with obj2rad. I have very limited experience with \nSketchup, but in my few experiences, I have found that the models are \nvery very hefty. Another alternative is to save out as 3ds and use \n3ds2rad, however there are limitations to this dealing with data sizing \nfor the file format.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nTom Young wrote:\n> hi Erwin\n>\n>  i can't make anything useful out of the linux binary for mac osx so \n> far as I can see\n>\n> i'm using Vectorworks\n>\n> i don't think there can be a route from Vectorworks to a rad file.\n>\n> i assume the way to go is to make a dxf file of a Vectorworks model\n>\n> if you have a dxf converter which would work on a mac, that would be \n> terrific !\n>\n> is it a command line utility ?\n>\n> tom\n>\n>\n> On 23 Oct 2007, at 12:53, Erwin Zierler wrote:\n>\n>> Tom,\n>> if you ar refering to Gerog Mischlers dxf2rad I am afraid you are out \n>> of luck.
