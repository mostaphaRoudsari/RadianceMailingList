{"body": "Hi Tom,\n\n\nI have a dxf2rad version available that we have developped for in-house \nuse.\nWe use it almost every day on Linux.\nIt should compile under osx also. Just dowload the files and run\n# gcc -o dxfimport dxfimport_so.cpp\n\n\n\"dxfimport\" is a c++ command line utility that reads triangle (face) \nprimitives from dxf files, and convert these into Radiance polygon \nprimitives, using the layernumber of each face as modifier (LAYER001, \nLAYER002 etc.).\n\n\nThe url is:\nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so.h\nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so.cpp\n\n\nComments in the source files are a combination of dutch and english, as \nI said it is an in-house tool - and I am dutch....  :)\n\n\nGood  luck,\n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Young wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004498.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "October 23, 2007 at 06:53AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004494", "id": "radiance-general_004498"}
