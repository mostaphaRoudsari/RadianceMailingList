Make \nsure that's been done first, then you may also need to run this as root \n(do you know about the sudo command, which runs things as root?).  After \nit's been compiled (yes, gcc is a compiler so it's not making a script \nbut an actual executable), you will move the binary to /usr/local/bin \nwith all the other Radiance binaries (you would do this with sudo too, \ni.e. \"sudo mv dxfimport /usr/local/bin\").  sudo will ask you for the \nadministrative password, which you likely set up when you set up your \nMac initially.  Hope this helps (and does not hurt)!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004502.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 23, 2007 at 10:15AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004494", "id": "radiance-general_004502"}
