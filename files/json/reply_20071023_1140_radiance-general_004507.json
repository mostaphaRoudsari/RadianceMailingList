I have written a Ruby script to export  \nSketchup models\nto Radiance and I'm about to finish and release it soon (I keep  \nsaying that\nfor 2 weeks now...). Sketchup has some nice features (like n-sided  \npolygons\nand a total lack of complex geometric primitives) that can be translated\nnicely into Radiance. It has not seen much testing (yet) and if Tom  \nneeds\na solution today I can only offer a work in progress.\n\n\nAnyway, Sketchup doesn't make the models 'hefty'; it's the users. If you\nhave a messy model in Sketchup/Vectorworks/Autocad it will end in a  \nmessy\nmodel in Radiance.\n\n\nI remember that there is another script around which was presented at  \nthe\nfirst Radiance Workshop in Fribourgh years ago. That might have seen  \nsome\nfurther development and be in a more user friendly state.\n\n\nOther options: does Vectorworks offer a scripting API? A very simple\nRadiance exporter should not be hard to do and can probably be derived\nfrom a sample script (access to the 3D faces is all that's required).\n\n\nYou could use Blender and Francesco's or my own export scripts. The\nbiggest problem is to find a format of the DXF file that Blender can\nunderstand. But that's the problem of all export-import-export tool\nchains (and ultimately of the DXF file format).\n\n\nFinally, I have written a partial DXF to Radiance converter in Python\nonce. It was written with one particular DXF file in mind and I don't\nthink I even added support for 3D faces. If you have a small DXF example\nI could see if it works and perhaps add bit to support the most basic\nfiles. I stopped playing around with that because I couldn't work out\nsome problems with transformations. But if Vectorworks exports to a  \nplain\n3D space it should be fine.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004507.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 23, 2007 at 11:40AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004494", "id": "radiance-general_004507"}
