I'd also like to hear (maybe off-list) your \nthoughts on how to model accurately in SketchUp, since it seems to still \nlack direct coordinate input, UCSs, and the object snaps seem a little \nlean compared to ACAD...\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004510.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 23, 2007 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004494", "id": "radiance-general_004510"}
