Things \ndisappear, objects behave strangely (such as not being able to be copied \nand pasted into other drawings), etc.  This particular Revit model I was \ntalking about was simply too detailed for its own good and was bogging \ndown my system.   In general I find that 300MB drawings will do that.  \n;-)  It was so slow that weeding out the extraneous polygons was simply \ntaking too long.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004512.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 23, 2007 at 01:18PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004494", "id": "radiance-general_004512"}
