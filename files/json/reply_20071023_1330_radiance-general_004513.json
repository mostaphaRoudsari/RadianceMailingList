{"body": "Hey Rob,\n\n\nWow 300Mb, I start being highly suspicious at around 25MB for a CAD \nmodel.  On the other hand, I think this BIM stuff is going to go \nsomewhere, so figuring out how to manage the data is going to be an \nissue worth investigating. I suspect it is particularly nasty if you are \ntrying get data out for use in Autocad 2000. I wonder if would be any \nmore \"inter-operable\" going from Revit to 2008.\n\n\nAs an aside, I really wish that the folks at Autodesk would provide a \nmethod for exporting to obj format. Not that this helps with managing \ngigantic 3D data sets, but it would at least provide good workflow from \nAutodesk tools to other applications....\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti wrote:\n> Jack de Valpine wrote:\n>> Hey Rob,\n>>\n>> Would you be willing to share experience with Revit to Radiance?
