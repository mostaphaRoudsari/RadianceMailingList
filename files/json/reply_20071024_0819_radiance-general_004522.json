{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nIn general, unless a data representation is published and stable, it  \ndoesn't make much sense to support it in a translator, as the next  \nversion that comes out will likely break it.  If there is a published  \nstandard for Sketchup files, or something closely related (a higher- \nlevel output from Sketchup), that would be interesting to look at.   \nOtherwise, you can try lobbying the developers to put a Radiance or  \nMGF export option directly into their software, which is much easier  \nto write than a translator.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004522.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 24, 2007 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004494", "id": "radiance-general_004522"}
