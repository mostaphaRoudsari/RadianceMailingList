{"body": "Thank you for your answer.\n\n\nI've checked it out as you mentioned, but I can't solve the problem yet.\nThe situation is assumed to take place in the distance shorter than\n1.5times of cylinderical light source's diameter. I think there may\nneed to\nsome technique to model cylindrical light sources.\n\n\nActually, I'm modeling UV lamp emitting only ultraviolet wavelength\nin small equipments.\nSo the cylindrical black light source was defined to have only blue\nradiation (for an alternative to UV). Of course all the materials have\nreflectance values only for blue radiation.\nI want to find the UV intensity on some surfaces, and I think Radiance is\nwell organized to calculate this value, but I'm not sure if\nthere is anything to consider like that cylindrical light source is not good\nin Radiance.\nI really appreciate if I get some advices on my case.\n\n\nMinki, Sung\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004538.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Minki Sung", "created_at": "October 30, 2007 at 07:45PM", "created_by": "Minki_Sung", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004475", "id": "radiance-general_004538"}
