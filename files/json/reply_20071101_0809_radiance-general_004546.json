Oh well...\n\n\nAnd John M, how complex was your model?  We just successfully used \nThomas' script to export an 80MB SketchUp model to Radiance!  Worked \nvery well.  I agree with John, a choice of \"by color\" OR \"by layer\" \nwould be very helpful.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 01, 2007 at 08:09AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004530", "id": "radiance-general_004546"}
