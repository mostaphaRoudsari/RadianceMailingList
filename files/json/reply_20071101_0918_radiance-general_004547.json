{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\n> And John M, how complex was your model?  We just successfully used\n> Thomas' script to export an 80MB SketchUp model to Radiance!\n\n\nMy SU model was only a 1/3 the size of yours: about 26Mb (Edges  \n124168, Faces\t60278).  The Radiance export took about 13 mins on a  \n2.16GHz C2D MB (2Gb RAM).  The exported rad file was of size 13Mb and  \ncontained 60278 polygons.  For comparison, exporting the same model  \nto Radiance via 3DS (& MGF) was much quicker but gave a rad file of  \nsize 38Mb with 188043 polygons (because of the conversion to  \ntriangles, of course).\n\n\nThe smaller rad file did produce a number of \"non-planar vertex\"  \nwarnings (as one might expect).  I haven't tried out the model much  \nsince I would need to first change all the material colours in SU to  \nmatch the scheme used for the layers.\n\n\nHats off to TB for this very handy utility!\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004547.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "November 01, 2007 at 09:18AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004530", "id": "radiance-general_004547"}
