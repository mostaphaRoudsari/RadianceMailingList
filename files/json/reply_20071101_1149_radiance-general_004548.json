The one and only mode exports to files based on the\ngroup or component instance name which is generated if it's not set.\n\n\nThis allows you to use the Sketchup hierarchy to model efficient\nRadiance scenes with '!xform'. At the moment only components can\nbe reused but Sketchup keeps track of identical groups as well;\nI just can't get this information from the API.\n\n\n> Is there (or will there be) an option to export surfaces by\n> layer name rather than material colour?\n\n\nSince you already got another one voting for it I'll look into it\nat the weekend. Should be easy to do.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004548.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 01, 2007 at 11:49AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004530", "id": "radiance-general_004548"}
