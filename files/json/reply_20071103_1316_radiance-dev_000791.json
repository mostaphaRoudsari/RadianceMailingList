A little messy, but it would work.\n\n\n\n\nSorry for my late reply, but I'm missing a bit free time for packaging\nwork these days.\n\n\nCreating an extra bin path is not a problem, but this makes things\nunnecessarily confusing for new Radiance users. If you'd like to see the\nRadiance community grow (which is one of the reasons why I've started to\nwork on a package for Debian - Radiance is too good to hide it somewhere\nin a small, closed community), things should be as easy as possible.\nThis includes binaries in $PATH and their manpages within the manpath.\nI've rarely seen a program which comes with such a good documentation in\nform of manpages, it would be a shame to hide them, just because we move\nall tools into a non-public path.\n\n\nFor those people who add an extra path to their PATH anyway:\nWhat about creating a directory which contains the compatibility\nsymlinks, so you can add this directory to your PATH?\nLike a directory /usr/lib/radiance/compat, with the following synlinks\nas contens:\n\n\nbin/genbox -> /usr/bin/genrbox\nbin/rview  -> /usr/bin/rvu\nshare/man/man1/genbox.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/genrbox.1.gz\nshare/man/man1/rview.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/rvu.1.gz\n\n\nThis would also allow you to add /usr/lib/radiance/compat/share/man to\nthe manpath to have the manpages available. And new users are able to\nuse genrbox/rvu without any extra hassle.\n\n\n\n\nWould this solve the problem?\n\n\n\n\nAlso I'd like to know if there're other wishes regarding the Dbeian\npackage, if so, I'd like to change things now before it needs to be done\nin a hurry later, and before more new users get used to the current\nstructure.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000791.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 03, 2007 at 01:16PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000791"}
