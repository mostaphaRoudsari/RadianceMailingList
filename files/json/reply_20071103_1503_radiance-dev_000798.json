I think the point of creating a separate\npath is to keep the established names while we're still able to have\neverything related to Radiance in one (less common) place.\n\n\n> This includes binaries in $PATH and their manpages within the manpath.\n\n\n$PATH can be extended and $MANPATH can be extended.\n\n\n> I've rarely seen a program which comes with such a good  \n> documentation in\n> form of manpages, it would be a shame to hide them, just because we  \n> move\n> all tools into a non-public path.\n\n\nA separate path is not 'hiding' anything. In fact this seems to be the\nmost Unix/Radiance-like way of solving the problem\n\n\n> For those people who add an extra path to their PATH anyway:\n> What about creating a directory which contains the compatibility\n> symlinks, so you can add this directory to your PATH?\n> Like a directory /usr/lib/radiance/compat, with the following synlinks\n> as contens:\n>\n> bin/genbox -> /usr/bin/genrbox\n> bin/rview  -> /usr/bin/rvu\n> share/man/man1/genbox.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/genrbox.1.gz\n> share/man/man1/rview.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/rvu.1.gz\n\n\nThis implies that we do rename 'genbox' which is not necessary if there\nis a separate path. And if we end up creating a 'compat' directory it\nshould not contain links to the real man page but a man page that  \ninforms\nthe user about the name change and advises to use the new name instead.\nThe binary links are necessary for existing scripts but I'm not sure if\n'rview' is still necessary. It's interactive after all so everyone who\nuses the wrong binary is presented with an error message as a reminder.\n\n\n\n\nTo come to an end: I don't thing there is a big problem with existing\nscenes/scripts breaking due to the renaming of 'genbox'. I don't think\nthere is a big sharing of scene files going on so everyone who's new to\nRadiance will write their own scenes and hopefully get a set of updated\ndocuments to assist them. The bundled examples should be easy to update,\njust as the various scripts out there (like my own). The source  \ndistribution\ncan create a link in the standard Radiance bin/ directory and expect the\nusers/admins to extend the path if necessary, Debian can moves these\nlinks to another place and only hack $PATH if compatibility is desired.\n\n\nWe will get a few more mails to the list but as the 'rvu' experience  \nshows\nit's nothing we couldn't handle. All in all it seems not such a big  \nproblem\nwhatever we do.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000798.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 03, 2007 at 03:03PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000798"}
