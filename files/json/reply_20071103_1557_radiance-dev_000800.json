Seems it's not included in the\nRmakefile and I forgot about it. I think Greg could add this to the\nprograms which are build in that directory anyway.\n\n\n> or external programmes like\n> gendaylit (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/generators/index.html).\n\n\nIf you convince the authors to put them under a free license, this is\nnot a problem at all. I've only looked at gendaylit, but it's license it\nnot free according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines.\n\n\n * Don't even think of selling this software to other people, or\n * distributing it commercially, that is strict and explicit no.\n\n\nWorst piece in there, didn't read the rest carefully.\n\n\n\n\nSome days ago I was pointed to a lot of documentation which is shipped\nwith Learnix (if I remember right). It would probably be interesting to\nship that with Debian, too (if the License permits to do so). If the\nLearnix people are reading here - I'd be happy if we could work\nsomething out (if I don't get any reaction I'll find an email addy and\nwrite directly).\n\n\nAn other interesting option would be to provide FAI\n(http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/) installers to install Radiance\non clusters - if anybody has a use for this.\n\n\n\n\nAlso I'd like to announce the availability of Radiance in my blog -\nwhich is on planet.debian.org - as soon as the packaging seems to be\nstable enough. If anybody knows a good summary about radiance, which I'd\nbe allowed to share (with proper reference of course) - please point me\nto it.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000800.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 03, 2007 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000800"}
