{"body": "> How stable is Sketchup when it is running in wine?\n> Any things to take care of?\n\n\nI managed to install it through CrossOver Linux, which\nis based on wine http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/\nbut only in a in a win2000 \"bottle\".\n\n\nIt is not really usable, since there is an annoying\nproblem with buttons and menus only being rendered\nwhen the mouse is over them, but the 3D context and\nruby integration seem to be fine, in fact I managed\nto build a simple scene and export it through \nthe exporter written by Thomas. \nPerhaps with a bit of effort the Codeweavers guys could\nmake it work well.\nJust to have an idea of the problems:\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/pub/sketchup_wine.png\n\n\nF.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004552.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "November 04, 2007 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004551", "id": "radiance-general_004552"}
