{"body": "> IDEA : Firstly my teacher wanted to simulate tunnel's illumination\n\n\nTry to get a copy of \"Renderin with Radiance\" (often refered to as RwR \nhere) before you start! There has been work done with Radiance \nconcerning simulation of road lighting, there have been studies about \nhow to model the materials (important for you - wet streets give very \ndifferent problems then a dry summer day), on glare effects etc. You \nshould know these before you start.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004557.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
