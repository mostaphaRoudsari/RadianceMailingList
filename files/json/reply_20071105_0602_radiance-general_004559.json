{"body": "We worte each other at the same time Lars.. thank you again.\n\n\nMy university is trying to get that book, but it looks like they print it on request. So, it is taking much time to get it. Anyhow, hope it will arrive in time. \n\n\nLucio\n\n\nI.> IDEA : Firstly my teacher wanted to simulate tunnel's illumination\n.\n.Try to get a copy of \"Renderin with Radiance\" (often refered to as RwR \n.here) before you start! There has been work done with Radiance \n.concerning simulation of road lighting, there have been studies about \n.how to model the materials (important for you - wet streets give very \n.different problems then a dry summer day), on glare effects etc. You \n.should know these before you start.\n.\n.Good luck!\n.\n.CU Lars.\n.\n._______________________________________________\n.Radiance-general mailing list\n.Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n.http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n.\n\n\n..
