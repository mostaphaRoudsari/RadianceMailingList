The standards offer the alternative of /usr/lib/<package>\nexactly for this case. Adding two extra paths in an user's\nenvironment is a trivial exercise. Remember that your target\naudience are Linux users, who do this all the time.\nThose people who would fail, just because they don't know how\nto edit their ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc, will not be able to do\nanything useful with Radiance anyway. Don't make life miserable\nfor the knowledgeable users because of them.\n\n\nRenaming genbox, with all the contreived workarounds that have\nbeen proposed, would only solve *our* problem *for now*. But\nbecause we'd occupy such a large portion of the namespace in\n/usr/bin/, installing there would inevitably cause more problems\nfor other package authors in the future. The problems it would\ncause for Radiance users right now have already been mentioned.\n\n\nIn summary: Clogging /usr/bin/ is very bad manners. Don't do it.\n\n\n\n\n(back into my cave again)\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000806.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 10:14AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000806"}
