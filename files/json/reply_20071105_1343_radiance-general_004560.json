{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nActually, white would be \"cxy 0.3333 0.3333\", so the values you are  \ngetting are actually becoming redder as the temperature decreases, as  \nexpected.\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this method for computing CIE (x,y) from  \nCCT -- it's probably best.  You can check against the other  \napproximation, which is a table-based lookup in src/cal/cal/ \nblackbody.cal.  Just load this file into icalc or rcalc and evaluate  \nthe cct_x(kelvin) and cct_y(kelvin) with the same argument.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004560.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 01:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004553", "id": "radiance-general_004560"}
