{"body": "Hi Bernd,\n\n\nThis e-mail must have caught you at a bad time -- I would consider it  \na favor if you keep a civil tone with others on this list.  Schorsch  \n(Georg Mischler) is one of the principal contributors to Radiance,  \nand the only other person besides myself who does regular work on the  \nCVS tree.  Virtually all of his time is donated, so bear in mind that  \nyou are speaking with a fellow volunteer and collaborator.   \nRegardless of rank and ability, no one deserves to be ridiculed in  \npublic for comments made, especially earnest and well-considered  \nones.  In general, I ask that posters treat each other with respect  \nand listen to one another's opinions, even if they disagree.  Enough  \nsaid.\n\n\nI am not a Linux user, so I don't really consider this my problem,  \nbut if I were to install Radiance on a machine I managed (which I  \nthink I've done once or twice), I would prefer to have the binaries  \nin their own separate directory as Schorsch suggests, similar to /usr/ \nX11R6/bin and /usr/local/pbm.  On my machine, Radiance sits in /usr/ \nlocal/ray, even though the default build script drops them in /usr/ \nlocal/bin.  I actually thought separate package directories was the  \nnorm, but you know more about Linux conventions and Debian packages  \nthan anyone else I know, so I trust in your authority.  However, I am  \ninterested to hear what others have to say on this point.  I don't  \nthink you want to receive complaints about crowding /usr/bin and  \ncausing name conflicts any more than I do.\n\n\nAs for naming all future Radiance programs rad-this or rad-that, it  \njust isn't going to happen.  The number of programs being added is  \nfewer than one per year, and what kind of sense does it make 10 years  \ndown the line to have 10 of 100 programs start with rad-* and the  \nrest sans prefix?  Renaming everything in a go would cause dozens of  \ncompatibility issues like the genbox problem we've discussed ad  \nnauseam, so I don't really see this as a viable solution.\n\n\nIs it possible to offer a different installation directory at least  \nas an option?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000809.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 04:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000809"}
