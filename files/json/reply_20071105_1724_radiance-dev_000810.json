{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> This e-mail must have caught you at a bad time \n\n\nNot a too bad time, but I'm a kinda annoyed by people who suggest to\nmake the use of software more complicated for the common user because\nthey know all about it. I'm sorry for the rant.\n\n\n> separate directory as Schorsch suggests, similar to /usr/X11R6/bin and\n\n\nThis was removed for a good reason.\nFor compatibility /usr/bin/X11 is a link to /usr/bin, and /usr/X11R6/bin\nis a link to /usr/bin, too.\n\n\n> I don't think you want to\n> receive complaints about crowding /usr/bin and causing name conflicts\n> any more than I do.\n\n\nDefinitely not, I'm more than interested to hear opinions about the way\nto handle this, too. Although I'd just keep it as it is for the moment -\nthe chance that we have a name clash before Lenny is pretty low imho.\nAlso in most cases I have the better arguments (use in\nclusters/scripts/existing stuff/....) - but not against a suite which\nworks similar to radiance, is in Debian since a _long_ time and has >\n280 popcon reports. Although their maintainer offered to rename it, it\ndidn't take long until the first users yelled at him. It is only sane to\nleave genbox to them. gromacs ships with 85 files in /usr/bin for\nexample - so having 123 files in /usr/bin is not a problem, definitely.\n\n\nIf you look at the popcon stats, radiance is rising more and more and I\nhope this keeps going, so we have a good argument not to rename anything.\n\n\nThe other problem which would be introduced by moving stuff away would\nbe the manpages, they couldn't be installed into section 1 anymore, so\nthis would be extra work to change the section and move them accordingly.\n\n\nThe only way I can see is if we're able to distinguish between programs\nwhich are used by other programs only, and not by user _scripts_ (as in\ncsh/bash/..., which relies on $PATH), they could be installed in a\ndifferent directory. Installing tools, which are used by a normal user,\ninto a different directory then /usr/bin would be a violation of the FHS.\n\n\n> As for naming all future Radiance programs rad-this or rad-that, it just\n> isn't going to happen.\n\n\nNo need to call them rad-foo, but for example instead of cv call a\nprogram metacv or metaconv. This rises the chance that somebody else\nuses a different name. For example brl-cad ships a cv binary, too, and\nlooking at http://lists.debian.org/debian-changes/2000/01/msg00006.html\nit seems we had a /usr/bin/cv some long time ago in the xa+cv package.\nAlso googling for /usr/bin/intendedprogramname helps.\n\n\nI still think even if we'd have to rename another tool (I'll try to\navoid that, bu you can't know) everybody who doesn't want to follow such\na name change is able to use the suggested compat directory. Adding\nsomething to PATH in general or adding it only if you want to use the\noriginal names doesn't make a bit difference imho. Please note that I\ncan't add directories to $PATH automatically, it's always something that\nneeds to be done by the user/admin.\n\n\n> Renaming everything in a go would cause dozens of compatibility issues\n> like the genbox problem we've discussed ad nauseam, so I don't really\n> see this as a viable solution.\n\n\nNo, renaming all tools doesn't make any sens at all and I'd never\nsuggest that.\n\n\n> Is it possible to offer a different installation directory at least as\n> an option?\n\n\nNot if you use packages.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000810.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 05:24PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000810"}
