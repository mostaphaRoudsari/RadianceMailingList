{"body": "Hi Bernd,\n\n\nThanks for your reply.  I guess I'm hopelessly behind the times when  \nit comes to how things are managed on Linux.  I know FreeBSD/Darwin  \nstill uses the old separate bin directories approach for tool sets.   \nWhether it causes problems, I'm not aware.\n\n\nAs for renaming \"cv,\" I don't think that would be a problem since  \nhardly anyone uses it.  If you have other specific programs you think  \nneed renaming, let me know, and I'll make the changes if I can.\n\n\nDo you distribute a removal script with your package as well, in case  \nsomeone decides to uninstall Radiance?  Just curious.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000811.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 06:14PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000811"}
