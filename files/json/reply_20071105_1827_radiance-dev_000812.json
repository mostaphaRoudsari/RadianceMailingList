{"body": "Hi Bernd,\n\n\nI was just poking around a bit and I wonder about using \n/etc/alternatives to manage the conflict between the two versions of \nxform? So perhaps there could be /usr/bin/rgenbox for radiance and \n/usr/bin/ggenbox for gromacs which then get resolved by \n/etc/alternatives/genbox? This /etc/alternatives is new to me so I am \nnot clear if I am thinking about this the right way.\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000812.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 06:27PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000812"}
