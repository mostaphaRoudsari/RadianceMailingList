I've asked Lars if\nhe'd be interested to package brl-cad, but he said that they'd probably\nnot have a problem at all to rename it.\nI think brl-cad would be a good addition, I hope they find the time to\nget a really good gui on top of it.\n\n\nAnyway I'll add the compat directory with the next upload, so people can\nadd it to PATH and MANPATH if they want to and get the old environment back.\n\n\n> Do you distribute a removal script with your package as well, in case\n> someone decides to uninstall Radiance?  Just curious.\n\n\nWell, it's a package, so you remove it like every package - using your\nfavorite package manager. You probably know rpm from redhat and co -\nDebian is using a different (times better imho) package manager called\ndpkg. There're several frontends to dpkg which handle the\nretrieval/upgrade/.... of packages and tell dpkg to install/remove/...\nthem. Most of them are based on apt, like apt-get.\nSo to install radiance you run\napt-get install radiance radiance-doc radiance-materials\n(if you want all packages....; there's also radiance-sse3 with optimized\nbinaries for modern x86_64 CPUs running a 32bit environment)\nTo remove radiance you could run - for example:\napt-get remove radiance radiance-doc radiance-materials\n\n\nAs usual there're also several ways to do this, but all of them will end\nby telling dpkg to remove the packages or to purge them (a remove keeps\nconfig files of a package, purge removes everything).\n\n\nI think a look into a random Debian for beginners howto will show you\nall details of the Debian package management. If you're interested just\nask, I can find a good book about Debian for you.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000814.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 07:21PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000814"}
