For example /usr/bin/x-www-browser is managed\nby alternatives and is used as default web browser in the system, you\ncan use update-alternatives to select konqueror/iceweasel/....... to\nprovide it.\nSame thing for diversions using dpkg-divert - it's only allowed if both\nprograms are able to replace each other. For example did gpsdrive ship\nit's own version of gpsd for some time, and while installing the\noriginal gpsd a diversion was added so /usr/bin/gpsd was provided from\nthe gpsd package.\ngenbox from Gromacs and genbox from Radiance have completely different\nfunctions, so using diversions or alternatives on them is forbidden by\npolicy.\n\n\nImagine you'd accidentally have the genbox from gromacs instead of the\nRadiance genbox because you've messed with the alternatives, and it\nwould provide some output which looks sane to the rest of Radiance -\nyou'd end up with something completely different then expected.\nThat's not a huge problem here, but imagine such a confusion would\nhappen with some destructive tool. That's why Debian's policy says:\nBinaries MUST have a unique name, and alternatives/diversions are only\nallowed if the programs are exchangeable without any problems for the user.\n\n\n\n\nHope that explains it :)\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000815.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 05, 2007 at 07:37PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000815"}
