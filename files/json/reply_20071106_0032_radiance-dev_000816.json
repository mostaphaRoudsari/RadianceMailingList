{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nbeing not a developer, I still want to comment on this.\n\n\nRadiance has always attracted a special kind of conflicts. It was meant \nto be a program for experts, giving reliable results for simulations. So \nin many cases, it will be installed on a dedicated machine and used by a \n\"dedicated user\", too - someone who is using it as a professional, \nknowing all the tricks, embedding it into his scripts, workflow \nwhatever, and compling it to\n\n\n/simulation/light/radiance/snapshots/3.4_withBackPorts/sse3\n\n\n;-) And it is perfectly working.\n\n\nOn the other hand, there have always been people who did unexpected \nthings with Radiance, even using it only to produce nice imagines, some \nin their spare time. And the great thing about the Radiance community is \nthat they all communicate, noone is blaming the other.\n\n\nNow in Linux world, a lot is about cleaning up Unix traditions that were \nlocking out users. The file hierarchy standard is one, the use of \npackage managers another (maybe not important for those who compile once \n- but after the third update, you will apreciate the simple automatic \nupdate procedure). And thus, it IS important not to invent special \ndirectory hierarchies for every single application.\n\n\nI know that there are approaches to keep packages in their own \ndirectory. I did so, because I often have different releases installed \nat the same system. But for a managed system, this does not make much \nsense. And even those systems having dedicated directory trees for \npackages are not really coherent - you will still find lots of \napplications in /usr/bin, there is some black magic deciding what is \nsuitable for an own dir and what is not. I think it is confusing at least.\n\n\nNow, I really do not see any disadvantage of renaming genbox, putting it \ninto /usr/bin, and having an option (not default) to set a compatibility \nlink. It would result in a cleaner setup for new users (which are the \nones I expect to use the package most). For those who have !genbox in \ntheir scenes, it won't be a problem to press \"Y\" - they are usually \nexperienced users anyway, able to edit their PATH as needed, maybe still \nprefering to compile from source (so not affected at all). So I do not \nsee a real scenario where this clean-up would cause a problem.\n\n\nAnd of course, we should not start ranting here, the community is too \nsmall and to precious to step on each other's feet. Schorsch has been \nboth a developer and a very helpful person for people who needed help \nand asked in the community, and he certainly has a lot of real \nexperience with Radiance, also as he is one of those who embedded it in \na commercial system which is a real great working environment for \nprofessional users imho. Bernd is from a very different background, he \nis one of those who try to make Linux useable for the non-experts, which \nis a lot about not focussing on one app but the whole system. And I \nthink we really need both here...\n\n\nOk, enough, have a nice day out there and go on with great work,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000816.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
