The new user does not have existing \nscenes. And it is trivial to change the scenes that are distributed, as \nthere are actually few scenes available for download, most from the \nradiance ftp-server, where a few sed's would solve all the issue.\n\n\nThe real worry I could understand is that things are documented in RwR \nwhich is not so easy to update. But that is also true for all changes of \nRadiance including new features.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000818.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
