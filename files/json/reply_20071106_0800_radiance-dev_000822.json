{"body": "> And all the docs are wrong now, including the only published reference, \n> and all the e-mail archives.  Does anyone else think this is a bit much?\n\n\nAs I mentioned, I take the documentation problem more serious then the \nPATH and script questions. But actually, to prevent this, you would have \nto \"freeze\" Radiance forever. A lot of things changed since the first \nprinted \"RwR\", and as I have a copy I bought some years ago, I have to \nlive with the fact that there is no obj2mesh, another animation system, \nrvu instead of rview, ...... it's like that for all software that is \nmaintained.\n\n\nThe email archives will reflect the changes (such as they already \ncontain this discussion). The example scenes can be updated. The problem \nis the book. So here, one could create a set of pages with changes, \ncorrections and updates to distribute as pdf. People may print out than \nand add it to the end of their copy of RwR. Would be reasonable with or \nwithout renaming.\n\n\nI am against Bernd's proposal of changing the name only in Debian. \nSupport on the list would be hell, a bit like anwering the \nDesktop-Radiance users' question while noone of those answering has an \ninstallation of the modified software. And if we reference to the \ncabin-scene, it should be THE cabin, not the Debian-, the classic- or \nmaybe one's Special-scene...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000822.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
