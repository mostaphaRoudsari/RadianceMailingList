{"body": "> I am against Bernd's proposal of changing the name only in Debian.\n\n\nThat was not meant as a proposal. More like: I have to change it to be\nable to get the program integrated into a distribution, you can follow\nthat if you want to, or not. I (as a package maintainer) can't expect\nupstream to follow such changes, if they do so it's good, if not, it's\nsomething I have to live with, which includes keeping the appropriate\npatches updated for ever. Adding a documentation about the change and\nprobably helping out users if they come with questions or bug reports\nresulting from it is something I have to do anyway.\nPackage maintainers can't force their upstreams to do things, all they\ncan do is to send their wishes and suggestions to upstream. Working\ntogether on such problems is the optimal case, unfortunately not all\nupstream's are as responsive as Greg is, some very prominent examples\neven refuse to keep contact at all...\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000823.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 06, 2007 at 08:36AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000823"}
