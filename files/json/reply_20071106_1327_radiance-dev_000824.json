{"body": "I could easily follow the method I used for the rview -> rvu change,  \nwhich is to install a symbolic link for compatibility in the install  \ndirectory (genbox -> genrbox).  Bernd would put this link in the  \nspecial directory, and genbox would become genrbox.  The manual page  \nwouldn't necessarily be linked, since genrbox would be the new,  \nofficial name.  Old scene files would still work on all installations  \ndone with makeall, and the Debian package would only require setting  \nthe PATH variable to make sure it works.  Following this solution  \nseems quite reasonable to me, and I'm grateful that it's only one  \ngenerator/program that's been hit by this (so far).  It would be much  \nworse if xform had to be renamed, and that's a pretty generic name --  \nwe got off lucky.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000824.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 06, 2007 at 01:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000824"}
