{"body": "from Jaroslav K\u0159iv\u00e1nek\n\"Radiance Caching is a ray tracing-based method for accelerated global \nillumination computation in scenes with low-frequency glossy BRDFs. The \nmethod is based on sparse sampling, caching, and interpolating radiance \non glossy surfaces. In particular we extend the irradiance caching \nscheme proposed by Ward et al. in 1988 to cache and interpolate \ndirectional incoming radiance instead of irradiance. The incoming \nradiance at a point is represented by a vector of coefficients with \nrespect to a spherical or hemispherical basis.\"\n\n\noh yes, it's radiance caching, i must read more :-)\n\n\nGreg Ward escribi\u00f3:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004563.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Munarriz", "created_at": "November 07, 2007 at 12:01AM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Munarriz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004561", "id": "radiance-general_004563"}
