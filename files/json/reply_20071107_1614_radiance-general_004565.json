{"body": "That's funny -- I didn't remember ever writing such a script, but  \nsure enough, Thomas is right:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005- \nFebruary/002444.html\n\n\nUnfortunately, even if you modified this script to render cones  \nrather than spheres in order to get a Voronoi diagram, it wouldn't  \ngive you the kind of smooth results you are probably after.\n\n\nNone of the Radiance tools or converters really supports per-vertex  \ncolor.  However, gensurf, mgf2rad, and obj2rad all support per-vertex  \nnormals, which are substantially similar.  It should be possible to  \npass the output of one of these programs through rcalc and convert  \nthe per-vertex normals to per-vertex colors, but it would be a very  \nnasty-looking script that would take me an hour or two to put together.\n\n\nA C-program that generates a Radiance picture you could use as a  \ntexture as Thomas suggests might even be easier to write.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 07, 2007 at 04:14PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004554", "id": "radiance-general_004565"}
