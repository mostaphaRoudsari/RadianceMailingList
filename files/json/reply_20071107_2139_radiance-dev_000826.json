I have a hard time\nbelieving that this is the only way provided by Debian.\n\n\nAmong other reasons, it only would make sense for people who\ndon't care which version they are using, which is relatively rare\nwith Radiance. Those who actually work with this stuff will\neasily have several different versions on their system for\nvarious purposes. An install procedure that does its job right\nwould take care of that as well.\n\n\nWe renamed rview to rvu, because as an interactive application it\ndoesn't appear in scene descriptions and because conflicting with\ngvim is a really bad thing to do (even if we used the name first).\nBut renaming genbox because of another obscure and specialized\npackage doesn't make sense, and would lead us on a very slippery\nslope.\n\n\nIn my opinion, a Debian default install is not sufficient\njustification to break scene descriptions. If you can't make it\nwork with the existing executable names, then so be it. And if\nyou force people to set a path to some \"compatibility directory\",\nthen you can just as well store all the binaries there.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, *if* we start renaming executables, then we should\ndo a complete overhaul (eg. with release 4.0), so that after that\n*all* names will be reasonably unique. There are several\npossible ways to make this largely transparent, so that Radiance\nwould still accept the old names internally, and transpose them\nto the new ones. Not fool proof for all situations, but a\npossible way to soften the blow to the users. But let's not drag\nthings out unnecessarily by renaming two or three items every few\nmonths, which is bound to happen if we start with just genbox\nnow.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000826.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "November 07, 2007 at 09:39PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000826"}
