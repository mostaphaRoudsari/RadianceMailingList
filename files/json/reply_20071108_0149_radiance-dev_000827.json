People who ask me to make the life for newcomers\nharder than absolutely necessary just because they're knowledgeable\ncan't expect any respect from me. You didn't come to this world as\nexpert, so please don't make it harder for other people to become as\ngood as you are.\n\n\n\n\n> I don't care if /usr/lib/<package> is really the right place\n> (that's your job to figure out, what eg. about /opt/?).\n> But placing very specialized packages with lots of executables\n> and support data into one system-central bin directory simply\n> doesn't work for everybody and everything.

That's why you can download the source using your\nfavorite package management tool and recompile it. Then you're also free\nto install to /usr/local or /opt.\n\n\n> Alternatively, *if* we start renaming executables, then we should\n> do a complete overhaul (eg. with release 4.0), so that after that\n> *all* names will be reasonably unique.\n\n\nThis would probably not be bad for the future, especially as you don't\nknow when there'll be some really important tool with the same or\nsimilar name as a radiance binary. Git (GNU Interactive Tools) is a\nprominent example here, since Linus decided to use git as name for his\nVCS. But I can't see any reason to have an extra hurry here.\n\n\n> There are several\n> possible ways to make this largely transparent, so that Radiance\n> would still accept the old names internally, and transpose them\n> to the new ones.

Let Radiance stay in Debian and see what's happening, nobody\nforces you to use it.\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000827.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 08, 2007 at 01:49AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000827"}
