If there's a need to add\nspecialized programs there should be a development package, which\nprovides the necessary headers and (statically linked) libraries. Moving\nthe most common (and not changing) functions into a shared library would\nalso be an idea for the future. It doesn't make sense to recompile the\nwhole package if you need an additional tool for one project, or if you\nneed to change one function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000828.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 08, 2007 at 02:02AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000784", "id": "radiance-dev_000828"}
