{"body": "Hi...\n\n\n>>> If you prefer to have a growing community Radiance must be attractive\n>>> for new users, and as easy to use as possible.\n\n\nActually, afaik Radiance does not need to care so much about a growing \ncommunity. Everyone in light sim is coming to Radiance sooner or later \nanyhow, as fas as not in need for a simple point-and-click-tool for the \nmost basic tasks. Still it would leverage the job of people giving \nsupport, university lab admins, and also developers of 3rd party tools, \nto have a package. E.g. installing the Blender frontend for Radiance \nwould automatically ask me to install the Blender and Radiance packages, \ndownload and configure. And all these packages could be updated without \nany trouble using package management.\n\n\n>> You obviously do (or did) not know who I am, so it should not\n>> damage your ego too much to apologize for your rudeness.\n> \n> I already did that, but if it's better for your ego I'll repeat it: I'm\n> sorry for the rant.

He has another concept of software distribution, that's all.\n\n\n>> I don't care if /usr/lib/<package> is really the right place\n>> (that's your job to figure out, what eg. about /opt/?).\n\n\nThe problem is to distinguish between distribution packages and \nadditional software. If software is part of the distribution, name \nconflicts have to be avoided. It is perfectly well to have all in \n/usr/bin than. If you install additional, isolated software (such as the \nthree self-compiled Radiance installs in my /opt), this is perfectly ok \n- but not touched by the package manager.\n\n\n>> But placing very specialized packages with lots of executables\n>> and support data into one system-central bin directory simply\n>> doesn't work for everybody and everything.\n\n\nIt works for all the software in Debian. As said, if you need something \nnot contained in the distro, you can still compile it into /opt, your \nhome etc.\n\n\n>> Among other reasons, it only would make sense for people who\n>> don't care which version they are using, which is relatively rare\n>> with Radiance.\n\n\nI think the typical user case for a Debian package is having the most \nrecent release. This will work in hundreds of installations. You would \nstill compile your own - you would simply not use the package.\n\n\n>> various purposes. An install procedure that does its job right\n>> would take care of that as well.\n\n\nNo, it is not necessary to have all releases of the software in all \nreleases of the distro. The distro of 2007 will in most cases contain \npackages based on software releases of 2007 with only bug-fixes added later.\n\n\nIt is important here to understand the difference between buying an OS \nand installing software, or choosing a distribution which is a \ncompilation of both OS and applications.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000829.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
