{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nwithout having seen the results - usually such artefacts result from \nweak ar, ad, as settings. We also do not know the scene. Can you provide \nus both with a sketch (e.g. wireframe screenshot or hand drawing) and an \nimage showing the noise, both low res and/or an a website? Usually you \ncan improve the visual quality by either setting higher values for the \nambient parameters or using workarounds as mkillum.\n\n\nOne other hint. Create a rif file and render using rad. That will help a \nlot at the beginning, as rad will set some parameters for your scene \n(and you can display those).\n\n\n\n\nGood luck! CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004571.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
