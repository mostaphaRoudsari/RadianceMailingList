{"body": "Dear Annica:\n\n\nWe have a little Daysim discussion forum going under\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/daysim which might be better than\nRadiance-online for Daysim-specific requests. In the archives of the\nforum you will find that the problem that you are encountering is due to\nthat fact that SketchUP somehow changed their 3ds output files in\nversion 5 and up, REDUCING the number of characters allowed for each\nmaterial layer in 3ds. This has lead to the problem that most material\nnames are shortened and that the Daysim library does not recognize them\nany more. As a workaround you have to manually change the material\ndescriptions for your Daysim/Radiance scene as described in the\ntutorial.\n\n\nGood luck and let me know in case your problems persist.\n\n\nChristoph \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004570.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "November 08, 2007 at 07:18AM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004567", "id": "radiance-general_004570"}
