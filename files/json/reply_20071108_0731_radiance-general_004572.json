{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nI suspect that the noise you are seeing is a results of the -dj \nparameter. There are a couple of things to note here:\n\n\n   1. oversample the image - eg render at higher resolution (3x to 6x\n      desired final resolution) and then downsample with: pfilt -r .6 -x\n      /3 -y /3 oversample.pic > final.pic (this would reduce the image\n      size 3x and apply a gaussian filter)\n   2. reduce -dj setting - this will produce less sampling jitter, but I\n      am not sure what your objective is here\n   3. pseudo random monte carlo vs. random monte carlo sampling - when\n      run with normal parameter settings radiance (rpict) uses pseudo\n      random sampling, with this you may notice directionality or\n      striation effects in the jittered samples, alternatively radiance\n      can be run with uncorrelated sampling by using the -u switch, this\n      will get rid of the directional effects but may require even\n      greater oversampling to reduce sampling noise due to the random\n      sampling\n\n\nHopefully this helps, I expect that you may get other input from the \nlist as well.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004572.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 08, 2007 at 07:31AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004569", "id": "radiance-general_004572"}
