My idea was to read the colour value and save\nit to a known picture position, then assign this position as\nUV-coordinate to the mesh vertex. The picture used as texture\nshould give the mesh the desired colouring.\n\n\nWhat I probably had in mind was something Blender users can do:\ncreate a mesh (example: a sphere), 'paint' a mouth, nose, eyes and\nhair onto the sphere in 3D and 'unwrap' it to a texture image.\nThen you can use Photoshop etc. to refine that sketchy image to\na proper face texture.\n\n\nApplied here it would be:\n\n\n1) get the mesh into Blender (...)\n2) unwrap and save texture of vertex colours\n3) export mesh to *.obj with uv-texture\n4) convert texture image to *.pic\n5) use obj2mesh to get shape and texture into Radiance\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004574.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 08, 2007 at 11:16AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004554", "id": "radiance-general_004574"}
