{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI do not know of any software that can do this inherently.  We have modeled these types of systems with Radiance.  We use python to script up sets of Radiance runs, and within the python we have done transforms on objects before creating octrees.  There is an example of an automated vertical louver system in my presentation at this years Radiance conference.  FYI - Here is the chunk of python code that rotates the louvers.  E-mail me if you would like to see the full python script.  This is done on a time-by-time basis, so this code is in a larger loop that is going through each time step called for.\n\n\n\n\n\tifp = os.popen( 'gensky %s %s %s +%s %s' % (sMonth[iSeason], sDay, sTime, sSky, aTmp[0]), 'r')\n        aTmp3 = string.split(ifp.read())\n        fAzi = float(aTmp3[17+len(aTmpA)])-fBAzi\n\n\n        # Determine slat rotation angle\n        if fAzi < -45:\n            fSlatAngle = 90\n        elif fAzi > 45:\n            fSlatAngle = 90\n\telse:\n\t    fSlatAngle = -2*fAzi\n\n\n        # Write louver_rotated.rad\n        fpOutFile = open ((sWorkingDir + os.sep + 'louver-temp.rad' ), 'w')\n        fpOutFile.write ('!xform -rz %f scene/louver.rad' % (fSlatAngle))\n        fpOutFile.close()       \n\n\n        # Create Octree from base octree and sky\n        if fAzi < -75 or fAzi > 75:\n            os.system( 'oconv -w -i %s %s >%s' % \\\n                       (sOctree, (sViewDir + os.sep + 'hour.sky'), \\\n                        (sViewDir + os.sep + 'tmp.oct')))\n        else:\n            os.system( 'oconv -w -i %s %s %s >%s' % \\\n                       (sOctree, (sViewDir + os.sep + 'hour.sky'), (sWorkingDir + os.sep + 'all-louvers.rad'), \\\n                        (sViewDir + os.sep + 'tmp.oct')))\n\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the great things about Radiance, it is so flexible and robust.  It may take several years to fully understand everything, but when you do the options are limitless!\n\n\nI hope this helps!\nZack\n\n\nZack Rogers, P.E., IESNA, LEED AP\nDaylighting Analysis Group Leader\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext. 435\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004577.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "November 12, 2007 at 01:52PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004576", "id": "radiance-general_004577"}
