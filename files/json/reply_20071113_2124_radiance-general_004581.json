{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nI lost this thread in some e-mail difficulties I was having with my  \nonline service.  These seem to be sorted out, now...\n\n\nA quick look at the ra_xyz man page will confirm that this program is  \nfor converting between RGB and XYZ color space, nothing to do with  \nthe pixel coordinates on an image.  (Confusing, I know.)\n\n\nIs your mesh grid regular?  If not, you're sort of stuck because you  \nneed to resample the colors onto a grid, which is a hard problem.  If  \nyou have a grid to begin with, it may be as simple as establishing a  \ncorrespondence between the local (u,v) coordinates and a dump of  \nvalues into a Radiance picture (using pvalue -r ...).\n\n\nIf you feel like hacking C-code, the program src/hd/rhpict will take  \na set of point values and resample them into an image.  It wouldn't  \ntake that much to get it to accept colors and positions rather than  \ntaking a holodeck as input, I don't think.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004581.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 13, 2007 at 09:24PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004554", "id": "radiance-general_004581"}
