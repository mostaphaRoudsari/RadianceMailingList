{"body": "> Right now I'm dealing with a few hundreds of thousand of faces, so I can\n> well imagine this limitation.\n\n\nWhile I cannot answer the max number of materials question, there should \nbe actually no problem if you define a limited \"palette\" - I guess not \nEVERY of the faces needs a different color? What about a 256- or \n512-color \"palette\", thus 256 or 512 materials? Or are you subdividing \nthe faces to get a smooth transition to work around the interpolation?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004587.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
