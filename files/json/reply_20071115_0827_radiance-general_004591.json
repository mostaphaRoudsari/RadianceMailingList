{"body": "There is no limit on name reuse in Radiance.  Why would there be?  A  \nmaterial/texture/pattern/mixture name only refers to that modifier  \nuntil it's redefined later in the scene description stream, however.   \nThis is how Radiance avoids the problem of name reuse in multiple  \nfiles, or the same file transformed multiple times and containing  \nmaterial definitions.\n\n\nFor example, if I used ies2rad to create a light fixture with a  \ndistribution, then made 100 copies of that fixture using an xform  \narray, that would be 100 materials in the scene, all with the same  \nname but different definitions since they would have different  \nassociated transformations.  This is an essential facility, though  \nperhaps one not many people are aware of.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004591.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 15, 2007 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004586", "id": "radiance-general_004591"}
