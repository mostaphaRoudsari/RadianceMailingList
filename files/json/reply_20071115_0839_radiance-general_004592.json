{"body": "> There is no limit on name reuse in Radiance.  Why would there be?\n\n\nI remember having had problems (rvu: too many modifiers in ambient list) \nbecause I had redefined materials too often and excluded them from \nambient calculation later. I thought it was a problem of material \ndefinitions / name, not the total number of definitions, as even if \nthere is only one material name, every definitions adds an modifier id \nto the lists. Had I been wrong, was it the total number (2047) of \nmaterial definitions than?\n\n\nThank you & CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004592.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
