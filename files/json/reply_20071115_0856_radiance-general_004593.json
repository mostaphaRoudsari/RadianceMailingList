{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYou are correct about this.  There is a limit to the number of  \nmaterials that may be included in the ambient exclude list (2047 in  \nthis case) or the trace set of rtrace (8192).  I could raise these  \nlimits in the distribution, or you could yourself by adding:\n\n\n\t-DMAXASET=N -DMAXTSET=M\n\n\nto the build options in the makeall \"rmake\" script and recompiling.\n\n\nAll I was saying is that there is no fundamental limit to the number  \nof times a material may be redefined.  You can say there is a limit  \nwith respect to the include/exclude settings, but this is not the  \nsame as a basic limit.  If Jelle wants to exclude his reused material  \nname, then he may have a problem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004593.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 15, 2007 at 08:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004586", "id": "radiance-general_004593"}
