{"body": "Hi Guillio,\n\n\nThis got me thinking about rtcontrib some more, and I decided that  \nhaving an option for accumulating values could be very useful in  \ncases like this, so I added the -c switch.  I just uploaded it into  \nthe CVS HEAD, and attached is a working example of a pool with  \ncaustics simulated on the bottom.  You are welcome to use it however  \nyou like.  (The rtcontrib -r option doesn't yet work with -c, but I'm  \non it.)\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004594.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 16, 2007 at 05:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004566", "id": "radiance-general_004594"}
