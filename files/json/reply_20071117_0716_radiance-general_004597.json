{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nIf you type \"make\" in the unpacked directory, the enclosed Makefile  \n(attached with minor tweaks) will run the following commands:\n\n\noconv -f pool_surface.rad catchpool.rad > catchscene.oct\nvwrays -pj .6 -vf pool_par.vf -x 500 -y 500 -ff \\\n| rtcontrib -w -ffc -c -fo -n 1 \\\n                 -f pool_coords.cal -o %s_caustics.pic \\\n                 -b floor_bin -bn 7500 -x 50 -y 150 -m floor \\\n                 -b s_wall_bin -bn 1500 -x 50 -y 30 -m s_wall \\\n                 -b n_wall_bin -bn 1500 -x 50 -y 30 -m n_wall \\\n                 -b e_wall_bin -bn 4500 -x 150 -y 30 -m e_wall \\\n                 -b w_wall_bin -bn 4500 -x 150 -y 30 -m w_wall \\\n                 catchscene.oct\nrm catchscene.oct\nrad -o x11 poolscene.rif\n\toconv sky.rad glowpool.rad pool_surface.rad > poolscene.oct\n         rvu -vp -20 20 20 -vd 20 -20 -20 -vh 30 -vv 20 -ps 16 -pt . \n16 -dp 64 -ar 38 -ds 0 -dt .2 -dc .25 -dr 0 -sj 0 -st .5 -aa .3 -ad  \n256 -as 0 -av 17 17 17 -lr 6 -lw .01 -R poolscene.rif -o x11 -pe .03  \npoolscene.oct\n\n\nThis will produce 5 Radiance pictures, one for each wall.  Since the  \ndefaults for rtcontrib set -ab 1, it will also consider some mutual  \ninteractions from the sunlight cast along the given parallel view  \n(pool_par.vf).  It does not include sky illuminance, which is  \nprobably a minor component, anyway.  Adding that in would require a  \nmore sophisticated bombarding sampler than vwrays, or a mixfunc  \nrather than a glow surface on the remodeling end.\n\n\nThe other cool thing the new rtcontrib -c option facilitates is  \noptical system modeling, as in custom-designed luminaires.  It would  \nbe interesting to compare to more specialized (& sophisticated)  \ncommercial ray-tracing systems.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  You need to download the latest HEAD of src/util/rtcontrib.c  \nand recompile for this to work.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004597.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 17, 2007 at 07:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004566", "id": "radiance-general_004597"}
