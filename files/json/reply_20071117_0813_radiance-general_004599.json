Since you're about to\ndebug your scene I'd remove everything that's not necessary.\n\n\n> I use the following commands to generate a center line of daylight  \n> at working height\n> (.85m) in a room:\n>\n> cnt 11 \\\n> | rcalc -e '$1=2;$2=$1/2+.5;$3=.85;$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' \\\n> | rtrace -I -dt 0.03 -ds 0.02 -ab 3 -aa .15 -ar 128 -ad 1024 -as  \n> 512 -h -w -oov scene.oct \\\n> | rcalc -e '$1=$2;$2=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)' > lux.dat\n\n\nLooks fine to me. Do your values change along the line or are all of  \nthem\nbelow 10000? If they differ a lot it's a sign that there is still  \ngeometry\nleft in the scene.\n\n\nTo check the sky I would remove everything from the rtrace command line\nexcept for '-I -ab 1 -h -w -oov' and check a single point for it's  \nvalue.\nChapter 6 in 'Rendering with Radiance' explains the process step by  \nstep.\n\n\nAnother thing:\n\n\nThe man page for gensky shows a sky with non-white glow material. The\n'-B 55.866' option will only create a 10k lux sky if you use a  \nnormalized\nwhite glow material (r=g=b=1).\n\n\nHTH,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004599.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 17, 2007 at 08:13AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004598", "id": "radiance-general_004599"}
