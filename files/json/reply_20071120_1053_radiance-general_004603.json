I have copied it from a python script. Best  \nthing I could\ndo in plain text.\n\n\nI have a PDF document where this is further detailed. I just can't  \nfind it or\nit's source on the web.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004603.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 20, 2007 at 10:53AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004602", "id": "radiance-general_004603"}
