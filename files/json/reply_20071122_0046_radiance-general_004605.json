{"body": "Hello Christian,\n\n\n\n\nMy suspicions concerning your problem go towards the fact that there \napparently are many ways to convert from RGB radiances to Lux (using \nslightly different RGB weights) ... moreover it is my general experience \nthat Radiance, when looking straight into a light source, produces \nradiances that are slightly less than the source radiance specified in \nthe scene file. For example when I point the \"camera\" straight into an \nRGB = 1 W/(m^2 * sr) sky dome I get radiances of 0.9941 (although that \nmay be due to finite precision in the .hdr file format).\n\n\nSeeing that you are from Denmark (as well) I took the liberty to call \nyou on the phone (your company switchboard informed me you were away on \ntravel) ... if you feel like discussing some of these things (not that I \nnecessarily have the answer to your problem) we can contact each other \nwhen you get back.\n\n\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004605.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus B.
