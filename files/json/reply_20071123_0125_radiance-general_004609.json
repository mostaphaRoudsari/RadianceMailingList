{"body": "\"Radiance is kind of like a big pile of rope to hang yourself with.\"\n- Greg Ward\n\n\nFirst compile: \"Hmm.. this collar feels tighter than usual.\"\nFirst three months: Pink rash around the neck.\nYear one: Rash changes from pink to 'angry' red.\nYear three: Rash turns to hard skin.\nYear ten: Hard skin has now become thick calluses.\n\n\nAfter two decades of using Radiance your neck will blunt the blade of  \na guillotine.  But you will find it difficult trying to look over  \nyour shoulder.  A small price to pay -- for having so much fun along  \nthe way.\n\n\nThanks, Greg.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004609.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "November 23, 2007 at 01:25AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004606", "id": "radiance-general_004609"}
