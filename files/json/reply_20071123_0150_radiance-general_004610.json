{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks for the super advice (and for Radiance :-)\n\n\nSwitching from light to glow solves the irradiance level problem. Now my \nproblem (of course) is: I don't get \"slightly dark patches\" beneath \nobjects standing on the ground plane as you would expect (due to partial \nocclusion of the incoming radiance from the sky dome). I.e., this use of \nglow (I dunno what to set maxrad to since the glow material is not \napplied to any geometry but just used for an infinitely distant skydome) \ndoesn't allow the Sky dome to cast shadow.\n\n\n\n\n... eh, and yes ... thanks for teaching me the Ropes of Radiance\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus B.
