{"body": "Thanks again for the export script. The following was in Fransceco's wiki as a future feature (no pun intended) \n<<replacement of component instances with pre-canned Radiance files>>\n\n\nI hope this will enable the script's ability to handle artificial lighting. I have some ies fixtures i've used in some radiance renders I want to use in the Sketchup to radiance generated files. So far I've only the following method:\n1 step converted ies to rad files\n2 Use mkillum for a wrapper for fixture geometry\n3 'update' the script generated files to search/replace a named scene 'place holder' with items 1 and 2.\n\n\nDoes this approach make sense? If there is a more straight forward way, please let me know.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steve michel", "created_at": "November 26, 2007 at 12:20PM", "created_by": "steve_michel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004530", "id": "radiance-general_004612"}
