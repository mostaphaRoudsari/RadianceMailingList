The radmap tool is actually a separate \ntool from the main Radiance distribution, but the creator, Francesco \nAnselmo, is a member of this mailing list so you may get some responses \nbesides mine here. But you should definitely also check out \nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ for other possible leads.\n\n\n> The weather file that I am using is TMY2 .epw I used following to render existing and proposed irradiation maps with \u201cradmap\u201d command:\n> *radmap -s 8 -a 40.8 -o 73.9 -m 57  -n 1 -w WeatherTMT2.epw --no-albedo --viewfile viewfile --radfile test.rad  -x 2048 -y 2048 --keep-temporary-maps --sky-resolution 1024 --max-kWh 500 --max-MJ 150 *\n> * *\n>\n> As a result, I get irradiation maps in which the orientation of the \n> shading looks out by about 90deg (area on north/northwest looks \n> brighter than east/southeast).\n>\n> - Am I using the correct weather data or parameters?\n>\n\n\nYour longitude is 73.9, but your standard meridian is a slightly \nnon-standard 57 degrees. I'd assume \"-m 75\" with \"-o 73.9\" will give a \nbetter result. Looks like you just accidentally transposed the numbers \nthere...\n\n\n> - I would also like to use the rpict options to get better rendering, \n> but whenever I specify the --optionfile it says,\n>\n> o View file to be used: *viewfile*\n>\n> o Option file to be used: *viewfile*\n>\n> o Do I have to specify the rpict options on the viewfile?\n>\n\n\nWhat version of radmap are you using? I have not used option files with \nit before, but I looked at the python code for my copy of radmap (v0.1c) \nand it doesn't seem like there's any confusion between view files and \noptions files. In other words, it should be reading in your option file \ncorrectly despite what's being printed to the command line. You might \nwant to try changing options directly in the python code; you'll see the \noptions towards the top of the file and Francesco has commented \neverything fairly well. Only a few of the options are in there, but it \nserved me well enough. Good luck!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004618.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 29, 2007 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004617", "id": "radiance-general_004618"}
