{"body": "Thanks Rob for your quick response.\n\n\nYes, I realized that the -m 57 option I was using was not correct, and\nre-rendered with \"-m 75\". The results I am getting after correcting -m\nis little better but not as I expected. The shadows seems to be rotated\nabout 75-90 degrees towards East - Any Idea why this is happening?\n\n\nI am using radmap version v. 0.1b / 2003-11-24. I am not familiar with\npython, and I am using Linux for the first time for Radiance, so I am\nvery much limited to using the compiled versions. \n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nPrasanta\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004624.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Prasanta Bhattarai", "created_at": "December 03, 2007 at 07:10AM", "created_by": "Prasanta_Bhattarai", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004617", "id": "radiance-general_004624"}
