{"body": "Dear Prasanta,\n\n\nSorry for the late reply, and thanks to Rob for helping out.\n\n\n> I assume, for latitude 40.8 north, longitude 73.9 west & meridian 75\n> west of Greenwich, the location options in radmap should be \n> \"-a 40.8 -o -73.9 -m -75\". Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n\nYes this is correct.\n\n\nJudging from your previous command line option you are using\nthe default cumulative sky method, and you can relax the sky resolution \nto a lower value, for example 128, saving a lot of time without\ncompromising results.\n\n\nAs Rob pointed out, you should download a more recent version of\nradmap, and on unix systems it runs without need to compile it, \nprovided that you have python installed.\n\n\nLet me know how it works. \n\n\nCiao,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004627.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "December 03, 2007 at 02:02PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004617", "id": "radiance-general_004627"}
