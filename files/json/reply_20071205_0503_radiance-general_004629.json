{"body": "> I am trying to simulate a 'prismatic diffuser' of a flourescent\n> luminaire.\n\n\nI think the fprism.cal file in Radiance's lib directory may help you. But I also think that this (luminaire modeling) is not really a use case Radiance was developed for, so I do not how reliable results you will get without tweaking parameters a lot. Maybe (!!!) it will help to hide your modeled luminaire behind an illum face (using mkillum) so that you get less noise.\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004629.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
