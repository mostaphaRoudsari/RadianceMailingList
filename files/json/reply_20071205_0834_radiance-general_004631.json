{"body": "Agreeing with the others, Radiance is not the ideal tool for modeling  \na fluorescent luminaire with a prismatic panel, but it can be done.   \nYou have to know a lot of details about the geometry and materials  \ninvolved, but this is a case where mkillum may work reasonably well.   \nThat isn't to say the whole thing is straightforward.\n\n\nYou are much better off either measuring the luminaire somehow, or  \nusing an IES luminaire file belonging to something similar.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004631.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 05, 2007 at 08:34AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004628", "id": "radiance-general_004631"}
