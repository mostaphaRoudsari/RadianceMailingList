{"body": "Hi Glen,\n\n\nThis error occurs when you pass a negative value (it can be very  \nsmall, such as -1e-11) and raise it to a non-integer power.  The  \nresult would be a complex number, but of course this doesn't work  \nsince a real result is required.\n\n\nYou can play with values using the \"icalc\" program, and it is even  \npossible to debug a function file to some degree using the \"debugcal\"  \nscript, which uses rtrace to assign the variables described in  \nrayinit.cal.\n\n\nGood luck,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004633.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 05, 2007 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004632", "id": "radiance-general_004633"}
