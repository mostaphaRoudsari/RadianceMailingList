{"body": "Dear Francesco & Rob,\n\n\nThanks for all your help.\n\n\nYes, Rob's suggestions really helped. I downloaded the latest version of\nthe radmap, and the shadows on the rendering now are coming in a correct\norientation. Although my original problems (of orientation & using rpict\noptions) were solved by using the newer version of radmap, I have some\nmore issues. \n\n\nThe rendering I am getting are not smooth and I am seeing horizontal\nbands on these renderings. I am not sure what exactly the problem is. I\nhave tried to run simulation several times, in different computers, but\neach time I get similar results. \n\n\nI am providing you all following links which has false color images of\nexisting and proposed conditions, and a file which has all rendering\ncommands and the background process that is carried out during\nsimulation, (hoping this would help). \n\n\nRadmap falsecolor image links: \nhttp://esc.freeshell.org/Radiance/rend_process.htm   (background\nprocess) \nhttp://esc.freeshell.org/Radiance/exist_test_0000_irrmap_fc_kWh.jpg\n(existing condition simulation)\nhttp://esc.freeshell.org/Radiance/proposed_test_0000_irrmap_fc_kWh.jpg\n(proposed condition simulation)\n\n\nI would really appreciate if someone could help me figure out what's\ngoing on with this simulation. \n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nPrasanta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Prasanta Bhattarai", "created_at": "December 10, 2007 at 01:09PM", "created_by": "Prasanta_Bhattarai", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004617", "id": "radiance-general_004636"}
