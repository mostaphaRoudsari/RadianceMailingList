{"body": "Hi Prasanta,\n\n\nYou are using one month of hourly data, and in particular December.\nRadiation his concentrated in the sun positions for each hour, \ntherefore it is normal to see strong shadows coming from\nthe suns. This sun displacement inaccuracy becomes less important\nwith bigger weather datasets, but for one month of hourly data it is\ninevitable.\n\n\nEnsure to use the -dt 0 option to account for all suns. It should\nbe on by default, and for the December month it should not do much\ndifference, but when evaluating annual cumulative irradiation\nit becomes important.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004637.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "December 10, 2007 at 03:04PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004617", "id": "radiance-general_004637"}
