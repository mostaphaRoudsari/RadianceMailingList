{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nAssuming you are using \"picture.cal\" for your coordinate mapping, you\ncan take advantage of the \"inpic\" variable to create a mixture\nbetween your colorpict and a constant value, e.g.:\n\n\nvoid colorfunc constRed\n4 0.8 0.02 0.02 .\n0\n0\n\n\nvoid colorpict myPic\n7 red green blue myPic.hdr picture.cal pic_u pic_v\n0\n1 0.667\n\n\nvoid mixfunc myMix\n4 myPic constRed inpic picture.cal\n0\n1 0.667\n\n\nmyMix plastic myMat\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\n\netc...\n\n\nNaturally, you'll want to apply the same transformations to both\ncolorpict and mixfunc if you have any, and the 0.667 value I've\nspecified for the picture aspect ratio should be adjusted to match\nyour source image (height/width).  I hope this is clear enough.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004639.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 13, 2007 at 09:29AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004638", "id": "radiance-general_004639"}
