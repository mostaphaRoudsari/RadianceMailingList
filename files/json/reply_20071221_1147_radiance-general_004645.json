{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nAnother thing to try is running HDRShop under a selected compatibility \nmode in Vista. I was able to get my ancient windows 95 version of the \nLego Mindstorm software running on Vista this way. It was a bit \nlaborious, I had to go find all the relevant executables and then set \nthe compatibility mode to windows 95 (via properties on the selected exe \nfile). I think there is also something called the compatibility wizard, \nyou can search the help for this, not sure how it works though.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nClaus B.
