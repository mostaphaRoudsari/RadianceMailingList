{"body": "Hi Adriana,\n\n\nYou need some measure of the quantity of ultraviolet light in  \ndaylight and the UV transmission of the windows, but in principle  \nthere is nothing to stop you from simulating shorter wavelengths than  \nvisible in Radiance.  I don't know where you would find the  \nappropriate quantities to use, however.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004647.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 22, 2007 at 10:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004644", "id": "radiance-general_004647"}
