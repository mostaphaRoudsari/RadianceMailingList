{"body": "Hello Lucio,\n\n\nIt is normal for rtrace (and other Monte Carlo ray-tracing programs)  \nto return slightly different results for the same ray, due to  \nrandomness in the sampling process.  The goal is to produce the  \ncorrect result on average in a reasonably unbiased estimation  \nprocess, rather than producing the same systematically inaccurate  \nresult each time, as would be produced by a completely deterministic  \nalgorithm.\n\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004650.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 28, 2007 at 03:55PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004649", "id": "radiance-general_004650"}
