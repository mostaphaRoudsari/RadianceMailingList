{"body": "Thanks Greg for such fast reply :o)) .. In the beginning I thought it was something like that, but I was confused when I saw that every time I was casting rtrace from the same input file it was giving exactly the same result.. \n\n\nI did also think that non-deterministic behaviour was just for indirect calculations.. well, it looks like it is not !! ;o)\n\n\nOk then, I feel better knowing that the 'error' is someway intentional and it will be probably not big.\n\n\nConsidering I'm working with luminances the 'imprecision' is in the third decimal number .. microluxes, than.. probably it will not affect much calculations.. \n\n\nThank you again, I will read the chapter about stocastic and deterministic raytracers, in 'Rendering with Radiance' that could help me understanding probably.. \n\n\nSorry for giving alarm !! :-P\n\n\nLucio Boscolo \n\n\n\n\n.Hello Lucio,\n.\n.It is normal for rtrace (and other Monte Carlo ray-tracing programs)  \n.to return slightly different results for the same ray, due to  \n.randomness in the sampling process.  The goal is to produce the  \n.correct result on average in a reasonably unbiased estimation  \n.process, rather than producing the same systematically inaccurate  \n.result each time, as would be produced by a completely deterministic  \n.algorithm.\n.\n.I hope this is helpful.\n.-Greg\n.\n.>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004651.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefano Ponzetti", "created_at": "December 28, 2007 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004649", "id": "radiance-general_004651"}
