I have used\nit a few times with good results.\n\n\nI don't think it matters which converter you use. There is a lot of\ninformation in these files but for ies2rad you only need the the\ndistribution. The luminaire is considered to be a point source so\neven the shape info is not required unless you do glare calculations.\n\n\n> Right now I'm using \"ies2tab -ei\" to convert from eulum to ies and\n> then ies2rad to convert form .ies to .rad but ies2rad is reporting:\n> \"warning - no lamp type .. \"\n\n\nies2rad has a limited knowledge on lamp types. The search patterns are\ndefined in the \"lamp.dat\" file in your Radiance installation.  \nManufacturers\nnow tend to use a product name in their lamp specification which is\nharder to identify.\n\n\nIf ies2rad fails to identify the lamp type it prints this warning\nand uses a default lamp type with neutral white colour. This is\nfine for most simulations (in particular Lux levels). When you're\ninterested in the actual rendering of the lamp colour you can use the\n-t option of ies2rad to tell it which lamp type to use. Look in the\n'lamp.dat' file for the specification.\n\n\nPlease not that you only have to worry about this if you have different\nlamp types in your scene. You can also change the colour balance of\nan existing image to simulate this effect with pfilt.\n\n\n> Maybe this is normal, but in any case, having just one conversion  \n> would\n> be probably better..\n\n\nSupport for new data file formats would be nice but given the number\nof conversion tools out there it's probably not worth the effort.\n\n\nHappy new year.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004659.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 30, 2007 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004652", "id": "radiance-general_004659"}
