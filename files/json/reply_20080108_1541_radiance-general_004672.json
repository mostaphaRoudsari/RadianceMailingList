Francesco Anselmo created a python script to overlay these on a \nRadiance fisheye view, which is very cool, but I never was able to use \nit correctly.\n\n\nThe figure eight pattern is called an analemma, and there are some cool \nlinks with info about this as well:\n\n\nhttp://solar-center.stanford.edu/art/analemma.html\nhttp://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Other/analemma.html\nhttp://www.analemma.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004672.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 08, 2008 at 03:41PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004671", "id": "radiance-general_004672"}
