{"body": "Hi Minki,\n\n\nIt is not clear to me what your geometry is supposed to represent.\n\n\n    case 1 - If you have 2 polygons representing \"walls\" and 1 cylinder\n    representing your source, where the cylinder passes through the\n    walls, you are going to have problems due to how the light source\n    sampling occurs along the linear source.\n\n\n    case 2 - if the geometry is supposed to represent a cylindrical\n    source that passes through a hole cut in each wall, then you\n    probably need to make sure that your \"wall\" geometry has a holes cut\n    out as needed for the cylinder to pass through.\n\n\nNote also if what you are trying to do is model an actual fixture with \nreflector elements of some sort and simulate the output distribution, then\nRadiance is probably not the right tool, you will need to look into a \nforward raytracer of some sort. I am sure that others on the list can \nadvise on what might be an appropriate tool.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004676.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 10, 2008 at 07:04AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004675", "id": "radiance-general_004676"}
