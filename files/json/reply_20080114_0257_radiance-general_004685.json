{"body": "Dear Lucio,\n\n\n> So ... it exists a tachnical report from  CIE which is titled \"Test cases to asses the\n> accuracy of lighting computer programs\". Briefly, it contains some sets of\n> scenes well described to be reproduced and computed in any software..\n\n\n> If nobody did those tests using radiance, it could be a nice goal for my thesys\n> to complete them or some of them at least.. If somebody already did them,\n> I'd like to look at them, if possible.\n\n\nFunnily enough, I was actually going to give this very task to one of\nmy students this year. I think it's well worth doing as an exercise.\n\n\nThere is a validation of Relux (and I think one other software\npackage) based on the CIE technical report. If I remember correctly,\nRelux worked all right, but they discovered that the CIE overcast sky\ndefinition was implemented incorrectly in Relux, which it's now fixed.\nIf you cant' find  the report on the Net, get back to me, and I'll try\nto dig it out.\n\n\nThere are two things that you should be aware of with such a validation:\n\n\na) The test cases are all VERY basic. This is because the reference\nresults are derived analytically (pen on paper). This is to make them\n100% correct, but the downside is that the scenarios can't be very\ncomplex. Radiance, however, excels exactly in such cases difficult\ncases which can only be validated though elaborate measurements in\nreal spaces (See J. Mardaljevic, C. Reinhard)\n\n\nb) Much of Radiance's accuracy is based on the operator's experience\nand him setting the ambient parameters correctly. I feel this would\nhave to be quite a large part of this assessment: How to get them\nright, and the penalty of not getting them spot-on.\n\n\nThose are my thoughts on the subject. I am looking forward to reading\nyour report, and wish you best of luck with it.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004685.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 14, 2008 at 02:57AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004681", "id": "radiance-general_004685"}
