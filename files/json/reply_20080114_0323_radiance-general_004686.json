{"body": "> Forget about the mouse. Radiance will be a whole new (command line) \n> experience.\n\n\nWas there some Radiance integration for ARRIS? Have to remember....\n\n\nOne note to Bill: There are two ways: compiling yourself and installing \nprecompiled. I do not even know what way you went, because you did not \ntell us what package you downloaded where. There used to be compiled \nRadicance binaries for Solaris on the official site, but I am not sure \nfor which releases and platforms. So, as others already wrote, first get \ncompilers (you can get the optimized C compilers for free from Sun, do \nnot waste your time with gcc on a Solaris installation), than makeall \ninstall. I used to install into /opt/radiance-max.min on Solaris as this \nwas the way most packages where handled on my Sun.\n\n\nGood luch!
