This one is needed to build and install from sources.\n\n\nI do not know where the binaries got installed (I guess something like \nin /opt or /usr/local), but you should set RAYPATH, maybe PATH, and go \nusing radiance.\n\n\nIf you download the sources, you will need a compiler, make, maybe some \nother tools found on most systems, and run makeinstall. The contributer \nwho created the binary package already did this for you!\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004697.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
