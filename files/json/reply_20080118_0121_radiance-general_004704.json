{"body": "> double-checked my exporter for ARRIS and it does export to OBJ.\n\n\nIf it does not work - you can export to Sketchup from Arris, and the \nSketchup-Format is supported by Thomas Bleicher's converter:\n\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/su2rad/\n\n\nIf there are problems, you can send a typical model (not to the list) in \n  obj and sketchup format to check which way will work with Radiance.\n\n\nI still wonder if there was not a direct export... I remember something \nlike the export interface in Octree CAD had been developed from a Arris \nversion, but I may be wrong.\n\n\n> verion 3.6 was a typing error. I did download 3.8 Yes, I am more\n> interested in pictures rather than lighting analysis\n\n\nYou will need a nice material library for that. Radiance can transport \nthe light, but you have to define the reflecting surfaces ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004704.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
