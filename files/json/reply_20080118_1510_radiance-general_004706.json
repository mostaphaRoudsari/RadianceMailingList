(just try 'ls -l /usr/local/ \nbin/rad')\n\n\nIt does not matter where the binaries for Radiance are installed as long\nas you have the directory path in your PATH environment variable. If  \neverything\nis installed in /usr/local/radiance3.8/ you need an entry for $PATH like\n'/usr/local/radiance3.8:/usr/bin:...'. Typically the application  \nspecific\ndirectories are first in the list, followed by the general system  \ndirectories.\n\n\nRAYPATH is used by Radiance internally. If a file can not be found  \nimmediately\nin the current scene directory. I don't have it defined on my system and\nRadiance works fine (it may be essential for the first example scenes  \nyou'r\ngoing to use, though!).\n> X11 is running.

Path names\non Unix systems are case sensitive, btw.\n\n\nPlease look for the directory that contains 'rad', 'rpict' and 'rtrace'.\nThis directory is where all your executables are installed and this  \nshould\nbe in your PATH.\n\n\nBTW: You can always run a program with the full path\n(i. e. '/opt/Radiance3.8a/ray/bin/rad scene.rif') but that's neither  \nconvenient\nnor will it help you if a Radiance binary is called from within a scene\nfile.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004706.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 18, 2008 at 03:10PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004705", "id": "radiance-general_004706"}
