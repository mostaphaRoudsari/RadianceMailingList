On Windows the locations data file\nis named differently which I haven't taken care of yet.\n\n\n> my render settings are as follows:\n>\n> < Scene_1.oct\n> \trvu -vu 0 0 1 -vf views/Scene_1.vf -ps 1 -pt .04 -dp 2048 -ar 105 - \n> ms 0.24 -ds .1 -dj .65 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01 -ab 3 - \n> aa .1 -ad 1536 -as 768 -av 8 8 8 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -R Scene_1.rif -o  \n> x11 -pe -4 Scene_1.oct\n\n\nYou can reduce the QUALITY setting in the .rif file to increase\nthe speed of the preview image. You can increase the 'ab' setting\nseparately ('render=' option in the rif file) if the settings\nrad would create are too low.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004709.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 19, 2008 at 01:02PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004707", "id": "radiance-general_004709"}
