{"body": "Mark this almost solved..\nWell I am using Sketchup export with SU2RAD. Initially, I was trying to view the sunpatchs on the far wall and floorplan with viewer's back to the window. When I rendered with the view towards the window opening (and gensky with +s sunny sky) I couldn't 'see' the sun patch. But when I checked with sketchup, I could see where a sunpatch should be, but it didn't appear in the render. To make sure ,I used sketchup shadow with time and location that shows a sunpatch clearly. Time is set 07:49am EST in sketchup; after export the generated sky file shows:\n\n\n!gensky 10 31 +02:49 -a 45.52 -o 73.57 -m 75.0 +s -g 0.2 -t 1.7| xform -rz -0.0\n\n\nobviously not what I wanted..So it renders correctlafter I manualy set the time to 07:49....could it be the exporter causing the 5hr difference???\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004710.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steve michel", "created_at": "January 19, 2008 at 08:54PM", "created_by": "steve_michel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004707", "id": "radiance-general_004710"}
