{"body": "Hi Prasanta,\n\n\nI'm not sure how (in terms of code) you're trying to extract the luminance values and how you'd be processing them, but I've faced a similar task some time back and tried to document the syntax in a easy-to-reuse way.\n\n\nhttp://www.yichunhuang.com/radiance_pic/rgbe.html\n\n\nat the bottom of the page, I've included a draft java file that eventually allowed me to access pixel values easily. (Did not have time to update with latest files...) Hope this is useful.\n\n\nCheers,\nYC Huang\nCenter for Building Performance and Diagnostics\nCarnegie Mellon University\n_________________________________________________________________\nEasily manage multiple email accounts with Windows Live Mail!\nhttp://www.get.live.com/wl/all\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004718.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "yijun huang", "created_at": "January 22, 2008 at 12:14PM", "created_by": "yijun_huang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004660", "id": "radiance-general_004718"}
