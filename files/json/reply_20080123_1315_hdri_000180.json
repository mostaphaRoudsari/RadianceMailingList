{"body": "Hi Magali!\n\n\nThe SIGMA 8mm fisheye will work on a more reasonably priced camera with a\ncropped sensor (usually about factor 1.6 or 1.3), but you won't capture the\nfull circle of 180deg.\nHowever, I read a while ago that SIGMA is planning to release a full 180deg\nfisheye for cropped sensors (like those used in the entry and semi-pro SLR\nlines). \nHere are the links: \nhttp://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3336&navigator=6\nhttp://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3337&navigator=6\n\n\nThese can then be combined with the more affordable Canon or Nikon SLR\nbodies.\n\n\nA benefit of a 36x24 sensor (full frame) might be the better low light\nsensitivity due to larger photosites (pixels). It might be therefore worth\nto give the camera systems of choice a try if possible if they fit your\nneed.\n\n\nCheers,\nTimo\n\n\n\n\nTimo Kunkel\nUniversity of Bristol\nUK\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-January/000180.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Timo Kunkel", "created_at": "January 23, 2008 at 01:15PM", "created_by": "Timo_Kunkel", "parent_id": "hdri_000178", "id": "hdri_000180"}
