{"body": "Hi Magali,\n\n\nSigma just released a 4.5 mm 180 degree fisheye for APS-C size (the \nsmaller sensors) digital SLR cameras.\nhttp://www.sigmaphoto.com/news/news.asp?nID=3377\n\n\nI just received one yesterday from B+H photo in New York and so far it \nseems to deliver as promised. I'm using it with a Nikon D50.\n\n\nQuestion (sorry if this is back to basics but despite many archive \nsearches I'm still at a loss):\nWhen viewing an HDR image with \"ximage\" and taking spot measurements \nwith the \"L\" command I get reasonably accurate luminance values.  When I \nmap the HDR image as an emissive glow on to a \"source\" geometry and view \nthe scene with \"rvu\" I get much lower luminance values than at the same \nspots measured in ximage.  Below is the scene description:\n########\nvoid colorpict skypict\n11 red green blue sky.hdr fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rz 180 -rx -90\n0\n0\n\n\nskypict glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\n\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n#########\n\n\nMy end goal is to document various sky conditions to be used for IBL \nscenes.\n\n\nHappy New Year and thanks in advance.\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-January/000181.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "January 23, 2008 at 02:18PM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "hdri_000179", "id": "hdri_000181"}
