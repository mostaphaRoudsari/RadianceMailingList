I've used\nboth systems in the past, and would happily point out the pros/cons of\nCP990 vs CP995. They actually differ quite a bit. Let me know if you\nwould consider this option.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-January/000182.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 24, 2008 at 01:29AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000178", "id": "hdri_000182"}
