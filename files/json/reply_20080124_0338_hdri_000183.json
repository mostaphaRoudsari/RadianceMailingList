{"body": "Hi Magali,\n\n\nI agree with Axel's comment. There are also some new(er) cameras that can use the FC-E8 or FC-E9(an improved version) Check http://nikonimaging.com/global/products/accessory/converter/list.htm  I've used the Coolpix 5000, and they work very well in my experience.\n\n\nHowever, be aware that with the latest model (Nikon Coolpix P5100) which I believe can take the fish-eye with an adaptor, you cannot use bracketing in manual mode which can be problematic, but that depends on the application.\n\n\nGood luck with your measurements, and please keep us posted.\nRegards,\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-January/000183.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "January 24, 2008 at 03:38AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "hdri_000178", "id": "hdri_000183"}
