{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThis is more of a Radiance question, I suppose, but the problem is  \nthat you have an EXPOSURE= value in your header that ximage is smart  \nabout, but the renderer ignores.  To get absolute values out of rvu,  \neither set a factor in your glow to 1/EXPOSURE (in all three  \nchannels) or \"undo\" the exposure by passing your picture through  \npfilt with -e set to the reciprocal of the exposure getinfo tells you.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Having the renderers ignore the EXPOSURE line was a design  \ndecision to facilitate texture normalization under the more typical  \ncircumstance when it is being used to modify reflectance.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-January/000184.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 24, 2008 at 01:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000179", "id": "hdri_000184"}
