{"body": "Hi Steve,\n\n\nThis is additional information to what Thomas wrote.  You can  \nmanually set the MDIR environment variable to the actual path on your  \nsystem.  (Note that this variable only takes a single path directory,  \nwhich must end with '/'.)  The objpict script does seem to be hard- \ncoded, which is a mistake you can correct as Thomas suggested by  \nediting the file.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004724.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 24, 2008 at 01:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004720", "id": "radiance-general_004724"}
