{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nYou have the source code, so you are free to do what you like with  \nit.  The linear interpolation routines are in src/rt/data.c.  You  \nshould be careful that whatever interpolant you use does not go  \noutside the limits of the input data.  Bicubic interpolation is  \nnotorious for producing negative values on all-positive input data,  \nsomething that can be problematic in a lighting simulation....\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004725.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 24, 2008 at 02:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004722", "id": "radiance-general_004725"}
