If  \nit's a low brightness downlight or something similar with good  \nshielding, It may just be that your viewing angle to the light source  \nis shallow enough that you cannot see any luminance.  Radiance will  \nrender the disc according to what the ies file says is appropriate  \nfor that angle.  It does tend to appear \"all or nothing\", that is, if  \nyou're looking straight up into the fixture the disc is all white and  \nvery shallow angles appear all black.  If you want to model the  \nappearance of the light fixture itself, you will have to get a little  \nfancier and model the geometry, include a glow material for the lamp  \nbrightness, and enclose the whole thing in an illum sphere and apply  \nthe luminance distribution to that.  This is well detailed in RwR and  \nin various posts on this list.  I have little experience doing this  \nwithout the help of front ends like Rayfront, but several people  \naround here are.  For my needs, the default rendering of the light  \nsources is generally adequate.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004727.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 26, 2008 at 07:51AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004720", "id": "radiance-general_004727"}
