For a downlight you\nshould not need any rotation, just lift (xform -t) the *.rad file to\nthe right height and place in your scene.\n\n\n> therefore my needs are simply to show a glow for the lens on the same\n> plane as the ceiling.

They will only  \ninterfere\nwith you're distribution. The only problem is that the polygon will have\nthe size of the luminous area not the of the actual fitting.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004730.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 27, 2008 at 03:31AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004720", "id": "radiance-general_004730"}
