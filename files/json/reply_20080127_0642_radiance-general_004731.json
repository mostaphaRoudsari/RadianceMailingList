{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nMARK THIS SOLVED\n\n\n\n\nI had created a 'glow' material and applying it to the same polygon in my ies.rad file. SO I got a render with my fixtures showing but still no illumination! I was trying to overlap or layer a glow material on a distribution's polygon. So you are right that the two might interfere. (But I can see where that might be useful to avoid  the extra step of two distinct polygon geometry for the same thing (which I have done before with erco fixtures 3d geometry)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT The simpler method of deleting the -i option in ies2rad worked...I see the fixture and the light distribution...\n\n\nThe next challenge is to use a single light distribution material and apply to multiple similar geometry in the scene... To isolate the problem, I've been hand editing each fixture geometry and duplicating the same ies.rad parameters to each...\n\n\n\n\nthanks to all\nSteve\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004731.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steve michel", "created_at": "January 27, 2008 at 06:42AM", "created_by": "steve_michel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004720", "id": "radiance-general_004731"}
