The accuracy of the rendering would not necessarily affect \nthe accuracy of the scene; if anything, sun patches would improve the \naccuracy of the results for a given set of settings.  I wouldn't worry \nabout the appearance of an illuminance image, if the values are \ncorrect.  I recommend you use the falsecolor tool to generate some \nfalsecolor images of your scene, so you can do a thorough investigation \nof the whole image's values.  And of course for absolute accuracy of a \nvalidation you should use rtrace and calculate values at specific points \nthat you can verify with hand calcs.  This will be more accurate than \ninterpolating a glob of colors in a falsecolor image, or even picking \npoints off the image in ximage. \n\n\nAlso, have you tried rad yet?  rad can make very intelligent guesses \nabout appropriate settings for rpict, based on your simple inputs of \nscene size (max dimension), image QUALITY (high-medium-low), VARIABILITY \nor range of light in the space (high-medium-low), and DETAIL or model \ncomplexity (high-medium-low).  This is a great tool and you can even use \nit and just output the settings to a text file to inspect.  You can \nlearn about the variables that way, by changing one of the parameters \nabove and see the ramifications on the rpict/rtrace settings.  The use \nof rad is covered well in RwR, as is the practice of performing \nsensitivity studies on your models and parameters, to find a sweet spot \nin terms of accuracy/time.  This dance is done on every project, but \neventually you will develop a feel for setting these parameters, at \nleast roughly. \n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004737.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 28, 2008 at 12:35PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004735", "id": "radiance-general_004737"}
