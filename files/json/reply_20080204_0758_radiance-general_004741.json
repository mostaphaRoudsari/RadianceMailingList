{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nIt is possible to do what you want, but you need to first generate a  \nview using rpict at a high resolution with the -z option to specify a  \ndepth buffer for output.  Then, give the picture and depth buffer to  \npinterp with the desired orthogonal view and resolution for your  \nfalsecolor isoluminance image.  Pass the output to falsecolor and  \ngenerate your contours.  The actual values will correspond to the  \noriginal rpict view, but the image will be reprojected into your  \northogonal view.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004741.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 04, 2008 at 07:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004740", "id": "radiance-general_004741"}
