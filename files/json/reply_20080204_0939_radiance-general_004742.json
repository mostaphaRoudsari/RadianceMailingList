{"body": "Wonderfull!!! \n\n\nSo powerfull is Radiance!! :o)\n\n\nThat's really what I wanted ! Thank you very much !!!\n\n\nNow let's see if I'm able to really do it ! :-P\n\n\nJust a curiosity. Pinterp just interpolates datas, right? So as much going far from the observer, as loosing detail, isn't it? This is probably the reason why I need high resolution image. \n\n\nIt is not possible to just calculate the points needed for the last image orthogonal one) from the observer point of view , and save results in an image format? It would probably need just a quite simple script (which calls rtrace many times) and could save much render time (definition is only were needed). Am I right? Or there is something I didn't contemplate?\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.Hi Lucio,\n.\n.It is possible to do what you want, but you need to first generate a  \n.view using rpict at a high resolution with the -z option to specify a  \n.depth buffer for output.  Then, give the picture and depth buffer to  \n.pinterp with the desired orthogonal view and resolution for your  \n.falsecolor isoluminance image.  Pass the output to falsecolor and  \n.generate your contours.  The actual values will correspond to the  \n.original rpict view, but the image will be reprojected into your  \n.orthogonal view.\n.\n.Hope this helps!\n.-Greg\n.\n.>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004742.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefano Ponzetti", "created_at": "February 04, 2008 at 09:39AM", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004740", "id": "radiance-general_004742"}
