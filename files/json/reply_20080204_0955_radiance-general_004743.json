{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nYes, it is true that pinterp needs to fill in missing pixel values,  \nwhich is why you need a very high resolution image.  (In fact, it  \nwould make sense to set the vertical resolution higher than the  \nhorizontal resolution, with the -pa 0 option to allow non-square  \npixels.)  However, the results should still be valid.\n\n\nIf you are concerned about calculation efficiency, then you could  \nwrite a script as you suggest.  First, you would use vwrays to feed  \nrtrace and get it to generate intersection points for all the  \npositions on the orthogonal view.  Second, you would apply a script  \nto convert these positions to directions from the observer for a  \nsecond rtrace run that would compute your radiance values.  This  \nwould be output to an image.  I guess it would go something like:\n\n\n% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \\\n\t| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct \\\n\t| rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ' \\\n\t| rtrace -ffc -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \\\n\t| falsecolor -cl -s auto \\\n\t| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif\n\n\nwhere XRES and YRES are the desired map resolution and OX, OY, and OZ  \nare the observer coordinates.  (E.g., add -e 'OX:10.5;OY:-3.9;OZ=2'  \nto the rcalc line.)\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.  It may require some adjustments -- I didn't  \ntest it out!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004743.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 04, 2008 at 09:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004740", "id": "radiance-general_004743"}
