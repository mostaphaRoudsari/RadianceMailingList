Create a falsecolor image from this rendering. Then use  \nthe\ngenerated image as a texture to colour your street. The texture  \nrotation would be\nthe view direction of your observer. Render the street from above  \njust for the\ntexture effect (no second falsecolor).\n\n\nAgain the first image should be large to provide more details. The  \nsecond rendering\ncould be done in any 3D modeller with sufficient control for texture  \nmapping (Blender\nfor example).\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004744.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 04, 2008 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004740", "id": "radiance-general_004744"}
