{"body": "Thanks to Rob for his thoughtful response...\n\n\nRegarding the HEAD release, those who are willing to compile their  \nown copy of Radiance (generally implying they are on some flavor of  \nUnix) may download the latest changes from www.radiance-online.org by  \nfollowing the \"Download Radiance\" link along the left frame and going  \nto \"latest version\" to grab last night's source tree.  This will  \ninclude whatever changes and bug fixes have been made since the last  \nrelease.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004753.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2008 at 04:22PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004751", "id": "radiance-general_004753"}
