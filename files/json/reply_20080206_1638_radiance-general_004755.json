{"body": "Hello Ji-hyun,\n\n\nI was very embarrassed to find the following message sitting in my  \n\"InBox,\" apparently unanswered.  Did anyone else write to you about  \nthis?  It must have come at a busy moment and was forgotten in my  \npile, so I apologize.  Let me know if you are still struggling with  \nthis, and I'll compose a proper response.\n\n\nBasically, you should have a look at the \"glaze\" script included with  \nRadiance.  Jack de Valpine of Visarc requested and sponsored its  \ndevelopment, and the script is specifically targeted at multi-pane  \nwindow systems.  It generates a BRTDfunc, which you may use as a  \nguide in your process.\n\n\nAgain, I am very sorry for the delayed response.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004755.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2008 at 04:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004490", "id": "radiance-general_004755"}
