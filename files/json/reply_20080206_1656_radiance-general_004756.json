{"body": "Hello Aditya,\n\n\nHow do you wish to visualize this information?  Since I presume you  \ndon't have a 3-D display in mind, this leaves you with the problem of  \nprojecting a hemisphere onto a flat image, which is bound to  \nintroduce distortions.  I am attaching two Radiance .cal files, one  \nthat goes from a vector direction to a Tregenza sky patch number as  \nused by Daysim, and the other which performs the reverse  \ntranslation.  It shouldn't be too difficult to convert these files  \ninto something Matlab understands.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n(Beware line-wrapping -- you may need to paste these links manually.)\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ray/src/ \ncal/cal/tregenza.cal?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ray/src/ \ncal/cal/tregsrc.cal?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004756.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2008 at 04:56PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004754", "id": "radiance-general_004756"}
