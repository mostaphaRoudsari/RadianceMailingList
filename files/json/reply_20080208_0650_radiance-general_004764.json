{"body": "Lucio, If you add \"-t [time in seconds]\" to your rpict command line it\nwill periodically report the progress as the calculation runs.  The same\nresult can be had by adding the line \"REPORT= [time in minutes]\" to your\nrif file.  Alternatively, if you prefer not to clutter your terminal,\nyou can pause the process \"<ctrl-z>\" and bring it back to the foreground\n\"fg <enter>\" and it should report the progress once.\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nSent: Friday, 08 February, 2008 9:24 AM\nTo: radiance-general\nSubject: [Radiance-general] rpict progress status\n\n\nHey, it looks like I'm quite monopolizing this mailing list.. I'm\nsorry.. !! \n\n\nSome time ago, if I didn't just dream it, I run into some explanation on\nhow to monitor rpict progress status. If I remember well, it was\nachieved with a light kill message to rpict process. In fact when\nkilling it, it returns the rpict progress. It was a way to achieve same\ninformation without actually killing it. I thought I found this\ninformation in Axel Jacobs' tutorials, but I'm not able to find it any\nmore.\n\n\nCan someone help me ?\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.. Caminante no hay camino, solo se hace camino al andar .. \n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004764.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "February 08, 2008 at 06:50AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004763", "id": "radiance-general_004764"}
