{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nIt's probably easiest just to make the invisible areas zero in the  \nfalsecolor image, which you could do like so:\n\n\n% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \\\n\t| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct > roadpts.flt\n% rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ'  \nroadpts.flt \\\n\t| rtrace -ff -opv -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \\\n\t| rlam -if3 roadpts.flt -if6 - \\\n\t| rcalc -if9 -of -e 's(x):x*x;OK=0.2-s($1-$4)-s($2-$5)-s($3-$6)' \\\n\t\t-e '$1=if(OK,$7,0);$2=if(OK,$8,0);$3=if(OK,$9,0)' \\\n\t| falsecolor -cl -s auto \\\n\t| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif\n% rm roadpts.flt\n\n\nThe usual caveats apply, as I haven't tried this.  If your world  \nunits are cm or something smaller, the 0.2 value might have to be  \nincreased for reliable behavior.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004771.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 10, 2008 at 11:01AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004740", "id": "radiance-general_004771"}
