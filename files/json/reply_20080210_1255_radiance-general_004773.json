{"body": "GREAT !! Simply GREAT !!!!\n\n\nThank you very much Greg. \n\n\nI was missing some knowledge to build up something like that and my printed manpages were not up-to-date as the online ones ..\n\n\nYour help opens me new horizons ! Thank you very much !\n\n\nAnd many thanks also to all the people who helped me with the rpict progress stuff (just giving thanks here to not send to much mails to the forum) ! \n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n .Correction -- missed a step (pvalue):\n.\n.% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \\\n.\t| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct > roadpts.flt\n.% rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ'  \n.roadpts.flt \\\n.\t| rtrace -ff -opv -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \\\n.\t| rlam -if3 roadpts.flt -if6 - \\\n.\t| rcalc -if9 -of -e 's(x):x*x;OK=0.2-s($1-$4)-s($2-$5)-s($3-$6)' \\\n.\t\t-e '$1=if(OK,$7,0);$2=if(OK,$8,0);$3=if(OK,$9,0)' \\\n.\t| pvalue -r -df -h -Y YRES +X XRES \\\n.\t| falsecolor -cl -s auto \\\n.\t| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif\n.% rm roadpts.flt\n.\n.Sorry about that.  It looks like a mess, but basically I'm just  \n.checking intersection values against the ones you get from your  \n.orthogonal view, and I need rcalc for that.  All the -if's and -of's  \n.make it run faster, but aren't really necessary.\n.\n.-Greg\n.\n._______________________________________________\n.Radiance-general mailing list\n.Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n.http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n.\n\n\n..
