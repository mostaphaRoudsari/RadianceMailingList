{"body": "Thank you very much Jack !! \n\n\nI cannot have access to the laboratory pc 'till thursday, then I'll check your suggested step (at evening just not to spend all the day fixing possible problems! :-P even if I don't think they will occurr).\n\n\nWhen tried I'll let you know the exits. \n\n\nJust a (hope not too much) stupid question : what does it mean : \" g++-4.1 - pick a version that matches the level of your current gcc\" ?\n\n\nAt home (where compiling Radiance is possible) I've got all the things you suggested installed in fact. \n\n\nI hope I will manage to compile it by myself with your directives, anyhway: what's the machine you have compiled it for? \n\n\nThank you again !\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.Hi Lucio,\n.\n.I just wanted to follow-up. I went through the steps of compiling \n.radiance on a machine with a relatively stock install of Ubuntu 7.10 \n.(gutsy) (a workstation install). In order to get Radiance to compile I \n.had to add the following using the Synaptics package manager:\n.\n.    * Libraries (these are needed for compiling stock Radiance)\n.          o libc6-dev\n.          o libx11-dev\n.    * Development (these are needed for compiling libtiff and trad)\n.          o g++-4.1 - pick a version that matches the level of your\n.            current gcc\n.          o tcl 8.4\n.\n.Note that in using the Synaptics package manger, the system will also \n.install any needed dependencies for the above packages, so this is the \n.way to go. Note if you do not have csh installed you will also need to \n.install csh.\n.\n.While working through this I also encountered a couple of minor issues \n.in the Radiance Head from last week. I passed some fixes along to Greg \n.and I believe that an updated Head is available.\n.\n.With all of this Radiance compiles with no problems. As an additional \n.though, if there is enough interest (although learning to compile is a \n.good thing to know), I can tar up the binaries I made and make them \n.available for download. Let me know.\n.\n.-Jack\n.\n.loscotec at libero.it wrote:\n.> Thank you very much jack, very kind of you ! \n.>\n.> It wasn't directly radiance breaking my system. \n.>\n.> Im running Ubuntu Gutsy.\n.>\n.> At home I don't have problems, but in my laboratory I do. \n.>\n.> According to someone who tried to help me, I was missing some libraries .
