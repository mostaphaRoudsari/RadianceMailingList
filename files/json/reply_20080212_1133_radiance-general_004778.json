{"body": "Just in case it is not known yet - Radiance is also integrated into ESP-R, a free building simulation system, which will allow you to calculate also thermal behaviour of your design and, most important, supports lots of analysis needs for finding the critical points by e.g. combining internal and external thermal loads over the year. Might be interesting for this project. Be warned, learning curve is even steeper then for Radiance (yes, I guess because it has a GUI ;-)...\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004778.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
