{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nIn the \"development\" section for Synaptics, you will see g++4.1 and \nperhaps some other versions. You will also note that it will show \nversions for gcc, I believe that you need to install the same version \nnumber (in this case 4.1, but you should check what gcc you have installed).\n\n\nThe compile that I did is generic, that is I did not make any \narchitecture specific settings. So I would hope that this would run on a \nsimilar linux installation.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nloscotec at libero.it wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004779.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 12, 2008 at 11:37AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004775", "id": "radiance-general_004779"}
