{"body": "The dilemma is - The same illuminance distribution that's well above the \ndesign fc level under sunny sky conditions is well below that threshold \nunder standard clear sky. I just double check to make sure it's meeting \nthe LEED criteria of 75% of space meeting 25 fc at noon on June 21 under \nclear sky conditions and it almost never does (I use the standard clear \nsky in IES Radiance for that).\n\n\n-The CIE clear sky is a sky model which has no direct sun input (clear sky \nin Radiance, without sun). Does your LEED criteria refer to real life \nclear sky condition, or the CIE model? Real life clear sky would \ncorrespond to a sunny sky description.\n\n\nKind regards,\n______________________________\nNicolas Roy\nVELUX A/S\nStrategic Marketing\nDaylight Energy and Indoor Climate\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004788.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicolas Roy", "created_at": "February 15, 2008 at 01:25AM", "created_by": "Nicolas_Roy", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004782", "id": "radiance-general_004788"}
