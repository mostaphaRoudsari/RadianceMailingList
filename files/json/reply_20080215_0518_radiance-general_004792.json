{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nLooking at what you are doing with rcalc, it looks like you are assuming \na 10,000 lux overcast CIE sky. While this is fine, you do need to tell \ngensky the output of the desired sky explicitly. To do this you can use \nthe -B switch and provide the horizontal diffuse irradiance. This can be \ncalculated as 10,000/179 = 55.866 w/m^2. With this your gensky line \nshould read:\n\n\ngensky 6 21 12 -c -a 59.9 -o 10.8 -m -15.00 -B 55.866\n\n\nWith this you should get some different results in your rcalc.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nPS: for further reading on this you should take a look at Chapter 6: \nDaylighting Simulation in /Rendering with Radiance/, this chapter is by \nJohn Mardaljevic.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004792.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 15, 2008 at 05:18AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004791", "id": "radiance-general_004792"}
