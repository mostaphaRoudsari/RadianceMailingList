{"body": "Thank you Greg!\n\n\nI imagined it was a wait-period problem, so I tried giving manually some \" rpiece @args \" invocation after minutes, and it didn't work as well. In addiction, setting -X and -Y directly in args and not in the sync file does work correctly (I've used it many times) withouth any wait-period. \n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n. .Hi Lucio,\n.\n.It's difficult to say why this didn't work as you originally had it,  \n.but it's generally a good idea to insert a pause of a couple of  \n.seconds between each invocation of rpiece, to give it time to lock  \n.its files.  This isn't reliable on all systems, otherwise.\n.\n.-Greg\n.\n.>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004798.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefano Ponzetti", "created_at": "February 16, 2008 at 01:06AM", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004796", "id": "radiance-general_004798"}
