Same for Lenny when it is released - while I can't update\nthe released version, I can always provide backports of the version in\ntesting to the last released version of Debian.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004800.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "February 16, 2008 at 03:42PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004758", "id": "radiance-general_004800"}
