{"body": "Hello Stefan,\n\n\nThis is simply the round-off error associated with the Radiance RGBE  \nformat.  Since the picture format uses three mantissas with a common   \nexponent, it is not possible to represent a non-zero value in one  \nchannel and a zero value in another channel.  Even though the actual  \nbyte stored for green and blue may be zero in your calculation, the  \ndecoder will interpret this as half a count out of 255 and give a  \ncorresponding value.\n\n\nSince the main purpose of Radiance is lighting calculations for  \nvisual simulation, and the eye's color channels have a (more or less)  \nlinear response, this is an appropriate/adequate representations for  \nthe design application.  If you need the original floating point  \nvalues, and don't mind files than are about 5 times bigger, you can  \nuse vwrays with rtrace and output floating point images directly.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004803.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 18, 2008 at 05:43AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004802", "id": "radiance-general_004803"}
