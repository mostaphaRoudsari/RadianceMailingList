{"body": "Hello Nick,\n\n\nI downloaded your files and from looking at your geometry briefly I would say that Ecotect i.e. you created some very small polygons (0.0001 meters on one side) that Radiance considers zero-area polygons. When I run oconv or getbbox on your scene file I get 28 warnings like this one:\n\n\ngetbbox: warning - zero area for polygon \"zone02.rad00000\"  \n\n\nLooking at polygon zone02.rad00000 I find a valid polygon description but I guess Radiance has some limitation with regards to geometry. Are you sure you are modelling in the correct scale?\n\n\nRegards,\n Erwin\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: [Radiance-general] ecotect export - missing surfaces (18-Feb-2008 16:31)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004805.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "February 19, 2008 at 05:16AM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004804", "id": "radiance-general_004805"}
