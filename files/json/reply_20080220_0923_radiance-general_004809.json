{"body": "Well, I'm somewhat familiar with the code, and I can't even tell  \nyou.  I know there are places where formatting limits the number of  \nsignificant figures produced in the scene files, but xform at least  \ntries not to lose too much.  I also know that a frozen octree  \nconverts the 64-bit floating point value to a 32-bit mantissa (with  \nsign bit) and an 8-bit exponent, which maintains about 9 significant  \ndecimal digits.  If what matters to you is in the 8th or 9th decimal  \nplace, you're in dangerous territory.  (By comparison, a 64-bit IEEE  \ndouble has about 15 significant digits.)\n\n\nSo, I agree with Erwin's recommendation of applying xform in cases  \nwhere you are starting to strain your significant digits,  \nparticularly if you are putting your scene into a frozen octree.  It  \nis also a good idea to work in world units that don't make your  \ncoordinate values too large or too small (large being on the order of  \n10^8 and small being on the order of 10^-4).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004809.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 20, 2008 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004804", "id": "radiance-general_004809"}
