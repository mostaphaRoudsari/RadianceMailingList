I have some code in my .profile that  \nautomatically loads X11 when I open a terminal window (if it's not  \nalready running) since many times when I open a terminal window I'm  \nabout to use Radiance, but you could just remember to start up X11  \nprior to running any of the graphical Radiance apps.\n\n\n>\n> finally, is rvu the same as rview?\n\n\nMark got this one already; it was renamed to avoid a very common  \nalias conflict on most Linux systems (with vim).\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004817.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 20, 2008 at 07:07PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004810", "id": "radiance-general_004817"}
