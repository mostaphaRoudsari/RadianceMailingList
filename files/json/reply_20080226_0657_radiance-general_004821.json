{"body": "Aditya,\n\n\nThere are some .deb files for debian/ubuntu here:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/software/binaries/rad3R8_linux.tar.gz\n\n\nUsually when I build from scratch I need to install tk8.3 and csh from the\nubuntu repo, so maybe you are just missing those dependencies (I did not see\ntk8.3 in the tutorial's list to apt-get and I'm not sure if tcsh is the same\nas csh or not). One other thing to check is taht typically when you're in\nUbuntu Bash or Dash is the default shell. I usually run into problems when\nrunning makeall for radiance in either of these two shells, so try using Csh\ninstead while compiling.\n\n\nHope that helps!\nDave\n\n\n2008/2/25 aditya potipireddi <aditect at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004821.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Maino", "created_at": "February 26, 2008 at 06:57AM", "created_by": "David_Maino", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004819", "id": "radiance-general_004821"}
