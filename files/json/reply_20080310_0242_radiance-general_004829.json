{"body": "It's been a while since I last installed Radiance - so memory may be  \nhazy - but I believe you may need to create the /tmp directory and  \nset permissions also.\n-John\n\n\nPS.  X11 on Leopard is a little clunky.  If you start it from an X11  \nicon in the dock, you may end up with two X11 icons.  Which doesn't  \nhurt, but it is annoying nonetheless.  The workaround I stumbled upon  \nwas to drag the X11 application icon to the lower-left pane of the  \nFinder (i.e. making a  shortcut X11 icon), and then starting X11 from  \nthat.\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004829.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "March 10, 2008 at 02:42AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004827", "id": "radiance-general_004829"}
