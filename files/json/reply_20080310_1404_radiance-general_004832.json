{"body": "Dear Steve,\n\n\nThe 'l' command in ximage applies the 179 lumens/watt conversion  \nfactor, so if the input is a picture created by rpict with the -i  \noption, you should be seeing lux values on your opaque surfaces.  If  \nyou are off by a factor of ten, then I would suspect the input values  \nor the calculation are at fault.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004832.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2008 at 02:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004831", "id": "radiance-general_004832"}
