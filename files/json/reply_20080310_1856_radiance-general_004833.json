{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nThanks for confirming the conversion factor..that was a the gap in my knowledge of radiance.  Now,  without getting into into sordid details, the scene pic in question has a skylight and some T5 direct/indirect lighting. From the rendered night and day pics all seems well with ximage's human exposure setting corroborating with what  I would expect. The daytime pic shows strong illumination on the  work plane but yields a 'lux' value lower than I expected (250 to 300). I did not use a secondary lightsource for the skylight.  With a night, with only the T5 luminaires (ies2rad in meters), which, from manufacturer's data and experience, should give a 300 to 500lux illuminance, gives me a reading approx. 40lux(?). \n\n\n\n\nI tried rtrace (courtesy of man pages) with ximage -t command on the daytime pic\n$ ximage office-i.pic | rtrace  -h  -x  1  -i office2xx.oct | rcalc -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'\n18.3891712\n21.1014687\n20.6663913\n???\n\n\nI like ximage's interactive features, but something may be missing in that pipe  to rcalc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIm using radiance to better (re)present my interior designs but\nfeel out place here using scientific instruments for my art supplies\n\n\n\n\nthnks always\nSteve\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004833.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steve michel", "created_at": "March 10, 2008 at 06:56PM", "created_by": "steve_michel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004831", "id": "radiance-general_004833"}
