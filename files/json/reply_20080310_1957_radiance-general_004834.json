{"body": "Hi Steve,\n\n\nA direct/indirect fixture needs an interreflection calculation for  \nany level of accuracy.  I recommend setting -ab 1 on the rtrace  \ncommand line, maybe even -ab 2.  This will take considerably longer  \nto produce a result, but should be closer to what you expect if there  \nis nothing amiss with your model.  The command you are using  \notherwise looks OK.\n\n\nI'm a little surprised by the factor of 10, unless the fixture throws  \nover 90% of its light towards the ceiling.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004834.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2008 at 07:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004831", "id": "radiance-general_004834"}
