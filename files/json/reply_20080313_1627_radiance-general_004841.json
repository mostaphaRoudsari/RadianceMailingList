{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n  I'm new to Radiance and am trying to follow Scene 1 in Rendering With Radiance (1998).  However, it fails to produce the same results.  The following problems occured:\n\n\n  ***\n  Page 55 - I defined brown_satin_paint in the material1.rad file like what the book suggested in P.46.  When I tried to use the function \"oconv\", however, the following line appears:\n\n\n  oconv: warning - (!genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_nw 4 ...... 0 0 2.5): empty file\n\n\n  Page 55 - When I ran the \"rview\" function, either one of the following lines appeared:\n\n\n  Unknown option argument: \"-10\"\n  Unknown option argument: \"-av\"\n  ***\n\n\n  Is it that Radiance commands have been revised and the book becomes obsolete, or have I not installed the program properly (I run it in Fedora)?  Any suggestions on how I can learn Radiance more effectively? \n\n\n  Thanks a lot for your help!!\n\n\n  Kam\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004841.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kam Shing Leung", "created_at": "March 13, 2008 at 04:27PM", "created_by": "Kam_Shing_Leung", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003801", "id": "radiance-general_004841"}
