{"body": "Hi Kam,\n\n\nSounds like a path problem -- make sure that your PATH variable is  \nset with the executable directory for Radiance appearing before  \nothers in the list.  The \"rview\" name has been taken over by the  \n\"vim\" editor, so use \"rvu\" instead.  I don't know of a conflict with  \ngenprism -- this you should try running on the command line to see if  \nthere is a problem with its arguments.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  For future, please don't copy the digest in your e-mail.  Thanks.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004842.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 13, 2008 at 04:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003801", "id": "radiance-general_004842"}
