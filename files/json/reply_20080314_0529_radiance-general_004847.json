{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI need it for importing the per-pixel normals into a program I am \nwriting myself, which will estimate the scene illumination conditions \nfrom an image of a scene. I have a 3D model of the scene, I know the \ncamera position and orientation relative to the scene, and from the \ncamera I get the \"measured reflected radiances\". Given the per-pixel \nnormal information I have developed a method for estimating the \nillumination conditions in the scene ... makes sense?\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004847.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus B.
