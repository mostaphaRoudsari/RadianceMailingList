{"body": "Hi Valeria,\n\n\nThis is probably one for the FAQ (if only there was a FAQ)...   \nRadiance has a preferred color space, but it does not require that  \nyou use it.  You can assign the three (RGB) channels to be anything  \nyou like, including total solar transmission/reflectance/whatever.   \nBear in mind that solar heat gain is also affected by thermal  \nconductance and convection, which are not considered in an optical  \nray-tracing calculation such as Radiance.  To the extent that IR  \nbehaves as visible light, however, Radiance may be trusted.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004858.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2008 at 10:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004853", "id": "radiance-general_004858"}
