{"body": "> thank you for your reply!  How can I change the contents of the channels?\n\n\nYou do not have to \"change\" them, you must enter the values for any \nsimulation anyway. Define three channels you need, and enter them just \nas you would do with red green and blue values in their corresponding \nfields when defining reflection, transmission and emission of your \nsurfaces. Of course you must know the properties of you sources and \nsurface materials for these channels. The point is that in your mind, \nyou have to replace the meaning of the RGB-values, usually taken as \nRedGreenBlue, with Channel1Channel2Channel3. Colors are just \"channels\" \nof radiance in this meaning, so just change the wavelength and you can \nuse it for anything ;-)\n\n\nOf course as Greg already wrote you should consider if the effects of \nradiance that are modeled in Radiance are enough or if you need other \nenergy transports for your work, too.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004861.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
