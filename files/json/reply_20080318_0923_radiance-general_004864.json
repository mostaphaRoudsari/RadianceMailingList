{"body": "Hi Chas,\n\n\n> Can you please explain how the \"planospheric\" fisheye projecting\n> differs from the \"-vta\" angular fisheye project with \"-vh 180\"?\n\n\nHmm, I thought I'd done that in the PDF. Typically, all fisheye\nprojections are used with a -vh and -vv of 180. The difference is the\nprojection of the hemisphere onto a flat surface. Let me know where\nthe PDF needs some more clarifications.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004864.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 18, 2008 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004851", "id": "radiance-general_004864"}
