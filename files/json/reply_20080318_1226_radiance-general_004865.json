{"body": "Axel,\n\n\nJust out of curiosity, in your projections.pdf document, the fish eye views show a scene that is mirrored on the top and bottom of the image.  Why is this?  If the view is looking straight up, I would think there would only be one building, one arch, one fountain, etc..  Also, the bottom of the image is darker than the top.  Can you explain?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004865.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark de la Fuente", "created_at": "March 18, 2008 at 12:26PM", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004851", "id": "radiance-general_004865"}
