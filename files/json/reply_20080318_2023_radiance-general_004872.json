Your stuff stands as one  \nof the most interesting applications of Radiance, physics, and art.   \nI love it.  And like Jack, I'd love to hear more about the process of  \ngenerating and rendering the model, if you have time to share!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004872.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 18, 2008 at 08:23PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004868", "id": "radiance-general_004872"}
