{"body": "Jack, Rob,\n\n\nI did a short talk about building the piece at SIG06, and again \n(with a little more detail, and more production images) to an art \ngroup here in Boston last year. Here are both PDFs:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/sketches_0621_Mark_Stock.pdf\n(start at page 10)\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/image/talk_collusion/collision_talk_5.pdf\n(start at page 35)\n\n\nIn summary:\n\n\n> How did you generate the geometry?\nMy fluid PhD code made the underlying mesh, a simple custom \nprogram created an open-topped box above every triangle.\n\n\n> How did you decide how to light the scene?\nI wanted an alien sky, so I used my skycolor.cal file with a pink \nzenith and colder (bluish) horizon. Actually, there must have \nbeen an error in the .cal file, because the horizon is pretty \nnoisy. I didn't fix it because it added some nice, odd colors to \nthe polygons that were facing down.\n\n\n> How long did your scene take to to render?\n602 hours. I think I spread the job across two single-core \nmachines that I have here at home.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Tue, 18 Mar 2008, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004874.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "March 19, 2008 at 07:31AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004868", "id": "radiance-general_004874"}
