When I export, it \ncreates a bunch of materials but names them all \"default_material\".  \nPerhaps the new material library function is causing this?  Is there a \nway to get the previous version back?  On the google site, you have a \nver_c but you also made a ver_d prior to the current one, which worked \ngreat for me.  I hope you still have that earlier ver_d, because I \noverwrote mine and this one doesn't work for me yet and I was hoping to \nuse your script this week! \n\n\nLet me know, and thanks for updating it.  Maybe I'm just not using the \nmaterial library function properly?\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004875.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 20, 2008 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004852", "id": "radiance-general_004875"}
