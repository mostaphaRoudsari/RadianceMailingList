{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nI'm sure there are better, newer references out there, but here's a  \nplace to start:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/sg96crs.pdf\n\n\nA quick google search of the terms \"radiance materials library\" led  \nto some online material from my old friend Kevin Matthews:\n\n\n\thttp://www.designlaboratory.com/computing/tools/radiance/radmatlib.html\n\n\nThere are some dependencies on some .cal files, which you may have to  \nfind elsewhere.  I know we worked on something like this at the LESO/ \nEPFL, but I don't know what became of it.  I don't think much was  \ndone with collecting specular materials.  You can find almost  \nanything you like out there in the big wide world, so a library will  \nnever be more than a random sample.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004877.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 21, 2008 at 04:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004867", "id": "radiance-general_004877"}
