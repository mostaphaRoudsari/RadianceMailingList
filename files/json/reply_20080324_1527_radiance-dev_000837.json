{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n> I am trying to compile on Solaris 10 using the Sun Studio compiler but\n> am having issues. In particular, rpict does not get made (amongst other\n> things).

For the Debian\npackage I re-qrote makeall, but that's not platform independent.\nAlthough I could come up with a proper Makefile replacement for makeall,\nif there's interest.\nAlso make sure to use the latest HEAD from cvs, probably it just works\nthen. Unfortunately I don't have access to a Solaris box anymore - my\nlast machines from SUN are working for the Debian project now ;)\n\n\n\n\nHope that helps,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-March/000837.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "March 24, 2008 at 03:27PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000835", "id": "radiance-dev_000837"}
