{"body": "Hi Brine,\n\n\nAs far as I know desktop radiance only works with Autocad 2000, If you are\ntrying to install the same on Architectural desktop 2005 It will not work\nfor my experience too. If you are using a Windows OS , there are\nsome binaries written, you might want to check\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php  by Francesco Anselmo. they are\nvery very helpful. If you have questions you can call me at 480.544.4936. I\nlive in tempe.\n\n\nbye\n\n\nAditya Potipireddi\nMS Building Design ( Energy & Climate)\nArizona State University\n\n\n\n\n2008/3/26 Brien Rakoci <BRakoci at fmsolutions.net>:\n\n\n>  I am wondering if there is a way to get Radiance to work with Autodesk\n> Architectural desktop 2005?
