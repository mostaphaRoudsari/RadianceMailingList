{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI think these sky images are only for nice image representation, and\nI'm not sure that they have correct radiance pixel values.\nTo obtain a sky with appropriate luminance distribution (generated\nwith gensky), and beautiful colors and clouds (as on Simon Crone's\nimages), images should be normalized first with normpat and then used\nas Jack explained in previous mail.\n\n\nOn some of Simon's images there is a sun, and when you apply it as a\npattern for a sunny sky made with gensky, you'll obtain a sky with 2\nsuns :)\nSo again I suggest you to use this skies only for artistic or\nrepresentation use, and not for accurate visualizations.\n\n\nIf I'm wrong, please correct me!\n\n\nMarija.\n\n\n2008/4/1 Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004894.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "April 02, 2008 at 04:19AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004890", "id": "radiance-general_004894"}
