{"body": "Hello Terrance,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do have a PATH problem and am now trying to correct the bash profile\nfile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did consider the LEARNiX  CD but was put off from what is written on\ntheir site..\n\n\nIf your Windows data partition (you do have a separate one, don't you?)\nis formatted as FAT or FAT32, you can mount it and save your files. The\nNTFS file system (Window 2000 and XP) is not supported yet.\n\n\nI also managed to read some chapters of the Curtin PDF you gave a link\nto. I couldn't find mention of saving files. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had to smile to myself while reading the PDF - I am always puzzled by\nthe defining of electrical lighting as 'artificial'. Why is that? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, here is a professional lighting designer's request to please\nconsider another term for lighting that is not Sunlight/Daylight!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks again, regards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004900.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Angela Giladi", "created_at": "April 03, 2008 at 11:04PM", "created_by": "Angela_Giladi", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004896", "id": "radiance-general_004900"}
