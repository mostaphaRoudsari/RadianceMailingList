{"body": "Hello Angela,\n\n\nThe Curtin ISO does not use the local hard drive, though it can as\nKnoppix 5.1.1 allows reading and writing to NTFS partitions quite\nhappily.\n\n\nThe method used with our students is to use USB memory devices/hard\ndrives - they are very cheap, come in a variety of sizes etc., no danger\nof endangering the existing installation.\n\n\n\n\n> I had to smile to myself while reading the PDF - I am always puzzled\nby the defining of electrical lighting as 'artificial'.\n\n\nWhat terms would you recommend to use for the generic description of\nlight from the sun and sky dome versus man made (hence artificial or\nconstructed) light sources such as incandescent, etc.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845 Western Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004902.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance McMinn", "created_at": "April 04, 2008 at 12:11AM", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004896", "id": "radiance-general_004902"}
