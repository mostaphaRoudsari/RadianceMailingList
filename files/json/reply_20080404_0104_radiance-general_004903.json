On almost any Linux distribution (and I guess this is true for \nthe two mentioned) it is easily possible to mount (connect) volumes on \nnfs and cifs servers. That means 90% of what is used out there. It is \nalso possible to mount Appleshare, but I am not sure if this is \nsupported in the boot cd's.\n\n\nAnyway, if you are sure that you cygwin radiance does everything you \nwant, and that you won't need a tool not available under windows later, \nI think is it fine to go on. I am actually sitting on a windows pc at \nwork (I have no influence on that ;-), and still kept more or less my \nlinux environment with Openoffice, Scribus, Gimp, Inkscape, even \nBlender, ESP+ and Radiance more or less intact. So switching between OSs \nmay be more a question on very specialized tasks (I have no cluster on \nwindows and do not care about stability here so much) - I have the same \nenvironment on my OS X laptop and the ssh cli'able cluster running \nLinux. So I would not worry so much any more about these.\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004903.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
