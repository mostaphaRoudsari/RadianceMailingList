{"body": "Hello Rob,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been a lighting designer for (holy cow) twenty years now, if you \ninclude my theatre lighting as well as my architectural lighting \nexperience, and I STILL use the term \"artificial\" to describe light \nderived from sources other than the sun and sky, though I also use \n\"electric lighting\" and prefer that. It's still better than \"fake \nlighting\"!\n\n\n-        Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've just returned from 'Light and Building' in Frankfurt. I conducted a\nvery unscientific survey amongst my\n\n\nPLDA colleagues as to which term they preferred...no consensus I'm\nafraid. One fellow member did say\n\n\nthat the German term 'kunstlicht' or 'art light', for artificial light,\ndoes perhaps lack any pejorative (for me) connotation. \n\n\nIt is like saying to a creator of sublime silk flowers for an haute\ncouture Chanel dress that they make artificial flowers, \n\n\n(as in those ghastly plastic things). The comparison is a bit bizarre I\nadmit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Also referring to Terrance McMinn's question) ... it's more than a\nquestion of semantics. \n\n\nI believe that we, as lighting designers, help the architect create a\nquality lit, built, human environment.\n\n\nI emphasize the human environment. \n\n\nIt is quite difficult explaining what 'quality lighting' means; it's\nimpossible to quantify. \n\n\nWe have all come across notions that natural light is good, electrical\nlighting is bad. Not true.  \n\n\nThe onus is on us to carefully choose the correct words in helping us\nconvey our design intent;\n\n\nand the terms we use for describing the different parts of light take on\nadded meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Giladi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004916.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Angela Giladi", "created_at": "April 09, 2008 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Angela_Giladi", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004905", "id": "radiance-general_004916"}
