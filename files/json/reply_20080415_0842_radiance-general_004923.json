{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nYou are better off multiplying the source spectra with the  \nreflectance spectra by hand, then converting to the color space of  \nyour choice.  Radiance does not really do this, and the approximation  \nof three primaries (RGB) multiplied between source and surface is not  \nvery reliable.  See the following paper for more information:\n\n\n\tWard, Greg, Elena Eydelberg-Vileshin, \"Picture Perfect RGB Rendering  \nUsing Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries,\" Thirteenth  \nEurographics Workshop on Rendering (2002), P. Debevec and S. Gibson  \n(Editors), June 2002.\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004923.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 15, 2008 at 08:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004922", "id": "radiance-general_004923"}
