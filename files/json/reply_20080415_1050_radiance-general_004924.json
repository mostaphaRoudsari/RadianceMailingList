{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nFirst, I apologise for starting a \"new\" topic rather than doing a reply to\nyour post. I know message board ettiquite but I haven't figured out how to\n\"reply\" yet.\n\n\nI'm just an undergrad in architectural engineering, and I haven't had any\ncourses that went into depth about color or light. So I don't quite follow\nwhat you mean by, \"multiplying the source spectra with the reflectance\" and\n\"converting to color space\". I've looked into it since you've responded and\nnow know what those terms mean, but not how to work with them. I was\nwondering if you could simplify what that entails and what numbers I will\nneed to obtain or measure and then what calculation I would have to do. Is\nthere is an example of what you mean?\n\n\nThank you,\nNick Calcagni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004924.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Calcagni", "created_at": "April 15, 2008 at 10:50AM", "created_by": "Nick_Calcagni", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004922", "id": "radiance-general_004924"}
