{"body": "Dear radiance community,\n\n\nI have been trying to get the su2rad plugin from Thomas Bleicher working on OS X. However, at \nstartup it displays these error messages in a UI.messagebox in sketchup 6:\nundefined method `file_loaded?' for main:Object\n/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp \n6/SketchUp/Plugins/location.rb:163\n\n\nAfter I hit the 'ok' button the next messagebox appears:\nundefined method `file_loaded?' for main:Object\n/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp \n6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2rad.rb:167\n\n\nAfter that I get a load errors overview from sketchup displaying that it won't load these two files \ndue to the file_loaded error.\n\n\nA little disappointed I try to load su2rad through the ruby console (load 'su2rad.rb') and to my \nsurprise it returns:\n> load 'su2rad.rb'\n++ found preferences file '/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp \n6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2radlib/config.rb'\n++ applied preferences from '/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp \n6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2radlib/config.rb'\ntrue\n\n\nSo I try my luck and enter load 'location.rb' and this one also returns \"true\". In the \"plugins\" \nmenu a Radiance item is added as well as a location-item.\n\n\nEven though it is working after all (my compliments to Thomas Bleicher), I wonder why I get \nthese error messages in the first place. Someone out there who knows?\n\n\nRegards,\nCasper Esmeijer\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004926.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Casper Esmeijer", "created_at": "April 15, 2008 at 01:28PM", "created_by": "Casper_Esmeijer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004852", "id": "radiance-general_004926"}
