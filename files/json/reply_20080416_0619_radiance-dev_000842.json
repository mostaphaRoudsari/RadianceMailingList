{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nVery timely ;-) Zack also asked me about this :-)\n\n\nI have been trying to make a mingw binary package with yesterday's HEAD\nsnapshot \nfrom the CVS, but a few things have changed in the source code since\n3R8, and\nI am still trying to find my way around them.\n\n\nrsensor needs libraycalls, libradiance and librtrad, so these have to be\ncompiled first, doing an rmake inside src/common and src/rt, and perhaps\ncrossing your fingers ;-)\n\n\nIn reality, the best approach I have found is to use scons.\nUnfortunately\nthe last changes done on the Sconscript files are two years old \n(schorsch, where are you? we really miss you!) so I am patching things\nhere and there to get the core programs compiled.\n\n\nI hope to be successful soon, and I'll post my findings to the Radiance\nWiki.\n\n\nKeep the faith ;-D\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-April/000842.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "April 16, 2008 at 06:19AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000841", "id": "radiance-dev_000842"}
