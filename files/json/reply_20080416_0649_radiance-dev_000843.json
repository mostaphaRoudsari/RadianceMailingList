{"body": "Hi Francesco,\n\n\nThanks very much for helping with this!  I forgot to mention that I  \nwrote a set of stub routines for Windows in src/rt/raypwin.c that you  \ncan use in place of raypcalls.c.  They don't really handle parallel  \nprocessing, but they'll get things going at least.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-April/000843.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 16, 2008 at 06:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000841", "id": "radiance-dev_000843"}
