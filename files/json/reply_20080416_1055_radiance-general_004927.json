This is a bit odd\nbecause that's actually built into Sketchup these days (as far as\nI know). How old is your Sketchup installation?\n\n\nI can give you more advice on debugging this problem but please\nlet's do this off list. There's also an issue tracker on the\ngoogle code project site:\n\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/su2rad/issues/list\n\n\nPlease report as well where you got the su2rad scripts from. The\nSVN repository is not much used so I don't bother with any form\nof quality check for the HEAD release.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004927.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 16, 2008 at 10:55AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004852", "id": "radiance-general_004927"}
