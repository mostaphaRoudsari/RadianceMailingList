{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthank you for that whole bunch of information! ;-) I have no redirecting \nsurfaces, but I use (mk)illums to bundle groups of light sources for the \nindirect calculation. I do not know if this causes additional start-up \nprocessing.\n\n\nThe idea to deactivate the obstruction cache is quite promising for my \ncase. I have one illuminated room, so all those light sources are not \nhidden by surfaces any way. That means that all that caching is for \nnothing and just wastes the start-up time in this special scenario.\n\n\nI will try this as soon as the next image is done (I guess tomorrow) and \nreport any success.\n\n\nThe idea to use -P is a good one - but I wonder how to do this when \nusing ranimate to control the rendering. Maybe you remember, I am that \ncrazy guy using ranimate to render stills - which is nice cause I can \nuse it to continue after broken processes, distribute processes both on \nsmp and on clusters, and all that... ;-) I will have a look at the \nranimate documentation once again.\n\n\nCU and thanks, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004930.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
