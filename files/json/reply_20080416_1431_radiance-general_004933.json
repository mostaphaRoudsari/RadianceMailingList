{"body": "This reminds me of one of my favorite hardware fixes. My laptop DAC\nmakes a hideous buzzing sound when plugged into PA amps at electronic\nmusic venues.

Cut the ground plug off my AC adapter.\n\n\n(Sorry for running off-topic... and thanks for the hint, Lars)\nDR\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 16, 2008 at 4:17 PM, Mark Stock <mstock at umich.edu> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004933.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Reetz", "created_at": "April 16, 2008 at 02:31PM", "created_by": "Daniel_Reetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004931", "id": "radiance-general_004933"}
