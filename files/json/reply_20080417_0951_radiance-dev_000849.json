Also, a clarification to my \ndescription of rsensor's purpose is in order, since I see you are also \nusing it for your description on the download page.  rsensor computes a \nphotosensor signal based on a sensor-specific spatial sensitivity, it \ndoes not actually calculate the spatial sensitivity.  The sensitivity is \nread in from a data file, sort-of the inverse of a photometric \nreport/.ies file, provided elsewhere.  This is all based on some \nresearch Zack has.  You'd be surprised by the variability in response \nfrom the various photosensors out there on the market; some are quite a \nways from cosine.  So, rsensor is able to act as a *vendor-specific* \nvirtual photosensor, which is like, totally rad. =8-)\n\n\nThanks again Francesco!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-April/000849.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 17, 2008 at 09:51AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000841", "id": "radiance-dev_000849"}
