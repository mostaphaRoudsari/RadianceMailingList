{"body": "> Lamp color (RGB) 28.93 8.62 0.0\n\n\nNow I got completely confused. I am modeling my source in feet, but \nscale it later, before rendering, to metres. Now, I get the radiance \nderived from the total luminous flux of a source (10 lm) and its surface \n(from its diameter 0.02m). The result in units of radiance is per /sr \nm2, so if I apply the light modifier to a sphere and scale it, the total \nluminous flux would increase, right? So scaling light sources with xform \nis a stupid mistake? Do I get it right? I scale more or less everything \nin my model, and usually xform cares about everything, such as textures \nand transformations, but I guess in this case it does not work.\n\n\nThanks, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004945.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
