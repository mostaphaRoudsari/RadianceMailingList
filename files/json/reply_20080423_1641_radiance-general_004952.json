{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI had a look at blackbody.cal can you guide us as to how the kelvin parameter is passed to this cal function into a usable rgb value?\n\n\nColor temperature is very useful stuff for designers (especially retail) but so poorly represented in most renderers. Any help there would be appreciated\n\n\n-steve\nS&J LTD\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004952.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steve michel", "created_at": "April 23, 2008 at 04:41PM", "created_by": "steve_michel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004943", "id": "radiance-general_004952"}
