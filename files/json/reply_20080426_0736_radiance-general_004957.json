I guess that \nyou are using bash, which is the most common shell on Linux today.\n\n\nLook for files called csh or tcsh in /bin, /usr/bin. If they do not \nexist, you will have to install a c-shell compatible package, most \nprobably tcsh. I am not an ubuntu-user, on my debian box I would do so \nusing apt-get install tcsh .\n\n\nI hope this is of any help, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004957.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
