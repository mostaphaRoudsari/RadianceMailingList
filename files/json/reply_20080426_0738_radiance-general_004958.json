The typical Linux these  \ndays doesn't even install\nthe c-shell any more. That's why your system can't find the csh  \nexecutable. Use your packet\nmanager to install csh (search for 'shell'). If it is already  \ninstalled check if the path is correct.\nIt could be something else than '/bin/csh' though I doubt it.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004958.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 26, 2008 at 07:38AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004956", "id": "radiance-general_004958"}
