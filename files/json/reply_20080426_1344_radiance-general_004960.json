{"body": "I am a Fedora 8 user, and one of the small annoyances of F8 is \nthat the default installation misses some useful packages. \nNevertheless, I have been using Fedora since its inception, \nand F8 is the nicest of them all, mostly because package \nmanagement now works right out of the box.\n\n\nPull down \"Applications\"->\"Add/Remove Software\", type in the root \npassword, and then either search for or browse the list to find \nthe \"csh\" or \"tcsh\" package(s). Install those, and you'll be on \nyour way. Also, make sure that you have the gcc program/packages.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Sat, 26 Apr 2008, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004960.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "April 26, 2008 at 01:44PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004956", "id": "radiance-general_004960"}
