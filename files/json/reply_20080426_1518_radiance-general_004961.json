Are you \naware that rpiece can help you distributing rendering of one single \npicture, and you can (mis)use ranimate to distribute renderings of \npictures from a view file? These tools already offer a lot, not only \ngeneric process control (no matter if you are on smp, a cluster or a \nsingle cpu), but also error recovery.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004961.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
