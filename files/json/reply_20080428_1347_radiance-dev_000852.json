{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nI'm not surprised to hear that readoct is CPU-bound, since it does a  \nfair amount of processing on the buffered input.  Generally, you only  \nreach the system performance limits when you are doing little more  \nthan reading data into memory, in which case memory mapping the file  \nmakes a lot of sense (for Unix systems that support it, anyway).   \nSince readoct has to unpack the data and allocate octree nodes and  \nleaves and so on, I'm not sure how best to speed up the process.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-April/000852.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 28, 2008 at 01:47PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000851", "id": "radiance-dev_000852"}
