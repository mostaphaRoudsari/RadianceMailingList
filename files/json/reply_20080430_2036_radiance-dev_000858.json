{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nReporting for a release (not unstable or testing) version of \nFedora 8 i686, using gcc 4.1.2, with the default rmake command, I \nfind that 3R9 builds completely. The dozen or so warnings are \nmostly about how mktemp is dangerous and that we should use \nmkstemp. Some other warnings are in libtiff, another about how \ngets is dangerous.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Wed, 30 Apr 2008, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-April/000858.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "April 30, 2008 at 08:36PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000856", "id": "radiance-dev_000858"}
