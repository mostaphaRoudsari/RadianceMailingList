{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\ndidn't know you were just about to release a new version with broadly \nscheduled testing.\n\n\nso why not take the opportunity and actually check the setvbuf call, \n'#ifdef linux' if needed ?\n\n\nAnother subtle suggestion:\nIt helps to trace problems and add information about other packages, \nwhen the testers mention parameters of their Linux distribution:\n\n\n    the compiler version used (gcc -v)\n\n\n    the shared lib versions used, e.g.:\n    host $ ldd /usr/local/radiance/bin/rpict\n            linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000)\n            libm.so.6 => /lib/tls/libm.so.6 (0xb7ee7000)\n            libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0xb7db4000)\n            /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7f1e000)\n    host $ ll /lib/tls/libc.so.6\n    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Feb 23 15:40 /lib/tls/libc.so.6 ->\n    libc-2.3.6.so\n\n\nSince Radiance depends so very little on other packages, it seems useful \nto know what the respective distributions supply for these few libs, in \nextension to the distribution names.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\nbtw1: running 'gcc -Wall' on the rt subdirectory prints warnings of \nuninitialized variables. (output attached, on gcc 4.1.2) If someone \nwant's to do a touch more, it's worth checking with the latest gcc \n(4.3.x) and/or Intel/AMD optimizations.\n\n\nbtw2: if anyone feels wants to be a pioneer during the holiday: running \na debugger like valgrind on the crucial rpict and rtrace wouldn't hurt, \nalthough it does take some time to separate noise from true errors. It's \nworth it. anyone bothered doing this already ?\n\n\nbtw3: the radiance-online box, nearly celebrating one year of happy life \nat Berkeley, still runs Debian Linux.\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-May/000860.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 12:50AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000856", "id": "radiance-dev_000860"}
