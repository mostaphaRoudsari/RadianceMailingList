I've compiled 3.9\nfor Solaris using the Sun Studio compiler.  Provisional packages are\nhere:\n    http://www.blastwave.org/testing/\ntoday's files (rev date may change):\n    radiance-3.9,REV=2008.05.01-SunOS5.8-i386-CSW.pkg.gz\n    radiance-3.9,REV=2008.05.01-SunOS5.8-sparc-CSW.pkg.gz\n\n\nSince 3.8 the Rmakefiles have lost some -lm.  I had to add these,\npatch attached.\n\n\nThere are some compiler warnings, extracts attached.  Most are\nunimportant but if you like I will attempt to edit the source and\nprovide a patch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-May/000863.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 06:47AM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000856", "id": "radiance-dev_000863"}
