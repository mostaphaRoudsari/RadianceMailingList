{"body": "Hi Tom,\n\n\nThank for taking the time to write a thoughtful and thought-provoking  \nletter to the group.  Indeed, material models are hard to come by in  \nRadiance, and most users end up spending a significant amount of time  \ncreating the materials they need for a convincing and accurate result.\n\n\nSadly, there are so many architectural materials out there, that  \ncreating a library that is comprehensive or even representative is a  \ndaunting challenge, and it has proven difficult to get public funding  \nagencies behind such an effort.  The best hope is for a consortium,  \nsimilar to the one set up by Mike Rubin & company at LBNL with the  \nglazing manufacturers to establish a protocol for characterizing  \ntheir products in a consistent and unbiased way.  Getting the kind of  \ncohesion and groundswell needed for such a consortium of the many  \ncompanies involved in producing masonry, floor coverings, paints,  \nwallpaper, etc., etc...  Well, let's just say it would take a big  \npush from somewhere.\n\n\nSo, I don't really have a satisfying answer to your request, but  \nmaybe there are others on the list who can volunteer their  \nexperiences with material modeling.  Perhaps someone can even suggest  \na route for gathering a reasonable library together.  Certainly, it  \nwould get some use.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004971.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 08:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004969", "id": "radiance-general_004971"}
