{"body": "Thanks, James.  This is a big help.  I'm especially grateful for the  \ncontext diffs on the Rmakefile's, which I've checked in.  Different  \nsystems put different things in the math library.  I suspect that  \nSolaris puts atof() there, which is why it's needed most of the time.\n\n\nI will include your Solaris binaries when I post the 3.9 release.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-May/000866.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000856", "id": "radiance-dev_000866"}
