{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nThe CURET database is an impressive resource, with about 60 measured  \nmaterials.  This was the original bidirectional texture function  \nmeasurement work undertaken by Kristin Dana during her Ph.D.  \nstudies.  I believe she plans a follow-up to this, but I don't know  \nthe schedule.  Another good resource is the Bonn BTF database, which  \nthough it only offers a few surfaces (10 by my count), they are  \ncaptured at more angles, and the data are pre-aligned, making their  \napplication much simpler:\n\n\n\thttp://btf.cs.uni-bonn.de/\n\n\nHowever, adapting BTF data to a Radiance model is something I've  \nnever tried, and my guess is that the memory requirements would kill  \nyou.  Most researchers try for some kind of PCA (principal component  \nanalysis) or tensor representation to reduce the memory footprint.   \nFor example, see:\n\n\n\thttp://btf.cs.uni-bonn.de/documentation.html\nand\n\thttp://mrl.nyu.edu/~alex/research_index.html\n\n\nHow you would incorporate a general Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is  \na big question.  Bottom line, if all you want is a set of materials  \nto use in Radiance, I don't think a BTF representation is the  \nshortest path.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004976.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 04:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004973", "id": "radiance-general_004976"}
