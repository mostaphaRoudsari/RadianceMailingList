We've all come a long way.\n\n\nSpeaking of which, just to slot me in to the age continuum of  \nRadiance users, I graduated from high school a year before the first  \nRadiance release (and started mucking around with Radiance about ten  \nyears later).\n\n\n\n\n> Someone should take 3.9 out for a drink!\n\n\nRight on, Greg; your baby deserves a little more than root beer.  ;-)\n\n\n_ Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\nP.S.\nI hope like hell to make the Workshop this year in Fribourg.  Sort-of  \na closing of the loop that started there in 2002...\n\n\nP.P.S.\nDamn, I'm like, old and shit.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004979.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 07:13PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004972", "id": "radiance-general_004979"}
