{"body": "Hi Steve,\n\n\nThanks for your input.  As I mentioned, I split the decision and made  \nthem available on one site and not the other.  Directions for  \nconverting additional models are below.  Thankfully, I had them in an  \ne-mail, because I sure don't remember doing this.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nInstructions for converting additional models\n\n\n\n\n1) Download and unpack .OBJ and .PPM files from:\n         http://people.csail.mit.edu/tmertens/textransfer/data\n\n\n2) Rename atlas.ppm to something more specific.\n\n\n3) Convert the .OBJ file to a Radiance triangle mesh using the command:\n         obj2mesh object.obj > object.rtm\n\n\n4) Convert the .PPM file to a Radiance picture:\n         ra_ppm -r object.ppm > object.pic\n\n\n5) Average the non-zero color values in the texture atlas to arrive  \nat a background color:\n         pvalue -h -H -df object.pic \\\n         | rcalc -if3 -e 'cond=$1+$2+$3-.01' -of -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3= \n$3' \\\n         | total -if3 -m\n\n\n6) Use the above three values (red_val, green_val, blue_val) in a  \nRadiance input file that looks like so:\n\n\nvoid colorpict object_pat\n7 lim_r lim_g lim_b object.pic climit.cal Lu Lv\n0\n3 (red_val) (green_val) (blue_val)\n\n\nobject_pat plastic object_mat\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\n\nobject_mat mesh object\n1 object.rtm\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a specular component, change the arguments of  \n\"object_mat\" to \"1 1 1 0.04 0.07\" -- feel free to alter the roughness  \n(final) parameter to suit, but unless the object is metallic, the  \nspecular value should not be greater than 0.04.\n\n\nThe file \"climit.cal\" is used to avoid black areas on the object  \nwhere it isn't covered by the texture atlas:\n\n\n{ Avoid zero pixel values }\nlim_r(r,g,b) = if(grey(r,g,b)-.01, min(r,1), A1);\nlim_g(r,g,b) = if(grey(r,g,b)-.01, min(g,1), A2);\nlim_b(r,g,b) = if(grey(r,g,b)-.01, min(b,1), A3);\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004982.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 01, 2008 at 08:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004966", "id": "radiance-general_004982"}
