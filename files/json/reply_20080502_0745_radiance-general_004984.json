So, what you see is  \nnormal.  You need to set up materials to match the orientations of the  \nsurfaces, say three if all surfaces are rectilinear.  See the example  \nin file 'pattmats' which is found in the directory 'obj/cabin'.   \nThere's a way for cylinders too, but it's been ages since I last used  \ncolorpict and I've forgotten how it went.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004984.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 02, 2008 at 07:45AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_004984"}
