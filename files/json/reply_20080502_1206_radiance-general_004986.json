{"body": "I sometimes use a cheap hack to avoid the texture smearing along 1 axis:\n - smearing it on a less noticeable axis.\n\n\nAssuming you are texturing a wall pattern\n squish the texture about 50% horizontally (not keeping aspect ratio)\nRotate it so it projects at 45 degrees. -rx 90 -rz 45  This works for\nmost walls - those that are 0, 90, 180, 270 orientations.\nTho at 45 135 etc, they don't work so well.\n\n\nRob F\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004986.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Fitzsimmons", "created_at": "May 02, 2008 at 12:06PM", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_004986"}
