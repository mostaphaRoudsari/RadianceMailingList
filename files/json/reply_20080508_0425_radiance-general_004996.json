{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nYour explanation solves my problem, and now I have another related\nquestion, of course :)\n\n\nIf my material is defined in some plane, for example ZX, and I have a\nsurface in some other plane, how can I calculate needed\ntransformations (rotations), to place the material correctly.\n\n\nI wrote the script and used the code from replmarks.c but it seems I'm\nmissing something important. Calculated rotations give good results\nfor some surfaces and bad for others.\n\n\nSo question is how should I calculate 3 rotation angles for -rx -ry\nand -rz, if I have:\n* starting right-oriented coordinate system defined with vectors\nx0,y0,z0  (plane where material is defined) and\n* surface coordinate system defined with vectors x1,y1,z1 (calculated\nfrom tree points on surface plane and normal)\n\n\nThanks again,\nMarija.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, May 7, 2008 at 5:42 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004996.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "May 08, 2008 at 04:25AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_004996"}
