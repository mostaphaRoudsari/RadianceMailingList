{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI didn't know about new version of replmarks code, so I downloaded and\nused it now. It partially solves my problem.\nI use the formulas from the replmarks but think my vector values for\ncalculation (in the code xp,yp and zp vectors) are wrong.\n\n\n1.right-oriented coordinate system where pattern is defined is defined\nwith vectors x0,y0,z0  (plane where material is defined and its\nnormal) and\n2. surface coordinate system defined with vectors x1,y1,z1 (calculated\nfrom tree points on surface plane and normal)\n\n\nHow do I calculate xp,yp, ans zp vectors?\nI tried to use xp=x1-x0, yp=y1-y0 and zp=z1-z0, but it seems my\ncalculation results aren't correct.\n\n\nMarija.\n\n\nOn Thu, May 8, 2008 at 6:12 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004998.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "May 09, 2008 at 03:10AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_004998"}
