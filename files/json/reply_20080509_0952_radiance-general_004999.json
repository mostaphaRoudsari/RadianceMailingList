I finally gave up and now I'm using the output of\na !replmarks command directly in my scene descriptions to place\nan object with translation and rotation into a global coordinate\nsystem.\n\n\nThe !replmarks command will create an \"!xform -rx ...\" line. You\ncould use these rotations to transform a matrix. The final matrix\nwill provide the vectors your after.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 09, 2008 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_004999"}
