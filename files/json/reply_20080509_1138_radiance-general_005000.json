{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nThomas' suggestion of using replmarks as is may be a good one, and  \nyou can feed it your vectors via rcalc if you like.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it should be possible to get the code to do what  \nyou want.  Here are a few caveats:\n\n\n1) The three vectors you give to the addrot() routine must be  \nnormalized (length 1) and orthogonal to each other.\n\n\n2) The vectors specify the new axes orientations, so you give it the  \ndestination position for each original X, Y, and Z axis.\n\n\n3) The axes must compose a right-hand coordinate system.\n\n\nI assume from what you've said, that it's probably #1 that is the  \nproblem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005000.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 09, 2008 at 11:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_005000"}
