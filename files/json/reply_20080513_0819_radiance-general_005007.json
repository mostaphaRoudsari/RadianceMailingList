I find that\nextreme values for 'ar' are only required when the total scene size is\nmuch larger than the zone you're interested in. An example would be a\ndaylighting model for a single small room in a building that also\nincludes large external geometry many times larger than the room itself.\n\n\nTry -ar 200 and -ar 600. You may be surprised that high values don't\nimpact your results that much, but would have a strong impact on the\nquality of rendered images.\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005007.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 13, 2008 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005006", "id": "radiance-general_005007"}
