I am not sure how valid this is so perhaps others can chime in.\n\n\nOooh, I hadn't thought of that before, but of course you're right.  A \nvery complex skylight/laylight system with multiple \"nasty\" layers could \nbe sorted out, via mkillum, one at a time with progressive mkillum runs \nstarting from the outside and working your way in.  Then for the final \ncalcs/renders, you would simply use the last set of illums.  Why \nwouldn't this be valid?  As long as you only use the last set of illums \nso there isn't any double- or triple counting of contributions, this \nseems totally valid to me.
