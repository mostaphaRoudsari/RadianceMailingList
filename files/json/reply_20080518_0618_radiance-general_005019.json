{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nMy model uses transparent textures, which is not supported by tmesh2rad.\nAdded some extras line in the output of tmesh2rad for the tranparent \ntexture, which works fine:\n\n\nvoid mixpict T-Pat\n7 TCOLOR void green\n./test_alpha.pic\ntmesh.cal u v\n0 7\n2\n0.1  0.0  0.0\n0.0  0.1  0.0\n\n\nIt would be nice if I had a better understanding of  the A1-A7 \nvariables. I like to calcultate these whitin my program, so I can export \nthe scene to radiance including the mixpict.\n\n\nCould you explain to me how to calculate the A1-A7 variables for \ntmesh.cal, given a set of vertexcoordinates and  texturecoordinates?\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "May 18, 2008 at 06:18AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005016", "id": "radiance-general_005019"}
