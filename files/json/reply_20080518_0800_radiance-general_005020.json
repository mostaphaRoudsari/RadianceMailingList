{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nIn order to explain the calculation of barycentric coordinates, I'd  \nhave to read and understand my code again, when it's easier just to  \nuse it.  This is one of the benefits of source code, after all -- you  \ndon't have to figure everything out all over each time you need it.   \nThe routines you want are in tmesh.{h,c} in src/common, and there is  \na nice routine comp_baryc() that makes it pretty easy.  In fact, the  \nsimplest thing to do is modify tmesh2rad to output what you want.   \nLine 252 in src/cv/tmesh.c is just begging for a hack.\n\n\nIf C programming is a hurdle, you could probably construct a set of  \nrcalc formats or macro replacements (m4) to substitute your mixpict's  \nfor the colorpict's that tmesh2rad produces.\n\n\nBest of luck,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005020.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 18, 2008 at 08:00AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005016", "id": "radiance-general_005020"}
