{"body": "Dear all, \n\n\nI have a question regarding the luminance prediction (cd/m2) on the plane for certain points. and any help would really be appreciated.\n\n\nI have measured  certain points with an luminance meter. I have used also image-based for the same points to extract the luminance and I have very similar results. I need to use also simulation-based luminance values for the same points and compare the results with the measured and image based ones. \n\n\nBefore,  I have simulated only Illuminances. How can I measure the Luminances?\n\n\nHere is the code I use to predict the illuminance:\n\n\n# commands to run\ncommands = [\"rm -f /tmp/bpi.amb\",\n            \"oconv env.rad lab_surfaces_corrected_moved.rad lab_windows_and_doors.rad strato_sokol2.rad> lab.oct\", \n\n\n\"echo '4.52    0.85 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n        \"3.74    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n        \"4.52    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +          \n        \"5.30    1.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +\n        \"3.74    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n        \"4.52    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n        \"5.30    2.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n        \"3.74    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n        \"4.52    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n        \"5.30    3.13 0.74 0 0 1 \" +    \n\n\n\n\n            \"' | rtrace -w -af /tmp/bpi.amb -as 512 -ar 64 -aa 0.15 -ab 2 -I+ -h lab.oct | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)* 179'\",\n\n\n\n\n            ]\n\n\n\n\nAny help would be really appreciated, \n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nBest regards, \n\n\nSokol Dervishi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005022.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "sokol dervishi", "created_at": "May 19, 2008 at 07:31AM", "created_by": "sokol_dervishi", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005015", "id": "radiance-general_005022"}
