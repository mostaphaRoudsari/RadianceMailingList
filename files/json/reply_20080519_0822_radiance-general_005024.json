{"body": "This seems to be a repeat posting of something sent out on Saturday.   \nThere is no need to post things twice -- we did get it the first  \ntime.  If you are unsure if a posting has made it to the list, you  \ncan always go online to check:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/\n\n\nI did not reply to this right away, since it is really a basic  \nquestion, and I figured any number of people could handle it.  In any  \ncase, a careful reading of the rtrace man page should give the  \nanswer.  Quoting from the first paragraph of:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtrace.1.html\n\n\n\"Input for each ray is:\n\n\n             xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir\n\"\n\n\nYou simply start the ray an arbitrary distance from your surface and  \ngive it a vector corresponding to the desired luminance measurement.   \nThe returned values (when you run rtrace without the -I+ option) will  \nbe in SI radiance units (watts/sr/meter^2),which may be converted to  \nluminance (in candelas/meter^2) using the formula specified under the  \n\"Examples\" section:\n\n\n\trtrace  -h  scene.oct  <lum_meas.pts |  rcalc  -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2 \n+11.6*$3'\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005024.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 19, 2008 at 08:22AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005015", "id": "radiance-general_005024"}
