{"body": "Nick,\n\n\nThe easiest way is to grab the Radiance format files that IES creates  \nwhen it converts the 3D model from its native format for use by  \nRadiance.  Can't recall where they reside in the file system, you'll  \nneed to do a little searching.  The Radiance format files should be  \nmostly standard.  There is however one exception that we found: the  \n'xform2' command.  This is not part of the standard release and the  \noctree conversion will fail if it encounters this command in a rad  \nfile.  Similar to xform, IES uses xform2 to create rectangles of  \narbitrary dimension for, it seems, use as workplanes.  It does this by  \napplying arbitrary scaling in the x and y dimensions (independently)  \non a unit square polygon (z = 0.8) and translating the output to the  \ndesired location in the scene.  I would have thought that simply  \ncreating a polygon in the right place would be a neater method,  \nwhatever.  Since the xform2 commands are embedded in the scene rad  \nfiles, you'll have to strip them out.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005027.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 21, 2008 at 06:20AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005026", "id": "radiance-general_005027"}
