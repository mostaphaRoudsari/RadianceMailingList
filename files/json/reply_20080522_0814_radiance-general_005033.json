{"body": "Hi Pavlina,\n\n\nYou should set -bn 146 on your rtcontrib line, so that even if  \nnothing comes back in certain bins, the number of output values is  \nheld constant.\n\n\nAlso note that the -as parameter gets overridden to 0 because it is  \nincompatible with the MC technique used by rtcontrib.  Indirect  \ncalculation settings in general should be different from what you  \nwould use for rtrace.  Large values for -ad do not necessarily help  \nyou that much in rtcontrib, but I haven't explored the parameter  \nspace enough myself to really offer sound advice.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005033.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 22, 2008 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005032", "id": "radiance-general_005033"}
