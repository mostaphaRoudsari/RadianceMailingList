{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nThe glow values (multiplied by whatever pattern is applied) are in  \nunits of watts/steradian/sq.meter, or SI radiance.  There is no  \nmaximum, and values below zero are even permitted in cases where you  \nare outside the standard RGB gamut.  You can compute luminance (in cd/ \nm^2) from these values by applying the formula:\n\n\n\tLumiance = 179*(0.2651*Red + 0.6701*Green + 0.0648*Blue)\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 23, 2008 at 05:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005034", "id": "radiance-general_005043"}
