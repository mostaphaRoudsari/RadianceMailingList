{"body": "For any interested , I too found that documentation useful to 'unblock' my initial difficulty with image mapping.\n\n\nBTW Matiu Carr's Image mapping has a snippet of the picture.cal function code. This documentation is helpful but I found out the latest picture.cal packaged with radiance3.8 file has commented lines in picture.cal describing what each item does in the function.\n\n\nNow Im wondering if there is a valid way of mapping a panaromic pic for a view through those wonderful daylight views we love so much.\nThe doc shows mapping on a tube with cyl.cal as way of doing just that. But that might interfere with skyglow and ruin the lux readings? Would a HDR mage mapped to the sky itself with sky luminance values 'indexed' to the bitmap's rgb values achieve a more accurate result?? \n\n\nSteve\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005044.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "steve michel", "created_at": "May 24, 2008 at 04:04AM", "created_by": "steve_michel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_005044"}
