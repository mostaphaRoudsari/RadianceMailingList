You will still have a\nproblem with adjusting the exposure or brightness of the outside view\nto the appropriate exposure for the inside. In reality you wouldn't\nbe able to see outside and inside at the same time.\n\n\nYou could also use a post process to blend the image of the interior\nwith a view of the skydome/panoramic sky. Use the brightness of the\nwindows or a specially created mask to switch between foreground and\nbackground image.\n\n\nAnd then there's always Photoshop ...\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005051.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 26, 2008 at 02:49AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004983", "id": "radiance-general_005051"}
