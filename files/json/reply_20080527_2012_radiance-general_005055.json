{"body": "I like Thomas' original suggestion of mapping an image to the window  \nand using an illum with the appropriate sky distribution.  If you  \nsimply use the fisheye.cal mapping I recommended earlier and apply it  \nto a fisheye capture out the window, all should be well for any  \nperspective view.  However, you will need a fairly high resolution  \nfisheye image to make this work.  The description goes something like  \nthis:\n\n\n# Define sky\n!gensky 5 27 12\n\n\n# Define high frequency view out window\nvoid colorpict west_view\n9 red green blue outsideHF.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rz 90\n0\n0\n\n\n# Apply view to sky only for West elevation\nskyfunc mixfunc full_sky_pat\n4 west_view void \"if(Dx,0,-Dx^.4)\" .\n0\n0\n\n\n# Apply this to the sky\nfull_sky_pat glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 360\n\n\n# Define window glazing\nvoid glass window_glass\n0\n0\n3 .92 .92 .92\n\n\n# Window angle affects transmittance, so use approximation to this\nskyfunc brightfunc win_func\n2 winxmit winxmit.cal\n0\n0\n\n\n# Define the window as an illum minus the exterior pattern\nwin_func illum window_illum\n1 window_glass\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nI tried it, and it seems to work OK.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005055.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 27, 2008 at 08:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005054", "id": "radiance-general_005055"}
