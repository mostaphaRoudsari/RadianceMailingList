What do you think about it?\n\n\nDo you want the specular part to be 'pure' -- that is, mirror-like?   \nIf so, this can be achieved easily enough by specifying a mixfunc  \nwith a fixed parameter, e.g.:\n\n\nvoid metal specular_bit\n0\n0\n5 0.1 0.1 0.1 1 0\n\n\nvoid plasdata brdf_data\n{your arguments here}\n\n\nvoid mixfunc asphalt\n4 specular_bit brdf_data 0.5 .\n0\n0\n\n\nSince we are mixing half of each, you need to double each component  \n(the specular_bit and the brdf_data), but otherwise this should work.\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want a specular component with a soft  \nlobe, it gets a little trickier.  Essentially, you want to modify  \nyour BRDF data such that the Gaussian model you are using for the  \nspecular_bit is taken out.  The basic principle still applies, however.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005056.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 27, 2008 at 10:23PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005052", "id": "radiance-general_005056"}
