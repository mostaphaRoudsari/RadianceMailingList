{"body": "I was interested about this as well.. !!\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n.Hi list,\n.\n.I wonder if noone else came to this problem, or if I just do not see the\n.answer to a rather simple problem.\n.\n.Radiance comes with pvalue to extract pixel values of images. This is\n.fine, as long as images are small - just redirect to a file, and the\n.values can be read according to the coordinates written at the beginning\n.of the lines.\n.\n.Now, for large images, this becomes a pain. E.g. if I want to get the\n.values of 64pixels, with known coordinates, I cannot read out these with\n.pvalue, but first must transform the complete image to a pvalue\n.formatted text file. These files can become hundreds of MB in size with\n.higher resolutions.\n.\n.Is there an easier and more efficient way to go? E.g. cropping the image\n.first to the pixels wanted? I guess the only way to do so is pcomb,\n.right?\n.\n.Lars.\n.\n.\n._______________________________________________\n.Radiance-general mailing list\n.Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n.http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n.\n\n\n..
