{"body": "I don't know what was Lars looking for, but what I was looking for was something like ximage do, but controlled by a script. I mean, as ximage is able to comunicate a value starting from mouse position and then by x,y coordinates, is it possible to do the same thing giving a numeric input instead of a mouse one (and getting a numeric output as well?\n\n\n\n\nAt the time I 'needed' it I skipped the problem with rtrace as suggested, but I am still curious to know if there was a simpler solution (as the one described above)\n\n\nThank you for interesting replies anyway.\n\n\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n.Just adding my two cents to this...\n.\n.The pfilt option (1) Jack suggests is a good one, and may be combined  \n.with the others as well.  The pcompos option (2) is a little more  \n.risky, as this program ignores/removes whatever exposure changes were  \n.made to the picture, so if it isn't straight out of rpict, you may  \n.get different values than you expect.  The scripting option (3) is  \n.very well-done, but I don't think you need to include the rayinit.cal  \n.file on the command line, as Jack has transcribed and modified the  \n.relevant functions into the -e arguments.\n.\n.One other comment is if you only want a few pixels out of an image,  \n.vwrays connected to rtrace is much simpler and faster.  Rather than  \n.generating a whole picture, just use:\n.\n.vwrays -i -vf view.vf -x ${xres} -y ${yres} | rtrace [options] octree\n.\n.Then, on the input to vwrays, type (or redirect) the desired x and y  \n.pixel coordinates; vwrays will produce the corresponding ray sample,  \n.which rtrace will compute for you.\n.\n.Finally, no one mentioned that ximage (and Photosphere and others)  \n.can query individual values interactively.  I don't know if this will  \n.work in your application.\n.\n.Cheers,\n.-Greg\n.\n.>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefano Ponzetti", "created_at": "May 29, 2008 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005059", "id": "radiance-general_005064"}
