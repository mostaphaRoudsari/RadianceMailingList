In effect the BRDF would be a \"correction\" to the  \nGaussian lobe model, or at least the direct part.  The indirect would  \nbe as good as it's going to be without writing your own BRDF sampler,  \nwhich would be both difficult and extremely costly in any rendering  \nyou might do.\n\n\n> As about the indirect calculation it would be influenced by  \n> specular (which is ok) but also from lambertian (indirect  \n> calculation of brdf).\n\n\nIf the diffuse part of your reflectance model is zero, then there's  \nno Lambertian calculation.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 29, 2008 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005052", "id": "radiance-general_005065"}
