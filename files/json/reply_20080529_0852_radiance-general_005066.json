{"body": "First thanks for the replies and suggestions. What I actually want to\ndo, is to sample pixel values over an area and get the average. This is\ndone for a HDR image assembled of photographs, so I cannot use vwrays.\nPfilt also does not work, as I need the samples to hit a light source in\na black (dark) surrounding. What I did now is writing a script in perl\nwhich filters the output of pvalue, but still, as these files are large\nand I am working on batches of such images, it is not that comfortable\nto do so (it takes time). I am taking these values into my script\nanyway, so writing this was not the problem, it is more about the\nunnecessary lookups of all those pixels that are just not that interesting.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005066.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
