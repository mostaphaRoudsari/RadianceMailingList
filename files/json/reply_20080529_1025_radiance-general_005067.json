{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nSo, this is why being specific about your problem helps -- we avoid a  \nlot of spurious suggestions that don't apply.\n\n\nThe best/fastest solution for rectangular areas is pcompos piped into  \npvalue and total, like so:\n\n\n\tpcomb -o captured.pic \\\n\t\t| pcompos -x ${box_width} -y ${box_height} - -${left} -${lower} \\\n\t\t| pvalue -h -H -df | total -if3 -m\n\n\nThe initial pcomb command is necessary to apply the exposure values  \ncorrectly.  If you want luminance (rather than radiance) output, use:\n\n\n\tpcomb -s 179 -o captured.pic \\\n\t\t| pcompos -x ${box_width} -y ${box_height} - -${left} -${lower} \\\n\t\t| pvalue -h -H -b -df | total -if -m\n\n\nEither of these commands will be very fast compared to any script you  \nmight concoct.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005067.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 29, 2008 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005059", "id": "radiance-general_005067"}
