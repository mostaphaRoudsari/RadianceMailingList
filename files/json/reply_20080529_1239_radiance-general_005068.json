{"body": "Hi again,\n\n\nI'm still thinking about the data provide by ICC files. Somehow I think \nit should be possible to calculate the top of the luminance range for \nthe target output device (-u option of normtiff), given a set of \nphotometric measurements which I believe an ICC profile provides. I \ntried to figure out _what_ precisely is measured in the \"SpectroScan\"  \nsection of the ICC file (attached), but even the support team of Epson \ncould not answer that question. Maybe one of you does?\n\n\nAlso I wonder how to calculate the 'dynamic range for the target output \ndevice ' (-d option of normtiff) This is said to be 32 for CRT monitors \nin the manpage. I have no clue how to obatin this value for other output \ndevices.\n\n\nThe only option I know for sure in normtiff is the gamma option, which \nit adjustable for Epson printers (1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 ).\n\n\nToday I spent some time reading High Dynamic Range Imaging. Although \nmost of the math is just magic for me, I understand the issue. I wonder \nhowever how much this issue is known by photo-labs and printing \nservices. I wonder also how much of this knowledge is implemented in \ncontemporary printing-technology. I don't know, if one of you does, \nplease tell me. The funny thing is that operators say \"O wow, \n32bit/channel images, great, no problem!\" But in fact they convert the \nfile to the printer's actual output, which  is 8 bit/channel. This is a \nkind of a communication problem, which I believe has to be solved at my \nside. I really like to be able to provide the photo-lab 'just' a \nstandard  8bit/channel image. I understand such an image can not look as \nperfect in print as it does in RGB monitor color space. But can we come \nclose to 'perfect' using proper calculations?\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\niebele schreef:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005068.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "May 29, 2008 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005058", "id": "radiance-general_005068"}
