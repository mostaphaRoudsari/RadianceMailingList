{"body": "Hi Jack!\n\n\n> Just to be clear, this routine calculates the average of the values in\n> the crop box. It will output a numeric value.\n\n\nYes, I had just misunderstood the -x -y parameters of pcompos. The\npvalue-part was clear to me.\n\n\n>      1. put a frame around selected crop areas in the image - perhaps\n>         this would be easier to do with something like ImageMagick?\n\n\nI guess that this is what I will do. While I still think that it could\nbe done using only pcompos, imagemagick is easier here. I wanted to draw\nmarkers such as rectangular frames around known areas, e.g. mark the\narea in an image that has been read out by pvalue.\n\n\nThank you!
