{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nIs there some reason to prefer gensurf to genrev in this instance?   \nGenrev should produce a smaller (simpler) model, and allows for  \nsmoothing as well.  The following makes a pretty convincing hemisphere:\n\n\n\tgenrev mat hemi 'cos(PI/2*t)' 'sin(PI/2*t)' 20 -s\n\n\nusing 20 primitives rather than 400.    Since the first function z(t)  \nis decreasing with increasing t, the surface normal points inwards as  \nrequested.\n\n\nIt's also possible to use an antimatter volume to hide the bottom  \nhalf of the sphere, and this is recommended if a perfect hemisphere  \nis required.  However, there are drawbacks to this method, such as  \nbeing unable to render from inside the excluded volume.  Here's an  \nexample of how this could be done:\n\n\nsphere_mat bubble my_sphere\n0\n0\n4 0 0 0 1\n\n\nvoid antimatter anti_sphere_mat\n2 void sphere_mat\n0\n0\n\n\n!genbox anti_sphere_mat anti_vol 2 2 1 | xform -t -1 -1 -1\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005074.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 04, 2008 at 08:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005072", "id": "radiance-general_005074"}
