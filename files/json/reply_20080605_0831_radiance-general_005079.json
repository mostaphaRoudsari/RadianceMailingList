{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe \"-o\" option of pvalue would usually do the trick, but pcompos  \ngobbles up the EXPOSURE= lines in the input, not passing them to  \nsubsequent programs.  This is why the exposure needs to be \"undone\"  \nbefore passing the picture through pcompos.\n\n\nThe reason pcompos behaves thus is that it's designed to take  \nmultiple input images and the combined result won't necessarily have  \nthe same exposure.  I should have some more intelligent code in there  \nfor combining the exposure values in case they're all the same, I  \nsuppose....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005079.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005059", "id": "radiance-general_005079"}
