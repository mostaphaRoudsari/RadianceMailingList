{"body": "Hi Iv\u00e1n,\n\n\nRegarding your calculation of kWh / m2, you should probably use -m  \n0.0005 if you are adding up values every half hour rather than once  \nper hour.\n\n\nAs for the -i option not doing quite what you want, glass and other  \ntransparent surfaces are excepted for this calculation and pass  \nthrough to whatever lies beyond.  Under circumstances where you are  \nafter a rendering of visible surfaces, this is usually preferred.  To  \nget the irradiance on every surface regardless of type, use:\n\n\n\tvwrays -x xres -y yres [view options] -fd \\\n\t\t| rtrace -fd -h -opN scene.oct \\\n\t\t| rtrace -fdc -I `vwrays -d -x xres -y yres [view options]`scene.oct \\\n\t\t> irradiance.pic\n\n\nVwrays produces the view rays, which the first rtrace very quickly  \nturns into intersection points and surface normals.  These are then  \npassed to the second rtrace as irradiance measurement points.  The  \nsecond invocation of vwrays in backwards quotes is simply there to  \ntell the second rtrace the image dimensions.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005080.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005080"}
