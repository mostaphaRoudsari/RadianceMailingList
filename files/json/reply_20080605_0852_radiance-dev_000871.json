{"body": "Hi Esben,\n\n\nTry adding \"-DEZXML_NOMMAP\" to the rmake script and rerunning  \n\"makeall install\" in the main directory or \"rmake install\" in the src/ \ngen directory.  Th ezxml.c module is new with this release and was  \nprovided by a third party, so I'm not well familiar with its  \nportability issues.  So far, it seems quite robust.\n\n\nThere isn't a bug reporting system for Radiance, so thanks for  \nalerting us to the problem.  Cygwin is not a properly supported  \nplatform, so you're on the bleeding edge.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000871.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 08:52AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000870", "id": "radiance-dev_000871"}
