{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n> ezxml.c: In function `ezxml_parse_fd':\n> ezxml.c:643: error: `MADV_SEQUENTIAL' undeclared (first use in this function)\n\n\nhave a look if there's /usr/include/sys/mman.h and what is defined in\nthere, if the file exists at all.\nIf so you'll probably find POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL and POSIX_MADV_NORMAL,\ntry to replace MADV_SEQUENTIAL/MADV_NORMAL by them. Unfortunately I\ncan't tell if it's save to replace them by default, but afaik it is.\n\n\nHope that helps,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000872.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 09:25AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000870", "id": "radiance-dev_000872"}
