Let me add another question:\n\n\nthe vwrays lines you sent uses inline commands which I cannot mimic in \nwindows shell, can someone pont me to some source on how to place \n'inline' commands in windows shell commands? (using F Anselmo's Mingw \nRadiance binaries)\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n\nIv\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005086.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iv\u00e1n Pajares S\u00e1nchez", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 09:56AM", "created_by": "Iv\u00e1n_Pajares_S\u00e1nchez", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005086"}
