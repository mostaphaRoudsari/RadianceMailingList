{"body": "Hi Ivan,\n\n\nWhen combining irradiance pics you may wish to set the pixel jitter to  \nzero (i.e. -pj 0), and render at the final resolution. This will  \nprevent different surfaces from possibly contributing to the summed  \nirradiance for those pixels that delineate the 'line' between one  \nsurface and another.  The consequence is more prominent jaggies, but I  \nprefer that to 'halos'.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005089.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005089"}
