{"body": "Hello Svetlana,\n\n\nNaturally, asking on the Radiance mailing list, you're going to hear  \npeople say Radiance is the most accurate.  In your case, I would say  \nthe 10% error is going to be overshadowed (no pun intended) by the  \nvariability of daylight.  Specifically, it is very important to  \nconsider the weather data used as your basis in determining exterior  \ndaylight conditions.  Even getting within 10% of measured  \nilluminances requires the use of measured sky distributions, which  \nare almost never available.  So, I'd say this accuracy is based on  \nthe assumption that your sky matches the standard CIE model, which of  \ncourse it won't if it's a real sky.  Radiance would fare no better.\n\n\nAnnual simulation requires quick calculations, which is not really  \nRadiance's strength.  I know that Rob Hitchcock (the author of  \nDElight) has put a lot of energy into his fenestration calculations,  \nso if you aren't getting the output you expect, I'd take a closer  \nlook at the input as a first step.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005093.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 11:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005090", "id": "radiance-general_005093"}
