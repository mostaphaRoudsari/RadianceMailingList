{"body": "Hello Greg and Rob,\n&nbsp;\nThank you both for a quick response.\n&nbsp;\nRob Hitchcock's claims 10% error in his paper&nbsp;about DELight2 (DELIGHT2 DAYLIGHTING ANALYSIS IN ENERGY PLUS: INTEGRATION AND PRELIMINARY USER RESULTS).\n&nbsp;\nHitchcock stated that:\n\"Delight participated in validation exercise specifically focused on the ability to simulate\nCFS performance, as characterized by measured BTDFs (Maamari, et al., 2005). The comparisons were based on measurements and corresponding simulations in a simple-geometry test box for combinations of CFS BTDFs and measured skies. The DElight2 results for a particular combination of a CIE overcast sky and a measured BTDF representing Serraglaze were shown.\"\n&nbsp;\nThis is all they mentioned about a sky model and the error. We used TMY 3 weather file downloaded from the Energy Plus website and did not add anything specifically related to the sky model in our input.\n&nbsp;\nI wonder if this information from Hitchcock's paper&nbsp;warranties accuracy of the results.\n&nbsp;\nWe have not done experimental testing of our system and can rely only on the computer simulations at this moment....so we want to make sure we are on the right track when selecting a software for lighting simulations.\n&nbsp;\nThank you very much.\n&nbsp;\nSvetlana\n&nbsp;\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005094.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Svetlana Olbina", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 11:59AM", "created_by": "Svetlana_Olbina", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005090", "id": "radiance-general_005094"}
