{"body": "Hi Ivan,\n\n\nOne approach we have taken for cumulative irradiance studies is to add\nup the sky sources first and then do a single simulation with multiple\nskies.  There is a script that Francesco Anselmo developed (I can't\nrecall the name or where it might be at the moment) that creates an\nannual sky based on a tmy2 weather file.  Not sure of your exact needs,\nbut this might be an easier way to go about it.\n\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\nZack Rogers, P.E., IESNA, LEED AP\nDaylighting Analysis Group Leader\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext. 435\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>>> Iv\u00e1n Pajares S\u00e1nchez <defunkt at pobox.com> 6/5/2008 3:35 AM >>>\nHello group,\n\n\nI am working out some simulations to get some figures that help me \nestimate irradiance on a building for thermal load comparison. What I\nam \ntrying to do is to gauge the range of numbers one can get and the \ndifferences in different part of the building so I have a basis to\nspeak \nto the engineer.\n\n\nTo do this I generate my Radiance model with only one material to start\n\n\nwith with 50% reflectance. I generate a 1/2 hour series of renderings \n(with -i switch on).\nAfterwards I add up the irradiances with pcomb to get one picture from\n\n\nwhich to get the falsecolor scale in kWh / m2.\n\n\nI'm using falsecolor with -m = 0.001 to get the output in kWh / m2 to \nget daily cumulative irradiances. Is this approach correct?\n\n\nI'm doing this because RADMAP for windows fails to work (even the \nexample files that come with it) so I wanted to play around with \nradiance and learn something on the way.\n\n\n\n\nI guess my next step is to feed real irradiance data into radiance and\n\n\nfoloow the procedure outlined before, Am I in the proper direction?\n\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\n\nIv\u00e1n Pajares\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org \nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005095.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "June 05, 2008 at 01:16PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005095"}
