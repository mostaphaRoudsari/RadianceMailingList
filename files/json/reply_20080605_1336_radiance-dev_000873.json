{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your quick answer.\n\n\nYour proposed solution seems to solve the problem as no errror are\nreported  by the compiler any more.\n\n\nI've found a code snippet from another project where they set\nEZXML_NOMMAP whenever the code is compiled for Cygwin:\n\n\n/* disable MMAP on CYGWIN, seems to cause problems... */\n#ifdef CYGWIN\n#define EZXML_NOMMAP\n#endif\n\n\nThis could maybe be a solution for Radiance too. This will of course\nrequire some modifications of the build system but will provide a\ngeneric solution which can be extended if Cygwin causes other problems\nand therefore needs special treatment :-).\n\n\nBest regards\nEsben\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 5, 2008 at 5:52 PM, Gregory J.
