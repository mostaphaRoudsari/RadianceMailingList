{"body": "Hi Bernd,\n\n\nThank you for your suggestion.\n\n\nI have grep'ed around in the include dirs of Cygwin but could not\nlocate the Posix versions of the macros anywhere. In the file\n/usr/include/d/3.4.4/std/c/linux/linux.d however at least the\nMADV_SEQUENTIAL and ditto NORMAL are defined in an enumeration as\nmentioned in my first mail. Since I don't know the internals of Cygwin\nI don't know the purpose of this enumeration.\n\n\nBest regards\nEsben\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 5, 2008 at 6:25 PM, Bernd Zeimetz <bernd at bzed.de> wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n>> ezxml.c: In function `ezxml_parse_fd':\n>> ezxml.c:643: error: `MADV_SEQUENTIAL' undeclared (first use in this function)\n>\n> have a look if there's /usr/include/sys/mman.h and what is defined in\n> there, if the file exists at all.\n> If so you'll probably find POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL and POSIX_MADV_NORMAL,\n> try to replace MADV_SEQUENTIAL/MADV_NORMAL by them.
