{"body": "I've been trying to work out a similar solution for generating a  \ncomposite image of hourly irradiance values over a full year.    \nHowever, rather than cumulative results, as produced with pcomb, I  \nwant each pixel in the final image to only represent the highest value  \nof irradiance that occurs at that pixel location over a years worth of  \nhourly runs.  Ex: if a given pixel gets the highest level of  \nirradiance on June 21 @ noon then that will be the value given to that  \npixel in the final image.  Has anyone tackled this before? Thanks.\n\n\nRegards to all,\nChris H\nBerkeley,CA\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005098.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "June 08, 2008 at 11:08AM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005098"}
