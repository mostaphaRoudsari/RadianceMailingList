{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI haven't done this, but you should be able to compute the maximum  \nvalues between two images using pcomb like so:\n\n\n\tpcomb -h -e 'max(a,b):if(a-b,a,b)' -e 'lo=max(li(1),li(2))' -o  \nlast_max.pic -o new_vals.pic > cur_max.pic\n\n\nRenaming cur_max.pic to last_max.pic (using mv -f cur_max.pic  \nlast_max.pic) before each invocation should maintain the maximum  \nvalues at each pixel over each new addition of new_vals.pic.  (The -h  \noption is to avoid endless growth of the picture header.)\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 08, 2008 at 11:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005099"}
