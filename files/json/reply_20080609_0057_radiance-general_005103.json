However as I'm trying to \ninclude the direct component I generate the skies seperately without sun \nand the the suns on another file to render. This is leading to \nextraordinarily big numbers so I guess I have to, and please correct my \nmathematical language if wrong, normalize the numbers to get a \nmanageable figure to work with, is this right?\n\n\nI know I might be repeating what F. Anselmo and R. Compagnon have done \nwith radmap and other scripts but I confess I enjoy learning this things \n'the hard way'...\n\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n\nIs it better to render the direct sun component on separate file to get \nall the sun's dayli/montly or yearly positions and render with all those \ndirect sources plus the accumulated skies or to accumulate the skies \nwith the sun and render?\n\n\nThanks to everybody for the feedback, it is outstanding the knowledge \nthat flows through these emails...\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005103.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iv\u00e1n Pajares S\u00e1nchez", "created_at": "June 09, 2008 at 12:57AM", "created_by": "Iv\u00e1n_Pajares_S\u00e1nchez", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005103"}
