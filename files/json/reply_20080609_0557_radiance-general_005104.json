{"body": "Hi Ivan,\n> Is it better to render the direct sun component on separate file to  \n> get all the sun's dayli/montly or yearly positions and render with  \n> all those direct sources plus the accumulated skies or to accumulate  \n> the skies with the sun and render?\n\n\nIf I understand the question correctly, It's more efficient to render  \nusing a 'sky' file that contains both the cumulative sun (e.g. many  \nsuns) and the cumulative sky [1] contribution since the inter- \nreflection calculation will determine the indirect sun component as  \nwell and the direct + indirect sky components.\n-John\n[1] Cumulative sky could be based on either brightdata format or an  \naggregated 'image'.\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005104.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "June 09, 2008 at 05:57AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005104"}
