Your lightprobe idea sounds  \ninteresting, too.  I would like to update radmap to use gendaylit to  \ncreate the sky descriptions for greater accuracy, but the current  \nversion works well for us for now.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005106.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 09, 2008 at 08:30AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005078", "id": "radiance-general_005106"}
