{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nIndeed, the RGB<->XYZ conversion in xyz_rgb.cal follows the  \nderivation in Roger's book, and it's been checked pretty thoroughly.   \nAs you note, the actual results are determined by the choice of RGB  \nprimaries and white point, and this transform assumes you are going  \nfor absolute rather than perceptually white-adjusted values.  The  \nprimaries chosen are the standard ones for Radiance, which are a near  \nmiss to the CCIR-709 recommendation used for the sRGB color space and  \nmost modern computer monitors, which is given in xyz_srgb.cal along  \nwith a D65 (versus equal-energy) white point.\n\n\nWhat other people have used for their color conversions is anyone's  \nguess.\n\n\nBy the way, did you mean to respond to the radiance-general posting  \non radiance-dev as you did?  I'm not sure Nick and Steve are on this  \nlist....\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000877.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 10, 2008 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000876", "id": "radiance-dev_000877"}
