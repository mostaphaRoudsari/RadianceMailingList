{"body": "> I like to keep my file formats as obvious as possible.\n\n\nWhile in general this works, in my case it was not obvious enough - at\nleast I had to ask :-) Thank you for the explanation.\n\n\nNow, I see that I get a function for each channel. What I guess is that\nthe function is sensor response ( picture luminance ), is this\nassumption true?\n\n\nWhat I actually would like to do is, for a range of picture luminances,\nplot a graph of the sensor output using the polynomal as given by\nhdrgen, and overlay it with the response curve as written by pfstools. I\nam using both tools at the moment and would like to see the differences\nfor the given range of luminances caused by the different algorithms.\n\n\nIs this possible at all?\n\n\nIs there any kind of unit related to the sensor response values?\n\n\nTIA&CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-June/000190.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
