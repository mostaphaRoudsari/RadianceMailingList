{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThere are no units for the sensor response function, which isn't  \nluminance, but individual responses for the three color channels  \n(red, green, and blue).  Sadly, even these are mixed up, since there  \nis a non-linear (and unknown) color transform between the sensors RGB  \nand the image RGB values.\n\n\nBTW, most of the accuracy from HDR sequences is unrelated to the  \nderived camera response.  Rather, it's from the proper combining of  \nclosely-spaced exposures with accurately reported ISO, speed, and  \naperture.  If those things are not reported correctly by the camera,  \nthen all bets are off.  Other things that undermine accuracy are lens  \nflare (trying to measure a dark area near a bright one or with direct  \nlight entering the camera), and vignetting for wide apertures.   \nAbsolute response is also a big issue, which is why you should  \nprobably have at least one luminance reading from each captured scene  \nif the actual values (and not just relative values) matter to you.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-June/000191.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 11, 2008 at 12:15AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000187", "id": "hdri_000191"}
