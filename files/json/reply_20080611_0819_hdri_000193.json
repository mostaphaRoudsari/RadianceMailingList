{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nSorry for the poor response to your previous question.  I was a bit  \nconfused by it.  This is clearer:\n\n\n> I understood the graphs / curves that I see response dependant on\n> luminance? If I draw the curve as a graph, and I write \"response\"  \n> to the\n> y-axis, what is the label for the x-axis in this case?\n\n\nIn fact, the response curve is reversed.  The independent axis (x) is  \n\"sensor output\" scaled from the 0-255 in the image to a 0-1 range for  \nthe recorded polynomial.  The dependent axis (y) produced by the  \npolynomial should be proportional to luminance, but it needs to be  \nmultiplied by the appropriate scale factors taken from the ISO,  \nspeed, aperture, and calibration.\n\n\nI hope this makes better sense.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-June/000193.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 11, 2008 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000187", "id": "hdri_000193"}
