Radiance has a built in tolerance for these points  \nbut when that's exceeded\nthe warning is generated and the vertex or the whole polygon ignored  \nin the rendering.\nI'm not sure about the last part but maybe someone else knows better.\n\n\nRelevance: If the polygon is ignored and it is essential for the  \ngeometry (ie a wall of a room)\nthen it is relevant. If it's just a tiny piece that doesn't do much  \nfor the lighting it's harmless.\n\n\nTo avoid this problem export with the option 'triangulate'. This  \ncreates polygons with\nonly 3 vertices. Much more polygons in the scene but no warnings.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005114.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 12, 2008 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005111", "id": "radiance-general_005114"}
