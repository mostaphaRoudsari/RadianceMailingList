{"body": "Hi Nikhil,\n\n\nAs Thomas said in his response, the material should show up in a  \nnormal rendering.  The best way to model frit glass is to use the  \n\"glaze.csh\" script that I created with funding from Visarc.  For a  \nsingle-pane glazing using a full covering of V-175 white frit, this  \nscript produces:\n\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision: 2.7 $\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 1\n# Exterior surface s1 type: clear glass\n# Interior surface s2 type: V-175 white frit\n# s2 coating coverage: 1\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.33\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.59\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.21\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed\n10\n         sr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\n         st_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n         0 0 0\n         glaze1.cal\n0\n11\n0.59\n0.59\n0.59\n0.256\n0.253\n0.251\n0.21\n0.21\n0.21\n         -1      1\n\n\nTry this for now, or run the script yourself to vary the parameters.   \nIf you can't run the script because you only have a Windows machine,  \nthen you may be stuck playing around with the \"trans\" material.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005118.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 12, 2008 at 03:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005112", "id": "radiance-general_005118"}
