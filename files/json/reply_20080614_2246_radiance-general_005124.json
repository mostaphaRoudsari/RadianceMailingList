{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nThe packages will be installed into the directory specified by packages\nitself. I suppose they'll be somewhere in a /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or\n/opt/radiance. Not in your home directory anyway!\n\n\nI'm unsure if the RAYPATH env. variable will be set automatically.\n\n\nYou may download the package I compiled for Ubuntu 7.10 myself:\nhttp://www.bakharev.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=38\n\n\nThe files will be installed into /usr/bin and /usr/lib. Also it sets all\nthe env. variables needed for Radiance to work.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nIlya\n\n\n\n\nZZ wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005124.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ilya A.
