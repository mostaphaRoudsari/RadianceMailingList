{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI realize you received several replies on this. But just a note for\neveryone.The error that you received when trying to run makeall install,\neg \"command not found,\" indicates that you do not have cshell (csh)\ninstalled. This is the shell that makeall requires. If you type \"csh\" at\nthe command line, you should get a message that explains how to get csh\nusing apt-get.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005126.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "June 16, 2008 at 06:26AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005120", "id": "radiance-general_005126"}
