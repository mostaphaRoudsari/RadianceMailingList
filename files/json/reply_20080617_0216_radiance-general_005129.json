This introduces a slight  \ndeviation from the mathematically 'perfect' distribution which might  \nbe noticed in certain situations.  You can prevent this happening by  \nusing a slightly modified version of cal file available here:\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/pickup/skybright_nomix.cal\n\n\nSimply place where it will be found by RAYPATH and rename  \n'skybright.cal' in the gensky output to 'skybright_nomix.cal'.  This  \nwill work for all sky luminance distributions.  If uniform is the only  \n'perfect' sky that you need, then the easiest way is create it manually:\n\n\n# uniform brightness sky (B=1)\nvoid glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nRe: Q2 - Have a look at the \"ambient accuracy parameter\" thread in  \nDecember 2006 (especially Greg's comment).\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-John\n\n\nPS. The current skybright.cal (2.7) is a later version than the one I  \nmodified (2.6), but I didn't note any difference in the code other  \nthan the RCS header.\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005129.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "June 17, 2008 at 02:16AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005128", "id": "radiance-general_005129"}
