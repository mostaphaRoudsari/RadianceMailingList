{"body": "Dear Kam,\n\n\nAs John Mardaljevic points out, the change at the edges of the sky is  \ndue to the \"mixing function\" designed to reduce variance at the  \nhorizon between the sky and the ground.  You can also avoid its  \nappearance without modifying skyfunc.cal by setting -g 1.0 in gensky,  \nI believe.\n\n\nAs for the repeatability of the results, John's reference is a good one:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006- \nDecember/004147.html\n\n\nI'm grateful to him for digging this up -- I would have tried to  \nanswer it all over again...\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  It is better not to send attachments to the list.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005130.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 17, 2008 at 07:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005127", "id": "radiance-general_005130"}
