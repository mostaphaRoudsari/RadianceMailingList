{"body": "Lars,\n\n\n From the gensky manpage:\n-m mer The site standard meridian is mer degrees west of Greenwich.  \n(Use negative angle for east.) This is used in the calculation of  \nsolar time. Be sure to give the correct longitude also! If a time zone  \nor solar time is given directly, then this option has no effect.\nSo it looks like solar time is not determined when you specify a time  \nzone, e.g. GMT.  I never use the time zone settings myself, preferring  \nto use the site meridian.  For your example:\ngensky 6 21 13:30 +s -a 1.25 -o -103.75 -m -120\ngiving:\n# Solar altitude and azimuth: 67.1 166.0\nWhich is much closer to where the Navy would have the sun (probably  \nvery nearly identical with the difference due to rounding).\n-John\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005133.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "June 18, 2008 at 03:25AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005132", "id": "radiance-general_005133"}
