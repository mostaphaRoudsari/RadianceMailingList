I'm ASSuming you are talking about the \nlatest release or HEAD release of the source code, in which case there \nare no executables in there.  The source code needs to be compiled into \nexecutables on your system.  Sounds like you're using a mac, so in order \nto compile the source you need to install the developer tools (Xcode), \nwhich you can get from here:\n\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html\n\n\nThen you'd run (as root) \"makeall install\" from the ray directory. \n\n\nLet us know how that works out.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 20, 2008 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005143", "id": "radiance-general_005146"}
