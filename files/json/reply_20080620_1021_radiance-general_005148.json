The latest radiance-HEAD source distro's makefile was \nlast modified on 4/17; I compiled the HEAD on a new system here on 4/20, \nand everything compiled fine.  I don't have time right now to test the \nlatest greatest HEAD on a system here, but I do see that the linux \nbinary package is missing a lot of programs. Francesco Anselmo maintains \nthat package, so hopefully he can weigh in here...\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005148.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 20, 2008 at 10:21AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005143", "id": "radiance-general_005148"}
