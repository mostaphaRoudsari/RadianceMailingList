{"body": "Hi Francesco,\n\n\nYour posting arrived twice -- were you not sure that it was posted  \nthe first time?  You can always double-check at radiance-online,  \nsince the archives are always current.\n\n\nThe \"interface\" type is what you are looking for, I believe, since it  \nallows you to specify the dielectric constant on either side of a  \nboundary.  Modeling materials at this level of detail requires that  \nyou know very precise things about the geometry and physical properties.\n\n\nIt is OK to have some sides of a dielectric capped by an opaque  \nmaterial, such as plastic.  If you have no cap, just an opening, then  \nthe results will not be correct.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005154.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 23, 2008 at 12:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005152", "id": "radiance-general_005154"}
