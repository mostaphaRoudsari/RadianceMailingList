{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI've had problems with glrad on various platforms as well, but I've  \nno idea how to fix it.  I'm not much of an OpenGL programmer, and the  \ncompatibility issues between implementations are considerable.   \nAnyone who wants to take this on, I'd be more than happy to answer  \nquestions about what it's supposed to be doing, etc.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005161.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 30, 2008 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005157", "id": "radiance-general_005161"}
