It can be used to create CIE standard\nsky situations.\n\n\ngendaylit creates the sky description following the Perez\nsky model. It is more suited to model different atmospheric\nconditions if you know how the parameters work. You can find\nthe man page here:\n\n\nhttp://caad.arch.ethz.ch/CAAD/ray/man_html/gendaylit.1.html\n\n\nIf you just want to do typical illuminance calcs for standard\nsituations you can happily stick with gensky.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005165.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 30, 2008 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005158", "id": "radiance-general_005165"}
