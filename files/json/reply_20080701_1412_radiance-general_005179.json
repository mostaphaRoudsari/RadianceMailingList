It's clumsy and resource hogging\nbecause it simulates an entire PC instead of sharing the hardware\nbetween two operating systems as VMware or Parallels on Mac\ndoes.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a faster and free alternative you can\ngoogle for Xen (which has the Linux setup hassle mentioned\nabove) or VirtualBox (Sun freeware).\n\n\nOn the subject of CPU type it should not matter much which\nCPU you are running on. You will get the better performance\nout of the CPU that's supported better by your virtualisation\nsoftware. In the case of Virtual PC I'd guess it makes no\ndifference at all.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005179.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 01, 2008 at 02:12PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005169", "id": "radiance-general_005179"}
