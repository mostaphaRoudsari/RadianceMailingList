However, as \nit seams to be related to climate, not only illumination, I really \nwonder if a more general simulation tool such as esp-r could be used \nhere. To decide what grows where, assumptions of temperature, humidity, \nair flows would be important too. So you would get a climate profile of \na location from a simulation run and could try to find suitable \nvegetation according to that. I know of lists of plants used e.g. in \nparks, public spaces and gardens, showing basic requirements, but \nnothing in terms of physical units. So I guess this is something that \nwould have to be started yet... I am very curious about what you are \ndoing, and will try to get some details from a friend who is in botanics.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005180.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
