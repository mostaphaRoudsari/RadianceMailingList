{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nI would suggest to start experiencing with the linux/unix terminal:\nyou'll see that you will use it quite a lot with Radiance! ;-)\n\n\nJust open a terminal window (Application/Terminal or Alt-F2 and type  \n\"gnome-terminal\")\nand write\n\n\nsudo apt-get install radiance\n\n\nThe apt package manager downloads a precompiled radiance package, so  \nthat\nyou don't have to compile or extract the Radiance binaries yourself.\n\n\nAlternatively you can use the Synaptic package manager, accessible\nfrom the System/Administration menu.\n\n\nLook for the radiance packages, and install them.\n\n\nThat's all! Oh well, that's just the beginning.\nThere should be some radiance examples in the /usr/share/radiance  \nfolder,\nor something similar. Try to familiarise with them and buy yourself\nthe Radiance bible:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/\nhttp://tinyurl.com/67hw9r\n\n\nHTH.\n\n\nFrancesco\n\n\nPS: There is a relatively new Radiance wiki with some minimal\ninformation at the moment,\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php\nI hope that it grows in the future, feel free to add anything to it  \nwhile\nyou are experimenting.\nCiao, F.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005184.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "July 06, 2008 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005183", "id": "radiance-general_005184"}
