{"body": "Thank you for this great resource.\n\n\nI fought the same fight, not only in writing, but also in promoting  \nand hosting Picturenaut (which is using your TMO). Associating HDR  \nwith a certain look tends to be a beginner's mistake, and it looks to  \nme like the situation is improving. It really is less about the  \nsoftware, but rather about the judgement abilities of the user. After  \ngoing crazy with surrealistic looks, more and more people seem to get  \ninto naturalistic tone reproduction. I monitored Flickr very closely  \nby leeching the most popular \"hdr\"-tagged images every month. And  \nthere no doubt that things are improving. (see http://www.hdrlabs.com/gallery/hotlarger.php) \n. Now about half the images are bearable, 6 months ago it was all  \nsurrealistic/overdone looks. Education is the key to raise awareness,  \nand many photographers actually do use HDR on a professional level now  \nin real estate or fine art photography. Michael Freeman's book is also  \nhitting this vein, very recommended read.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nChristian Bloch\n\n\n\n\nOn Jul 7, 2008, at 8:42 AM, E.
