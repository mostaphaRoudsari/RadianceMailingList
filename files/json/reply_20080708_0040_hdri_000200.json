{"body": "Hi...\n> In the introduction, you should indicate that HDR means High Dynamic Range - you use both, but don't equate them.  I've spoken to several photographers who think HDR is a look, and have no idea that it might mean something else.\nI am not sure if it would discourage the targetted audience - but maybe \none should just write that HDR, which means High Dynamic Range - is not \nreally suitable as a format to share for web browser display.\n\n\nAnd than go on explaining how to create \"good\" tone-mapped images.\n\n\nI do not know anyone who really browses the net for hdr-images. \nEverything seams to be about tone-mapped images.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-July/000200.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
