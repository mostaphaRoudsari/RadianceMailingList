QT4 is nice to work with, and more\nimportant, it has - in my opinion - a much more reliable upstream and\nless bugs than wx. QT4 supports all important platforms - including OSX\nand Windows, and supports OpenGL out of the box.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-July/000882.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "July 08, 2008 at 01:22PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000878", "id": "radiance-dev_000882"}
