{"body": "Qt's great, but it doesn't support Python, my preferred environment,  \nwhen I don't need great speed. Sigh. What I've seen of WxWidgets  \ndoesn't thrill me, either, but it works in a broad range of  \nenvironments. There aren't  really any good FOSS solutions that I've  \nseen, and the ones that aren't FOSS are too expensive to consider.\n\n\nOh, well. Maybe this is less of an issue than I think; right now I'm  \nstill struggling to build shared libraries; I'll know more when I  \nstart doing serious UI work.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-July/000883.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "R Fritz", "created_at": "July 08, 2008 at 03:20PM", "created_by": "R_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000878", "id": "radiance-dev_000883"}
