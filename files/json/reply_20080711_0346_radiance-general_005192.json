{"body": "There is a tool called ies2rad included in radiance, which will \ntranslate a ies-formatted distribution to a light source in Radiance. \nThe process is also described well in RwR, or in the various tutorials. \nStill, you must be careful - the orientation of some ies-distributions \nseams to be a cause for errors frequently, and you also have to make \nsure that the units in the ies-file fit those in the scene (or the \ntranslation corrects this). It is good practice to place the light \nsource, after the translation, using !xform-statements - that way you \ncan easily change them.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005192.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
