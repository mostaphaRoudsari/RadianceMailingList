{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nI'm using ESP-r coupling Radiance.Through \"daylight coefficient\" approach, I\nget the illuminance of an indoor photocell location, but the illuminance is\nmore than 40000 lux. I think it must be much more intense than reality.\n\n\nDoes anybody have any ideas about why that? And how to cut down the illuminance?\n\n\nthank you.\n\n\nWarm regards,\nZZ\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005193.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "ZZ", "created_at": "July 11, 2008 at 05:20AM", "created_by": "ZZ", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_005193"}
