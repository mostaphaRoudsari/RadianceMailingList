{"body": "Nick, you are almost there ;-)\n\n\nrview's name changed to rvu. So call it again with\n\n\nrvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test2.oct\n\n\nRpict gives out a picture, so the strange characters are what is \nhappening if you write a picture to the terminal. Redirect output to a \nfile and display it with ximage:\n\n\nrpict -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test2.oct > image.hdr\nximage image.hdr\n\n\nOr if you do not want to save the image but just display it, redirect \nthe ouput to ximage using the pipe:\n\n\nrpict -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test2.oct | ximage\n\n\nI hope this helps a bit. Get used to input/output-redirection, which is \ndescribed in all standard Linux tutorials. You should know the meaning \nof <, > and | in a unix-like system. Than introduce filters such as \npfilt, ra_tiff, pcond. Than go on with modeling scenes, lights, materials.\n\n\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005202.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
