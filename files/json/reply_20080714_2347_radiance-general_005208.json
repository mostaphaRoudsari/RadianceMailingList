I do not know if you have any experience as a photographer, \nbut you would most probably use a wide angle lense, as the room is small \nand you want to see a perspective v\u0131ew, not just one wall. Try something \nlike -vh 90, which would open the horizontal field of view to 90 degree. \nAlso, sketch a plan of your room, and mark view-point and field of view \n(which would be an angle at the viewpoint), so you can get an idea how \nmuch you can see of your room at a given point with a given lense.\n\n\nThis is much more about photography/sketching then Radiance.\n\n\nYou could use rvu and just play around, but it is still better to KNOW \nwhat you are doing ;-)\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005208.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
