{"body": "> I mean to get a picture from ''rvu\".\n>\n\n\nThere are commands in rvu to rotate the camera around camera center (r),\naround a center on an object surface (p), to move the camera (m) etc.\nYou should set a wider field of view as a command line parameter. When\nyou are happy, you save the view to a view file.\n\n\nTo be honest, I never felt that comfortable navigating in rvu. So I\nchoose a number of promising views (using my paper-and-pen-approach) and\ndo some previews, feeding the view parameters to rvu on the command\nline. Usually I imagine where I want to stand, what should be in the\ncenter of the image, etc, so I use rvu as a pure preview.\n\n\nOf course you can also use any 3d-modeler to find camera position,\ndirection etc. IT should only be possible to define field of view (or\n\"focal length\").\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005211.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
