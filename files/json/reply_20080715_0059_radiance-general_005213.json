{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nit has been a while since I started radiance from inside esp-r. Can you\nfind out how to set the ab-parameter for the simulation? It is the\nnumber of ambient bounces. I would set it to 3 in your case. Others\nmight suggest even higher values - you should increase it until there is\nno real change observed any more.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005213.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
