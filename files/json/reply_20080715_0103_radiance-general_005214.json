{"body": "Hi, all,\n\n\nsorry for the mistake in the last email.\n\n\n  I'm trying to use ESP-r coupling Radiance to perform thermal integrating\ndaylight use simulation.\n\n\n  And I have performed 7 days simulation with 1 hour timestep, which means I\ngot 168 illuminance numbers of one indoor test point. I find calculated\nilluminances of 6 days is basically close to the measured data. But1 day is\nexceptional, there is a big difference between calculated illuminances and\nmeaured ones. That1 day is a very clear sky because that day has a highest\ndirect and diffuse radiation of those 7days, but the simulated illuminance\nwith radiance is\nmuch lower than other six days. Anybody can tell why? and how to modifiy?\n\n\nThank you for your time.\nZZ\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005214.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "ZZ", "created_at": "July 15, 2008 at 01:03AM", "created_by": "ZZ", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005212", "id": "radiance-general_005214"}
