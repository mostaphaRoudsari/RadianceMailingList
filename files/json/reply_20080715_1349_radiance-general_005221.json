A clear sky has a different distribution\nthan an overcast sky and this could influence the illuminance\nin your scene, especially if you're parameters for the ambient\ncalculation are too low (-ab option as mentioned by Lars).\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005221.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 15, 2008 at 01:49PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005212", "id": "radiance-general_005221"}
