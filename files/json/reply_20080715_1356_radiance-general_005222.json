Once you have started rvu press 'v' and\nfill in the view parameters (view point, direction, up,\nangle, clipping). Repeat with small changes until you have\na nice view.\n\n\nYou can save the final view parameters but also the image\n('W') to a file. The clipping is useful to create parallel\nand perspective views that are physically impossible (eg.\na perspective of the interior of the room from the outside).\n\n\nRead the man page for rvu. It tells you all the tricks.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005222.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 15, 2008 at 01:56PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005205", "id": "radiance-general_005222"}
