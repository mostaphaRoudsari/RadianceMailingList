{"body": "If you have indoor lighting, the light fall-off and, maybe, direction of\nthe light will underline geometry based on distance. Also objects will\ncreate visible shades when between light and surfaces.\n\n\nIn your empty room, lid only by daylight (probably with a low -ab\nsetting and a set av-value, you did not tell us more about the\nparameters you used), all surfaces will show the -av-preset brightness,\nas they most probably do not receive direct light and the indirect is\nnot calculated. So it is hard to understand the interior, and there is\nactually little calculation done.\n\n\nSet -ab 2 and try again.\n\n\nIn general, for your questions, it is always important to post the whole\ncommand line, e.g. rpict with all options and parameters! Without, we\nare just guessing what you may have done.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005226.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
