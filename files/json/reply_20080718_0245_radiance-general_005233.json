{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n> We discussed that within our group and decided to simplify the license.\n> From now on, you can use it also for commercial products and it can be\n> easily included in packages.\n> We only want to be acknowledged - which is similar to the RADIANCE\n> license. Details: see README file of the package.\n\n\nThis sounds good, thanks a lot! Although I'd suggest for your own safety\n(please note that I'm not a lawyer...) to\n- require that the copyright information is kept in the files\n- require that the *license* is not removed from the source. At the\nmoment you're alloweing me to share the files without any license\ninformation...\n- add a disclaimer which tells people that they can't sue you if your\nsoftware fucked up their system.. or so. Although I'm not a lawyer and\ndon't know if you need that or now, in my optinion it's better to have it.\n\n\nWhile I appreciate free licenses, I'd still suggest to stick with a\nlicense like the one radiance uses (which is the older BSD license) or,\nif you're looking for a really free one, use the ISC license.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license\n\n\n\n\nAnd the other question is: Does Greg want to include gendaylit into\nRadiance, or would it make sense? With such a license this would be\npossible.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005233.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "July 18, 2008 at 02:45AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005231", "id": "radiance-general_005233"}
