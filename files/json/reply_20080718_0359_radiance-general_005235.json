{"body": "> Is there any experience out there to share regarding installing Daysim \n> (Linux version) on a Mac PPC running OS 10.4 ?\nIt is not possible like that. You can either install an emulator, which \nwill emulate a x86-machine with linux, on your Mac and run it in there, \nor you have to convince the Daysim-folks to compile a universal binary \nfor OS X. The problem is that Daysim is compiled for an entirely \ndifferent platform (x86) then yours (ppc).\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005235.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
