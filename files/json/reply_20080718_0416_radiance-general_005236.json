{"body": "Hi\n\n\nI run Dayim on a Macbook Pro (OSX 10.5 and on the earlier 10.4). Current\nconfiguration is to use Parallels Desktop for Mac to run XP 95, then\ninstalled the windows version of Daysim on this. I've also used Apple\nBootcamp / XP / Daysim combination as well. \n\n\nRegards\n\n\nSean Mooney \n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\nThis message has been scanned by MailController -\nwww.MailController.altohiway.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sean Mooney", "created_at": "July 18, 2008 at 04:16AM", "created_by": "Sean_Mooney", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005234", "id": "radiance-general_005236"}
