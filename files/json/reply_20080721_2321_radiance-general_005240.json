Most probably it is not a problem of the software. We do not \nknow / see the problem. A \"light leakage\" can be anything from a missing \nceiling to a rounding error...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005240.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
