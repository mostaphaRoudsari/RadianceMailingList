There are \nstandards such as iges, step for cad, and for models/scenes vrml, x3d \nusually work well. dxf is a propietary format by Autodesk, they change \nit at will, do not expect other software to be able to support it perfectly.\n\n\nTo import (subset) dxf into radiance, there are several translators, but \nobj is better supported now.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005241.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
