{"body": "Dear Thomas and Harshada, \nwe currently have also figured out a light leakage problem that occurs only when working with quite huge models. We did some analysis on that problem and found out the following:\n\n\nIf we measure the daylight factors in a simple box generated with genbox without any openings than rtrace gives us zero values for all measurement points as expected. \n\n\nIf we than add an additional surface that is much bigger than the simple box and do the simulation again (without changing anything else), we receive light in the the completely closed box. We think, we are using appropriate values for -aa and -ar. The result of:  biggest_model_length * aa / ar is much smaller than the distance between the measurement points.\n\n\nMaybe the solution for this problem is using mkillum instead of common windows. We keep on testing...\n\n\nRegard, Kai.\n\n\n\n\n\t-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\n\tVon: radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org] Im Auftrag von EncaseIndia\n\tGesendet: Donnerstag, 24.
