{"body": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nThanks for your feedback\n\n\nyup as Kai said ,,I have kinda huge model... so that can be one of the things which i need to check.\nand one more thing is as Thomas said,I have modelled it without the actual material thickness.So i even have to check it with that.\nNow I am just explaining what problem i have eaxactly.\nI have a geometry of a building block wiith two wings ,modular. The wing from which I am getting light leakage is on east side.\nSo i tried copying the same geometry from west to east.\nbut the same geometry is perfect on west and if you place it on east it leaks light.\n\n\nI know this is kinda long mail,,, but thanks for reading\n\n\nIn search of solution\nHarshada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005263.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "EncaseIndia", "created_at": "July 25, 2008 at 01:56AM", "created_by": "EncaseIndia", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005239", "id": "radiance-general_005263"}
