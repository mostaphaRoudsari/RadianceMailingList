{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nOne of the slowest things in Radiance is the .cal file evaluations,  \nso minimizing expression evaluations is the key to faster renderings  \nin this case.  Having many surfaces for each ray, all having function  \nevaluations, is bound to be slow.  Combining or eliminating such  \ncalls would help a lot.  I don't know enough about your situation to  \nrecommend \"how.\"\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005268.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 27, 2008 at 03:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005267", "id": "radiance-general_005268"}
