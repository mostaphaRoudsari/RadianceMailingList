As \nfar as I know, I alsways have to at least rotate anything mapped that I \nwant to appear on a non-horizontal surface. I can avoid scaling, \nmirroring etc by applying these tranforms to the images using image \nprocessing tools such as those coming with radiance. But for avoiding \nthe rotation, I do not see a way (besides rotating the whole model with \nlight sources and views instead of the images if e.g. I want to map most \nonto a vertical plane). So did you mean something like that when saying \n\"eliminating such calls\", or were you thinking about structuring them \nmore efficient?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005271.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
