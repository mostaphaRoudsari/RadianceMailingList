{"body": "> I have been working on building a small collection of computers to run rpiece.

There are \nmany ways to check why and how this is the case (the most basic would be \nto try to install any other package, maybe you cannot install anything \nat all?). Also working network connections not always mean access to \napt-sources, e.g. if there is a firewall which blocks one machine and \nlets the others connect.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005272.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
