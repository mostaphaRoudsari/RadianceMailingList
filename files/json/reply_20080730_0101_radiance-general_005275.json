{"body": "> Does this make sense?\n\n\nYes, it does ;-) thank you for the explanation Greg! You know that I \nhave a model making rather intensive use of textures here (the Hagia \nSophia model), and I was wondering if there were some techniques to \napply for a speed-up. But as we do not combine cal-files at all, just \nmap one image per object, I do not see such a possibility any more. It \nmight make sense to have simplified colorpict modifiers doing the most \nfrequently used transformations hard-coded, without calling to the \ncal-file interpreter - e.g. a colorpictxy, colorpict xz and colorpict yz \nmodifier which would allow to do all mapping in orthogonal models \nwithout cal-files. But it would break e.g. xform for such modifiers, and \ncreate a mess in the scene language while few models really have a \nproblem with too many mappings. So we have to live with slow mappings ;-)\n\n\nBTW, as it is related to textures and came to my mind some days ago - it \nshould be quite doable to modify the source of mkillum in a way that it \noutputs polygons with a prerendered ambient calculation mapped onto \nthem, right? It would be one step towards a nice vrml/x3d-export from \nradiance scenes, as the x3d- / vrml-viewer could render the direct \nlight, while the view-point independent ambient calculation would be \nleft to radiance. The only problem would be the need of correct surface \nnormals for the whole model.\n\n\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005275.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
