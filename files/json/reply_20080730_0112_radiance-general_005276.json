Richard Gillibrand (formerly of Bristol Univ.) and his  \n2003 workshop presentation springs to mind.  Here is a related  \nearlier post, relating also to the presentation by Bernhard Spanlang  \nin 2002.\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/ \n000551.html\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005276.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 30, 2008 at 01:12AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005267", "id": "radiance-general_005276"}
