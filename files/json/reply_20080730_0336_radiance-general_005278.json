Such a feature makes sense to me \nalso.\nIn my case the mixfunc for transparancy is consuming lots of rendering time. \nAlthough .cal files makes the whole system very flexible, some features are \nso commonly used that of course it would be great if these were optimized a \nbit. At the other hand I imagine that these kind of changes are not that \neasily done, if it is possible at all, in the first place.\n\n\nIebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005278.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "July 30, 2008 at 03:36AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005267", "id": "radiance-general_005278"}
