E.g. imagine a scene \nusing a colorpict_xz modifier. Everything would be fine - until you run \nxform to rotate the scene. Xform would have to replace the optimized \nmodifier now. And having two ways to do the same is always a mess to \nsupport. So I guess the rather few cases where this is needed do not \nrectify the trouble one would introduce in that case.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005279.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
