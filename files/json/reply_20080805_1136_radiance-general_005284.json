That's what the compile script\nis based on and I don't think it comes with Mac OS X. Mine\nis installed in /usr/local/bin which indicates I put it\nthere myself.\n\n\nReading through your error messages there are a lot of\nerrors from 'cp' usage. I think the script tries to copy\nmultiple files in a directory in '/usr/local' that does\nnot exist. You can try and create the directory '/usr/local/ray'\nyourself and then run the script again.\n\n\nhth,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005284.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 05, 2008 at 11:36AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005280", "id": "radiance-general_005284"}
