Place\n\n\nPATH=\"/usr/local/ray/bin:${PATH}\nRAYPATH=\".:/usr/local/ray/lib\"\n\n\nin your ~/.bash_profile file. Then set the command that's executed by\nTerminal to \"/bin/bash --login\" (in \"Preferences\").\n\n\nWhen you restart Terminal now you should have Radiance in your PATH.\nPlease adjust for your Radiance installation path and preferred shell  \nand\nread about the startup files in the man page. It's a bit more  \ncomplicated on\nMac OS X but the man page reflects that.\n\n\n\n\nAnd please delete the tail of a message if you're not referring to it  \nany longer.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005286.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 05, 2008 at 12:24PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005280", "id": "radiance-general_005286"}
