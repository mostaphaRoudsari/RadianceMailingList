{"body": "> Has this command changed too? (such as rview to rvu)\n\n\nOn Linux systems, there already exists a command genbox. So the package \nmaintainers (I guess you use a debian or ubuntu setup?) have to rename \nthese tools (I would guess to rgenbox, rgenprism) to avoid \nunpredicteable behaviour. The source tree at radsite/radiance-online \ndoesn't reflect these changes, the documentation doesn't do it neither.\n\n\nActually I start to feel that the fact that a lot of radiance \ninstallations are done on Linux those days, but the tools' names do not \nhave a commen prefix or anything that would make it possible to include \nthem unchanged into any distribution, is getting more and more trouble. \nAs a rule, when encountering such problems, try to find out \"which\" \ncommand you actually call, and what it does, by running it seperately, \nnot from inside a scene description.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005291.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
