{"body": "Hi Dave,\n\n\nRpiece calls on rpict to render \"pieces\" of the image as determined by \nrpiece. So in other words, you do not start rpiece and then start rpict, \nthis is what rpiece does for you. Looking at what you have provided, I \nhave to surmise that you are not telling rpiece to divide the view up. \nIn order to do this you need to provide  rpiece with -X <divisions in X> \n-Y <divisions in Y>, so for example -X 2 -Y 2 would divide the image \ninto a 2x2 matrix. We do not know what your other arguments are so it is \nhard to tell if other things are missing. It might help if you could \nprovide the the full command line that you are using to run the job.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005294.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "August 08, 2008 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005293", "id": "radiance-general_005294"}
