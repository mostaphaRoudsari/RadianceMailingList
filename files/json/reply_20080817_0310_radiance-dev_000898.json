Fortunately, mktemp(1) does indeed quite a bit better\nthan that, and actually creates the file before anyone else can\n(presumably using mkstemp(3)). If the shell scripts can be fixed\nthat way with reasonable effort, I'm all for it.\nIn fact, this will make the scripts more secure (with regards to\nthis specific, and for Radiance probably minor, aspect) than the\nfew remaining mktemp(3) instances in the C code.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-August/000898.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "August 17, 2008 at 03:10AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000890", "id": "radiance-dev_000898"}
