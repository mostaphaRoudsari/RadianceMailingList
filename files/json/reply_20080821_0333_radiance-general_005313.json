{"body": "Hi Adriana.\n> I'm assuming that this material can best described as follows:\n>\n> void metal metal_1\n> 0\n> 0\n> 5  .95  .95  .95  .90 .10\nSorry, you are close, but this would give a strange result. the .90 is \nfine and tells radiance that 90% is specular, 10% is diffuse \nreflectance. The .10 does not work. Roughness is not the same as diffuse \nreflection. Diffuse reflection is already defined as the difference \nbetwenn specular reflection and 1. Roughness is more or less a visual \neffect simulating uneveness of a surface. Set it to zero for your \napplication.\n\n\nThe same for your second example, set the rgb values to the total \nreflection, define the specular component (which is low in the second \nexample), so the rest is diffuse.\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005313.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
