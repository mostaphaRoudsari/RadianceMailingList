{"body": "> Then, my question is: what is the difference between \"Total Reflection %\"\n> and \"Specular Reflectivity %\", and how does this translate in the METAL\n> material values?\n\n\nHm, I hope I do not write something wrong now...\n\n\nThe total reflection is the relation of energy reflected to the energy\nthat is hitting the surface. 100 hit the surface, so, if total\nreflectivity is 95%, 95 leave it.\n\n\nSpecular reflectivity is the part of what is reflected that is leaving\nthe surface in a directed manner. So to go on with our example, is 95%\nwas the total reflection, and the specular reflectivity is 90%, of the\n100 hitting the surface 0.9*95=85.5 leave the surface as specular\nreflection. That also means that the remaining 0.1*95=9.5 leave it as\ndiffuse.\n\n\nMy total unitless numbers would all translate into radiance Watt / (sr *\nm2).\n\n\n> My other question is still about the value ranges:\n> \n> What are the maximum values for \"specularity\" and \"roughness\".

If you replace the\nmaximum 1.0 by 100% you will understand.\n\n\nAs far as I know you are right about roughness, but it is difficult to\nestimate this parameter, and I treat it more as a visual effect...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005314.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
