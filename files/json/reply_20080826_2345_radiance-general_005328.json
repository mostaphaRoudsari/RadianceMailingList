I vaguely \nremember simple skylights like in Walmart performing better than roof \nmonitors with louvers or something to that effect.\n\n\nI don't even know if there is a paper written up on the subject matter. I \ndo not have Prof Moeck's current contact information so I'm hoping to find \nhim or someone else who can help through this email.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nRAMANA KOTI Assoc.
