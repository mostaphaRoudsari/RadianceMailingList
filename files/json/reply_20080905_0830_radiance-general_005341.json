Here is a link to a paper Greg wrote on rad that is\nextremely informative about the way rad (and by extension, all of the\nrendering and calculation pieces of Radiance) works:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop2/cd/Ward/egwr95.pdf\n\n\nAnd from this paper, regarding the routines rad employs to make these\ndecisions about rendering parameters, we have this gem:\n\n\n\"There is very little point in describing these routines in any detail,\nbut pseudocode\nfor the medium quality procedure is included in the Appendix for those\nwho are\ncurious. What is significant is that these three short routines embody\nmuch of the\nauthor\u001b$B!G\u001b(Bs knowledge about Radiance rendering and what works best in a given\nsituation. As awkward as they may look, they are a form of expert knowledge,\nand it would have been impossible to write them without years of experience\nusing this software. Initially, it seemed that coding this knowledge\nwould be\nimpossible, but it turned out instead to be cathartic.\" (Ward)\n\n\nA paraphrased version of this paragraph has remained in my head since\nthe first time I read it (indeed, I searched the pdf for the word\n\"cathartic\" to find the paragraph), because to me it encapsulates the\nentire crux of the problem of Radiance mastery.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005341.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 05, 2008 at 08:30AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005338", "id": "radiance-general_005341"}
