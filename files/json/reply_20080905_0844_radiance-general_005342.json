{"body": "There an overview table on pages 517 and 558 of Rendering with Radiance\nfor direct and ambient settings. I'm not sure if some of the other\nsettings are outlined in a similar manner in other portions of the book.\n\n\nI suspect that the actual values given in those tables may be simplified\nor have been updated since then. For example I thought that setting\nQuality=High and Variability=High will give an -ad parameter above 1024.\n\n\n> Quick question:  Can anyone tell me how the rad program interprets the\n> HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW settings in the .rif file?  Does each setting have a\n> corresponding pre-determined list of rpict parameters, or does it take\n> scene geometry etc. and determine appropriate parameters each time?\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005342.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "September 05, 2008 at 08:44AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005338", "id": "radiance-general_005342"}
