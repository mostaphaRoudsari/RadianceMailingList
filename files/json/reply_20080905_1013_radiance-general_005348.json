Bear in mind that certain surfaces do not report  \nirradiance, such as glass, which you see through as usual with the -i  \noption.\n\n\n> So my extremely bright ground plane is actually showing its lux level\n> (the amount of light falling on it, rather than the amount of light  \n> it's\n> reflecting).
