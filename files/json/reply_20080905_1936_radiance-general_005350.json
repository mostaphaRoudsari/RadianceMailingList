{"body": "Hi Cw,\n\n\nI'm not sure how pfsview converts colors to luminance values, but it  \nmay apply a different set of coefficients from those used in Radiance  \n(and pvalue).  This could explain the discrepancy.  The best way to  \ncheck is to compare values for a gray pixel, which should be the same  \nregardless of the color -> luminance conversion.\n\n\nAlso, are you 100% sure you are checking the exact same pixel(s)?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005350.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 05, 2008 at 07:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005349", "id": "radiance-general_005350"}
