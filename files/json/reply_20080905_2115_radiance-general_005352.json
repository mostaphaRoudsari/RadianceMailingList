{"body": "Hi Chew,\n\n\nYes, pvalue -o -b * 179 and the ximage 'l' command should report the  \nsame values for the same pixels, though it's a bit difficult to know  \nif you are in fact checking the same pixels -- the ximage 'p' command  \ncan help with that.\n\n\nI guess this is moot since you couldn't compile ximage.  I believe  \nEcotect offers a Windows-ready substitute free of charge.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005352.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 05, 2008 at 09:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005349", "id": "radiance-general_005352"}
