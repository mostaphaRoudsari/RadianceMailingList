{"body": "Problem solved, I think.  The confusion arose from me jumping to\nconclusions based my comparison of luminance/illuminance images.  I saw\nthe bright floor plane outside and assumed it was a mistake.  It\nactually turned out that the reflectance of the local ground plane was\nset to 0.25 while gensky defaults to 0.2.\n\n\nPerhaps 0.25 is a bit too high for asphalt but reasonable for concrete? \nBRE [1] list a table of surface reflectances with asphalt = 0.07 and\nconcrete = 0.2 ~ 0.3.  Anyone know of a more detailed reference for\nsurface reflectances?\n\n\nNick\n\n\n[1] BRE Report 380 2000 - Environmental site layout planning: solar\naccess, microclimate and passive cooling in urban areas\n\n\nOn Fri, 05 Sep 2008 12:12:33 -0400, \"Jack de Valpine\" <jedev at visarc.com>\nsaid:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Doylend", "created_at": "September 08, 2008 at 03:52AM", "created_by": "Nick_Doylend", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005344", "id": "radiance-general_005360"}
