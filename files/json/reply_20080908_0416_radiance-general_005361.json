{"body": ">\n> Perhaps 0.25 is a bit too high for asphalt but reasonable for concrete? \n> BRE [1] list a table of surface reflectances with asphalt = 0.07 and concrete = 0.2 ~ 0.3.  Anyone know of a more detailed reference for surface reflectances?\n>   \nI think in this case, taking a grey chart, going out and finding the\nvalue by comparision would work well. The problem is that there are so\nmany different types of concrete (granularity, additions, surface\nfinishing) plus outside factors (wet / dry etc) that you cannot get one\ncolor / reflectance for the material.\n\n\nBTW if I look at the road in front of the office I am working in right\nnow, I also wonder if the reflectance of the real-world asfalt is not\nmuch higher. The 0.07 may be \"pure\" asfalt (so almost black as bitumen)\nwhile the road surface here contains sand and stones to make it rough\nand dureable. So if you walk around with your grey chart, just make one\nmore comparision ;-)\n\n\nOne problem with outdoors surfaces is that the values measured in lab\ncan be far apart from real world. Erosion, dust, humidity, vegetation...\nmany factors affect what we see outside, besides the pure \"material\". So\nI guess in a proper simulation, one should always try to check these\nreflectances, at least if they have big influence on the result.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005361.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
