To be clear (pun!), let's say you have a view from the outside \nof the building looking in, and you trace a pixel that shows floor \nbehind the curtain wall.  In this case, the irradiance value returned is \nthe irradiance on the floor, and it is of course modified (reduced) by \nthe reflectance and absorptance of the glass.  Now, let's say you have a \nview from inside a building, and you trace a pixel on the ground \noutside.  In this case, the irradiance is not influenced at all by the \nglass, even though you are tracing a ray through the glass. \n\n\n> What happens for surfaces made of transparent BRTfunc materials (like \n> double glazing)?
