{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nI have not compiled Radiance in a while but if I remember right this kind of errors you see when you don't have the TIFF libraries installed. Just download rad3R8supp.tar.bz2 or whatever is the current version, unpack it in the buld directory (ray) and recompile. This should hopefully be sufficient to cure the problem.\n\n\nRegards,\n Erwin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: [Radiance-general] compiling radiance (18-Sep-2008 14:18)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005379.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "September 18, 2008 at 05:48AM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005378", "id": "radiance-general_005379"}
