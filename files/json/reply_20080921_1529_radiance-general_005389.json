{"body": "I think that was it, it must have been good coffee.  I found Rad was\nsetting an ambient value of 10.  I added -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 to the .rif\nfile's render option and got images that weren't so groovy looking but\ndid give a better indication of something like a reasonable daylight\nfactor. (http://ndoylend.fastmail.fm/temp/test02_c5.jpg)\n\n\nThis is with an indirect setting of 2.  I suppose I should reduce the\nambient value to zero and increase the indirect to get a more realistic\nDF, but is it worth it (these are for visualisation only)?\n\n\nThanks for the suggestion,\n\n\nNick\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005389.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Doylend", "created_at": "September 21, 2008 at 03:29PM", "created_by": "Nick_Doylend", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005386", "id": "radiance-general_005389"}
