{"body": "I just gave up trying to get it to run on Windows, even running without\nany temporary files left hanging around it still generated a bunch of\nzero length composite sky files and failed.\n\n\nI had more luck running under Linux, and it seemed to do its thing much\nfaster.  However, I'm not sure how to interpret the results!  To test I\ncreated a flat ground plane and looked at the cumulative map - the\nresults were about 822kWh/m2.yr when I traced points on the original kWh\nimage and approximately the same in the false coloured kWh image.  If I\nlooked at the source EPW data I found a cumulative global horizontal\nradiation to be more like in the region of  1200kWh/m2.yr.  Shouldn't\nthey be the same (assuming I set lat/lon/mer correctly)?\n\n\nThe MJ scaled image didn't make much sense - I thought that 1kWh is\n3.6MJ, but I get a much lower result when I look at MJ than kWh.\n\n\nAre there any papers describing the program in more detail (I've looked\nonly briefly at the man page and a .pdf presentation so I'm probably\nmissing something)?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nNick\n\n\nOn Thu, 18 Sep 2008 15:02:13 +0200, \"Jelle Feringa\"\n<jelleferinga at gmail.com> said:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005390.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Doylend", "created_at": "September 21, 2008 at 03:47PM", "created_by": "Nick_Doylend", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005377", "id": "radiance-general_005390"}
