{"body": "Hi Nicolas,\n\n\nDaysim is using the Perez Sky model, so I would use gendaylit instead of\ngensky for a comparision.\nSecondly, I assume, that you have to use the -R instead of the -r\nOption, since you are dealing with irradiance rather than radiance. This\nis causing the big difference, I assume.\nBut  be careful: -R is expecting horizontal direct irradiation, not\ndirect normal irradiance!\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005393.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "September 22, 2008 at 07:40AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005391", "id": "radiance-general_005393"}
