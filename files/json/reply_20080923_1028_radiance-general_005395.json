There are\nother data visualizers around like MayaVi or OpenDX that allow you\nto import points and export lines in DXF. It depends on the time you\nwant to spend to learn one of these tools.\n\n\nAnd then you've always the option to interpolate the values to find\nthe locations of points on the 2% line and draw the line by hand.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005395.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 23, 2008 at 10:28AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005394", "id": "radiance-general_005395"}
