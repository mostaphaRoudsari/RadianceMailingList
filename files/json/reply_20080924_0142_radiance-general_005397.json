This is \ncausing the big difference, I assume.\nBut  be careful: -R is expecting horizontal direct irradiation, not direct \nnormal irradiance!\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005397.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nicolas Roy", "created_at": "September 24, 2008 at 01:42AM", "created_by": "Nicolas_Roy", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005391", "id": "radiance-general_005397"}
