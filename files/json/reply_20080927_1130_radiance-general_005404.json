Still this is not really useful for animations, and I guess there have been enough hints for generating the view points now - so this is just for completeness ;-)\n\n\nHave a nice week-end!\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005404.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
