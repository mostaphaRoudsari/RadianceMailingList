{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI just tried to compile the current HEAD release and remembered this post of yours, so I threw your customized Rmakefile into ray/src/px. Unfortunately this didn't work as expected. Every line in the file that was referring to .../common/ failed. \nI changed those lines to ../common and now everything compiled just fine. Is my system (or csh) missing something or in other words, ist the notation of .../ something that should actually work? Just curios...\n\n\nRegards,\n Erwin\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Message        processed by David.InfoCenter \nSubject: [Radiance-dev] Re: [Radiance-general] compiling radiance (18-Sep-2008 15:46)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-October/000903.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "October 07, 2008 at 02:57AM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000902", "id": "radiance-dev_000903"}
