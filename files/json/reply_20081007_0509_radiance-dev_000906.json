{"body": "Hi Erwin,\n\n\nUnfortunately, adding -n to rpict isn't as simple as it was to add to  \nrvu (not that it was particularly simple there, either).  I have  \npondered the problem for some time and not come up with a suitable  \nsolution.  Basically, I would have to rewrite the sampling code for  \nrpict, which is more than I have time for at the moment.  I agree a  \nparallel rendering option to rpict would be very handy, but I don't  \nexpect to create one anytime soon.  I'm afraid we're stuck with  \nrpiece for now....\n\n\nSorry.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-October/000906.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 07, 2008 at 05:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000904", "id": "radiance-dev_000906"}
