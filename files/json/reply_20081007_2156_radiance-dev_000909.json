{"body": "I have tried your patch but it didn't change things really. Out of curiosity I compiled the current head on a 32bit machine (also under Linux) and I get the exact same behavior (using the original 3ds2mgf.c). \nSo I finally tried an older binary of 3ds2mgf (Radiance 3.6a) on the same system and this one works just fine. Unfortunatly I dont have the sources anymore to see what happens if I compile them \nSomehow I get a feeling it might have to do with the gcc version I am using on all these systems nowadays: \n\n\n# gcc --version\ngcc (GCC) 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2 p1.1)\n\n\nFor all older compilations I am pretty sure I was still using gcc 3.*. \nJust in case that helps. \n Erwin\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: Re: [Radiance-dev] behavior of 3ds2mgf (07-Okt-2008 18:40)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-October/000909.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "October 07, 2008 at 09:56PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000907", "id": "radiance-dev_000909"}
