{"body": "Hi Erwin,\n\n\nThe problem with that face is that it refers to vertex normals 29760,  \n29761, and 29763, whereas you've only defined 544 normals up until  \nthat point in the file.  It is illegal to refer to an undefined index  \nin obj2rad, hence the reported error.  None of the other OBJ file  \nconverters will like it, either.  The faces up until that point in  \nthe file don't use vertex normals, so they pass without complaint.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  To those of you confused by this exchange, Erwin sent me his  \nOBJ file in a separate e-mail at my request.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005414.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 07, 2008 at 10:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005413", "id": "radiance-general_005414"}
