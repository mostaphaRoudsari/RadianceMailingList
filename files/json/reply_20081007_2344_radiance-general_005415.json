{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks for the investigation. This means that Archicad produces faulty OBJ files or something went wrong during the export. I will have to ask the folks who gave me the file. I tried importing this file into other modellers, some of them seem to ignore all faulty objects, and some of them import everything only up to that line. But I have not checked this out in great detail. Maybe I can implement some kind of syntax checker that does some sanity checks on obj files before I throw them at obj2rad. I guess my goal will be to import at least the geometry, even if the vn or vt info is not correct. \nRegards,\n Erwin\n\n\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: [Radiance-general] Re: obj2rad failing (08-Okt-2008 7:21)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005415.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "October 07, 2008 at 11:44PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005413", "id": "radiance-general_005415"}
