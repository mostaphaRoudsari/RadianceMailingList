{"body": "Dear Erwin,\n\n\nI don't know if the gcc is really the problem - but if yes, see below an\ninstruction how to build an older gcc version with a newer one. I use\nthat for compiling esp-r- which also has trouble with gcc4.xx.\n\n\nThen you have two gcc versions in parallel. Be careful while installing:\nyou have to use the /make bootstrap /otherwise you can destroy your\nsystem (if you install it as root it replaces the existing libraries - \nI once  destroyed my system  with that....)\nBefore using programs compiled under gcc3.x, you have to set the library\npath to the related lib-path ( export LD_LIBRARYPATH=/opt/gcc33/lib or\nsimilar).\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nJan\n\n\n------------- Instruction to build an gcc 3.3.6, using gcc4.xx\n\n\n\n\nGet gcc-core from from GCC Mirrors Page\n\n\nCompiling GCC-3.3.6:\n\n\nUntar the source then configure with:\n./configure --prefix=/opt/gcc33 --program-suffix=-3.3\nWARNING: Do NOT configure it with the default prefix! It is recommended\nto compile it with this prefix else you can damage your system!\nNow compile it with make bootstrap and after that install it with make\ninstall.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-October/000912.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "October 08, 2008 at 12:00AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000907", "id": "radiance-dev_000912"}
