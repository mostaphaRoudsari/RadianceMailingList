{"body": "Hi Erwin,\n\n\nImporting minus the vertex and textures can be done with this command:\n\n\n\tsed '/^f /s@/[0-9/]*@@g' Hauk-EZ.obj | obj2rad > Hauk-EZ.rad\n\n\nSeems to work for me, at least.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I also tried putting all the vertex normals at the front of the  \nfile, thinking maybe ACAD just scattered them throughout in violation  \nof one of the Wavefront syntax restrictions, but there were still  \nfaces that referred to vertex normal indices that exceeded the total  \nnumber of vertex normals in the file.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005416.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 08, 2008 at 07:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005413", "id": "radiance-general_005416"}
