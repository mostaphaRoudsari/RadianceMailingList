Typically we do this via Ecotect, exporting 3ds files\nfrom Rhino, importing into Ecotect, and using Ecotect to generate my rad\nfiles. However, this model is just a mess once it's imported into\nEcotect - even the flat facades are a mess of triangles, and the reduce\ncoincident triangles/polygons command is all but worthless. The Rhino\nmodel is actually fairly complex, it's a masterplan with 20 or so\ntowers, but even doing just one building is going to take me a day to\nclean up. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\n\nThanks,\nCramer\n\n\n\n\nJ.
