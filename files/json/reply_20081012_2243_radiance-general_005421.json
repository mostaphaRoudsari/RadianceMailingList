{"body": "Cramer,\n\n\nI've come across the same thing in the past and thought that it was due to the model being a set of NURBS surfaces that rhino is segmenting to turn into a DXF. I think there is a way to try and get rhino to clean some of this up but haven't found a fast process to do so.\n\n\nDo you need to clean up the model? I would try a test render to find out what kind of processing time it takes to render and use this to evaluate if you need to clean up. In ecotect the edges are highlighted to help you indentify different objects. I've found in the past that these often don't show up in a radiance render and this can often be less time consuming than trying to process the surfaces.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nMeredith Davey \nAssociate Director\natelier ten\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nbuilding service engineers + environmental designers \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 1\nDate: Fri, 10 Oct 2008 18:48:07 +0200\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005421.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Meredith Davey", "created_at": "October 12, 2008 at 10:43PM", "created_by": "Meredith_Davey", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005417", "id": "radiance-general_005421"}
