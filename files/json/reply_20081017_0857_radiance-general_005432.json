What I'm wondering\nabout is if there's anything else out there which is under a DFSG\ncompatible license and could be included in Debian, too? If somebody\nelse would like to maintain such packages in Debian just let me know and\nI'll happily review and sponsor the uploads for them - or create and\nmaintain the packages if you want me to.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005432.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "October 17, 2008 at 08:57AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005431", "id": "radiance-general_005432"}
