{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI suppose you can use some of standard Radiance tools for that, but here is\nanother way we use.\n\n\nIn Raddisplay http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html program you\ncan create falsecolor image from your original radiance image. If you define\nfalse color palette with 2 colors - one has value 0 and another value you\nwant to use as a threshold, and open Statistiques dialog, you'll have\npercent for each color in the tablle. You can also define the palette with\nmore colors, for various threshold values.\n\n\nHope this helps,\nMarija\nDe Luminae.\n\n\n2008/10/20 Galen Burrell <galenburrell at yahoo.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005434.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "October 20, 2008 at 03:42AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005433", "id": "radiance-general_005434"}
