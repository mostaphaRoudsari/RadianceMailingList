That\nrequires a new material definition for each frame you export.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005439.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 22, 2008 at 09:22AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005438", "id": "radiance-general_005439"}
