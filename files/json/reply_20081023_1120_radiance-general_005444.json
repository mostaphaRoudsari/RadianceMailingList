{"body": "It's a new set of scripts, though I started with Schorsch's scripts,  \nas well as the Radiance makefiles. This new set of scripts has ended  \nup very different because I had different goals. The scripts use more- \ncurrent SCons features. They are cross-platform, though the set of  \nplatforms is limited. The libraries built follow the makefile model as  \nclosely as I could quickly manage (few large libraries) rather than  \nthe Schorsch model (many small libraries). I like to think that this  \nmakes for simpler build scripts. I do, though, incorporate much of  \nSchorsh's Windows C code, so that pipes in scene description files  \nwork. There are two small source-code tweaks, in included headers.  \nProbably the biggest practical difference is that I have not written  \ninstall code into the scripts, since these are a base for  \nexperimentation rather than production.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005444.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "R Fritz", "created_at": "October 23, 2008 at 11:20AM", "created_by": "R_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005442", "id": "radiance-general_005444"}
