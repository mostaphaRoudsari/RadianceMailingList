{"body": "All suffixes in Radiance are just a convention, but since both  \nWindows and Mac OS X look at the suffix as a first indication of file  \ntype, it's not a bad idea to standardize them.  The \"hdr\" suffix has  \ndefinitely been picked up by the mainstream as a Radiance image file,  \nwhile the \"pic\" suffix gets confused for other types on the different  \nsystems.  In this respect, I agree with Axel that it would be  \nbeneficial to change this convention, if people are OK with that.\n\n\nAlthough I can see Rob's point that it's nice to have a suffix that  \nuniquely identifies a Radiance-generated image from other possible  \nsources, the de facto use of extensions does not support this these  \ndays.  An extension indicates the file type, not its creator.\n\n\nIf anyone else has a good reason why we should not switch to using  \n\".hdr\" in place of \".pic\" in rad/trad/etc. in the next release, now  \nis the time to speak up.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005450.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 25, 2008 at 10:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005448", "id": "radiance-general_005450"}
