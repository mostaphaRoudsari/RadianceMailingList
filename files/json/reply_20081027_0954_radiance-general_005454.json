I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find\nfunction file \"rayinit.cal.\" I searched through the mailing list\narchives and found a few items on the placement of library files and\nsetting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I\nhave my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make\nsure\nthat rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables\nare\nexporting properly as I can see the paths when I \"echo $PATH\" and\n\"echo\n$RAYPATH,\" however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for\nsome\nreason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave\nMaino\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005454.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Calcagni", "created_at": "October 27, 2008 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "Nick_Calcagni", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003066", "id": "radiance-general_005454"}
