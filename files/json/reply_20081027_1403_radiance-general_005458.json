{"body": "Hello\n\n\nAzimuth and altitude angles are both given as comments in the output of the gensky program.\nHere are two very simple C-shell scripts that will just extract these values. You may use them to build a script to generate the data you need.\n\n\nHope this will help you.\n\n\nRaphael\n________________________________________\nDe : radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org [radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org] de la part de sokol dervishi [dervishi_sokol at yahoo.com]\nDate d'envoi : lundi, 27. octobre 2008 20:44\n\u00c0 : radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] Azimuth and Altitude\n\n\n Hello everyone,\n\n\nI need to calculate solar altitude for 2008, from 6.15 to 18:00 every 15 minute step, and use this information to calculate the direct normal irradiance and together with diffuse irradiance  (I have direct and diffuse irradiance values) as an input for  PEREZ model using RADIANCE.\n\n\n I wanted to ask if RADIANCE can provide me with this information, so a list of sun altitude for a year-based.\n\n\nI have seen some website where I can calculate the sun altitude for a single step, however I need the data for a year-based, and it is not a good idea to calculate it each time step.\n\n\n If not, can someone provide me with some sources  (formulas) how to calculate the values?\n\n\nI thank you in advance,\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nSokol Dervishi,\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005458.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "October 27, 2008 at 02:03PM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005457", "id": "radiance-general_005458"}
