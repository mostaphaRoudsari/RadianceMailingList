The camera plane cuts through\nthe rectangle and only the parts in front of the plane are shown.\n\n\n> I've included an example below that clips the corner of a rectangle.\n> Is there a workaround to this, say, a simple conversion to a parallel\n> view from very far away?\n\n\nThe simple solution is to set the -o clipping plane to a negative value.\nIn your example '-o -8' is enough to show all of the rectangle.\n\n\nFor a view spec without clippings you have to add the inverse of your\nview direction to your view point until everything is shown. Basically\nyou're moving the camera backwards but for a parallel view there is\nno difference.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 04, 2008 at 08:54AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005462", "id": "radiance-general_005464"}
