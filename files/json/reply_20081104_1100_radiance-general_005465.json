You can  \nestimate its reflectance with a camera with a telephoto lens (or a  \nspot meter) and an 18% grey card; procedure at <http://www.kodak.com/global/en/consumer/products/techInfo/am105/am105kic.shtml \n >. Use a tripod and stand far enough off so that your shadow doesn't  \naffect the measurement.\n\n\nI don't have any good ideas for frit glass--perhaps the manufacturer  \nhas some information?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005465.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "R Fritz", "created_at": "November 04, 2008 at 11:00AM", "created_by": "R_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005461", "id": "radiance-general_005465"}
