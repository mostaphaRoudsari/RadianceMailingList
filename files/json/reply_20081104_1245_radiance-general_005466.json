{"body": "Rob and Thomas,\n\n\nAh, I was visualizing a sphere at infinity, centered on -vp with a\ncamera on the sphere pointed in the direction of -vd as opposed to a\nplane within the model at -vp, with a normal of -vd that casts out\nparallel rays. I misinterpreted the phrase \"center of a parallel\nprojection\" in the rpict man page for -vp. I guess the plane version\nmakes more sense when you start to throw clipping planes into the mix.\nA negative -vo clipping plane an interesting concept, I hadn't\nconsidered that.\n\n\nI was looking at views from the sun, so I just subtracted a huge\nmultiple of the -vd vector from the -vp position and everything worked\nout well.\n\n\nThank you very much,\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005466.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Smith", "created_at": "November 04, 2008 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "David_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005462", "id": "radiance-general_005466"}
