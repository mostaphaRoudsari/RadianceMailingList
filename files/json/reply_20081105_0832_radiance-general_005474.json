The choice \ndepends on both required accuracy (in many applications, the overall \nbrightness is much more important then color) and, of course, budget ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005474.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
