{"body": "I have been thinking about a material library/editor for a while too. For many  needs it would be probably sufficient to have a basic database with the simpler materials (plastic, metal, glass,...) but as soon as it comes to more complex/combined materials the task of providing a useful interface becomes more of a challenge. Schorsch has addressed this with his material editor in Rayfront but this is not targeting beginners. I think that for many users it would be just fine to have something similar to the colorpicker tool (http://www.luxal.eu/resources/radiance/cp4r.shtml), maybe extended with the functionality of adding at least your own custom textures (image uplaod) to basic materials. \nAnyway, as a start it might be worth thinking about a central web based material depository where we all can share our own creations. The display format can be a simple list with mat, cal, pic files and a little preview.\nAnyone interested in starting that? \n\n\nRegards,\n Erwin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005477.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erwin Zierler", "created_at": "November 05, 2008 at 11:19PM", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005477"}
