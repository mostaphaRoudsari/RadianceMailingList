{"body": "> Anyway, as a start it might be worth thinking about a central web based material depository where we all can share our own creations. The display format can be a simple list with mat, cal, pic files and a little preview.\n> Anyone interested in starting that? \n>   \nMaybe one should first consider a database of measured values. Based on \nthis, one could implement a material editor that could query that \ndatabase and give a radiance material definition as a result. The \nadvantage is that I could compile the material data available into a \ndescription fitting the needs of my specific application. It is \nimportant to keep in mind that our measurements and simulations not only \nhave a degree of accuracy but also a scale. A material for a wall of \nbricks is not only depending on exterior influences (dirt, humidity, \nvegetation) but also on the scale we look at it - from far a way it will \nbe sufficient to define it as one uniform color, sampled e.g. over \n2mx2m, from a close point of view I would want to have a brick texture \nincluding the different colors of brick and mortar, and for a detail \nview I would need the color and structure of only the brick itself, as \nthe mortar would be a different material. Just one very simple example, \nother materials are much more difficult. Still sharing the measured \nvalues (including very detailed descriptions of object and set-up) would \nbe very useful for the secondary materials, those that a simulation not \nreally focuses on and could be approximated. Think I would be interested \nin contributing.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005478.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
