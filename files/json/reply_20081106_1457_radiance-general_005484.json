{"body": "Mark,\n\n\nThat's where gamma values come in. Let's say the RGB values of a paint\nsample from EasyRGB are (125,150,175), a blue gray. Take each channel,\ndivide by 256, take the result to the power of 2.2 (monitor gamma) and\nthen multiply by 256.\n\n\nR = (125/256)^2.2 * 256 = 52.9\nG = (150/256)^2.2 * 256 = 79.0\nB = (175/256)^2.2 * 256 = 110.9\n\n\nIf you put the resulting values (52.9,79.0,110.9) in as the R G and B\nmaterial colors, you should get the correct paint color in your\nsimulation that matches the physical paint color.\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005484.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Smith", "created_at": "November 06, 2008 at 02:57PM", "created_by": "David_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005484"}
