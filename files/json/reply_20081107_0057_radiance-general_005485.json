{"body": "Hi Dave,\n\n\nAs Mark already said, these values seem very bright to me also.\n\n\nOnce I did some measurements on a Kodak grayscale chart (from the good \nold Q-14 color separation guide) using a photospectrometer from Kodak, \nwhich results were all below 1.0 for each Radiance RGB triplet (see the \nattachment, which contain the conversions of the measured xyz-values to \nradiance rgb ). Since then my idea has been that rgb triplet values for \ndiffuse reflectances above 1.0 are invalid. Reading your mail I get \nconfused a bit.\n\n\nAnother point I don't understand is why you suggest to use gamma \ncorrection within a material description. I always think of gamma to be \napplied after the simulation has been done. In other words, I think of \ngamma to correct an image for a certain output device. So, why should we \ncorrect reflection values with a gamma _before_ a simulation?\n\n\nThe idea of a public database for materials, paints etc. dedicated to \nRadiance would be very usefull. Imho such a database would be very \nvaluable as a part of the Radiance distribution also. This instead of \npointing to websites, which might confuse users. Measured samples from \ncommercial color charts (like RAL, Pantone and other paints and \nmaterials) would extend the direct useability of Radiance a lot. It \nmight be an idea to plan measurements using a photospectrometer on such \nstandard commercial color charts, and discuss the conversion of the \nresults within this group. Or has this already be done in such an \nextensive way?\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005485.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "November 07, 2008 at 12:57AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005485"}
