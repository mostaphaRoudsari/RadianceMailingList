{"body": "While I agree that extending the material file in the radiance \ndistribution would be useful for viz, I'd like to encourage those who \ndid not try yet to use their digital cameras and a calibration tool such \nas macbethcal and the not too expensive chart as a measurement device. \nToday as almost everyone has the equipment for digital photography, this \nshould be not too difficult. While one can certainly discuss the \naccuracy, obtaining an \"inaccurate\" sample of the material that is \nactually to be simulated should still be better then an accurate sample \nof a generic material.\n\n\nThat said, the most important feature of a new material database must be \ndetailed documentation of the samples, measurement equipment, conditions.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005487.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
