{"body": "Hi\n\n\nThis RAL and xKxxx paints colors list is probably the same as the list appearing in the annex of my Radiance tutorial http://home.hefr.ch/compag/ref/RADIANCE_tutorial_E.pdf\nwhere their reflected Yxy values (measured under the standard illuminant D65) are given.\n\n\nThese values were measured in years ~1991-1993 with a colorimeter at LESO-PB EPFL Lausanne (where I was working at that time) on paper paints samples. The xKxxx or xExxx color names are coming from a Swiss standard notation defined by the paints manufacturers association VSLF http://www.vslf.ch/\nThis tiny database was built for the ADELINE package http://www.ibp.fhg.de/wt/adeline/index.html\n\n\nRaphael Compagnon\n\n\n\n\n-----Message d'origine-----\nDe : radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org] De la part de Thomas Bleicher\nEnvoy\u00e9 : vendredi, 7. novembre 2008 11:21\n\u00c0 : Radiance general discussion\nObjet : Re: [Radiance-general] Color reflectance values and materials..\n\n\nI have here a list of 50+ RAL and xKxxx (like 2K216) colors.\nI don't remember where I got those from and if I'm allowed\nto share them in public. I also do not know if the Radiance\nRGB values are validated or 'just' calculated.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005489.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "November 07, 2008 at 02:46AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005489"}
