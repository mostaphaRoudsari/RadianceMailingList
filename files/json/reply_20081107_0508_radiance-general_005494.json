{"body": "Sorry, I keep forgetting that I'm replying to the digest.

I have to admit that they are still\nnot in the ColourPicker. I've put them up for your perusal:\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/ral_mat.tgz\n\n\nIf anybody is going to translate the names to English, please bounce\nthe changes back to me for inclusion in the ColourPicker. The values\nwere measured with a Minolta chroma meter from samples. YXZ was then\nconverted to Radiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file, so the values\nshould be accurate.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 07, 2008 at 05:08AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005494"}
