{"body": "Hi guys,\n\n\nI am not an expert with the radiance and i do not know if i am\nrepeating any simple stuff here.\n\n\nColour is a function of both the reflectivity and incident light.\n\n\nReflectivity itself is an intrinsic function and in this case i think\nwe are assuming lambertain( equal reflectance in all direction)\nmaterials.\n\n\nThe amount of light that is reflected off a surface would be dependent\non the spectral shape of the incident light and the reflectance.\n\n\nSo in order to talk about the color properties of different object we\nneed to measure its reflectance ( use of a spectrophotometer).\n\n\nPerhaps we can also include the type of incident light sources (\ntungsten / sunlight) if we want to talk about reflectivity\n\n\nCheers\ncw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Nov 7, 2008 at 10:52 PM, David Smith <dbs176 at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005496.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "chang cw", "created_at": "November 07, 2008 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "chang_cw", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005496"}
