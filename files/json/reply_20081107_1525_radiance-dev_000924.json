{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nthanks for chasing this up. My comments are below...\n\n\n\n\nEncoding considerations: Binary preferred.  This is a binary image\n  type with a text header; \"binary\" or \"base64\" are the only\n  reasonable choices.\n\n\nApplications that use this media type: Radiance, HDR Workshop,\n    Photoshop, TBD\n\n\n+++ pfstools\nmore here: http://luxal.dachary.org/webhdr/software.shtml\n.hdr is listed as RGBE\n\n\nAdditional information:\n     Magic number(s): Text \"#?RADIANCE\\n\" (octet sequence 23 3f 52 41\n       44 49 41 4e 43 45 0a) at the beginning of the file\n     File extension(s): pic, hdr\n     Macintosh file type code(s): TBD\n\n\n--- The .pic extension is officially dead and buried. Stick to .hdr.\nIt might be worthwhile also aiming for .rgbe and .xyze\n\n\n+++ I don't think #?RADIANCE\\n is quite good enough. It also matches\noctrees (FORMAT=Radiance_octree). I would suggest that\nFORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe or FORMAT=32-bit_rle_xyze needs to be in the\nspecs as well. The problem is that they don't have a fix position,\nsince this depends on the commands which were used to generate the\nimage.\nI believe this is what the offset thingy is there for (although this\nparticular line does not work somehow):\n<match type=\"string\" value=\"FORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe\" offset=\"0:500\"/>\n\n\nHere is a full .hdr header:\n\n\n----------8<--------------\n#?RADIANCE\noconv skies/sky.mat materials/barnsley2.mat skies/sky.rad\nobjects/barnsley-1.8m_7.5deep.rad objects/lightshelf_horizontal2.rad\nrpict -vu 0 0 1 -vf views/floor2.vf -x 1600 -y 1600 -ps 4 -pt .08 -dp\n1024 -ar 80 -ms 0.08 -ds .3 -dt .1 -dc .5 -dr 1 -sj .7 -st .1 -ab 4\n-af tmp/b2.amb -aa .1 -ad 1536 -as 392 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 8 -lw\n.002\nSOFTWARE= RADIANCE 3.8 lastmod Mon Dec  3 11:50:14 GMT 2007 by root on\naxel-desktop\nVIEW= -vtl -vp 3.75 3.75 1.5 -vd 0 0 -1 -vu -1 0 0 -vh 7.5 -vv 7.5 -vo\n0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0\nCAPDATE= 2008:03:13 12:04:37\nFORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe\npfilt -r .6 -x /2 -y /2\nEXPOSURE=3.078936e+00\n<blank line>\n-Y 800 +X 800\n\n\n... and an octree header:\n\n\n#?RADIANCE\noconv materials/barnsley.mat skies/sky.mat objects/gnd_floor.rad\nobjects/top_floor.rad skies/sky.rad objects/lightshelf_sloped.rad\nFORMAT=Radiance_octree\n<blank line>\n----------8<--------------\n\n\nWould you mind if I forwarded your email to the pfstools mailing list?\nI'd be happy to act as a gatekeeper and feed you only sensible\ncomments back.
