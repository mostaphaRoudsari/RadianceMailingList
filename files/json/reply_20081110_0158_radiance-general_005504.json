{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThank you so much for posting this file. I think both your RAL file as \nthe Kodak grayscale chart measurements I send in my earlier mail are \nvery usefull for Radiance.\n\n\nIn my previous mail I mistakenly wrote that we used a Kodak \nphotospectrometer for the grayscale chart from Kodak's Q-14 color \nseparation guide. That chart was also measured with a Minolta device, I \ndon't remember exactly wich model it was -  but it was a pretty advanced \none that we hired for two weeks, so the file wich the greyscale \nmeasurements should be accurate also (which are YXZ values converted to \nRadiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file).\n\n\nA list of all RAL colors in English (and other languages) can be found at:\nhttp://www.ral.de/en/ral_farben/anwender/farbnamen_classic.php\nI will be happy to translate it and send it back.\n\n\nMaybe we can discuss a little bit more about the issue if such accurate \nmeasurements could be part of the Radiance distribution? I like to hear \nmore about the pros and conts. My idea is that it would help users a lot.\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxel Jacobs wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005504.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "November 10, 2008 at 01:58AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005471", "id": "radiance-general_005504"}
