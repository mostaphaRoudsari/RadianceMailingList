{"body": "I apologize that I don't have time at the moment to look at this  \nthoroughly.\n\n\nI just checked in the switch from \".pic\" to \".hdr\" throughout the  \nHEAD release of Radiance 4.0a.\n\n\nThe \"#?RADIANCE\" line at the beginning of the file is, as Axel notes,  \nnot a unique indicator of a RGBE or XYZE file.  For that, you really  \nneed to find the format string, and I think the notion of \"magic  \nnumbers\" fails in most specifications of a header that could be any  \nsize, with the important string buried in it somewhere.  I only added  \nthe \"#?RADIANCE\" line as an afterthought in fact to provide something  \nbasic for the Unix \"file\" command to work with.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-November/000925.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 10, 2008 at 11:12AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000922", "id": "radiance-dev_000925"}
