{"body": "The higher the surface reflectances, the more bounces you need to  \ncompute.  In pathological cases where you have all white surfaces  \nfacing each other in a closed environment, you may need to disable  \nthe ambient cache (-aa 0) and rely on Russian roulette sampling (-lr  \n-20 or so).  To get a large -ab setting to work (-ab 20 or whatever),  \nyou will also need to decrease the -ad setting to make this tractable  \n(-ad 64 or so with -as 0).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005506.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 10, 2008 at 11:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005501", "id": "radiance-general_005506"}
