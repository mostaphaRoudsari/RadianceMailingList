{"body": "Sure, Rob.\n\n\nJust add \"-N 4\" to the \"set opts=\" line near the top of objview.  The  \nrad program passes whatever is set with -N to the new rvu -n option.\n\n\nAs for using a saved view, the syntax:\n\n\n\tobjview -v \"-vf myview.vf\" octree\n\n\nshould work, but it doesn't because I forgot to put quotes around the  \nargument to the -v option.  On line 35 of objview, fix it to:\n\n\n\tset vw=\"$argv[1]\"\n\n\nHopefully, that will work.  (I'll fix this for the next release and  \nadd a -N option as well.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005521.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 20, 2008 at 05:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005520", "id": "radiance-general_005521"}
