{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nI am trying to render an image using only ambient light.  I noticed that the\nreflected light appears to be non-uniform across the objects in the scene.\nThe scene is a open box with the open part facing the viewer and only\nsurfaces inside the box are lit (outside of the box is dark).  It appears\nthat the light has some directionality to it.  I'm guessing that there is a\nsetting value that I have not appropriately set or something.  I wondered if\nanyone had an idea what might be problem. The rpict parameters are listed as\nthe following:\n\n\nrpict -t 12 -vf view_files/rightview.vf -x 1600 -y 1600 -ps 3 -pt .08 -dp\n512 -ar 48 -ms 0.71 -ds .2 -dj .5 -dt .1 -dc .5 -dr 1 -sj .7 -st .1 -ab 1\n-aa .15 -ad 800 -as 128 -av 0.5 0.5 0.5 -lr 8 -lw .002 -dj 0.6 -dt 0.01 -dr\n3 -ds 0.1 -sj 0.7 -st 0.15 -dc 0.5 -lr 1 -aw 0 -av 0.02317 0.02317 0.02317\n\n\nAny ideas would be appreciated.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nBei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBei Xiao\nRoom 330 C\n3401 Walnut Street C Wing\nDepartment of Neuroscience\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104, USA\nWeb: www.psych.upenn.edu/~beixiao\nflickr:www.flickr.com/photos/slowtempo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005526.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bei Xiao", "created_at": "November 25, 2008 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao", "parent_id": "radiance-general_001662", "id": "radiance-general_005526"}
