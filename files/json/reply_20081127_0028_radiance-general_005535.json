{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI did some validations of Radiance against these CIE test scenes, but \nonly for the\nexperimental test cases (chapter 4) and a few test cases with analytical \nreferences\n(chapter 5, TC 5.6, 5.7, 5.8). You can find the results in my \npresentation from this\nyear's Radiance workshop. Unfortunately I did not use the test cases, \nwhich are\ndealing with daylight (I guess they would be more important for you).\n\n\nKind regards,\nDavid\n\n\nIlya A.
