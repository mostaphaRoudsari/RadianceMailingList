At the sky condition that\nyou've included in the files I'd say that the sunbeam through the\nwindow misses the sample point (therefore no direct component).\nIf you have the blinds down you get some reflected sunlight at\nthe sample point which increases the illuminance.\n\n\nI have to play around with your scene a bit to confirm this but\nfrom an initial rendering this seems to be the case.\n\n\nCan't comment on the glare issue.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005538.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 27, 2008 at 04:15AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005533", "id": "radiance-general_005538"}
