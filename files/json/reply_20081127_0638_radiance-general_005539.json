Please\nlift your sample points (or lower the desks) by a small amount\n(0.01m is enough). When a point for rtrace calculation is located\non a surface (as in your case) the results are not predictable.\n\n\nRaising the points slightly above the surface will not influence\nyour illuminance values but it will provide reliable results.\n\n\nI'd say it is quite unusual to do an illuminance calculation with\na horizontal orientation directly on a surface. Effectively you are\nblocking half of the hemisphere with your table surface. I would\nrun all the calculations without the desks in the scene to see if\nthat makes a difference.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005539.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 27, 2008 at 06:38AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005533", "id": "radiance-general_005539"}
