{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThe xform -e option is now the default, so is simply ignored.  I  \nremoved it all the same in my modifications to objline.\n\n\nDownload the HEAD sometime tomorrow and see if it works.  I took a  \nslightly different approach than yours, and it may not work as you  \nexpect, but matches the behavior of xform exactly.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-November/000941.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 30, 2008 at 11:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000939", "id": "radiance-dev_000941"}
