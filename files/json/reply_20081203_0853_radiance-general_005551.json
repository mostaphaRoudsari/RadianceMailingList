{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nYou have a rectangle image description when specifying your -x and -y\nvalues but your -vh and -vv values describe a square image.  I think you\njust need to delete your -y variable and you should then get a square\nimage.  If you want a rectangle image then find the ratio between your\n-x and -y value and apply the same ratio between your -vh and -vv\nvalues.\n\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n\nAndrew\n__________________________\nAndrew Bissell\nB.Eng(Hons) C.Eng MSLL MCIBSE MIET\nAssociate Lighting Designer\nCundall Light4\nDirect: 0161 200 1235\nMobile: 07899 907 978\nOffice: 0161 244 5660\nP Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005551.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "December 03, 2008 at 08:53AM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005550", "id": "radiance-general_005551"}
