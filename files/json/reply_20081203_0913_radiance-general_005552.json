{"body": "Hi Nastassja,\n\n\nThe identified glare sources are shown with their average luminance  \nin cd/m^2.  The shape shown does not correspond necessarily to the  \nactual shape of the sources.  The shape shown is the centroid of the  \nactual source with the estimated source solid angle drawn as a circle  \n(which may appear as an ellipse depending on the view projection used).\n\n\nDoes this clear up your confusion?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005552.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 03, 2008 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005549", "id": "radiance-general_005552"}
