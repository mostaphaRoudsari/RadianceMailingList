{"body": "Hi Kam,\n\n\nIf you use -ab 1, there is no significant penalty for setting -aa 0  \nin a point-by-point rtrace calculation for a small number of  \npositions.  With -ab 2 and greater, setting -aa 0 may take a very  \nlong time, or require reducing the -ad and -as parameters, which will  \nnegatively impact the accuracy of your result.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005554.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 03, 2008 at 11:21AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005548", "id": "radiance-general_005554"}
