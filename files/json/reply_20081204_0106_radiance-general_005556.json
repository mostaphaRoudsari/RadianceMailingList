{"body": "Hi Yu Sheng,\n\n\nAs Andrew pointed out,  you need to calculate the correct -vh and -vv \nvalues for your \"camera\" as well. Calculating the ratio of the image \ndimensions and simply apply these on the -vv and -vh values is not the \nbest solution, however. There has been a discussion about this topic on \nradiance-online.org. Please also have a look at the attachment, which \n\"implements\" this discussion in a little tool that will calculate the \ncorrect vertical view angle, when a horizontal view angle and the image \ndimensions are given.  I hope this makes sense to you.\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005556.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "December 04, 2008 at 01:06AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005550", "id": "radiance-general_005556"}
