{"body": "Shortly after PMAP was released I messed about with it to try and\nunderstand what the numbers all meant and to see what you had to do to\nget accurate results.  I have cut down a presentation I created to\nprovide 4 slides of the process I went through to get appropriate images\nand numbers.  Not very scientific to be honest but perhaps a starting\npoint for further study.\n\n\nI will go and have another look at the same model with alternative\nsuggestions for the three variables if you have any.  Although I may\nalready have the results as only some of them are included here.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAndrew\n__________________________\nAndrew Bissell\nB.Eng(Hons) C.Eng MSLL MCIBSE MIET\nAssociate Lighting Designer\nCundall Light4\nDirect: 0161 200 1235\nMobile: 07899 907 978\nOffice: 0161 244 5660\nP Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/009587.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "December 04, 2008 at 02:13AM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005555", "id": "radiance-general_009587"}
