{"body": "Hello again.\n\n\n From a quick look at the scripts I would change the following:\n\n\nfinalmultiplesim1.csh:\n\n\nYou have very low quality settings for the rtrace command\n(basically left at the defaults). I would at least increase '-ad'\nand add '-as' unless you know it's not going to change the\nresults.\n\n\nnewglares.csh:\n\n\nYou calculate a picture for findglare with default view settings\n(-vtv and -vv 60 -vh 60). The findglare man page recommends\nto use a fisheye (-vta) and 180 degrees for the view angles. With\nyour images findglare has a lot to compute from the octree.\n\n\nThe rpict options are left at the defaults (including ab=0!). I don't\nthink that's your intention.\n\n\nfindglare itself could do with more options as well. Best thing\nto do is to set the rpict/rtrace options in  a variable and use\nthis on the command line for all of the commands (rtrace, rpict\nand findglare).\n\n\nYou also should look at the way how findglare works. The\ndefault threshold to identify glare is 7 times above the average.\nGiven that you're looking at a bright window (very large\nsource) you may never find a glare source unless you're\nlooking directly into the sun. If that's all you need, fine, otherwise\nyou have to work out a reasonable threshold for your scene.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005562.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 05, 2008 at 05:26AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005560", "id": "radiance-general_005562"}
