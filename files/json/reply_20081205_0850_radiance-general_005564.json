{"body": "> Again thanks to you and the other Fraunhofer folks making this  \n> important extension available to us - is there any hope that pmap  \n> could become part of the Radiance distribution itself one day?\n\n\nI have looked at this in the past, but not recently, I admit.  The  \nchief problem as I see it is that the photon map is implemented as an  \neither/or strategy that's decided at compile time.  If it were  \nimplemented as a separate module, there would be no question of  \nincluding it in the distribution.  However, since the implementation  \nis intimately entangled in the main rendering code, there are  \nmaintenance issues that I cannot resolve.  When I go to change or add  \nsomething, I don't understand the pmap add-on well enough to know  \nwhat I'm doing won't break it.  In other words, including the pmap  \nmodule as written means I would have to be done developing Radiance,  \nessentially.\n\n\nIn my opinion, the best solution would be to create a separate tool  \nusing the photon map to replace mkillum in certain circumstances.  I  \nam starting to head this direction with my rtcontrib developments,  \nthough I also need to add support for BRTDfunc and other material  \ntypes for this to be complete.  Such a solution would do well for  \ndaylighting systems, but wouldn't achieve the caustics that many  \nconsider the most valuable contribution of the photon mapping method.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005564.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 05, 2008 at 08:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005555", "id": "radiance-general_005564"}
