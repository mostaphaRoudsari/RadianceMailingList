Any help in that direction will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThe BSDF types in Radiance only work for \"highlights\" currently --  \nindirect components default to diffuse, as you point out.  I am  \nlooking at ways to correct this in future releases, now that BSDF  \ndata is becoming more available, thanks in large part to Peter A-B  \nand his continuing efforts to improve the measurement side of things.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 05, 2008 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005555", "id": "radiance-general_005565"}
