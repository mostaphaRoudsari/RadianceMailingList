{"body": "I think in Real Live(TM) you will find everything.\n\n\nThe good thing about IES is that you can read the essential\nbits from a 95 file with knowledge of the 86 specs. IIRC most\nchanges where in the area of required key-words and allowed\nformats. So - if anything - the variations got limited by the later\nversions (not sure about 2002, though).\n\n\nI haven't seen a lot of 2002 files. One reason is certainly, that\nI stopped looking at IES files. The other is that the manufacturers\ndon't re-release their files in a newer version just because\nthere is a new spec available. The design of most fittings on\nthe market predates most of the specs so it's only a matter of\nwhen the manufacturers finally got their products measured\nwhich defines the format of their files.\n\n\nI think that's why you will find more 1995 files than anything\nelse. It was just the right time for the industry to go digital.\n\n\nIn Europe IES gets a bit side lined by Eulumdat and\nthe various proprietary plugins for Dialux etc. Although, I\nthink that Relux and AGI32 are based on the IES format\nand just package some other information with it.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005567.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 07, 2008 at 03:16AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005566", "id": "radiance-general_005567"}
