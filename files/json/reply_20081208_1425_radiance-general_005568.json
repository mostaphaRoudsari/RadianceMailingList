{"body": "That sounds about right.  I did a quick informal survey of the data  \navailable from four manufacturers which distribute in the USA.  Here's  \nwhat I found:\n\n\n   Corelite\t\tlinear\t\t  \tIES 1995 (one file checked)\n   Lightolier\t\tbroad line\t\tIES 1995, 2002 (two files checked)\n   Lucifer Lighting  \tcutting edge\t  \tIES 2002 (one file checked)\n   SIMKAR\t\tinexpensive linear\tIES 1986 (426 files)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIES 1995 (18 files)\n\n\nSIMKAR seems to have licensed a number of older designs, and this  \nprobably accounts for the large number of 1986-format files.  The  \nnewer Lightolier file I checked was 2002 format; the older was 1995.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nOn Dec 7, 2008, at 3:16 AM, Thomas Bleicher wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005568.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "R Fritz", "created_at": "December 08, 2008 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "R_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005566", "id": "radiance-general_005568"}
