{"body": "Lars,\n\n\nIt won't be of much help to you probably, but EN 12464-1:2002 (paragraph\n4.2) gives you a range of reflectances for interior surfaces:\n\u0097 ceiling: 0,6 to 0,9\n\u0097 walls: 0,3 to 0,8\n\u0097 working planes: 0,2 to 0,6\n\u0097 floor: 0,1 to 0,5\n\n\nFor similar lighting evaluations we normally use: ceiling 70%, walls 50% and\nfloor 10% or 20%.\n\n\nCasper Esmeijer\n\n\n\n\n...\nI have seen the assumption of 80%, 50%, 20% neutral grey levels for\noffice spaces quite a lot, but I wonder if there is anything like a\nstandard for a \"generic\" office environment anywhere. Does anyone have a\nlink to a recommendation what to use when doing studies on an office\nspace whose surface properties are not known yet?\n\n\nThank you, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005574.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Casper Esmeijer", "created_at": "December 10, 2008 at 04:41AM", "created_by": "Casper_Esmeijer", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005571", "id": "radiance-general_005574"}
