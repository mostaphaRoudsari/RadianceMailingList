{"body": "Radiance is part of current ubuntu installation. I would strongly advice \nusers using the packages, if you do not have very clear reasons not to \ndo so (e.g. using modified code, extensions, special compile parameters, \na certain release).\n\n\nAs you are using a very old ubuntu release, I would suggest that you \nhave a look at the backports-server. Only if you do not find packages \nthere, try to compile on your own.\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005583.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
