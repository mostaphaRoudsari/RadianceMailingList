{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThanks for the advise. I have customised Ubuntu 7.10 for my needs and also \nhave a very old PC. So, I did not upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu.\n\n\nI tried the back-ports server from Ubuntu 7.10 but Synaptic as well as \napt-get did not report Radiance as available.\n\n\nWill now upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10 as per your recommendations.\n\n\nRegards,\nJiten\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005584.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "EncaseIndia", "created_at": "December 10, 2008 at 11:27PM", "created_by": "EncaseIndia", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005582", "id": "radiance-general_005584"}
