Or is the number of interreflections between the surfaces\n(with their little distance) simply too high? I guess that you mean the\ninterreflections under low angles, right?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005586.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
