{"body": "Hi Jan, Lars:\n\n\nIt's important when discussing these material types to be aware of  \nwhat works and what doesn't.  While I concede that the BRTDfunc type  \ndoes not account for the sky correctly in it's \"directional-diffuse\"  \ncomponent, the diffuse and specular components are done properly.  In  \nthe case of a glazing system that has a mixture of specular peaks  \n(reflected and transmitted) and diffuse (e.g., scattering from frit),  \nthe BRTDfunc does a perfectly adequate job.  This is why it is  \nemployed in the glaze script and other places to represent glazings.   \nYou'll notice that the directional-diffuse part of the glaze output  \nmaterials are zero.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005587.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 11, 2008 at 08:52AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005576", "id": "radiance-general_005587"}
