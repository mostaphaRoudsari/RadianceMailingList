{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThanks for bringing this to my attention.  I have no idea how these  \ndirectories were left off, but I've reinstated them in all the  \nrelevant distributions.\n\n\nAs for the Linux README regarding libtiff, I'm all for it, but not  \nconfident enough to write it myself, having never done it.  I also  \ndon't understand packages under Linux or Ubuntu, so I'd really prefer  \nthat someone else submit a README to put into the distribution.  I'd  \nbe happy to proofread it and include it.  I don't think there are any  \nserious problems remaining between the packaged libtiff and the one I  \ndistribute, but again I don't have any Linux experience to draw on.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000946.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 10:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000944", "id": "radiance-dev_000946"}
