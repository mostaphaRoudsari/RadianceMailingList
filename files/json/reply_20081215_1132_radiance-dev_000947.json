Last thing I remember is\nthat I talked with Greg about some tiff related patches from me, and I think\nthey're applied in his tree. Didn't catch up with that as I'm spending more\nspare time on Lenny related stuff at the moment.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000947.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 11:32AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000944", "id": "radiance-dev_000947"}
