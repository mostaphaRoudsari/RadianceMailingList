{"body": "The Optics5 IGDB database (glazing.mdb) is password protected, in order to\nkeep general users from changing the data.\n\n\nIf you want to get the spectral data information for records in the\nglazing.mdb file, I would recommend getting it from the WINDOW 5 / 6 program\ndatabase -- the WINDOW Glass Library allows importing of records from the\nglazing.mdb file, and all the spectral data information is copied into the\nWINDOW database, which is not password protected (the default WINDOW\ndatabase is W5.mdb or W6.mdb, an MS Access database).\n\n\nHowever, if you need the BRTF information, I suggest that you use the\nfunction in Optics5 that writes a Radiance file (File menu / Export Radiance\nfile). Optics5 calculates the BRTF functions from the spectral data, so\ngetting the raw spectral data (directly from the databases) may not result\nin information that is useful to Radiance.\n\n\nBoth Optics and WINDOW are available for download (no charge, courtesy of\nthe US Department of Energy) on our website:\n\n\nhttp://windows.lbl.gov/software/\n\n\n\n\nRobin\n******\nRobin Mitchell\nWindows & Daylighting Group\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005590.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robin Mitchell", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "Robin_Mitchell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005576", "id": "radiance-general_005590"}
