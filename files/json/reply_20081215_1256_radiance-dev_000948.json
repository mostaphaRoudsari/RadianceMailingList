You guys rock!\n\n\nBernd, I know I half dumped you into this by even begging the\nquestion. Thanks a lot for picking this up! I promise to put on my\nSherlock Holmes hat and give some good-quality dummy's level feedback.\n\n\n(Thomas:)\n> Francesco has already written down what's necessary to\n> compile on OS X:\n> http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php\n> I haven't compiled Radiance myself in ages because\n> Greg always provides the binaries (probably first of all):\n> http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad3R9_macosx.tar.gz\n> There are minor issues on OS X but they have been\n> covered a lot and if your student couldn't get it\n> to work he/she shouldn't use the source distribution\n> in the first place or search the in list archives\n> for the same problem.\n\n\nThanks for pointing this out. I was aware of Francesco's site, but did\nnot know the install instructions (sorry, Francesco).\nGreg, do you think this would justify a link to Francesco's page on\nthe two download pages (radsite and radiance-online)? All the coding\ngurus seem to run MacOS now. However, many Mac people are still of the\nmore artistic type. So even something like\n'/your/preferred/path/to/the/binaries' might be too much. So where DO\nI stick them? Come on... we all started off small.\n\n\nOh, and yes, I'm deliberately being a bit stubborn here.\n\n\nMany thanks for you efforts and feedback\n\n\nCheerioh\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000948.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 12:56PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000944", "id": "radiance-dev_000948"}
