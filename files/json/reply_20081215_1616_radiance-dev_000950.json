{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> I agree we should have better linkage to Francesco's Wiki -- do you\n> think it should go in the \"Resources\" list on radiance-online.org?\n> Where would you look for it?  I don't think it belongs on the\n> download page, personally.\n\n\nAs a Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu user, I am somewhat spoiled when it\ncomes to installing packages. More often then not, they are available\nfor download with one simple command. To be honest, I don't even know\nif MacOS has a similar mechanism. Windows does not.\n\n\nWhen I do have to get my fingers dirty with tar balls and compilation,\nall instructions, including dependencies, make commands, compile\noptions, switches etc. are usually documented in one or more files\nwithin the tar ball. This usually means:\n- README: This software does so and so, is written and maintained by\nthis guy, published under such-n-such license. Please read LICENSE for\ndetails about the license. For installation instructions please refer\nto INSTALL.\n- INSTALL: To build this, you need package1, package2 and package3.\nThis is how you build the thing: run ./configure, make, make install.\nOr run ./makeall install etc. This is also where compile switches\nwould be listed, unless they are available through, e.g. ./configure\n--help\n- Then there might a PACKAGERS, for what Bernd is doing with the\nDebian packages, possibly a MANIFEST, and potentially a few other text\nfiles of special interest to certain groups of users, such as CVS\ninstructions for hackers. BUGS, ISSUES, TODO, But this already pushing\nit. README and INSTALL are the two biggies.\n\n\nIt is very rare indeed to find a README which says: \"For installation\ninstruction, please go to http://mywebsite.com/mysoft/install.html\".\nIf the installation or configuration is very different between\nplatforms, there might be a README.linux, README.macos, README.win32\netc.\n\n\nSo I'm not sure that 'Resouces' is a good place for the install\ninstructions to live in. Should they not be within the tar ball, or at\nleast on the same download page?\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000950.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 04:16PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000944", "id": "radiance-dev_000950"}
