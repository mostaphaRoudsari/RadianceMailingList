{"body": "Sure, but Francesco's site isn't a set of installation instructions.   \nIt's meant to be broader than that, and people can add and delete  \nstuff at will.  There is no central location for installation issues  \nas far as I know, other than the mailing list.\n\n\nI don't install many packages these days, and I'm not familiar with  \nthe current conventions.  If anyone wants to clean up these  \ninstructions so it fits with others notions of the expected on Linux,  \nI'll check in whatever they submit, but I don't promise to maintain  \nit.  I'm pretty lousy at maintaining the instructions I have (in case  \nyou hadn't noticed).\n\n\nThe build system on Radiance doesn't use the standard configure  \nscripts and so on, and there's little sense in adding them at this  \npoint.  Packages under MacOS X are generally installed as binaries.   \nI've never bothered to make an OS X package for Radiance, though I  \ncertainly could.  Such a package would imply a nice application with  \na GUI, and that's not going to happen.  Radiance is not for the  \naverage user, and giving novices a nice, easy ramp that leads them to  \na cliff seems a bit cruel....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000951.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 04:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000944", "id": "radiance-dev_000951"}
