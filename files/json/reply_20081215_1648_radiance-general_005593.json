{"body": "Hi Matt,\n\n\nTry this:\n\n\n\trlam -if '!pvalue -h -H -b -df input1.pic' '!pvalue -h -H -b -df  \ninput2.pic' \\\n\t\t| rcalc -if2 -of '$1=$1-$2' | total -if -m\n\n\nThis should work with any recent Radiance release.  Older releases  \ndon't support the binary options, so you'll need the slower version:\n\n\n\trlam '!pvalue -h -H -b -d input1.pic' '!pvalue -h -H -b -d  \ninput2.pic' \\\n\t\t| rcalc '$1=$1-$2' | total -m\n\n\nYou may need to escape the '!' in the above commands if you use the C- \nshell, which claims this as its history character.\n\n\nNote I've added the -m option to each of the total commands.  This  \ncomputes the \"average difference\" between pixels, rather than the  \nsum.  I don't know what the sum would mean, which is why I added -m.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005593.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2008 at 04:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005592", "id": "radiance-general_005593"}
