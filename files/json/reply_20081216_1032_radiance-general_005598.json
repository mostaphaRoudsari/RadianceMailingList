{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThis may be the best you can achieve with the existing script.   \nWithout an air gap, you won't get as much internal reflection in the  \nsystem, but there may still be some caused by the PVB interlayer.  It  \ndepends on its structure and index of refraction.  The glaze script  \nwas not really designed to model such systems, but I can't point you  \nin a better direction at the moment.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005598.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 16, 2008 at 10:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005594", "id": "radiance-general_005598"}
