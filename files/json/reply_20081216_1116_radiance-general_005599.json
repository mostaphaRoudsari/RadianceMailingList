{"body": "Hi Dave,\n\n\nLights cannot be included in instances or octrees that are then compiled \ninto a higher level scene. One way to do things is as follows:\n\n\n   1. compile all non light source fixture geometry (not geometry with\n      light, illum or glow materials applied) into an instance object\n      (eg a frozen octree)\n   2. define your light source elements, such as ies photometry and\n      possible glow sources to represent glowing sources (highly\n      dependent on what you are trying to accomplish)\n\n\nThen these two sets of data can be deployed via replmarks or xform (item \none then needs to be incorporated into a radiance \"instance\" \ndefinition). Another added step could be to merge these two together as \na radiance scene description referencing the instance (1) and sources (2).\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005599.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 16, 2008 at 11:16AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005596", "id": "radiance-general_005599"}
