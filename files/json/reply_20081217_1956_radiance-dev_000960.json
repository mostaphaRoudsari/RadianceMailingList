{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThis is an interesting proposal.  One way to do this would be to  \nallow an executable to be named before options with the oconv,  \nmkillum, and pfilt variables.  Variables could likewise be added for  \nrpict and rvu, with the render variable used for both.  This with  \noffer the further facility of having separate options for the two  \nprograms, which rad currently doesn't support but I've wished for now  \nand again.\n\n\nI'll work on this when I get some time.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000960.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 17, 2008 at 07:56PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000959", "id": "radiance-dev_000960"}
