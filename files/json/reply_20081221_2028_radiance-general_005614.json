The manpage of findglare says:\n\n\n\"By default, findglare only computes glare sources and indirect vertical \nilluminance for the given view [...]\"\n\n\nSo I would get only the indirect irradiance, while, to calculate the \nilluminance, I would need the total irradiance including direct \nirradiance e.g. from light sources visible from the point of view - \nright? So I cannot automate this using an existing tool but must write a \nscript to integrate fish-eye projected pictures over the whole \nhemisphere, right?\n\n\nThank you for your support on all that pmap-related stuff!!!\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005614.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
