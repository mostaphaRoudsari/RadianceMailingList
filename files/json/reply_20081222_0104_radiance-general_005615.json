{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI think you are right. Anyhow, I'm not sure, if Roland implemented the\ncorrect pmap conform rpict-call within findglare - I'm pretty sure he\nnever worked on that. Therefore there is no other way as rendering the\nwhole hemisphere and than evaluating the picture.\nIf you also plan to use evalglare (last week Stephen visited us and he\nmentioned that), you have to do that anyhow.\n\n\nMerry Christmas and best wishes for the 2009!\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nLars O.
