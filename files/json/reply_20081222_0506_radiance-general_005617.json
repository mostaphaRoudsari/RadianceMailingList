Hopes that works, as it is a while since I \ndid that and I have no example to start here.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005617.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
