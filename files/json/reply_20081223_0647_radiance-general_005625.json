{"body": "Hi Neha,\n\n\nwelcome to the world of neverending challenges.... You have chosen quite\na difficult topic, and I am struggling a lot with these question myself,\nbut to give you a hint - Radiance itself, without extensions such as the\nphoton-mapping extension pmap or other tools (that I do not really\nunderstand yet) such as rtcontrib won't be able to model highly\nspecular, non-planar light redirecting systems. Look out for photon map,\npmap, light redirecting systems, light shelf, light pipe in\n\n\n- the archives of this mailing list\n- in the links at radiance-online.org\n- in the hundreds of publications that are available\n- among those, the papers from the annual conferences as archived on\nradiance-online.org\n\n\nThis should give you a lot of input and information about these systems,\nthe difficulties to model them as well as techniques that can be used\nfor such calculations.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005625.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
