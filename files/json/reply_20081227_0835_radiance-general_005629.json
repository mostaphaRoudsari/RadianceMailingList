{"body": "Dear Neha,\n\n\nRadiance uses ray-tracing to perform lighting calculations in  \nbuildings.  It is not configured for optical ray-tracing.  For such a  \npurpose, you are better off with any of the number of commercial  \npackages available (TracePro, Optics Lab, ORA LightTools, etc.)   \nWhile it is *possible* to use Radiance for optical design, it is not  \ngeared for it, and you won't find many people who have applied it to  \nthis task.  I am just starting to work with it myself, but even the  \naccurate definition of a lens given the lack of bicubic patches is  \nproblematic.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005629.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 27, 2008 at 08:35AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005628", "id": "radiance-general_005629"}
