If it finds a compatible\nlibtiff on the standard paths (or on a path defined in the\nplatform config file) it will use that, otherwise it builds the\nincluded one as before. I've only tested it on linux, but it\nshould work on any platform, including Windows/cygwin/etc.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000967.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "December 28, 2008 at 04:01AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000953", "id": "radiance-dev_000967"}
