Also there are a lot of Debian derivates, Ubuntu is just\na more well known one. So imho it would make sense to describe a way to do it,\nI'm just not sure what the best place for it is. The other option would be to\nfigure out how backports in Ubuntu work, as far as I know they have something\nlike Debian's backports.org - but as I'm not an Ubuntu guy and I don't have\nthe necessary chroot available, I think that somebody else would have to take\ncare of \"official\" Ubuntu backports.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000970.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "December 28, 2008 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000902", "id": "radiance-dev_000970"}
