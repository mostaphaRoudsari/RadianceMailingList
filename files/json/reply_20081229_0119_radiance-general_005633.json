Besides that you should read everything concerning glass, \ndielectric, trans and interface modifiers in radiance several hundred \ntimes ;-) You can also have a look at renderpark, a tool that has not \nbeen developed for a while, but has some radiance compatibility (it \nunderstands the mgf format) and implements several forward-raytracing \nengines.
