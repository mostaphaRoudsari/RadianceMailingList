{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nMerry Christmas -- I hope you didn't get the virus I caught that  \nbrought my whole system down for two days on the 24th.  I'm still  \nfeeling a bit weak, so apologies if none of this makes sense...\n\n\nSetting d=0 in one of the #@mkillum comments in your scene file will  \ncreate a diffuse source, which is what you want in this case.  (And  \nyes, it will be computing irradiance in effect.)  Since it takes  \nalmost no time to compute such a source, you may as well use mkillum  \nif you're comfortable with it.  If you want to create the source by  \nhand, then simply divide your external irradiance by PI to get the  \nradiance of the source, whatever size it may be (doesn't matter),  \nmultiplying of course by the transmission as well.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005634.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 29, 2008 at 11:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005632", "id": "radiance-general_005634"}
