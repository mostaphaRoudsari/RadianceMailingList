{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nget better befor new year! I am pretty safe from flue and cold, sitting \njust some meters from the equator in nice and warm Singapore...\n\n\nThank you for your reply!  It made me think once more about what I am \nasking for, and essentially the funny thing is that in my case, having a \nuniform sky, this led me to the (late) insight that I can simply use the \nluminance of the sky source (in this case 1000/pi) to modify a surface \non the entrance of the system - nothing else I do when applying the \ngensky-created description to a window pane. So the luminance of my \nreplacement-source is the same as the luminance of my uniform sky source \n(as long as I ignore the transmission properties). It just took me a \nwhile to get it that, when looking through a perfectly transparent \nwindow, I see the sky luminance and not the window glass. Maybe a sign \nthat I have been working in a window-less office space for too much time \nnow...\n\n\nI wish you all a happy new year and a nice celebration, those in cold \nclimates beware of the flue,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
