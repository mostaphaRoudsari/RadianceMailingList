{"body": "Isn't a file INSTALL in the ray directory the right place to collect all \nthis information? Having one section \"old distributions\" in such a file \nwould allow to add information on sources such as backports, how to \ncompile on old linux distributions and such. Here is also the place to \ncollect hints on systems such as solaris, os x, the various windows \nports - even if we have only urls to sites describing the procedure, \nthat way users having problems to install could have a start. In the \nvery beginning, the options\n\n\na) binaries from radiance-online.org and radsite\nb) binaries coming with distributions\nc) compiling from source (generic using makeall install) should be present,\n\n\nthan all the special work-arounds.\n\n\nI have an ubuntu box running, is there need for an ubuntu maintainer? Be \naware that I have no (aka zero aka nul) experience with package building \nexcept making my own ones, but I guess that building on top of Bernd's \ndebian work, there are few changes to expect.\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000971.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
