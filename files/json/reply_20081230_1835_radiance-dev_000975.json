{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nThanks for working on this!\n\n\n>   1. Is the file header different on Windows because of the  \n> difference in newline convention?\n\n\nNo, a single newline ('\\n') character should terminate each header  \nline no matter what system you're on.  A carriage return ('\\r') will  \nbe ignored, and not produced by any of the Radiance tools.\n\n\n>   2. Is *Rendering with Radiance* still available from Booksurge?\n\n\nYou can buy it from Amazon:\n\n\n\thttp://www.amazon.com/Rendering-Radiance-Science-Lighting- \nVisualization/dp/0974538108/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5711964-3059265? \nie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186177315&sr=8-1\n\n\nThe link perpetually says it's out of stock, but since it's print-on- \ndemand, it doesn't matter.  I think it comes from BookSurge, but I  \ndon't think they have a link for it anymore.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000975.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 30, 2008 at 06:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000922", "id": "radiance-dev_000975"}
