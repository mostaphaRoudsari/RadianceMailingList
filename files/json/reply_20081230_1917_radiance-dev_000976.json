{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\none main problem I still see for people who'd like to use the system's libtiff\nare the tiff headers shipped in src/common:\n\n\n0 bzed at think:~/workspace/debian/recluse/pkg-radiance/src/common(upstream-cvs)$\nll tiff*\n-r--r--r-- 1 bzed bzed 30663 2008-08-28 00:57 tiff.h\n-r--r--r-- 1 bzed bzed 19161 2008-08-28 00:57 tiffio.h\n-r--r--r-- 1 bzed bzed   410 2008-08-28 00:57 tiffvers.h\n0 bzed at think:~/workspace/debian/recluse/pkg-radiance/src/common(upstream-cvs)$\n\n\nI think it makes more than sense to use the tiff headers shipped with the\ndistribution's libtiff package instead of the old versions included in the\nRadiance source. Could they be dropped from src/common and only be copied in\nthere in case the libtiff from the Radiance source is being built?\nThe other option would be to change the Makefile which does the libtiff build\njob to let libtiff install the tiff headers into a special subdirectory, so\nthis directory could be added to the CPPFLAGS with -I per default, but it\nwould be only used if there's something in it.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000976.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "December 30, 2008 at 07:17PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000953", "id": "radiance-dev_000976"}
