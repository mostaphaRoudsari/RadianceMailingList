In case dget complains about unknown signatures, use dget -xu - the\noption is new and not available in old versions of dget.\n\n\n> cd radiance-3R9+20080530\n\n\nThats would become\ncd radiance-<version>\n(replace <version> by the version of the downloaded source - ls -l will show\nyou the right directory name)\n\n\n> dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -rfakeroot\n> cd ..\n> sudo dpkg -i radiance*.deb\n> #############################\n\n\notherwise it should be fine.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005641.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "December 31, 2008 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005631", "id": "radiance-general_005641"}
