I do not get it... to get the illuminance from a 180 degree \nfisheye picture (no matter if taken by a camera or rendered by rpict), I \nhave to integrate the luminance values over the circular surface of the \nprojected hemisphere. This means that I somehow have to sum-up the pixel \nvalues. Still I do not really know the maths to do it, can anyone give \nme a hint, please? Is it the average of the pixel values multiplied by \nthe surface area, the  pixel values being weighted according to the \nsolid angles they cover?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005643.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
