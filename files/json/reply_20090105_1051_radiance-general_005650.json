{"body": "Hi Germain,\n\n\nThe \"mirror\" type allows Radiance to find a small source like the sun  \nby creating a \"virtual source\" behind the mirrored surface.  The same  \nis not true for the other types you tried, which is why your -I  \ncalculation came up empty.\n\n\nWith many mirrors in your scene, especially if they are not perfect  \nmirrors, you will probably need to use rtcontrib to send rays from  \nthe direction of the sun and track them onto your object, estimating  \nthe flux density by ray counting.  I think I mentioned this  \npossibility to you at the workshop.  Unfortunately, I don't have a  \nsimple example to offer you showing how it's done, and it's not what  \nI would characterize as straightforward.\n\n\nEssentially, you need to create a ray flux generator corresponding to  \nthe solar beam radiation striking your mirror array.  You send these  \nrays into rtcontrib, specifying one or more materials to record ray  \nstrikes on the heliostat receiver.  These get counted up and the  \nratio of ray strikes to rays sent tells you the transfer efficiency.\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005650.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 05, 2009 at 10:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005649", "id": "radiance-general_005650"}
