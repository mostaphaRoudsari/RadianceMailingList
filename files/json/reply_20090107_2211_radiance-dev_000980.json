{"body": "Hi Christopher,\n\n\nI have given this some thought in the past, and the problem is,  \nrpiece is not really that reliable or well-supported.  I'm therefore  \nreluctant to include it with the more dependable programs called by  \nrad.  Also, rpiece is made to be run over multiple machines, which  \nrad cannot easily support.\n\n\nHave you tried using rvu (rad run with -o) and the -N option on your  \nmultiprocessor?  If what you're after is a quick preview, this works  \nrather well in the latest release.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-January/000980.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 07, 2009 at 10:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000979", "id": "radiance-dev_000980"}
