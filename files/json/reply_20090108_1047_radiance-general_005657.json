{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI keep hoping I'll get around to making this more automatic.  The  \ncurrent distribution of Radiance has a file called \"tregenza.cal\"  \nincluded in the ray/src/cal/cal/ directory, which converts a sky  \ndirection into a Tregenza bin number for rtcontrib.  There is another  \nfile called \"tregsrc.cal\" in the same directory that is used to  \ngenerate Tregenza solar and sky positions, and a file called  \n\"tregsamp.dat\" in the ray/lib directory that has 64 randomly  \ndistributed samples over each Tregenza patch, plus 64 randomly  \ndistributed samples over the ground (negative altitude angles).  This  \nfile is useful in combination with rtrace to determine the patch  \ncontributions for a particular sky/ground model.\n\n\nI have some scripts as well for using these files, but they are  \ncomplicated and specific to projects I've done in the past, and not  \ngenerally usable or understandable.  I wish I could provide you with  \nmore, but that's all I have at the moment.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005657.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 08, 2009 at 10:47AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005655", "id": "radiance-general_005657"}
