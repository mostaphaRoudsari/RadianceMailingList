{"body": "I remember from some documents (maybe even RwR) that\n'glass' is optimised to model the effects of a thin\nsheet of glass in one single polygon rather than\ntwo parallel 'interface' polygons. The thickness of\nglass panes in buildings is rather standard (4 or 6\nmm) so there should be minimal errors due to this\noptimisation.\n\n\nIf you want to model exactly how a solid body of\nglass would behave you should use other primitives\nlike 'dielectric' (see the whale sculpture and\nanti-matter examples in RwR). Arguably, the Radiance\napproach is not the best algorithm for this.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 14 Jan 2009, at 05:41, Lars Oliver Grobe wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005659.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 14, 2009 at 01:11AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005658", "id": "radiance-general_005659"}
