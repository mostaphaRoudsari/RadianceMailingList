{"body": "Hi Thomas, thank you for the reply!\n\n\nYes, I know that it is an optimization. Still it would be possible to\naccount for the angular dependent distance given a single polygon if you\nrely on that average of about 6mm. But the internal calculation should\ninclude the angular dependency than, and that is what I am wondering. So\nis the fact that a ray entering a glass face at 0 degree (perpendicular)\nwould travel a much shorter distance through the material then one\nhitting it at 45 degree considered in the glass modifier code?\n\n\nBTW yes I think this is explained in RwR, though I do not know if this\nquestion is answered there. Unfortunately my book is 10.000km from my\ncurrent location and the one we ordered weeks ago seems to be not\navailable.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005660.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
