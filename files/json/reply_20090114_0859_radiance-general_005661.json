{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe 'glass' type correctly computes the angular transmittance and  \nreflectance of any sheet of glass, since the actual thickness drops  \nout of the equation.  The only thing it won't do for you is show  \ndouble- and triple- reflections that are offset by the glazing  \nthickness, as one might notice in a thick pane of glass.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005661.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 14, 2009 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005658", "id": "radiance-general_005661"}
