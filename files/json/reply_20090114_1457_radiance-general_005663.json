{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nI won't comment on the usefulness of your proposed study, other than  \nto say it sounds interesting to me...  I do have a couple of  \nsuggestions, however.\n\n\nThe output of Optics5 should not be used directly, but should be  \npassed through the \"optics2rad\" script to get the desired angular  \nbehavior from the selected glazing.  In the case of multi-layer  \nglazing systems, you may be better off using the \"glaze\" script to  \ndefine your material.  This script does a much better job modeling  \nthe multiple reflections that occur in a double-glazed system.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005663.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 14, 2009 at 02:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005662", "id": "radiance-general_005663"}
