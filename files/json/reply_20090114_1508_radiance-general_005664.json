{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nYou should probably consider the glaze script to produce a material \ndescription for your glazing. I think that this will you get the most \nsophisticated description for a glass material. You can incorporate data \nthat is output from Optics for single monolithic glass types to build up \ndouble pane insulating units if needed. A coating can be applied to a \nselected layer of the make-up. Note, that using the simple BRTDfunc \ndescription output from Optics (unless this has been updated in the past \nfew years) does not account for variation due to incident angle. There \nis actually a way to set up the glaze script so it accepts a file of \nglass types as input rather than using the rather minimal inputs that \ncome with script.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I will do the best I can to \nhelp out.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005664.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 14, 2009 at 03:08PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005662", "id": "radiance-general_005664"}
