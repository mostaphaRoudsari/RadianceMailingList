{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nA couple of subtleties to watch out for.\n\n\n   1. the normals for glass geometry must be uniformly oriented and\n      point to the interior of the space\n   2. the header spacing if very specific and relies on tabs only as I\n      recall\n   3. I think that you will also find that the appearance in the images\n      will be sensitive to the ambient parameters that are used\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005666.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 15, 2009 at 06:15PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005662", "id": "radiance-general_005666"}
