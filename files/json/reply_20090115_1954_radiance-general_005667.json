{"body": "Thanks Jack.\n\n\nAll seems clear and I've got some results that I'm pretty happy with.  One thing I'm still a little unclear about is how you would apply a low-e film to a non-clear glass (i.e. tinted green, blue, etc) if the script requires one surface to be \"clear\" for each pane.\n\n\nFor example:\nVE2-2M (http://www.viracon.com/makeupsheet.php?id=3840) has the VE-2M coating applied to Evergreen glass on the #2 surface.  As it is now, I would input:\nSurface 1 - Clear\nSurface 2 - VE2-2M on evergreen (from optics 5 data)\nSurface 3 - Clear\nSurface 4 - Clear\n\n\nIs there an easy hack to make Surface 1 evergreen instead of clear?\n\n\nThanks,\nGalen\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nDate: Thu, 15 Jan 2009 21:07:06 -0500\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005667.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Galen Burrell", "created_at": "January 15, 2009 at 07:54PM", "created_by": "Galen_Burrell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005662", "id": "radiance-general_005667"}
