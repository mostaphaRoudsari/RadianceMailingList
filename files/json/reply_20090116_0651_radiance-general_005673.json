{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nIt has been a while, but I think that the color/tint comes from the rgb \nvalues for the coated glass. So the color would be conveyed by \"VE2-2M \non Evergreen\" monolithic export from Optics 5. So this should account \nfor the color of the coated glass. However, I think that I have to defer \nto Greg on this for confirmation.\n\n\nNote for Viracon:\n\n\n    <type><color>-<transmittance>\n\n\n    so\n    type = VE = Low-E\n    color = 2 = Green\n    transmittance = 2M = ~70%\n\n\n    if you want \"Evergreen\" you need to look at color 8.... so VE8-2M\n\n\n\n\nOne way to sanity check is to run a single layer output from glaze and \nspecify s1 as clear and s2 as VE2-2M on evergreen. The last three lines \nof the material description should give you:\n\n\n    Rext_r Rext_g Rext_b\n    Rint_r Rint_g Rint_b\n    Tr Tg Tb\n\n\nThe rgb components should be the same as those exported from Optics5 \n(even though you are specifying \"clear\" for one layer).\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005673.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 16, 2009 at 06:51AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005662", "id": "radiance-general_005673"}
