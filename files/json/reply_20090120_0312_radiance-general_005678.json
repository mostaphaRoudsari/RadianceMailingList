{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI have never used radiance on windows and do not know about windows \nneither. Still there is something strange in what you describe:\n\n\n> now i run\n>  % oconv sky.rad  outside.rad  window.rad  room.rad  > test1.oct\n>  \n> (...)\n>  \n> my .bash_profile was\n>\n>  # System-wide .bashrc file\n> # change the directories if necessary\n> PATH=.:/opt/radiance/bin:$PATH\n> RAYPATH=.:/opt/radiance/lib\n> MANPATH=/opt/radiance/doc/man:$MANPATH\n> export PATH RAYPATH MANPATH\n>\n> (...) \n>\n> later i found the \"rayinit.cal\" file path \n> (C:\\cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\lib)\n>\n\n\nYou found rayinit.cal in a subdirectory called \ncygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\lib, so I guess your binaries are in \ncygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\bin, right? Still your PATH points to \n/opt/radiance/bin, and you are able to call oconv. So something is \nwrong. Is it possible that the settings in this .bash_profile are \noverwritten somewhere?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005678.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
