{"body": "Thanks Lars and Thomas,\n\n\nIt is working !!\nI copied the rayinit.cal and skybright.cal into project folder.\u00a0Now \"rpict: command is working. Image is rendered and i am able to see in HDR shop.\n\n\nWell i am not a expert unix guy....\u00a0just started with cygwin..... to install radiance ....i refered\u00a0\" install.txt\" \nRadiance 3R9 for Cygwin 2005-08-03\nHOW TO INSTALL IT QUICKLY ...\n1. Launch the Cygwin console (double-click on the Cygwin desktop icon)\u00a0 2. Change to root directory (don't type the dollar sign):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $ cd /\n3. Create the \"opt\" directory:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $ mkdir /opt\u00a0\u00a0 4. Create the \"radiance\" directory inside /opt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $ cd /opt ,\u00a0\u00a0 $ mkdir radiance\n5. Copy the radiance_cygwin_3R9.tar.gz inside C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance 6. Extract the archive: $ cd radiance .....\u00a0\u00a0 used win rar instead of\u00a0 ..$ tar zxvf radiance_cygwin_3R9.tar.gz\u00a0 7. Copy the bash_profile file to your home directory:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $ cp bash_profile >> ~/.bash_profile\u00a0 ( Instead i did copy paste in windows)\u00a0\u00a08. Close the Cygwin console.\u00a0 9. Re-launch the Cygwin console. 10. Enjoy!\n\n\nNow i really want to fix the problem of PATH for future. Therefore i am explaining my directory structure.\nUnder cygwin\\home\\abc directory\u00a0 ..... i have folder\u00a0 \"opt\" and files .bashrc , .inputrc, bash_profile, BASH_HISTORY\n\n\nbash_profile\u00a0changed content is given below \n\n\n# System-wide .bashrc file\n# change the directories if necessary\nPATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin:$PATH\nRAYPATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/lib:$RAYPATH\nMANPATH=/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/doc/man:$MANPATH\nexport PATH RAYPATH MANPATH\n\n\nthen under\u00a0\u00a0 cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\n\u00a0i have \"bin\", \"doc\", \"lib\" and \"obj\" folders. and my source files ( now it includes rayinit.cal and skybright.cal)\u00a0are also into\u00a0\u00a0 - \"cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\"\n\n\nWhen i relaunch the cygwin console and\u00a0\u00a0execute\u00a0$PATH .... i get the following info on the console\nbash:\u00a0usr/local/bin: /usr/bin: /bin : /usr/X11R6/bin : /cygdrive/c/Program: No such file or directory.\n\n\nand when i do $RAYPATH then no message or info\u00a0comes on the console.\n\n\nfor execution of source file - once i am inside the \"cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\" ditectory\nI do\n1. export PATH=$HOME/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin/:$PATH ( Without this command i am \"oconv\" commoand is not executed)\n2. oconv command......... \n3. rpict command ............\n\n\nI suppose\u00a0my path is set to bin\u00a0 and it does not point on lib folder? How i can set the path(s) such that i do not use export command\n\n\nBest Regards, \nBrajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005680.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brajesh Lal", "created_at": "January 20, 2009 at 05:32AM", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005677", "id": "radiance-general_005680"}
