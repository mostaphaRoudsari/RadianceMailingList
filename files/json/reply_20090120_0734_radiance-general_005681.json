If  \nyou have the resources I recommend installing Linux on an old  \ncomputer or setting up a virtual machine with Linux. It will make it  \neasier for you to understand Unix.\n\n\n> Now i really want to fix the problem of PATH for future.

You can verify  \nby typing\n\n\nwhoami\npwd\n\n\nin the console window. The first should give you 'abc' the second '/ \nhome/abc'\n\n\n\n\nSecond: This 'opt' is not were it is intended to be. That might be  \nthe problem.\n\n\nCygwin creates its own file system 'root' in its installation  \ndirectory (typically \"C:\\cygwin\"). Every command you enter in a  \nCygwin shell will use this as the start for the file system tree. An  \nabsolute file path in Unix starts with '/' (no dot!). So if you see a  \nUnix path '/home/abc' this translates to \"C:\\cygwin\\home\\abc\".\n\n\nFollowing this logic '/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin'  \nshould be found as\n\"C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\\bin\". Just keep the  \nfiles as they are and move the cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9 folder to the  \nright location.\n\n\nYou should not mix your project files with files in the distribution.  \nYou might accidentally destroy essential files.\n\n\n> bash_profile changed content is given below\n\n\nNote that there should be a '.' in front of the file name:  \n'.bash_profile'. The '.' hides the name for the user so this file is  \nsomewhat protected. It is still part of the file name and without it  \nthe file will not be recognised. This may be why you don't have the  \n$RAYPATH set correctly.\n\n\n> # System-wide .bashrc file\n> # change the directories if necessary\n> PATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin:$PATH\n> RAYPATH=.:/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/lib:$RAYPATH\n> MANPATH=/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/doc/man:$MANPATH\n> export PATH RAYPATH MANPATH\n\n\nIf you follow the renaming as above these settings should work now.\n\n\n\n\n> then under   cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\n>  i have \"bin\", \"doc\", \"lib\" and \"obj\" folders. and my source files  \n> ( now it includes rayinit.cal and skybright.cal) are also into   -  \n> \"cygwin\\home\\abc\\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\"\n\n\nMove your source files to a folder in your HOME directory ('/home/abc/ \nproject1' for example). Keep your Radiance installation clear!\n\n\n> When i relaunch the cygwin console and  execute $PATH .... i get  \n> the following info on the console\n> bash: usr/local/bin: /usr/bin: /bin : /usr/X11R6/bin : /cygdrive/c/ \n> Program: No such file or directory.\n>\n> and when i do $RAYPATH then no message or info comes on the console.\n\n\nSee above. IF you are user 'abc' AND the file is called  \n'.bash_profile' it should work.\n\n\n> for execution of source file - once i am inside the \"cygwin\\home\\abc \n> \\opt\\radiance\\cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9\" ditectory\n> I do\n> 1. export PATH=$HOME/opt/radiance/cygwin-radiance_dist-3R9/bin/:$PATH\n\n\nWhat you do here is what should happen in the config file. You only  \ndid change the PATH setting, but did not create a RAYPATH. Therefore  \nyou could use oconv and rpict but the search for 'rayinit.cal' failed.\n\n\n\n\nOne last thing: If you copy-and-past from Windows to Linux you should  \nchange the line end characters. Windows will create a '\\r\\n' at the  \nend of a text file while Unix only uses '\\n'. The bash configuration  \nfiles should not be affected, but other programs might have problems  \nwith that.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005681.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 20, 2009 at 07:34AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005677", "id": "radiance-general_005681"}
