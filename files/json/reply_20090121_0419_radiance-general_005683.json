These do not dependent\non the latitude directly, but the sky brightness is defined\nvia sun angle (zenith) that obviously does depend on the\nlocation.\n\n\n> For example, where it takes the zenith luminance?\n\n\nIn terms of absolute values there are some hard coded in the\ngensky.c source file. However, if you don't specify values\nfor horizontal or solar radiance (-b/-B or -r/-R) the absolute\nvalue is meaningless.\n\n\nYou can find the sky distribution functions in the file\nskybright.cal and a description in various CIE publications.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005683.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 21, 2009 at 04:19AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005682", "id": "radiance-general_005683"}
