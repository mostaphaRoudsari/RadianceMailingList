There\nare interfaces for blender and sketchup that allow you integration of\nradiance into these tools, as well as the (commercial) rayfront from\nwww.schorsch.com, which is a more general GUI and Autocad integration\n(free demo available).\n\n\nStill, starting at the GUI is not reasonable, as 99% of the job in a\nsimulation is the model...\n\n\nWhat are you planning to do with radiance?\n\n\nAnd (again) did you look at the tutorial? It is a step by step introduction.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005687.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
