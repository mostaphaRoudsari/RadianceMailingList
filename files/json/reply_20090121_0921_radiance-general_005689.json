So now that you have\ninstalled Radiance, your GUI is ESP-r. I do not know if you must tell\nESP-r where to find the binaries, I guess if the PATH is set, everything\nshould be fine.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005689.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
