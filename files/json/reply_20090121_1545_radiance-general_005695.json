It's a very simple viewer. Unlike the AGI, \nI don't have an editing capability. There's a text HTML summary facility \nwhich \"almost\" works. I'm not sure where that fits in people's ideas of \nsuch things, but it sounds like it's worth bundling up & distributing.\n\n\nSystem requirements: I have a Mac application which one can just run on \n10.5, or you need python, wxpython, and pyopengl. It works on Mac, \nsort-of works on Windows.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph Fritz\n  design machine group\n  architecture department\n  university of washington\nrfritz at u.washington.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005695.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "January 21, 2009 at 03:45PM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005690", "id": "radiance-general_005695"}
