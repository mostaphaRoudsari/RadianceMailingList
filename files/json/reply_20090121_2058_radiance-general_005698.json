{"body": "Hello, I would definitely like to see some more photometric friendly\nfeatures with in Radiance.  As it is, I typically go to other programs\nwhen dealing with photometric files.  FYI, they are:\n\n\n1) There is a free version of the Photometric Toolbox available here,\nhttp://www.cooperlighting.com/content/design/etools.cfm \nI believe this is just an older version of the software created by AGI\nbut provided for free by cooper.  I do not think it has all the features\nthat the new Lighting Technologies Photometric Toolbox has but it\ndefinitely has some nice features, including a nice 3d photometric web\nand 2d plot options for comparison with published data.\n2) Visual 2.6 also has some nice photometric features including a\nphotometric web.  I believe this is available in the free \"Basic\"\nversion, it is definitely available in the \"Pro\" version.\n\n\nI have heard of some efforts to link softwares with online photometric\ndatabases to help avoid the cumbersome and mistake prone process of\nfinding the correct IES file for the luminaire (w/ options) that is\nbeing modeled.  For example, Visual comes with all Acuity brand\nphotometrics already in the database - not sure if it can be updated\neasily.  There is also a new xml format being developed by IESNA for the\ntransfer of Luminaire Component Data, separate from photometric data.\nPart of the intent with this format is to link it more directly to\nmanufacturers.  Just thought I'd throw that out there as we discuss any\nnew photometric tools for Radiance.\n\n\nRegards,\nZack\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005698.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "January 21, 2009 at 08:58PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005690", "id": "radiance-general_005698"}
