{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nInteresting little tool!\nI tried it in Kubuntu and it works perfectly (I have python, wxpython and\npyopengl aready installed).\n\n\nFew remarks:\n-No About dialog (I saw you haven't put event handler for it). It would be\nnice to put some short text.\n-Maybe some legend about planes colors should be aded. Maybe in About dialog\nor some tool-tip when we are on image.\n\n\nOtherwise, I think it can be very useful for fast IES files exploration.\n\n\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005700.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "January 22, 2009 at 03:13AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005690", "id": "radiance-general_005700"}
