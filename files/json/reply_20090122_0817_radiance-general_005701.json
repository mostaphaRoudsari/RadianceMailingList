{"body": "Yes, well I was thinking much more along the lines of what Rob has  \nalready done, that is provide a means to graphically confirm a  \nluminaire's output distribution in a Radiance context.  I.e., it  \nshould take ies2rad output, not reinterpret the IES file, as Zack and  \nothers have noted that ies2rad itself is occasionally suspect.  Also,  \nhaving the Radiance coordinates as a final check of placement in the  \nscene is often useful.\n\n\nI don't use IES files that often myself, which is probably why I have  \nnever spent much time on this.  I just thought a false color fisheye  \nimage might be an interesting way to confirm the IES file was being  \nloaded and interpreted and placed correctly.  Sounds like there are  \nenough tools out there already, though.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005701.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 22, 2009 at 08:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005690", "id": "radiance-general_005701"}
