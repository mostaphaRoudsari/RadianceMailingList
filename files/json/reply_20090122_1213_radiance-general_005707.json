{"body": "I agree with Marija's comment, it is easy to lose your bearings after\nrotating the fixture a bit and forget which axis is which. Might be\ndifficult to do with actual text labels for X Y and Z in a 3D view, but\nSketchup and AutoCAD seem to agree on a red X axis, green Y axis, and\nblue Z axis. In sketchup the positive axes are a bolder color than the\nnegative axes for clarity (of course it's easy to recommend additions to\nother peoples work ;)\n\n\nAnother handy feature would be just to display the maximum candela value\nof the distribution, to be able to judge the total output quickly\nwithout going to the \"Show Photometric Data\" window.\n\n\nthat being said ... it's a great tool, Thanks!\n\n\n>Maybe some legend about planes colors should be aded. Maybe in About\ndialog or some tool-tip when we are on image.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005707.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "January 22, 2009 at 12:13PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005690", "id": "radiance-general_005707"}
