{"body": "Hi Greg!\n> If you just want a pixel count, you can use:\n>\n>     pcomb -e 'lo=if(S(1)-1e-30,1,0)' input.pic | pvalue -h -H -pG -df \n> | total -if\nHm, thank You for this, now I am trying to figure out how it works. So \nyou set the brightness to 1 if S(1) is greater then the very low \ntreshold, else set it to 0, and sum up the pixel values (which are \neither 1 or 0, thus resulting in the n of pixels > 0)? This is very \nsimilar to what I did with grep, removing all values that have zero \nluminance, and counting the lines than. I was just not sure if it is \nreally safe to rely on that pixels with zero luminance must be out of \nthe view... But most probably they are, if I do not have a perfect \nabsorber in my scene.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005714.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
