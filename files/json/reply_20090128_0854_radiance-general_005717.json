{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nSeems to me you have a pretty good grasp of what's going on with this  \ncalculation.  You didn't really leave me anything else to explain...   \nSince S(1) returns exactly 0 for off-view pixels, the 1e-30 threshold  \nis set to allow for *very* small pixels, as you might have in a very  \nhigh-resolution image.\n\n\nJust beware that because the Radiance RGBE encoding doesn't have an  \nexact representation of 1.0, that the actual count will be off (by  \n-0.5% if I remember right).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005717.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 28, 2009 at 08:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005712", "id": "radiance-general_005717"}
