{"body": "Ah, thanks, pvalue does the trick.\n\n\nTwo things of note though which I don't think are documented: It looks like  \npvalue needs the ASCII input to have a Radiance header - at  \nleast \"#?RADIANCE\" on the first line followed by a blank line. In the  \ncommand \"pvalue -h image.hdr | pvalue -r > image2.hdr\" the second pvalue  \nwill not know what to do with the output from the first pvalue.\n\n\nAlso, the -d switch on pvalue works on the reverse operation as well. If  \nyou do something like \"pvalue -d image.hdr | pvalue -r > image2.hdr\", the  \nsecond pvalue will use the header to determine the dimensions but ignore  \nthe red and green columns (assuming they were supposed to be x and y), so  \nyou'll get only the blue channel in image2.hdr. However, \"pvalue -d  \nimage.hdr | pvalue -r -d > image2.hdr\" will reproduce the original image.  \nThis behavior is noted in the Bugs section but not in the description for  \nthe -d option.\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005725.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dave B", "created_at": "January 30, 2009 at 07:49AM", "created_by": "Dave_B", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005723", "id": "radiance-general_005725"}
