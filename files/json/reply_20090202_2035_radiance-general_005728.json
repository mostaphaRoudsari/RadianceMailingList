{"body": "So of course I ran into that problem of having perfectly black surfaces \nin my field of view. If ever anyone needs a way to get around this, here \nis my solution for now, using nothing but primitive text processing (and \nI am sure that the grep line could be written nicer):\n\n\nN_PIXELS=`vwrays fisheye.hdr | grep -v -c \"0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 \n0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00\"`\n\n\nSo I feed my image (fisheye.hdr) into vwray, which will produce \nviewpoint/direction vectors for each pixel. For pixels that are outside \nthe view, it writes out three times zero. Grep -c counts those, but grep \n-v -c counts the lines NOT containing the six zero expressions. And this \nis the number of pixels inside my image's view.\n\n\nMaybe someone finds it useful one day.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005728.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
