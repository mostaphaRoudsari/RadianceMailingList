{"body": "Kevin.\n\n\n'rview' in Radiance has been renamed to 'rvu'.\nThe documentation (mostly old) does not reflect this,\nthough.\n\n\nCheck that you have an 'rvu' command on your\nsystem and substitute the two whenever you see an\n'rview' related to Radiance.\n\n\nIf you don't have 'rvu' you should update your\nRadiance version. If that's not possible use the\nfull path (something like '/usr/local/bin/rview').\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005743.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 10, 2009 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005740", "id": "radiance-general_005743"}
