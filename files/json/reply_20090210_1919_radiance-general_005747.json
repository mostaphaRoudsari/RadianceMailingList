{"body": "Hi!\n> I have downloaded and installed the Windows version of Evalglare but \n> am not sure whether the software has actually been installed.

I was not even aware that it \nexisted. On Linux, it comes as an archive, and the documentation is \nincluded as a pdf document.\n\n\nThere is no GUI for evalglar, as it simply processes rendered image \nfiles. Did you try if it is in your PATH already by just typing \n'evalglar' at the command line? How did you install it?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005747.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
