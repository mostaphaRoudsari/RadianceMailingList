{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nthe subject-line of this mail is not very helpful. What kind of file do\nyou want to export from Ecotect? I try to understand what you wrote, and\nit seams that you want to use the image processing tools of Radiance on\nimages generated in Ecotect, is this the case? I also do not know which\n\"image viewer\" you refer to, the only image viewer in Radiance that I am\naware of is ximage, and it offers no such things like your information\noverlay functionality, as this is done by filters in Radiance. So I\nguess you are using other software here, not Radiance.\n\n\nCan you please find out some details about what kind of data you want to\nprocess using which Radiance tools?\n\n\nGood luck, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
