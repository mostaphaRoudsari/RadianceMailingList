{"body": "I would like to thank everyone for their advice. It looks like the problem\nhas been resolved and that it was not related to the fact that the rview.exe\napplication does not come with the version of Radiance I am using (MinGW\nRadiance Installer for Windows (HEAD snapshot 2008-04-17) available for\ndownload at http://www.radiance-online.org/).\n\n\n I had to reset my Radiance directory within the 'image viewer' program in\norder to be able to apply any of the overlays. Below is an excerpt from an\nNRC document explaining how to get started with Ecotect-Radiance-DAYSIM\n(available at http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim_e.html),\nin which specific reference is made to the issue I experienced:\n\n\n Please note: The first time you are trying to generate a falsecolor image\nyou might get an error message stating \"RGBE read error\". If this is the\ncase, you have to reset your Radiance directory within the 'image viewer'\nprogram above under OPTIONS >> SETTINGS (see also Step 30.a).\n\n\n The NRC document describes how to import/export files from\nEcotect/Radiance/DAYSIM. It is very helpful, although parts of it may be\nslightly outdated.  For example, I think that the link provided for the\nRadiance download (\nhttp://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/software/Radiance3P7forWindows.zip)\nmay refer to an older version of Radiance.\n\n\n I am keeping my fingers crossed things will run smoothly from now on!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005759.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Krystyna Zelenay", "created_at": "February 15, 2009 at 01:19PM", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005753", "id": "radiance-general_005759"}
