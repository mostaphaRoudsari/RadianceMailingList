{"body": "Hi Chandrayee.\n\n\nYou can use gcc. I just compiled it on Mac OS with gcc\n4.01. I didn't use any flags ('CCOPTS=') and set 'CC=gcc'.\n\n\nI always got an error when compiling it. Today I looked\nthis up and found that there is a macro fropen() that\nconflicts with the definition in the gensky source file\nfropen.c (on Mac OS X BSD at least). I renamed 'fropen'\nto 'fzopen' in fropen.c and gendaylit.c and it worked!\n\n\nYou may also include 'string.h' to avoid a warning\nabout strcpy.\n\n\nHth and servus,\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 16 Feb 2009, at 12:42, Chandrayee Basu wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005761.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 16, 2009 at 06:08AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005760", "id": "radiance-general_005761"}
