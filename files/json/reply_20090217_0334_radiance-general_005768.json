{"body": "Hello\n\n\nThank you for the help. The Gendaylit is installed properly now. Actually I\nam facing some errors while trying to export scene from ESP-r to RADIANCE\nfor which I was suggested to install Gendaylit. I have installed the\ncomponents of Gendaylit in the default target locations as given in the\nmakefile. My RADIANCE is also working properly. But still I am getting error\nin ESP-r as 'problem detected in opening filename.rif and\nfilename_day_f.sky. Is there any problem regarding the location of\nGendaylit? The binaries of RADIANCE are in /usr/local/bin while the\nlibraries are in /usr/local/lib/ray. But the default location of the\nGendaylit components is /usr/local/radiance. Could this be a problem? Do I\nhave to reset the environment variable PATH for Gendaylit?\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nChandrayee\n\n\n2009/2/16 Jan Wienold <jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005768.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chandrayee Basu", "created_at": "February 17, 2009 at 03:34AM", "created_by": "Chandrayee_Basu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005760", "id": "radiance-general_005768"}
