Then\nrun 'make install' again in the source directory.\n\n\nAlternatively you can extend your RAYPATH and\nPATH to include the location of gendaylit and its\n*.cal files.\n\n\nThere is no risk of overwriting existing\nfiles so I would recommend the first option;\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005769.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 17, 2009 at 03:53AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005760", "id": "radiance-general_005769"}
