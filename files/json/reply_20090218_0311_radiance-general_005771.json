Use the line\n\n\n     gensky $mo $da $hh\":00\" -a 45.50 -o -12.33 -m -15 -u -g 0.2 >  \nsky.rad\n\n\ninstead of your command. I assume that the CSH syntax\notherwise is correct. I have not checked that the output\nof $hh\":00\" returns something like \"13:00\".\n\n\nI also noticed that you use a uniform sky here (-u).\nThis is not realistic sky distribution and only appropriate\nin specialist cases. If you want a \"standard\" sky you should\nuse \"-c\" to create an CIE overcast sky (probably not very\naccurate for Venice either - I'm sure you get some sun there.).\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn 18 Feb 2009, at 10:30, Valeria De Giuli wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005771.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 18, 2009 at 03:11AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005770", "id": "radiance-general_005771"}
