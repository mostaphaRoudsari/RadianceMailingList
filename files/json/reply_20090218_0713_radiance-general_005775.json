{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI think that what you want to do is:\n\n\n    <total reflectance> - <diffuse reflectance> = <specular reflectance>\n\n\n    thus\n\n\n    86 - 10 = 76\n\n\nThe specular reflectance that is provided is for a measurement at 60 \ndegrees incidence, if I understand this correctly.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005775.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 18, 2009 at 07:13AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005773", "id": "radiance-general_005775"}
