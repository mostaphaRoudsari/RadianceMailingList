{"body": "Hi Jack!\n> I think that what you want to do is:\n>\n>     <total reflectance> - <diffuse reflectance> = <specular reflectance>\n>\n>     thus\n>\n>     86 - 10 = 76\n>\n> The specular reflectance that is provided is for a measurement at 60\n> degrees incidence, if I understand this correctly.\n\n\nYou mean that, while at 60 degree the specular reflectance is higher,\nthe average specular reflectance over all angles of incidence should be\nthe expected value of 76%? I try to get what the values really mean... a\ndesperate attempt without really knowing what had been measured.\n\n\nThanks!
