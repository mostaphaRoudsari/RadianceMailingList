{"body": "Hi Mehlika,\n\n\nwhat exactly do you want to achieve? The command you quoted from Greg's\nmail does not change the projection (or view-type). It corrects for the\nweigth of luminances according to their angle from the optical axis (or\nthe view-direction of the sensor) when contributing to the illuminance\nof a point, which is also known as the cosine law. So you can expect a\nfall-off. Do you want to change the projection of an existing image?\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005781.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
