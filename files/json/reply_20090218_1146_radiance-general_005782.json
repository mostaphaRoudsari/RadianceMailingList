{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYes, I would like to change the projection of the existing image from an \nequi-angular to hemispherical fisheye, if that is doable. But my \nintention was similar to your motive. I have used hemisherical fisheye \nimages in the past to calculate illuminance at the camera point \n(averaging luminance within the circular area and multiplying by pi). \nSince the physical fisheye lenses have equi-angular (or equi distant) \nprojections (not cosine corrected hemispherical fisheye projections), I \nam trying to calculate illuminance from a HDR photograph taken with a \nfisheye lens.\n\n\nThanks,\nMehlika\n\n\nLars O.
