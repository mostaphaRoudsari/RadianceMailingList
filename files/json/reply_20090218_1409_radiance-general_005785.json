{"body": "Hi Lars,Just wondering, do you have a roughness value (RMS) or equivalent from the manufacturer?If not, could it be possible that the 60-degree measurement is used to define the roughness value? The higher value (82) seems like a way to define the BRDF.i.e. BRDF(theta-i, phi-i, theta-r, phi-r) = 82/76 = 1.079You'd need to know (manufacturer definition)what the actual angle configurations (theta and phi) are for the 60-degree measurement, then working backwards using the Radiance equation, you'd get the roughness (RMS) value.for example, if both angles are zero, roughness = 0.272.if both angles are 30 (60-degree split evenly), roughness = 0.292 What exactly is the material? If it is more smooth than rough (polished metal rather than plastic-ky) then obviously my guess is wrong. cheers,YC Huang  I think that what you want to do is:\n\n\n    <total reflectance> - <diffuse reflectance> = <specular reflectance>\n\n\n    thus\n\n\n    86 - 10 = 76\n\n\nThe specular reflectance that is provided is for a measurement at 60 \ndegrees incidence, if I understand this correctly.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005785.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "yijun huang", "created_at": "February 18, 2009 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "yijun_huang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005773", "id": "radiance-general_005785"}
