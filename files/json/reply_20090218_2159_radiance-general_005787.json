{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI did not really get what you really want to achieve. What kind of a sky \ncoordinate grid are you refering to? It looks like you want to create a \nprojection of the longitudonal lines of a hemisphere, right? What \nprojection do you refer to when saying hemispherical view? What I see on \nthe image looks a lot like a parralel proction of the dome, so the \nlines's coordinated could be calculated from spherical coordinates, \nobtained from the horizontal and vertical angle and radius, and ignoring \nthe third coordinate (for the image you just need the two dimensions), \ntransfered into cartesian coordinates. If you write down the formulas \nfor this, you should be able to combine to something much simpler \ndescribing the parabolic curves. But I am not sure if I really got your \nintention yet.\n\n\nSo do you want a parallel projection of a hemisphere with longitudonal \nlines?\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005787.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
