{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nthank you for the reply! The material is an aluminium surface finish\nwith coatings. I do not know about the roughness yet, as it was not\nprovided. I know that the total reflectance was determined using an\nintegrating sphere, and at an angle of 30 degree (whatever this really\nmeans in detail - where is the angle in this measurement?), the specular\nreflectance was measured according to ISO 7668.\n\n\nAs far as I understand, the routine is to point a light source at the\nsample point under the indicated angle (which is given as the angle\nbetween surface normal and the line between the sample point and the\nlight source. On the opposite side, the sensor is pointed at the same\nsample point. 60 degrees is a standard for aluminium measurements\naccording to the ISO 7668.\n\n\nAs the surface roughness influences the measurements, the term used here\nis gloss (a nice explanation is found at wikipedia\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(material_appearance) ). If someone\ncan share a nice definition of the difference between gloss and specular\nreflectance it would be highly appreciated ;-)\n\n\nAnd I have to read a bit before I can follow you about how to determine\nthe roughness.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005788.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
