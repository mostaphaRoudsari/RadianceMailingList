{"body": "David.\n\n\nFor a parallel projection all you have to do is take\nthe circle equation (x^2 + y^2 = r^2) for the outmost\nline (+/-90 deg long, stays a circle) and 'squeeze' it\nwith the sin of the longitude. I assume that 0 deg long\nis in the centre of the image.\n\n\nA perspective projection is not as simple because\nyou have to take distance from centre and z-value\ninto account. It's still a linear equation, though.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn 19 Feb 2009, at 05:59, Lars O.
