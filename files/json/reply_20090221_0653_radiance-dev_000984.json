{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI've changed my git repository layout a bit - if there's anybody pulling from\nit, you'll probably have to update your branches:\n\n\n1. Remove the upstream branch. It was more or less a tagged version of the\nupstream-cvs branch, there're better ways to achieve this.\n\n\n2. Rename the 'upstream-debian' branch to upstream. This just makes life more\neasy with git-buildpackage and similar tools, and is less confusing.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-February/000984.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "February 21, 2009 at 06:53AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000977", "id": "radiance-dev_000984"}
