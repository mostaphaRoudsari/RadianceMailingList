{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nGendaylit seems to spit out an uncommented line as part of the outpu:\n\n\n    gendaylit : the actual zenith radiance....\n\n\nThis results in output that cannot be run, unless a comment \"#\" is added \nin. Is there some reason for this? I have added a \"#\" in the src and \nrecompiled to remove this.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005795.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 23, 2009 at 08:32AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005760", "id": "radiance-general_005795"}
