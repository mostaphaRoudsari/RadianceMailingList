{"body": "> Finally got a reply on this.  They think it's pretty good but want \nmore on security for the type.\n\n\nHi,\n\n\ndid you only submit the hdr or also the scene description types? \nSecurity-wise, the rad-files have to be treated as scripts, as they \nallow any command to be executed from within (using the !-prefix), so I \nguess this leads to a very different classification then hdr's. Not sure \nwhat kind of nonsense an attacker could hide inside an octree though (I \ndoubt that there are any security checks in Radiance about memory \nprotection here?) - but I am just a non-developer on the wrong list, \nwithout inside-knowledge on the implementation here ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-February/000986.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
