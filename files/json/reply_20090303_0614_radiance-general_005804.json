{"body": "Hello\n\n\nI am trying to determine Daylight coefficient in a classroom using ESP-r and\nRADIANCE. I am getting a message on selecting sky type that \"not  a radiance\nskyfile\". What could be the reason for this? I have installed Gendaylit and\nincluded the link to the Gendaylit in PATH and to the Sky .cal files in\nRAYPATH. Is it some problem with gensky? What should I do about this?\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nRegards\nChandrayee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2009/2/23 Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005804.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chandrayee Basu", "created_at": "March 03, 2009 at 06:14AM", "created_by": "Chandrayee_Basu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005760", "id": "radiance-general_005804"}
