{"body": "Hi Matthew,\n\n\nI believe that the -N option of rad will start multiple instances of \nrpict, with each instance working on a different view (ie NOT parallel \nprocessing on the same view). So if the rad file that you have only has \none view then using -N 2 will not accomplish anything.\n\n\nIf your intent is to distribute one image (view) over multiple cores \nthen you will need to look into rpiece.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005806.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 03, 2009 at 06:53AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005805", "id": "radiance-general_005806"}
