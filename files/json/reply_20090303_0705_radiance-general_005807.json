So to make use of more then one CPU or core or network\nnode or whatever, you will need more then one view defined. By the way,\nI have also used ranimate for this task, which has some  extra\nfunctionality for cluster support...\n\n\nFor most cases, with modern machines, it is not worth the trouble to\ncare about distributing the rendering calculations for one view. In some\nspecial cases, where you have very complicated scenes or want to render\nin very high resolution, rpiece may be a good solution.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005807.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
