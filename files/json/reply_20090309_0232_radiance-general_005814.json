{"body": "Hi!\n> I wish to use Radiance to render a normal map of a scene. By normal map\n> I mean a floating point RGB image, where the RGB values of each pixel\n> correspond to the xyz coordinates of the surface normal in scene\n> coordinates. More precisely, for example for the red channel:\n> \n>     R = (Nx + 1)/2\n\n\nI think I'd use rtace with -oN, pipe the result to rtrace to calculate \nyour channel value, and convert the output into a radiance hdr format \nusing pvalue.\n\n\nI guess that, if you want to do all this with rpict and render the \nsurfaces \"in your scene\", you could try the glow modifier as a material \nto modify. Just as a starting point.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005814.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
