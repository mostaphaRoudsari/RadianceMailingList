{"body": "How did you measure the UV reflectance of the surfaces of your box?   \nMost paints drop off dramatically from the visible spectrum to UV.   \nWhite paints may re-emit UV as visible so they appear \"whiter\" under  \ndaylight illumination.  You really need to know the behavior of your  \npaint with respect to ultraviolet wavelengths to do this correctly.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005832.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 15, 2009 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005830", "id": "radiance-general_005832"}
