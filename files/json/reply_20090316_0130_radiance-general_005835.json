I get\n7.5/(2*pi*0.54*0.032)=7.5/0.1086=69W/m2, divided by pi=21.99 W/m2sr.\nThis means that your light source is two times brighter than I would\nexpect it to be.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005835.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
