{"body": ">\n> Also, I'm curious how you'd use LAMPCOLOR for a UV-lamp? Obviously the\n> efficacy would not be the usual 179?\nWell, it is probably not. But if you multiply the 7.5W to get the lumen\noutput, lampcolor will internally divide by 179 to calculate back to\nradiometric values, so the result should be fine (as long as you do not\nstart to multiply the results of rtrace to get anything like lux or nits\nfrom what is not visible light ;-) )...\n\n\nOne nice problem if comparing the result to experimental measurements\nwill be that the lamp's age will probably show some influence on the\nreal output. So most probably something like 7.5W*0.9 or 0.8 would be\nmore realistic. But I have NO experience with this UV stuff, so this is\nsomething to find out first.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005837.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
