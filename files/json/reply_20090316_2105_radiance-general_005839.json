{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> as 0.032m is diameter, which Lars might already know.\n\n\nWell, good point.... ;-)\n\n\nMaybe this is of help:\n\n\nhttp://www.uvequip.co.za/faq.htm\n\n\n\"Of the approximately 456 types of fluorescent lamps made all of the UV \nor Blacklight lamps make up less than 1% of the total lighting \nindustries lamp production. Therefore there is not much economic \nincentive to do research to develop low UV depreciation LW phosphors and \nlamps. The typical UV depreciation of a 4W, 6W, or 8W LW lamp might be \nas much as 40% to 50% in about 2,400 hours.\n\n\nUV SYSTEMS has just completed a scientific UV depreciation test using \none TripleBright II LW LL-60-352 lamp. From this test it was determined \nthat the UV output of that lamp depreciated to about 80% of initial \noutput (a 20% reduction) after about 7,000 hours of use. While this was \nonly a sample of one, it could be typical of all LL-60-352 lamps.\"\n\n\nAnd some more tests (you can see a set-up how to determine the \ndepreciation in this paper, too):\n\n\nhttp://www.uvsystems.com/articles/Life_SW_Filters_UV_Depreciation_Lamps.pdf\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005839.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
