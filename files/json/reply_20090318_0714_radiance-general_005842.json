{"body": "Hello Everyone,\n\n\nI am simulating to find illuminance values for different angles of \nVenetian blinds, Using Mkillum.. Do we need to consider Blinds as \npart of the Luminous plane generated by mkillum..? We are getting \nbetter results when using just a plane polygon as Luminous \nsecondary source as compared to when we include Blinds in the \nfenestration system as luminous plane. ( comparing two different \nsystems of blinds of similar angles and characteristics.)\n\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nG V Deepak\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005842.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "G V DEEPAK", "created_at": "March 18, 2009 at 07:14AM", "created_by": "G_V_DEEPAK", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002642", "id": "radiance-general_005842"}
