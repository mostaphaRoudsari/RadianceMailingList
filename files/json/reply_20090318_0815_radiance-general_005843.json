Do we need to consider Blinds as part\n> of the Luminous plane generated by mkillum..?

( comparing two different systems of blinds of similar\n> angles and characteristics.)\nIf I understand you right - are you asking wether to replace the each\nblind's surface by a mkillum-generated illum??? This makes no sense -\nyou have aluminium blinds, and no light will pass through a blind. This\nmust lead to really funny results.\n\n\nMkillum has been written to precalculate the effect of compex\nfenestration such as blinds. You calculate a light source on the inside\nof the complex fenestration using mkillum, so that during your (rpict or\nrtrace) rendering, the light source for ambient calculations is not\nobstructed. The reasons for this are explained in detail in the book\n\"Rendering with Radiance\".\n\n\nIn your case there are only two reasonable options as far as I\nunderstood so far. Either render without mkillum, but very(!!!)  high\nquality settings for ad, as, aa, ab (which will take a long time), or\nseal your complete fenestration system with mkillum-generated illum\nsurface(s) as explained in the book.\n\n\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005843.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
