You're basically \ntaking the backwards ray tracing operation away from the view plane and \nplacing it right up against the blinds to help guarantee that plenty of \nrays get through the \"nastiness\" and find those bright light sources out \nthere.  The result of that calculation is then saved as a .dat file and \nused on that virtual light source plane in the regular calculation, \ngiving much better results in less time (opposed to relying on brute \nforce with the ambient calculation).  As Lars said, there is good \ninformation on this in the RwR text.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005844.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 18, 2009 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_002642", "id": "radiance-general_005844"}
