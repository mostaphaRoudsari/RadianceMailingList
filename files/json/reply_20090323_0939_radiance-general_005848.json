{"body": "Hi Glen,\n\n\nThe -PP is used for memory sharing on a single host running multiple \nprocesses. If you have a machine with 4 cores then you will need to \nstart 4 copies of rpiece. So with something like the following:\n\n\n    rpiece -x 800 -y 800 -X 2 -Y 2 -F my_syncfile.sync <rpict options\n    including -PP my_persistfile.pp> -o myimage.unf myscene.oct\n\n\n    this command line would need to be run 4 times in order to get the 4\n    processes up and running\n\n\nThis would result in an image split into a 2 by 2 grid and spread out \nover 4 processes. The memory including the scene would be shared among \nthe 4 processes, thus reducing the memory footprint.\n\n\nThis can be automated simply using a Makefile or with other tools such \nas Perl or Python.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions and I can try to answer.\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nG HARDING wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005848.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 23, 2009 at 09:39AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005846", "id": "radiance-general_005848"}
