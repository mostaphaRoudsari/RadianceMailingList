The trick is to start\none with all the command line arguments and the others without, so that\nthey will take over from the parent process. BUT: If you have several\nframes to render, I would not care. It is much easier to render the\nframes in parallel then slicing the single images. And to render all the\nviews at one (if you have enough processors) you just call rad -N 8 (for\neight CPUs), and it will start eight images at once for you. Much\neasier, same effect.\n\n\nBesides that, if you have really lots of frames, I have an old\ndocumentation on how to use ranimate for similar stuff:\n\n\nhttp://www.larsgrobe.de/projects/radiance/ranimate_openmosix/\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005847.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
