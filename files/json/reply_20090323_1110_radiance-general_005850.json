Check the manpage\nof gensky about how to switch on the sun. Do a test using rvu, looking\nup with a fish-eye view - if you do not see the sun, there will be\nlittle contribution for direct sunlight. You can always test the output\nof gensky - if there is no light modifier defined called solar, there\nwill be no sun (which is defined as solar source sun, by the way).\n\n\n> mkillum -ab 0 -ad 1024 -av 0.1 0.1 0.1 hr.oct \"<\"\n> windowillum.rad>illumination.rad\n\n\nI think you do not want -ab 0 for mkillum. You do not calculate anything\nhere - setting the ambient parameters high, but calculating 0 bounces\n(this means nothing) is not very reasonable. If you still have your\nblinds there, run mkillum with 2, than 3 and 4, and find out if you have\nsignificant changes.\n\n\n> oconv -i hr.oct outside.rad Conv-0.rad illumination.rad>hour.oct\n> rtrace -h -I -ab 1 -ad 4096 -as 128 -av 0 0 0 \n\n\nYou should be able to reduce -ad here, a much lower value should be fine\nand give a great gain in rendering speed.\n\n\n> Let me know if there is anything wrong with this.\n\n\nDone ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005850.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
