So while overriding these calculated values using b, B, r or R \nmay be the way to improve results for a given location, the value given \nby gensky is not really unspecified. At least I would hope so... ;-)\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.seris.sg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005853.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
