{"body": "Hi Sung,\n\n\nTry adding the following parameters to your rtrace command:\n\n\n\t-dj .7 -dt 0\n\n\nHow sure are you of your surface reflectances?  Did you actually  \nmeasure the lamp output, or are you assuming the manufacturer's lumen  \nspecification is correct?  How far off are your values?\n\n\nSince you notice the most errors near to the lamp and at low angles,  \nit's possible that the Fresnel effects are important.  The emission  \nof the fluorescent phosphor may be considered diffuse, but the actual  \noutput of the lamp will be a function of angle due to Fresnel  \nreflection of the glass bulb.  You can account for this  \n(approximately) by applying the \"winxmit.cal\" function included with  \nRadiance, like so:\n\n\nvoid brightfunc Fresnel_effect\n2 winxmit winxmit.cal\n0\n0\n\n\nFresnel_effect light lamp_light\n0\n0\n3 X X X\n\n\nlamp_light cylinder fluorescent_tube\n(etc...)\n\n\nI think you get the idea.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005863.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 01, 2009 at 11:35AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005862", "id": "radiance-general_005863"}
