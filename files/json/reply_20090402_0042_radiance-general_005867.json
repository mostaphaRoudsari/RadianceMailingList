{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your advice and I just tried as you said but actually the\nresults were not improved as following link.\n\n\n*http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/xe/?document_srl=346*\n\n\nThat might be so because the lamp is actually UV lamp but as you know, there\nis almost no difference between flourescent and UV lamps besides with or\nwithout phosphor coating on the surface of lamp. Nevertheless,\nI thought the absence of phosphor coating could cause some differences on\nthe diffuse of UV including the Fresnel effects. I'm finding some references\non the diffuse of UV lamps.\nThe reflectances were referred to a japanese paper which had done\nexperiements with UV and the UV output of lamp was referred to the\nmanufacturer's specification but the UV intensities at 1 m distance is\nalmost the same.\n\n\n Additionally, I'm checking the UV sensor but as it also follows cosine law\nas illuminance sensors do, there might be no problem with UV sensor.\n\n\nSung\n\n\nMessage: 4\nDate: Wed, 1 Apr 2009 11:35:14 -0700\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005867.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Minki Sung", "created_at": "April 02, 2009 at 12:42AM", "created_by": "Minki_Sung", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005862", "id": "radiance-general_005867"}
