{"body": "Hi Vincent,\n\n\nif I would not know the difficulties to get a copy of it, I would ask\nyou to first browse through the book \"Rendering with Radiance\". If you\nhave access to it, this is the way to start. If not, I would advice you\nto go through through the documentation done by Axel Jacobs (he made up\ntwo great tutorials, if you cannot find the link I can look through my\nbookmarks), which is available as pdf. After reading a bit, the first\nthing you will understand is that actually the output you get from\nradiance IS radiance (or irradiance which is most probably what you\nneed) as long as you do not convert it into photopic units. The easiest\nway to divide the irradiance into diffuse and directed I could think of\nwould be to do a rendering with sun and sky and ambient calculation and\nthen substract the resulting pixel values of a rendering of only the sun\nwith ambient bounces = 0 (which is the direct component).\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005874.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
