{"body": "Hi Sung,\n\n\nI'm not exactly sure what we are looking at with these plots, but  \nit's clear that you need to characterize the sensor response in order  \nto understand the situation.  Did  you perform the cosine sensitivity  \nexperiment I suggested?  You could mask off a portion of the center  \nof a tube if you don't have a small UV source, and see how the sensor  \nresponds as a function of incident angle at a fixed distance.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005876.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 05, 2009 at 07:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005862", "id": "radiance-general_005876"}
