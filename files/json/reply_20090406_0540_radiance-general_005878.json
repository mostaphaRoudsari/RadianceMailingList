{"body": "Yes, I checked cosine sensitivity but the results showed that UV sensor did\nnot calibrated by cosine law. I have two UV sensors made by different maker,\nbut both showed almost same responses to incident angle. I am going to ask\nthe maker on this problem and I think the UV sensors might not cosine\ncalibarated with UV.\n\n\nhttp://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test05.gif  Fraction of value in 0 degree\nhttp://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test06.gif  Fraction divided by cosine\n\n\n\n\nDear Lars,\nI think UV sensors would be calibarated to reponse according to cosine\nlaw. It can be controlled with geometry of sensor body and diffuser plate\nattached on the receptor and I think it shoud be as shown in figure\ntest06.gif (FL, illuminance sensors). I used UV sensor body sending electric\nsignal to datalogger and the datalogger convert the signal to UV intensity\naccording to calibration curve as usual photosensors.\n\n\nSung\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005878.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Minki Sung", "created_at": "April 06, 2009 at 05:40AM", "created_by": "Minki_Sung", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005862", "id": "radiance-general_005878"}
