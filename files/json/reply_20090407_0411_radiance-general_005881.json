The most useful way would be \nfalsecolor images. As falsecolor by default multiplies pixel values by \n179 to get from radiometric to photometric units, you must tell it to \nuse a multiplier of 1 instead of 179. Than, you most probably have to \nset the scale in a way that you see the irradiances in your image. One \nexample, using a scale of 0-5000 and the multiplier 1 (to avoid the \nconversion to lx) would be like this:\n\n\nfalsecolor -i input.hdr -m 1 -s 5000 -l \"Watts/m2\" > output.hdr\n\n\n> As well, in order to perform irradiation analysis a sky generated \n> following the perez-all weather model would be more accurate than just \n> using the standardCIE skies supported by gensky.
