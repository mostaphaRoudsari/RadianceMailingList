Most probably something is wrong with your \nRadiance installation, the most common origin of all trouble are PATH \nand RAYPATH settings not pointing to the right directories. But here we \nhit a point that I cannot really help you - I have zero experience with \nRadiance on Windows, and usually it is guaranteed 100% more pain for \ndoing the same.
