{"body": "Giovanni, right-click on My Computer, select Properties, go to the\nAdvanced tab, click the Environment Variables button near the bottom.

I can't even find those files in my radiance\ninstallation!!\nThanks anyway!\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars O. Grobe\nSent: 07 April 2009 12:54\n\n\n\n\nThe same command works here. Most probably something is wrong with your\nRadiance installation, the most common origin of all trouble are PATH\nand RAYPATH settings not pointing to the right directories. But here we\nhit a point that I cannot really help you - I have zero experience with\nRadiance on Windows, and usually it is guaranteed 100% more pain for\ndoing the same. Can you check your installation?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005886.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 07, 2009 at 07:41AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005880", "id": "radiance-general_005886"}
