Details on Rayfront are located here:\n\n\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/\n\n\nSchorsch? Any chance of spinning that off into a separate \npurchase/download (or updating RF to work on newer versions of AutoCAD)?\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005889.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 07, 2009 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005880", "id": "radiance-general_005889"}
