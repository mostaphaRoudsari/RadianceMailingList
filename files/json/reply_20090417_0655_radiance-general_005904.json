{"body": "Hi Valeria,\n\n\nI suppose it depends a lot on what the film does and if data is \navailable. You might want to take a look at Optics 5 from LBL as a \nstarting point. It is possible if the data is in the database that you \ncould build up an insulating unit and export the relevant information to \nRadiance. You could then look at using either the optics2rad or the \nglaze script to generate a valid radiance material description.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nValeria De Giuli wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005904.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 17, 2009 at 06:55AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005903", "id": "radiance-general_005904"}
