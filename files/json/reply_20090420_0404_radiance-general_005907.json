{"body": "I converted that model to a radiance dome, i usually work with radiance \nwith aesthetical purposes so i'm not sure it's phisically accurate, it \nmisses the atmosferic effects because, as Lars said, i think it's \nnecesary to modify radiance code. I did it as part of a 3dsmax exporter \nto rad i'm working with.\nI got the main sources some time ago from a web page of the University \nof Girona in Spain (sir project), i think they created the sources based \non some code related to the paper, i've returned to search for the \nproject again but i haven't found it on the internet.\n\n\nIt's a windows .exe file, the program creates three data files with \nradiance colordata and outputs a radfile with the definitions of the sun \nand the sky and a white box to avoid radiance no objects error, it uses \na calc file ssky.cal to map the data to the dome, the parameters are\n\n\n                 lat Latitude (0-360)\n                 long Longitude (-90,90) south to north\n                 sm  Standard Meridian\n                 jd  Julian Day (1-365)\n                 tod Time Of Day (0.0,23.99) 14.25 = 2:15PM\n                 turb  Turbidity (1.0,30+) 2-6 are most useful for clear \ndays.\n\n\ngesky3 lat long sm jd tod turb (gesky 43 3 3 180 10 6 >ssky.rad)\n\n\nyou can download: www.aisarquitectura.com/archivos/ssky.zip\n\n\nWhen i got it there were some code missing and i could not compile it as \nit was so i modified it, but not to distribute because i don't know the \nprotocols to add new code (comments, licenses ...), so i can send the \nsource code to anyone who is interested in cleanning it or somebody \ncould try to help me in make it better\n\n\nIgnacio Munarriz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinhart, Christoph escribi\u00f3:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005907.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Munarriz", "created_at": "April 20, 2009 at 04:04AM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Munarriz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005898", "id": "radiance-general_005907"}
