My guess is that the  \nsteeper slat angles are letting some direct sun to strike your sensor  \npoints close to the window. Check the slat spacing, and the blind  \nsection overall.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005911.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 22, 2009 at 07:15PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005909", "id": "radiance-general_005911"}
