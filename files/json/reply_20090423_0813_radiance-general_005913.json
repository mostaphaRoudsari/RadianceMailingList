It does not really work on our side.\n\n\nBoth a folder and a file have been created.\nBut the folder is empty and the file just has a short header with  \nthree lines:\n#rhino2rad;  ;#Materials:;  ;Geometry:\n\n\nIs there something wrong with our system or do we have a wrong rhino  \nversion (engl. 4.0 evaluation)?\n\n\nThank you for a short answer...\n\n\nArne\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005913.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Arne Huelsmann", "created_at": "April 23, 2009 at 08:13AM", "created_by": "Arne_Huelsmann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005767", "id": "radiance-general_005913"}
