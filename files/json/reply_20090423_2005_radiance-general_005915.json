{"body": "Arne and Christoph,\n\n\nI didn't expect something I pretty much threw together to get at all\npopular, rather a good-enough tool when the circumstances came about.\n\n\nI'll take a more careful eye to it this weekend, especially with respect to\nreliability.\n\n\nThank you for the feedback, I do appreciate it. Always feel free to contact\nme off-list about your issues with it.\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005915.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Smith", "created_at": "April 23, 2009 at 08:05PM", "created_by": "David_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005767", "id": "radiance-general_005915"}
