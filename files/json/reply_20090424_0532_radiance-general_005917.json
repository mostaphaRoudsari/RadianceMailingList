{"body": "Thanks Mr Gulielmetti,\n\n\nYes its for single time and sun angle , we were trying sample \nsimulations for 10, 11 am and 12 noon. I am getting these weird \nresults. I have checked the geometry a number of times as well as \nall the parameters, these results seem very strange. any \nparticular reason..?\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nOn Wed Apr 22 22:15:37 EDT 2009, Rob Guglielmetti \n<rpg at rumblestrip.org> wrote:\n\n\n> On Apr 22, 2009, at 7:42 PM, G V DEEPAK wrote:\n>> The illuminance values for the blind angles of 0 degrees and 45  \n>> degrees seem to be fine.\n>> However,  I am getting very high illuminance values for the 15  \n>> degree and 30 degree blind angles for the sensor point which is  \n>> closest to the window .\n>> The values are ranging from 8000 lux to 20,000 lux. which I \n>> guess  are totally unreasonable results when we have blinds \n>> placed in a room.\n>> \n>> These values are higher for the blind angles of 15 degrees and \n>> 30  degrees than for the completely open blinds (zero blind \n>> angle gives  us illuminance of 2500 lx).\n>> \n>> Any idea why we are getting these high illuminance values for 15 \n>> and  30 degree blind angles?\n> \n> Is this for a single time of day/sun angle?
