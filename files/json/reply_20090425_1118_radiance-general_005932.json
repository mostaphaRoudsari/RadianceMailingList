{"body": "Hi Ren,\n\n\nI see nothing wrong with your command that I can see.  I would  \nsuspect something with your scene file, except if oconv ran OK then  \nyour scene must be alright.  It does seem likely that something is  \nwrong with the X11 connection, but it's impossible to debug from here  \nwith no error messages or symptoms.  You can kill rvu with ^\\ to get  \nit to dump a core file (if enabled) and find out where it's stuck  \nthat way, but you have to know something about programming and your  \nsystem configuration.  I know the former but not the latter, and I  \ndon't have access to your machine.  This is not a common problem.   \nIt's the first I've heard of it.\n\n\nAnyone else have suggestions?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005932.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2009 at 11:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005926", "id": "radiance-general_005932"}
