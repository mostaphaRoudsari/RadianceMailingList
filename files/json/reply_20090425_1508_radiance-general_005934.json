{"body": "Sounds like an incompatibility with the X11 server.  This is the  \nsecond such report we've seen this week, though the symptoms are  \ndifferent.  Check the thread entitled \"fatal XIO - newbie\" to see if  \nthere are any useful hints there.  Otherwise, we'll just have to wait  \nto hear from others with more experience about similar problems.   \nWhat is your exact system configuration?  It could be something as  \nsimple as missing fonts.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005934.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2009 at 03:08PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005926", "id": "radiance-general_005934"}
