{"body": "Hi Marina,\n\n\n1.glazing geometry\n\n\nAlways define glazing object as a polygon, no matter how many layers of\nglass it contains in real world.\nDouble clear, laminated and other glazings differ only in BRTDfunc (light\ntransmittance and reflectance distribution function), while real glazing\nwidth is not important here.\n\n\nNote that polygon face should be oriented  towards building interior.\n\n\n##########\n2.glazing material\nSince BRTD function for double glazing is different then for single glazing,\nI don't suggest  using of simple glass material.\nProcedure we use is next:\n*Measure each glass layer transmittance and reflectance data. If you can\nmeasure their r,g,b components it is good, if not use the same value for all\n3 components.\nor\n*Export from IGDB (using Optics5 I suppose), each layer separately. And\nwrite down transmittances/reflectances you have in BRTD functions.\nNote that in Optics5 front side of the glazing is towards outside, so their\nfront and Radiance \"front\" are different.\n\n\nSo you should have next parameters for double glazing parameters after\nmeasures or after export:\nrf1 - interior pane front reflectance (towards the room)\nrb1 - interior pane back reflectance (towards the exterior pane)\nrf2 - exterior pane front reflectance (towards the interior pane)\nrb2 - exterior pane back reflectance (towards the exterior)\nt1 - interior pane transmittance\nt2- exterior pane transmittance\nr,g,b - red, green and blue color components\n*For clear glass layers front and back reflectance are always the same\n*\nvoid BRTDfunc double_glazing\n10\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_g),ft(t1_g),fr(rf2_g)),cr(fr(rb2_g),ft(t2_g),fr(rb1_g)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_b),ft(t1_b),fr(rf2_b)),cr(fr(rb2_b),ft(t2_b),fr(rb1_b)))\nft(t1_r)*ft(t2_r)\nft(t1_g)*ft(t2_g)\nft(t1_b)*ft(t2_b)\n        0 0 0\n        glaze2.cal\n0\n9\n        0 0 0\n        0 0 0\n        0 0 0\n*\n\n\nIn glazing definition function\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))\nmeans:\n-if light is incident to the front side of the glazing then reflectance is\ncr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r))\n-else (light is incident to the back side) reflectance is\ncr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r))\n\n\nFunctions for double glazing reflectance and transmittance are defined\nin *glaze2.cal\n*script which is provided with Radiance:\n-cr(refl1, trans,refl2) - is reflectance distribution for double glazing as\nfunction of light incident angle.  refl1 is reflectance of first glazing\npane, refl2 of the second one, and tran1 is transmittance of the first\nglazing pane\n-ft(t) - transmittance distribution for single glazing as function of light\nincident angle. For double glazing total transmittance is ft(t1)*ft(t2)\n\n\nHope this helps,\nMarija\nDe Luminae <http://www.deluminaelab.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005944.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "April 29, 2009 at 07:56AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005942", "id": "radiance-general_005944"}
