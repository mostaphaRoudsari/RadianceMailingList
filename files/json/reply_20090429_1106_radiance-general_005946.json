{"body": "This seems to make some sense. Anyone have a guess of whether it would\nbe more productive to set -dt 0 or -dc 1 in order to ensure no sources\nare missed? In the man page those two settings seem to lead to avoidance\nof estimations in the direct calculation.\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Behalf Of Andrew McNeil\nSent: Wednesday, April 29, 2009 1:36 PM\n\n\nI'm going out on a limb here but I'd suggest looking at -dt and -dc\nparameters.\n\n\nIt could be that direct source testing stops earlier than you'd like for\nunobstructed surfaces.  I expect that a scene with ~4000 suns should\nhave higher parameters for direct sampling anyway.  \n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005946.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 29, 2009 at 11:06AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005939", "id": "radiance-general_005946"}
