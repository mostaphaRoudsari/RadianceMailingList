{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI just got your earlier e-mail, which you sent to my greg at anyhere.com  \naccount.  I'm not checking that account regularly, as the server  \nseems to have been claimed by a spambot and 99% of the e-mails on  \nthere are now viagra offers.\n\n\nThe paper is fortunately archived on the RwR CD-ROM, and I'm  \nconverting it to PDF for the website.  I'll let you know when it's  \nready.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005950.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 29, 2009 at 04:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005949", "id": "radiance-general_005950"}
