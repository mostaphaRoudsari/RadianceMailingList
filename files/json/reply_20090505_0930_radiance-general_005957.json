{"body": "Hi Marina,\n\n\nLooks about right to me -- does it reproduce the combined  \ntransmittance and reflectance you're measuring?  Are the interfaces  \nseparated by an air gap, or are some/all layers laminated with an  \noptical adhesive?  In the latter case, the functions in glaze2.cal  \nwon't compute the correct combined transmittance and reflectances.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005957.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 05, 2009 at 09:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005954", "id": "radiance-general_005957"}
