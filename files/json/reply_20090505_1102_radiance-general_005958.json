{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nfirst of all, there is a mistake in my previous mail. I wanted to say\n< and I cannot get its description from Optics5.>\n\n\nIt is the latter case:\noutside the laminate (glass pane + optical adhesive coating +... +\ninterlayer + ... + adhesive coating + glass) then the air gap and the\ninside that is a float glass.\n(It is a switchable glass in a double glazing)\n\n\nHow can I then describe this glasses?\n\n\n(I have the possibility to measure the double glazing or the different\nlayers separately)\nJust a naive idea that could helps:\n\n\nIf the combined R and T are the ones resulting from the hole double\nglazing which could be measured in the spectrometer if I measure the\ncomplete double glass and not the separated layers:\n\n\nTotal Reflectance front\nTotal Reflectance back\nTotal Transmitance\n\n\nCould be with this data a way to describe them?\n\n\n\n\nMarina\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005958.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "marina aviles olmos", "created_at": "May 05, 2009 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "marina_aviles_olmos", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005954", "id": "radiance-general_005958"}
