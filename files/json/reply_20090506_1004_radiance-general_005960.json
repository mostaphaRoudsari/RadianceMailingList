{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks.\n\n\nWhat I actually try to do in a part of my current research is a\ncomparative study of the daylight efficiency of different glass systems\nand some of this glasses are switchable, so thanks the link.\n>From your answer, I guess that the glaze2.cal is not the exact script to\nthis ones although the results will be quite accurate.\n\n\nThe method that Jack describes has some points that I can understand at\nthe moment, so I have tried (for the moment) the first method:\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc double_glazing_a\n10\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.075),ft(0.831),fr(0.153)),cr(fr(0.188),ft(0.158),fr(0.075)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.075),ft(0.899),fr(0.134)),cr(fr(0.150),ft(0.215),fr(0.082)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.083),ft(0.88),fr(0.141)),cr(fr(0.150),ft(0.195),fr(0.083)))\nft(0.831)*ft(0.158)\nft(0.899)*ft(0.215)\nft(0.88)*ft(0.195)\n0 0 0\nglaze2.cal\n\n\n0\n9\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nand the results looks like right, but just to be sure:\n\n\nthe descrition of:\n\n\nmod glass id\n0\n0\n3 rtn gtn btn\n\n\nis not included in this cases of double glazing. Is it right?\nand, it is only included, I guess after your mails, only in monolitic\nnot double glazings, isn't it?\n\n\n\n\nMarina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005960.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "marina aviles olmos", "created_at": "May 06, 2009 at 10:04AM", "created_by": "marina_aviles_olmos", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005954", "id": "radiance-general_005960"}
