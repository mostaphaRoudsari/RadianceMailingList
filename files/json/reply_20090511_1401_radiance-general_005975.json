{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nWhy is your description missing the \"glass\" descriptor Optics usually  \nproduces?  The optics2rad script is a bit fragile to such  \noversights.  Maybe you just took it out for brevity.\n\n\nIn any case, the optics2rad script doesn't like underscores in names  \nany better than it likes Spaces.  The only underscore you can have is  \nbefore the final \"_glass\", \"_front\" or \"_back\".  The issue is not  \nwith Radiance but with the rcalc program, which looks for the end of  \nthe name by searching for an underscore.  Not much way around it, I'm  \nafraid.  All three names need to be identical as well, e.g.:\n\n\nvoid glass SB60-Starphire-8_glass\n0\n0\n3 .95 .95 .95\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    SB60-Starphire-8_front\n10\n       0.050     0.057     0.073\n       0.795     0.815     0.777\n       0 0 0\n       .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    SB60-Starphire-8_back\n10\n       0.044     0.051     0.037\n       0.795     0.815     0.777\n       0 0 0\n       .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005975.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 11, 2009 at 02:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005968", "id": "radiance-general_005975"}
