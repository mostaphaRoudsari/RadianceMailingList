{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nGood glad it worked. It actually only just occurred to me that this \nmight be a way to get a well formated radiance description that rcalc \nwould be happy with. As Greg mentioned optics2rad calls on rcalc to do \nmost of the work. Rcalc is very sensitive to the input format that it \nexpects, unfortunately this can be a bit difficult to track down. Note I \ndid also do an export of some dummy data from optics5 and this went into \noptics2rad without any problem. So it may be that if you are using some \nintermediate script in your process that it is somehow munging the \nformat along the way. One simple thing to check for is if you have a \ncarriage return at the last line of the input file that your script is \ngenerating or outputing for optics2rad processing.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005979.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 11, 2009 at 03:53PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005968", "id": "radiance-general_005979"}
