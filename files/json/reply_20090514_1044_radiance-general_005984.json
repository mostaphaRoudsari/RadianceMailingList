{"body": "Hi Christoph,\n\n\nWe've had pretty good success using the Sigma 4.5mm fisheye on a Nikon  \nD40.   The images do need to be calibrated for which we use a Minolta  \nCS-100a luminance meter.  We found the latter on E-Bay for a fraction  \nof the price of a new one.  A colleague has a Nikon Coolpix P-1 point  \nand shoot which seems to be spot on, needing no calibration  (perhaps  \nbecause Greg has the same camera?:)).\n\n\nChris\nChristian Humann ~ Associate\nLOISOS + UBBELOHDE\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwww.coolshadow.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005984.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "May 14, 2009 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005982", "id": "radiance-general_005984"}
