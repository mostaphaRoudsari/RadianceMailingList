{"body": "Hi Apipam,\n\n\nI have no experience with the EOS 450D, but I tested the Canon EOS350D\ntogether with Photosphere and it performed well with respect to luminance\nestimation. See\n\n\n\"Accuracy of Luminance Maps Obtained from High Dynamic Range Images\" in the\nIESNA journal Leukos Vol 4 No 2, Oct 2007, pp. 99-112.\n\n\nThe typical RMSE for colors with low chroma is around 11%, depending on what\ngray card you pick (I recommend Munsell N6). The Nikon Coolpix 5400 with a\nCCD sensor used to have 20%. The luminance of saturated colors cannot be\nestimated. Polychromatic LED illumination is also not suited, but broad\ncontinuous spectra should be ok.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nMartin Moeck\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-May/000216.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Moeck", "created_at": "May 14, 2009 at 10:12PM", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck", "parent_id": "hdri_000211", "id": "hdri_000216"}
