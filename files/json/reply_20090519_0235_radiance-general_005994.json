{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nI want to be able to test the daylight and sun penetration in the mall space\nduring different sky conditions eg 9am 12pm 3pm sunny sky and also an\novercast sky. So in hindsight I should've used the CIE overcast. However,\nwhen I simulate with sunny sky conditions I get the same resolution and\nrendering problems.\n\n\nAny more thoughts?\n\n\nPaul.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005994.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Chilton", "created_at": "May 19, 2009 at 02:35AM", "created_by": "Paul_Chilton", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005989", "id": "radiance-general_005994"}
