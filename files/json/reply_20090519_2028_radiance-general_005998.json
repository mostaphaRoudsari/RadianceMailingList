{"body": "Hi Paul!\n\n\nI do not have much time right now, so only a short answer.\n\n\nThe fact that you still see the direct sun hit inside surfaces is \nexpected. The illum surface just replaces the indirect component (the \nbackground sky and outside reflections), not the direct light, for which \nit appears to be transparent or as the secondary modifiert you use it with.\n\n\nIf you want to see whether everything is fine, generate the mkillum \nsources with a sky without direct sun.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nLars.\n\n\nLars O.
