Are you asking about the validity  \nof things such as mkillum in a predictive lighting calculation?  \nBecause mkillum is most definitely a physically-based approach. As  \nwith any simulation method, the user and his or her assumptions factor  \ninto the equation, but using mkillum to essentially bring the direct  \ncalculation closer to the surfaces of interest, when properly used, is  \nmost definitely a valid procedure.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006003.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 20, 2009 at 08:40PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006002", "id": "radiance-general_006003"}
