{"body": "There is actually a Daysim forum that can be found in Google Groups. You\ncan probably get more advanced advice there, and the software authors\ntrack that message board. I'll give some general comments:\n\n\nFirst, take a look at the tutorial which may answer your questions\nbetter than I can\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim/docs/DaysimTutoria\nl.pdf\n\n\n1. I'd recommend giving an example of the error you found to the Google\nGroup for review so it's more clear what the problem is.\n\n\n2. I believe Daysim assumes that any time a daylight value over a\ncertain threshhold occurs that the user would draw the shades blinds and\ncut the daylight value by an assumed percentage. If you're sure that\nthere will not be any shades there should be a \"no blinds\" option. \n\n\n3. The user behavior for active or passive use (or mix) basically\nguesses whether occupants will actively raise blinds when glare is no\nlonger present or will be passive and leave them closed most of the day.\nI assume it's similar for user behavior with respect to switching of\nlights, but I'm not sure if that's based on daylight or occupancy.\n\n\nThe Lighting and shading controls should relate to any automated control\nsystem for the blinds or electric lights.\n\n\n4. Good question for the Daysim Google Group.\n\n\n5. If you set a particular work plane sensor I believe it will predict\nenergy on that one particular sensor instead of some other behavior, but\ncheck the tutorial for better explanation.\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006008.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 21, 2009 at 07:12AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006005", "id": "radiance-general_006008"}
