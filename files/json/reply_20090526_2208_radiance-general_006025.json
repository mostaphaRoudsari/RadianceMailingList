In this case you can use the glow material for your lights  \n(with a small radius, see the docs) to affect a visual context as you  \nare looking for without exacting a huge penalty on the render time.\n\n\n>\n> Is there a way in Radiance to make a planer object emit a certain  \n> amount of uniform light?\n>\n\n\nYep, the glow is the material you want for this. I have used it  \ninfrequently but I believe this is exactly what you need to get these  \nrenderings looking good and completing in reasonable timeframes.\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006025.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 26, 2009 at 10:08PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005989", "id": "radiance-general_006025"}
