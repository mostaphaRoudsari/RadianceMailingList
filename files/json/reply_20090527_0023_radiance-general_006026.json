{"body": "Hey Andrew,\n\n\nThank you for your help. I actually tried that after posting the message yesterday and it worked well. I got daylight factor equal to zero and a nice picture. \n\n\nI am hoping to illustrate DF=0 with a black color instead of purple. Can I change the puple color (DF=0) to black and how can this be done?\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Haugaard,\n\n\n\u00a0Den tirs 26/5/09 skrev Andrew McNeil <andrew.mcneil at arup.com>:\n\n\nFra: Andrew McNeil <andrew.mcneil at arup.com>\nEmne: Re: [Radiance-general] DF for a polygon\nTil: perhaugaard at yahoo.dk, \"Radiance general discussion\" <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nDato: tirsdag 26. maj 2009 17.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe: [Radiance-general] DF for a polygon\nYes, your errors are most likely resulting from deleting some of rtrace points. \u00a0Rtrace is expecting 4351*3000 points and is getting fewer, hence the unexpected end of file error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the rtrace manual page: \u201cIf the direction vector is (0,0,0), a bogus record is printed...\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Instead of deleting you could change the vector to \u20180 0 0\u2019 and then the area outside of your polygon would be comprised of bogus records (zeros). \u00a0\u00a0This method might not work if you are expecting legitimate zeros in your output.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006026.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Per Haugaard", "created_at": "May 27, 2009 at 12:23AM", "created_by": "Per_Haugaard", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006020", "id": "radiance-general_006026"}
