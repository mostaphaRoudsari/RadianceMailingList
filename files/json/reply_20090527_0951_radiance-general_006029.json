{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nA falsecolor scale that colors zero as black is actually very useful.  I\noften use pcompos and image masks to achieve the same effect.  A second\nversion of falsecolor modified as you suggested is a major convenience for\nme.  Thanks!\n\n\nIf others agree that it is useful, maybe it can be incorporated in\nfalsecolor as an alternate color scale (similar to the -spec option)?\n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 5/27/09 8:37 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gward at lmi.net> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006029.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 27, 2009 at 09:51AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006020", "id": "radiance-general_006029"}
