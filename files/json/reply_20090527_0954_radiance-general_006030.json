{"body": "Chien,\n\n\nIES's Virtual Environment is a software suite for MEP / Building Services\nengineers. It offers things like energy modeling, thermal load analysis,\nCFD, and analysis tools of that sort. One of the modules is called\nRadianceIES, which translates the model in VE to Radiance geometry and calls\nDesktop Radiance.\n\n\nYou can set most of the switches, pick sky types, apply materials, set\npatterns on the materials, set camera views, and add luminaires.\n\n\nMore information is here:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop5/2006_Radiance_Workshop/Presentations/DonStearn.pdf\n\n\nHonestly, if you know what you're doing, there aren't many things you can't\ndo with it that you would be able to do interfacing with Radiance directly,\nbut I'll try to hit a few:\n\n\nVE is set up as a walled garden, performing the tasks for you in the\nbackground. This can be troublesome if something goes wrong, and you're\ntrying to retrace where the problem is. Also along these lines, they don't\nallow for scripting within VE, nor an API to script from the outside, so you\ncan't do fancier things like multiple iterations of geometry, data\nmanipulation, or things of that nature. Another thing is that the models are\ncatered toward the thermal modeling, so they are mostly massing geometry.\nFor more complex geometry, you either have to have generated it separately\n(an external RAD file) or brought the model through something like Sketchup,\nin which case I'd recommend su2rad instead. As I recall, sensor points are\nlimited to one per room, so you cannot generate a grid of values.\n\n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of the intensely hierarchical nature of VE, there\nare some settings which are 5, 6, 7 windows deep, but I gather you're used\nto this through the thermal/energy modeling bits of the software. All that\nsaid, version 6 is being released in a month or so, maybe there will be a\ndifferent song to be sung then.\n\n\n--Dave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006030.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Smith", "created_at": "May 27, 2009 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "David_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005986", "id": "radiance-general_006030"}
