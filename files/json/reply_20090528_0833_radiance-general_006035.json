The cool thing\nabout Radiance is you never will know everything about it.\n\n\nWhat we really need is some kind of program to re-orient normals based on\nsome point. I thought I had an old AutoLISP routine that did that, but\nman, that is long since gone from my backups (both the DVD kind and the\ngrey matter kind)!\n\n\n> In Autocad (for example) 3dfaces that\n> are built in a clockwise manner will have the normal pointing out of\n> the clockwise face (I hope I am remembering this correctly).\n\n\nIt's hard to tell from your description if you are or not. Think of it\nthis way: let's say you are drawing a polygon that represents the face\n(screen)  of the computer monitor you are now staring at. If you draw the\npoints in a clockwise fashion, the surface normal will be pointing away\nfrom you (out the back of the monitor). If you define it with points in a\nCOUNTER-clockwise fashion, the polygon's surface normal will be pointing\nat you. IOW, in the first example, with a glow applied, the monitor face\nwould render black. In the latter example, the monitor face would glow.\n\n\nThis can be reinforced by a permutation of the so-called \"right hand\nrule\". Take your right hand and point at your face with your thumb, and\nthen curve your fingers around the axis defined by your thumb; if you\nimagine your fingers pointing in the direction of rotation (and direction\nof point creation), your thumb describes the surface normal (vector).\n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006035.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 28, 2009 at 08:33AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005989", "id": "radiance-general_006035"}
