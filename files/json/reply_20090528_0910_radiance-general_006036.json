I knew I should have gone and \nactually checked.... Another way to consider this, if you are working in \nthe XY plane (Autocad based example here) then counter clockwise gets \nyou a normal point in positive Z.\n\n\nOf course this really applies to surface generated geometry. Solid \nmodeling will bring its own set of issues with geometry management....\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006036.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 28, 2009 at 09:10AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_005989", "id": "radiance-general_006036"}
