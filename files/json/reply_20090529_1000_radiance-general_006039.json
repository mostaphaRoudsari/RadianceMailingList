{"body": "Hi Alex,\n\n\nUnless you are concerned about how the surfaces look to a human  \nobserver, there's little sense in modeling a 300K blackbody as a  \ncolor.  You are better off treating total radiance, using identical  \nRGB intensities and reflectances throughout, and just considering the  \nenergy transfer.\n\n\nThe main problem with Radiance as an IR engine is that it doesn't  \nconsider the ambient temperature and radiation of all surfaces --  \nonly light sources and reflections thereof.  Some people have fudged  \nthis by considering a surfaces absorption and re-radiation as a kind  \nof diffuse reflection, but this is a poor approximation for 300K,  \nwhich is just above room temperature.  It only works when there is  \none high-temperature surface acting as a heat source.\n\n\nBottom line:  I don't think Radiance is well-suited to your problem.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  The cct_x(t) and cct_y(t) functions in blackbody.cal are also  \nnot reliable for such low temperatures -- it's meant for visible  \nblackbodies.  300K is in the far infrared.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006039.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 29, 2009 at 10:00AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006033", "id": "radiance-general_006039"}
