{"body": "Hi Kai,\n\n\nIs the 20,000 lux measured at the source or at the receiving surface?\n\n\nYou are best off using the \"source\" type with a 1.5-degree solid  \nangle, even though your source is not infinitely distant.  Do you  \ncare very much about the fall-off at the edges of your model?  You  \ncould create an aperture that passes the infinitely distant source --  \nessentially a large opaque ring with a 70 cm hole in the appropriate  \nplace.  Does the behavior of the light source have to precisely  \nmatch, or is an approximation such as this good enough?\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 29, 2009 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006038", "id": "radiance-general_006043"}
