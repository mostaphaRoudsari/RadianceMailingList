{"body": "Hi Greg,\nthanks a lot for answer. That's exactly the solution I was looking for. \nI don't care to much about the fall-off at the edges of my model.

Do you care very \nmuch about the fall-off at the edges of your model?  You could create an \naperture that passes the infinitely distant source -- essentially a \nlarge opaque ring with a 70 cm hole in the appropriate place.  Does the \nbehavior of the light source have to precisely match, or is an \napproximation such as this good enough?\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006045.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kai Babetzki", "created_at": "May 29, 2009 at 01:25PM", "created_by": "Kai_Babetzki", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006038", "id": "radiance-general_006045"}
