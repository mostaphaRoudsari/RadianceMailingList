{"body": "low teck approach, just command line:\nI would just generate a mask with photoshop, an image with just white  \nand black pixels, but in RGB.\nconvert it to tiff and then to pic    (ra_tiff -r ).\nuse pcomb with image 1 and image 2 and write an expression that takes  \nvalue of pixels in your HDR only if they are inside of the mask, all  \nthe others null (basically multiply image 1 by image 2, check that the  \nmask contains 0 and 1 only!).\nuse pvalue on the filtered image and convert to numbers\nuse total and get the sum of all data from filtered image, TL\ncount the white pixels in the mask (pvalue and total for example), TN\nTL/TN = average luminance within the mask\n....\nthe whole thing can be written in a script.\nand perhaps also put together with a nice sequence of pipes.\nG\n\n\n\n\nOn 1 Jun 2009, at 21:29, Roberto Rodriguez wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-June/000220.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giulio", "created_at": "June 01, 2009 at 02:18PM", "created_by": "Giulio", "parent_id": "hdri_000219", "id": "hdri_000220"}
