{"body": "Hi Roberto,\n\n\nRadiance is open source and is available at www.radiance-online.org. The \nprogram \"ximage\" is part of the Radiance tool set. Rather than hacking \nximage source code there may be other ways to calculate the average \nluminances that want. For example it is possible to read in values from \nan image on a per pixel basis, depending on what you are trying to \naccomplish this could be coupled with an image mask to sample only \nselected pixels.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\nRoberto Rodriguez wrote:\n> I\u00b4m a PhD student from Argentina, member of a research team advocated to\n> the study of natural lighting.
