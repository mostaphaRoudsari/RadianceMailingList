Sum up all the values and divide by the number\nof pixels and you have your average.\n\n\nIf you can't calculate those pixel coordinates easily you can\ncreate a black and white mask to isolate the area of interest.\nYou would then combine the mask and your picture, get the sum\nof all pixels in the image but divide by the number of pixels\nthat are not zero (black).\n\n\n> How can we overcome this?

You can find\nthe CVS repository online here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/\n\n\nThe ximage source code is located in ray/src/px/.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-June/000222.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 01, 2009 at 03:02PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "hdri_000219", "id": "hdri_000222"}
