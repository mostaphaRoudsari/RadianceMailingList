{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThanks for explaining your exact problem.  The documentation for  \nRadiance is scattered and frequently application-specific.  Did you  \nbrowse the \"Seminars and Course Notes\" section of:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/\n\n\nFrancesco Anselmo's Radiance wiki is also useful:\n\n\n\thttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php\n\n\nCheck out Axel Jacob's tutorials at:\n\n\n\thttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml\n\n\nAs for describing a mixture, you need to use the \"mixfunc\" type.   \nCorrecting what you gave in your e-mail:\n\n\n> I calculated the total amount of energy emitted by a 300\u00b0K  \n> blackbody as\n> 146.305W/(sr m^2). So the material for my source becones\n>\n>      void light bright\n>      0\n>      0\n>      3  48.77 48.77 48.77\n\n\nDon't bother dividing the value up, just give it three times:\n\n\n      void light bright\n      0\n      0\n      3  146.305 146.305 146.305\n\n\n\n\n>      void plastic brown\n>      0\n>      0\n>      5  .2  .1  .1  0  0\n>\n>      brown glow brown_glow\n>      0\n>      0\n>      4 100 100 100 100\n>\n>      brown_glow sphere BB\n>      0\n>      0\n>      4  2  1  1.5  .125\n\n\nShould be:\n\n\n      void plastic brown\n      0\n      0\n      5  .2  .1  .1  0  0\n\n\n      void glow bit_of_glow\n      0\n      0\n      4 100 100 100 100\n\n\n\tvoid mixfunc brown_glow\n\t4 brown bit_of_glow 0.5 .\n\t0\n\t0\n\n\n      brown_glow sphere BB\n      0\n      0\n      4  2  1  1.5  .125\n\n\n\n\nNote that I gave half of each, so their actual values will be reduced  \nby 50%.  In some cases,  you may wish to double the parameters to  \ncompensate.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006049.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 04, 2009 at 10:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006033", "id": "radiance-general_006049"}
