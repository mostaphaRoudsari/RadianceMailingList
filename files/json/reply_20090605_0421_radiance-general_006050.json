{"body": "Hi Giovanni.\n\n\nI'm not quite clear if you want to use the Radiance tools from the command line\nor if you expect that there is a 'use these values' button in EcoTect.\n\n\nIn the fist case you have to find the file that contains the sky description in\nthe scene that's exported by EcoTect. -B and -R are options to the gensky\ncommand that should be on one the lines in this file.\n\n\nFor a batch calculation of different values you have to loop over\n\n\n1) modify the gensky command\n2) recreate the scene octree\n3) do the calculation again\n4) move the images (or rtrace results) to a different place\n\n\nThis is possible with a bit of command line scripting.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 4, 2009 at 6:07 PM, Giovanni\nBetti<gbetti at fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006050.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 05, 2009 at 04:21AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006048", "id": "radiance-general_006050"}
