{"body": "Sure.\n\n\nA few things I need to know first:\n\n\nDo you use Radiance on Windows or Linux?\nDo you change anything else in the scene (like blinds) or just the sky?\nCan you locate the exported scene and find the file with '!gensky ...'\nin it? It might even have an extension like '*.sky'.\n\n\nIf Ecotect allows you export a batch rendering for different times of\nday or similar you\ncould do that and see how it is realised in the export. We could use\nthose files and\njust modify them to include changing '-B' and '-R' params.\n\n\nI'll be a bit busy this afternoon. So it might take me a bit to reply.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 5, 2009 at 1:16 PM, Giovanni\nBetti<gbetti at fosterandpartners.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006052.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 05, 2009 at 05:36AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006051", "id": "radiance-general_006052"}
