{"body": "Thomas, \nthanks for the quick reply.\n\n\nI work on Windows.\nAt the moment I am just interested in changing the sky definition while the building geometry stays the same.\n The way it works for me now is that when I export out of ecotect I get a *.rif file containing scene information, views and rendering parameters plus two *.rad files, one containing the geometry and the materials definition, the other containing the sky and ground glow. I guess I could go into the command line with those information and run everything from there, although I've never tried it...\n\n\nWhen I create a series of batch images, I need to provide ecotect with a *.brf (txt) file with the following information\nOutput name\t\tMonth \tDay\tTime\tSky\tLat.\t Long.  TimeZone\tOrientation\n\n\nWhich looks like this: \n\n\nrow: ty3_001, 4, 1, 10.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000   55.9\nrow: ty3_002, 4, 1, 11.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\nrow: ty3_003, 4, 1, 12.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\nrow: ty3_004, 4, 1, 13.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\nrow: ty3_005, 4, 1, 14.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000\t55.9\n\n\nWhat gets output is a batch file (*.bat) which automatically runs the command prompt and generates the different images and a *.rad file that overrides my previous sky definition and changes at every subsequent run.\n\n\nI hope this answers your questions,\n\n\nThanks again,\nCheers,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006053.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "June 05, 2009 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006051", "id": "radiance-general_006053"}
