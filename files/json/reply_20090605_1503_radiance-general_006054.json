It's optional but will\ncreate a 10000lux sky which is a nice value to work with.\n\n\n> What gets output is a batch file (*.bat) which automatically runs the command prompt and generates the different images and a *.rad file that overrides my previous sky definition and changes at every subsequent run.\n\n\nIf you can access the *.bat file before it is run you should find the\nsky definitions in it (assuming that is just lists each step in the\nloop). You can simply add the -B and -R option and values to the line\nthat gets written into the sky file in each loop. Then run the batch\nfile as before.\n\n\nIf you have a few hundred or thousand values, though, we should find\nanother solution. If you can send me the *.bat file we can work out\nthe steps that are necessary in EcoTect.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006054.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 05, 2009 at 03:03PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006051", "id": "radiance-general_006054"}
