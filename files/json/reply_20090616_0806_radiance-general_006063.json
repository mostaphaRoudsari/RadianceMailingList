{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI suppose there is some command prompt command to do that easy and fast\n(Greg?).\n\n\nFor more complex solution you can download and install\nRadDisplay<http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_download.html>program.\nRadDisplay works on Windows and Linux.\nWhen you open pic image in the program, create False Color image and then\npress \"Stats\" button. In the dialog you 'll have various image statistics\nand average luminance too.\n\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\nMarija\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 16, 2009 at 4:33 PM, Giovanni Betti <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006063.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "June 16, 2009 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006062", "id": "radiance-general_006063"}
