{"body": "Hi Giovanni,\n\n\nThere are a number of ways to do it, but I prefer using pvalue.  For  \na color (RGB) average, you can use:\n\n\n\tpvalue -h -H -df test.hdr | total -if3 -m\n\n\nFor grayscale average:\n\n\n\tpvalue -b -h -H -df test.hdr | total -if1 -m\n\n\nFor original units (watts/sr/m^2) add a -o to either of the pvalue  \ncommands above.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 16, 2009 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006062", "id": "radiance-general_006064"}
