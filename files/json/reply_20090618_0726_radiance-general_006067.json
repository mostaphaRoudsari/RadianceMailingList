{"body": "Is the desired end result a daylight factor falsecolor? or just the data\nsuch as min, max, avg, uniformity?\n\n\nDepending on what your goal is, you may want to set up a grid of\ncalculation points (coordinates and direction vector), process your\nscene, sky, and grid points through rtrace, and manipulate the the data\nas required. See 6.4, Case Study II in RwR dealing with daylight factor\ngeneration. If you need images you could use pvalue to create an image\nfrom the grid of results and process it through falsecolor to put a\nscale on it.\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nIn terms of post processing I would \n\n\n\n\n*\tconvert each pic to daylight factors \n\n\n*\tQuery the PIC by tracing an \"Area of Interest\". This is used to\nwork out DF min, max, ave, uniformity, etc. With this I can exclude\noverlapping spaces and other features such as notional corridors from\nthe working plane calcs. \n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006067.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "June 18, 2009 at 07:26AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006066", "id": "radiance-general_006067"}
