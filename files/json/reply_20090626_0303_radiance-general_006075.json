I don't remember\nwhich tool from the standard set he used but this might\nhelp you to find it. That tool might help you.\n\n\nI have to do the same thing for my scripts but I think\nI just add the missing \"view=\" line to the image header.\nNo binary munging involved. If you can wait till tomorrow\nI can post what I do to solve the problem from my scripts.\nJust can't find it at the moment. \n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006075.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 26, 2009 at 03:03AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006074", "id": "radiance-general_006075"}
