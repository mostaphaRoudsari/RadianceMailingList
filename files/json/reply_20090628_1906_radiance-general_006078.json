Unfortunately this \none is again in the good old tradition of conflicting with vi (well, I \nam really curious how many commands I type lead me to that little editor)...\n\n\nThe reason I was asking is that I am working on full-frame fisheye hdr \nimages as they are expected e.g. by findglare and evalglare. These \nimages do not have any view information included, and I am trying to add \nthis missing part of information.\n\n\nCheers Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006078.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
