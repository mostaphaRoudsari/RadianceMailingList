{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThere isn't really a \"vinfo\" command, is there?  What does it do?  I  \nused the name because the editor it applies is in fact \"vi,\" so it  \nseemed appropriate.  Feel free to modify the code to edit the header  \nas you like.  The getinfo command can be used with \"ed\" to accomplish  \nthis.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006079.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 28, 2009 at 08:59PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006074", "id": "radiance-general_006079"}
