{"body": "Lars,\n\n\nI wrote a little Perl script some time ago, to help out a student\nwho wanted to batch-correct the exposure info in HDRs. The script is \navailable here:\n\n\nhttp://www.luxal.eu/resources/hdr/hdrexpo/index.shtml\n\n\nIt's called hdrexpo. Feel free to use it as a base for for your own HDR \nheader manipulation, if you're happy to stick to the GPL license. I'd be \nhappy to put in your changes.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006081.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 29, 2009 at 01:18PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006074", "id": "radiance-general_006081"}
