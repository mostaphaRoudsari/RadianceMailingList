{"body": "Hi,\n\n\na short update, for now I am dividing the task to set-up a sky into two \nsteps:\n\n\n1) Create a gensky-description. The zenith radiance as calculated by \ngensky can be found in the skyfunc definition (it is the third number on \nthe last line of the output, so it can easily be extracted using awk). \nThe horizontal illuminance that is to be found for the ground luminance \ncan be either calculated from the sky model using rtrace, or, for skies \nWITHOUT sun, be derived by multiplying the \"ground ambient level\" by \npi*179. The sun position can also be read from the comment lines.\n\n\n2) Set-up the ssld-description using the values found in step 1).\n\n\nMaybe it would be worth to create a script that can do all that (and \nalso set the ssld-coefficients from a look-up table for a given sky type).\n\n\nCheers Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006083.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
