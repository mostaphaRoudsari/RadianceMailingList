{"body": "I'm not sure what you mean by the \"radiance scale factor\". Are you trying to compute the cameras' response curves? As for your second question, you won't be able to calculate radiance from a single exposure, even if all the details about that exposure are known. The process you are describing requires a high dynamic range (HDR) image, which is comprised of multiple exposures. The typical minimum is three exposures separated by 2 f-stops each, but ideally the longest exposure should have zero black pixels and the shortest have no white pixels. This ideal is only necessary to capture scenes of extreme dynamic range, however.\n\n\nRadiance-online.org also hosts an hdr mailing list which is definitely worth subscribing to:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/hdri\n\n\nRobert Guglielmetti  IES, LEED AP\nBuilding Energy Efficiency Engineer\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n1617 Cole Blvd, MS-5202\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n303.275.4319\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 01, 2009 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006084", "id": "radiance-general_006085"}
