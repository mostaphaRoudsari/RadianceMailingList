{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe SSLD creation process is a bit old and clunky.  It does require a few hand calcs and a little interaction with the text file.  It really could be scripted to create it automatically...  One day...\n\n\nTo start with, you need to know what type of sky you're trying to create, where the sun is, and the direct and diffuse horizontal illuminances.\n\n\nFor the diffuse sky distribution, step 4 of my old documentation says just put in any old number for the zenith radiance - it doesn't matter what it is at that stage.  That model is then tested and the zenith radiance is altered to create the correct diffuse horizontal illuminance in step 12.\n\n\nThe ground radiance is found in step 3, requiring knowledge of the global horizontal illuminance and the ground reflectance.\n\n\nI'll have a search around here for a script that automates the process.  I vaguely remember someone has done this before...\n\n\nCheers,\nPhil.\n\n\n\n\nDr Phillip Greenup\nSenior Consultant - Lighting and Sustainability\n\n\nArup\nLevel 17\n1 Nicholson St\nMelbourne VIC 3000\nPh +61 3 9668 5669\nwww.arup.com/lighting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "July 01, 2009 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006082", "id": "radiance-general_006088"}
