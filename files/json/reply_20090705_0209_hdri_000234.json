{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nwhat you want is a HDR image that contains pixel values in photometric\nunits. To achieve this generate a reasonable response curve, which\ncompensates for the non-linear response of the sensor to illuminance on\neach channel. Second, you should compare the luminance from the pixels\nto a reference. One way to do so is using a stabilized light source.\nThis will give you a factor that can be used as a multiplier to get from\nthe pixel values to cd/m2.\n\n\nBesides that, aperture size, focus distance, the lens etc. all have\ninfluence on the pixel values in your image...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-July/000234.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
