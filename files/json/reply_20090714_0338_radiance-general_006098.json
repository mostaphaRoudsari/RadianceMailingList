Like a kind of \"silicone sealant\"! As\nyou know, I'm no coder but I'm guessing it could be python scripted from\nSketchup. There'd be a small increase in rendering time. If the cylinder is\nsmall enough it won't show. Or, if the appropriate size and colour are\nselected you could achieve \"cartoon edges\"!\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nChris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006098.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Yates", "created_at": "July 14, 2009 at 03:38AM", "created_by": "Chris_Yates", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006095", "id": "radiance-general_006098"}
