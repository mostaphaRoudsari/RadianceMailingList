But if you\nexport simple scenes from the likes of ESP-r it should also be\npossible to work out a wall thickness from the attributes of the wall.\nIf only a single room is exported it should be quit easy to apply an\noffset to the floor outline and create two layers of polygons. Usually\nthe geometries in energy simulation apps are quite basic which\nsimplifies the calculation of intersections and openings.\n\n\nBut for the moment those are still features for the next generation\nof exporters.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 14, 2009 at 03:42PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006095", "id": "radiance-general_006099"}
