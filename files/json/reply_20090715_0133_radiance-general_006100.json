You  \ncould use the genampos script to see where the calculation is  \nexpending effort.  See the resources page on my site (link below) for  \na 'Technical Note' on the use of the genambpos script.  The script  \nshould get installed by default with the rest of the Radiance  \nexecutables.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006100.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "July 15, 2009 at 01:33AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006095", "id": "radiance-general_006100"}
