{"body": "I believe the -I option to rtrace automatically takes the trace point\none unit in front of the point to avoid conflict with a surface (in case\nyour point is defined co-planar with a wall, floor, etc.). This would\nprobably be fine if you model was set up in inches or mm. Maybe you can\nscale your model to millimeters using xform -s?\n\n\nA question to the list, would the -i (lowercase) be appropriate to get\nthe value for the exact point as defined?\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nthe command used is:\nrtrace -ab 7 -ad 2048 -oodv -I\nrcp.oct<numeric/plan_de_travail.fld>numeric/090715_BU_Rennes_07_vitrage_\nirradiance.irr\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006106.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "July 16, 2009 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006106"}
