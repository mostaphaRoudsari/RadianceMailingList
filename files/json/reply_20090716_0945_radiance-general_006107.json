{"body": "As Chris wrote, -I implies an observer point 1m above the 'point of interest'.\nBut it also turns around the view vector (your output shows -1.000000e+000).\n\n\nBasically rtrace introduces a virtual plane of lambertian properties and looks\ndown onto this plane to calculate the irridance from the reflection (which is\nidentical).\n\n\nThe offset of 1m is only a problem if you want to use the output to anchor\nyour results in a model or if your workplane is close to an obstruction that's\nlower than 1m above the plane. Then the rtrace rays would hit the back\nof the obstruction and not the ideal reflector.\n\n\nBut then, perhaps Greg has anticipated this case and added some magic to\navoid it ...\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 16, 2009 at 5:17 PM, PAUPELIN-HUCHARD\nValere<v.paupelin-huchard at elioth.fr> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006107.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 16, 2009 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006107"}
