{"body": "Valere, as Chris and Thomas have mentioned, you want to use the -i option for that field.\n\n\nHonestly, I've never noticed this -I option before. The man page doesn't mention the 1m offset, either. Frankly, I don't understand the point of this option. If I want irradiance, I usually want it on some surface or virtual plane (a uniform grid on the front of a library stack, for example), and I just make a field of points normal to that surface and use the -i option to compute irradiance at that point. If for some reason I wanted irradiance offset from some surface (dark sky / light pollution calc or something), I would just arrange the points offset from the surface, and oriented at the surface, and still use the -i. What are people generally using the -I option for? I'm curious.\n\n\nRobert Guglielmetti  IES, LEED AP\nBuilding Energy Efficiency Engineer \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n1617 Cole Blvd, MS-5202\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n303.275.4319\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006109.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 16, 2009 at 10:01AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006109"}
