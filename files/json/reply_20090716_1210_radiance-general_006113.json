{"body": "sorry, little time - may be not the answer you are looking for, but as Raphael says, nothing to do with it.\nanyway if you want a point and the illuminance at that point in the output file, \nuse that point in the grid, -I in rtrace and again\u00a0-opv.\nthis saves the point from the grid to the final output.\n\u00a0\nexplanation, the point of the grid is the intersection point in the calcualtion as the observer is moved 1 unit from it and used to trace a luminance calculation converted in illuminance...\nanyway \n-opv\n\u00a0\nciao\nG\n\n\n\n\n--- Gio 16/7/09, Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl <Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch> ha scritto:\n\n\n\n\nDa: Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl <Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch>\nOggetto: RE : [Radiance-general] daylight factor and rtrace cmd\nA: \"Radiance general discussion\" <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nData: Gioved\u00ec 16 luglio 2009, 20:30\n\n\n\n\nrtrace -oodv has nothing to do with the \"1 meter offset\".
