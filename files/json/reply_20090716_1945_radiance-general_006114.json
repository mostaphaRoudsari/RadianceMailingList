{"body": "Yes, the -oo option combined with -I doesn't really work properly in  \nrtrace, as it \"fakes\" an intersection with an ideal diffuse surface a  \ntiny amount (about 1e-6) in front of the point you specified, while  \nsetting the ray origin arbitrarily one unit before it.  No actual  \nintersection calculation is done, so no worries about intervening  \nrays.  This is something I should fix, but since you give the origin  \non input, it hasn't come up very often where people want the same  \norigin on output.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006114.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 16, 2009 at 07:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006114"}
