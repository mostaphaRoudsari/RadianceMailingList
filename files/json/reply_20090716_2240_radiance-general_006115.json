Like ordering a door\nand getting delivered some planks and a saw. (Should we call this\n'IKEA rendering'?)\n\n\nWhile we're at it, I think that this virtual intersection also swallows one\nbounce out of your '-ab' specs. That only becomes obvious when you\ntry to eliminate indirect contributions ('-ab 0' and '-ab 1') but then it's\nrather annoying when you don't remember it.\n\n\nWhat's the community's opinion? Should rtrace raise the bounce count\nfor '-I' internally or should it just be well document? I'm not sure what's\nmore consistent with the way Radiance behaves now or if there are any\nside effects.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006115.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 16, 2009 at 10:40PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006115"}
