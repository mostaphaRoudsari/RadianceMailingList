{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nI agree that the -oo output is odd behavior.  I'm a bit afraid to  \nchange it, though, because there might be someplace in the code where  \nzero ray lengths are problematic, and the initial \"false primary\" ray  \nis needed for consistency for rtrace's reporting routines.  I suppose  \nI can try it and see if anything bad happens.\n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean, though, about the -I option changing the  \neffect of -ab.  I suppose it depends on how you think about it.  With  \n-ab set to 0, only direct illumination arriving at that position is  \nconsidered.  Setting -ab 1 sends out sample rays over the hemisphere  \nto gather indirect contributions.  Is this other than what you would  \nexpect?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006116.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 16, 2009 at 11:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006116"}
