For \"-ab 0\" I would have expected both of them\nto be zero.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006118.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 17, 2009 at 12:05AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006105", "id": "radiance-general_006118"}
