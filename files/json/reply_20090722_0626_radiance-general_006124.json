{"body": "A view file is supposed to represent one (1) view. The last line of the \nview file is considered to be the view spec.  Considering a view file to \nbe a collection of multiple views is counter productive.\n\n\nIt seems to me that there are a few ways to do what you want:\n\n\n   1. create multiple rif files with each one representing a \"view\n      group\" and containing multiple \"view=\" lines, note this is really\n      one of the things that rif file is for, that is to create coherent\n      groupings of views with respect to a set of\n      geometry/materials/lighting as defined in an octree....\n   2. enhance your script to include a separate \"view group\" file, the\n      script can parse the view group file and pass the relevant views\n      to the rif file, in essence building a rif file on the fly....\n   3. ranimate, as Thomas suggests, you could probably do something with\n      the ANIMATE parameter for ranimate pointing to a script to produce\n      the correctly modified octree and use a VIEWFILE with all your\n      views in it.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006124.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 22, 2009 at 06:26AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006122", "id": "radiance-general_006124"}
