{"body": "Hello again,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first thank you for the welcome and the immediate answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars, my concern in the dissertation is the glare effect created in the\nswimming pool and do not allow a lifeguard to search the bottom of the pool.\nAccording to the theory found till now, I am interesting in the amount of\nlight reflecting from the surface and the amount that is travelling through\nthe water till it hits the bottom and all the way up. The ratio of the\nintensities will show me how much glare I have in the swimming pool. I have\nalready found in previous messages a formula in Radiance that calculates\ncorrectly the reflection of light and for this reason I am working for the\namount of light that travels in the water. Thank you for the information\nabout the dielectric and I think that I will abandon the mist\npseudo-material. Since water is clean in the swimming pool. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack de Velpine, I have found already the threads about \"water any news ???\n\" but it seems like there are more mails than those I have found. I will\nsearch them all and I'll try to understand the \"rtcontrib\" tool. I may come\nback with any new questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you all for your time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSotiris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006128.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sotiris Papantoniou", "created_at": "July 22, 2009 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Sotiris_Papantoniou", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006120", "id": "radiance-general_006128"}
