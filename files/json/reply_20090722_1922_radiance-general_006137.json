On a perfectly even \nsurface, you could easily look through to the ground, as long as you do \nnot hit the total reflection by very low angles. But as the lifeguard \nwill usually be interested in the pool when there are occupants, the \nsurface will not be a plane any more, but wavy. And now everything \ndepends on the shape - having big, smooth waves will allow good view, \nbut small wrinkly waves (ok, here I hit the limits of my English \nlanguage skills) would cause a lot of reflections by total reflection, \nand at the same time caustics resulting in uneven illuminances on the \nground. If you are able to model the water surface geometries which you \nneed to consider, it will be possible to make some estimates on \nvisibility of anything below the surface. There are two ways afaik, one \nbeing rtcontrib, the other one pmap. rtcontrib comes with recent \ndistributions, but is not really documented. pmap comes with a nice \ndocumentation, but is currently supported only with radiance 3.7.\n\n\nBy the way, I think there are two effects to consider. One is glare. \nEven more important may be the total-reflection that simply does not \npermit you to look through a water-air interface (aka the water surface) \nunder narrow angles, with or without glare. Glare alone might render the \ntask of the lifeguard tiring, but non-visibility renders it impossible...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006137.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
