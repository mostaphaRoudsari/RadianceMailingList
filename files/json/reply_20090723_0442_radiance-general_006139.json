{"body": "Hello Lars,\n\n\nIt would be great to run the simulations with moving water surface but since\ni want to compare the simulations with the measurements it would be\ndifficult to create similar conditions in the real pool. Your suggestions\nwere very useful though and i will start working immediately with a simple\nmodel to understand how it works and eliminate possible problems that may\ncome up. \n\n\nThanks again\n\n\nSotiris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006139.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sotiris Papantoniou", "created_at": "July 23, 2009 at 04:42AM", "created_by": "Sotiris_Papantoniou", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006120", "id": "radiance-general_006139"}
