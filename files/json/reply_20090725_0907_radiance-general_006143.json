{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nYour backtrace is missing symbolic information telling what call was  \nlast made in Radiance.  It seems to have crashed in a sprintf()  \nstatement, which means it could have bombed while trying to print an  \nerror message.  You should recompile with the -g option and crash it  \nagain.\n\n\nJust as a guess, you wouldn't happen to have any strings longer than  \n127 characters in your material descriptions, would you?\n\n\nThis probably belongs on the dev list, so I'll cross-post and we can  \nfollow up there.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006143.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 25, 2009 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006142", "id": "radiance-general_006143"}
