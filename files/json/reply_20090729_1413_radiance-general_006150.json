I can't really explain what's going on but have you tried to\nincrease your \"-ab\" value? This should provide you with a more\neven light distribution.\n\n\nYou can probably also change other values like \"-ad\" or \"-aa\".\nBut you didn't comment on those so I can't say if there is potential.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n===========End of original message text===========\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006150.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Schwartz", "created_at": "July 29, 2009 at 02:13PM", "created_by": "John_Schwartz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006145", "id": "radiance-general_006150"}
