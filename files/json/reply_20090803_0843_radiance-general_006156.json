You can remove them\nto see if the command runs through then. The output would not be\nuseable, but it might help to find the problem. In particular \"-w\" turns\noff warnings from rtrace.\n\n\nI could not find the \"-c\" option in the (online) man pages. Perhaps\nthat's a source for an error there, too.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006156.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 03, 2009 at 08:43AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006141", "id": "radiance-general_006156"}
