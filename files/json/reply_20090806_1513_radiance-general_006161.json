{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> We finished a new version of RadDisplay tool.\n\n\nI think it would be great to have that in Debian, so I've started a packaging\neffort at svn.debian.org/svn/python-apps/packages/raddisplay/trunk (access via\nsvn:// or - if you have an account on alioth.debian.org - via ssh+svn://....).\nUnfortunately I don't have much spare time, to I would appreciate if somebody\nwould like to maintain it - with a lot of help from me of course. That's also a\ngood start into Debian packaging practice :)\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                             Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprints: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n                   ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485 DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006161.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "August 06, 2009 at 03:13PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006149", "id": "radiance-general_006161"}
