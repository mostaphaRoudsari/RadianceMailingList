Ubuntu is starting to freeze again, if there is\nsomething to fix, it should be fixed now.\nThe CVS head from 20090601 is in Ubuntu now, which is pretty old already\ncompared with what I have in Debian.\n\n\nGreg: I've seen that you were doing various minor changes during the last weeks\n- when is a good day to get your CVS Head and push it to Ubuntu? I think you've\ntried to fix Lars' bug !?\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                             Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprints: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n                   ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485 DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-August/000999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "August 08, 2009 at 05:22PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000994", "id": "radiance-dev_000999"}
