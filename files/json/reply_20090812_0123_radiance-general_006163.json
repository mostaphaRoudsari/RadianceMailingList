{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe SSLD sky generator creates a diffuse sky distribution.  If you don't put a sun in there, there won't be one.  If you're sky model involves a diffuse sky that is brightest in the sun direction, but the sun itself is not directly visible, then you'll just need to ensure you get the diffuse horizontal illuminance you're looking for (and that's the hard part - what should the diffuse horizontal illuminance be?).\n\n\nSo you won't end up with two sun definitions.  And you control the diffuse and direct components of global horizontal illuminance.  If the sun is not visible, it shouldn't be in the model, the direct illuminance component will be zero and the global will equal the diffuse illuminance.\n\n\nThis is assuming you are using my old SSLD sky generator / cal file.  Could be a different story if you're using something else?\n\n\nCheers,\nPhil.\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006163.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "August 12, 2009 at 01:23AM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006162", "id": "radiance-general_006163"}
