But because of the altitude \nmodification gensky does for high altitudes, the sun (light) is 2.5 \ndegrees off the brightest spot of the sky glow - leading to light plus \nglow spot. Probably the fact that the solid angle covered by the sun is \nsmall, the difference is not that high, but in cases where my \nilluminance is really only due to a small circumsolar domain of the sky, \nthis may lead to some higher illuminances, right? Would need some test \nmodels to see whether this becomes visible with a skylight. I just \nrealized that I have two different sun positions in my model - the \n'real' one by the ssld background sky, and the manipulated on by gensky.\n\n\nYes, I am using you cal-file, thank you by the way :-)\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006164.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
