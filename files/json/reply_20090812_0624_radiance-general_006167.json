{"body": "> Second, gensky manipulates the sun position when coming close to the\n> zenith and sets it to 87.5 altitude.

A few degrees above and below the\ntropics hit a zenith of 87.5.\n\n\nA short while ago I modified and recompiled gensky, changing 87.5 to\n89.9 in lines 218-225 (\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003118.html\n).\n\n\nHas anybody else done this and run into problems?\n\n\nI think if the zenith is at 90.0, the -vu vector may get messy if\nyou're translating the gensky output into a camera showing the sun's\nview, which was my reasoning for 89.9.\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006167.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Smith", "created_at": "August 12, 2009 at 06:24AM", "created_by": "David_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006162", "id": "radiance-general_006167"}
