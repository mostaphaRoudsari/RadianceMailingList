You can't\ngot to 90 degrees\nbut everything else should work. I remember that the positions I got\nwere still credible\nand far better than the results form another algorithm I used that\ndistorted the sun's\npath around the zenith. Gensky may be a bit inaccurate, too, but i\ndon't think it is\nnoticeable.\n\n\nI checked the output by plotting a sunpath with the values I got from the gensky\ncomments in the output. I think Axel Jacobs has written a script to do\nthat but you\ncan use any plotting app you want.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006168.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 12, 2009 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006162", "id": "radiance-general_006168"}
