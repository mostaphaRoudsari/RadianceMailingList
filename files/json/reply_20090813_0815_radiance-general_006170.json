{"body": "Sort of related to this discussion:\n\n\nWhen diffuse and direct input parameters are taken from measurements  \n(e.g. a climate file), the value for direct normal will usually be  \nbased on an instrument that has an acceptance angle quite a bit larger  \nthan the solar disc, e.g. 6 degrees for the Eppley solar tracker. So,  \na reasonable portion of the most intense circumsolar region will end  \nup be apportioned to the sun luminance (actually, radiance), and  \ntherefore handled by the deterministic part of the calculation. This  \neffect is described in more detail in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3  \n(p60-61) here:\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:thesis\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006170.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "August 13, 2009 at 08:15AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006162", "id": "radiance-general_006170"}
