{"body": "Hmm, well no suggestions thus far has helped solve the problem I am\nhaving. I think it would help if I explain what I am trying to do. I am\nattempting to validate radiosity calculations against a raytracer (in\nthis case Radiance). I am doing this with a simple example of a box lit\nonly by direct sun and ambient bounces, so there is no sky distribution.\n\n\nI have attempted many different rendering options, such as -aa 0 and many \nother \"high quality\" level options as recommended in the Rendering with\nRadiance book. These do not get rid of the problem. As you can see in my\ngensky below, the sun shouldn't be approaching the zenith, as it has been \nrevealed can cause problems. \n\n\nI was reccommended to try using mkillum to turn the window into an illum\nsurface. I have attempted this, but it doesn't appear to do anything, so\nI could be using it incorrectly? I am only using a single ambient bounce\nin my calculations because the shadow is still there even on higher\namounts, such as -ab 20. I decided -ab 1 would make it easier to track\ndown the problem as well as take less computation time.\n\n\nAny more thoughts on what could be causing this? Could it be a problem\nwith gensky similar to the zenith problem maybe?\n\n\n--John Schwartz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006172.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Schwartz", "created_at": "August 13, 2009 at 01:42PM", "created_by": "John_Schwartz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006145", "id": "radiance-general_006172"}
