{"body": "John,\n\n\nI'd also like to see your scene, but while I wait I'll go out on a limb:\nAFAIK in radiance, an ambient sample ray is never emitted normal to a\nsurface.  I suspect your shadow results from the (slightly) decreased\nprobability of sampling the highlight from the area directly above the\nhighlight.  This effect can be compounded by the -as setting (which never\nsamples the upper edge of a division, but can sample the lower edge of a\ndivision).\n\n\nMy suggestion: try a high ad value coupled with no ambient super samples.\n-ad 20000 -as 0  \n\n\n\n\nAs far as your comparison between raytracing and radiosity, You pick a scene\nthat plays to all the strengths of radiosity.  Radiosity with a dense mesh\nproduces a highly accurate result in relatively little time for scenes that\nhave very simple geometry and are limited to completely diffuse reflection\nand completely specular transmission.\n\n\nIf you had semi-specular reflection, semi-diffuse transmission or complex\ngeometry raytracing is more likely to result in higher accuracy in less time\nthan radiosity.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 8/13/09 1:58 PM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006175.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "August 13, 2009 at 03:01PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006145", "id": "radiance-general_006175"}
