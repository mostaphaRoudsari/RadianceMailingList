{"body": "John,\n\n\nI'm running your scene and am witnessing the same effect.  Interestingly the\ndark spot still exists, it is just much less pronounced.\n\n\nI am both able and unable to understand why this works.\n\n\nYears ago I remember someone mentioning the impossibility of ambient\nsampling normal to a surface and it's lingered in my mind ever since.  I've\nalways struggled with the ambient calculation's ability to sample the\nhorizon which technically contributes nothing to illuminance at a point\nwhile it was unable to sample the zenith which contributes most to\nilluminance.\n\n\nI've thought about suggesting the range for ambient sampling switch from\n[0,1) to (0,1]  but couldn't grasp the ramifications of the possibility of\nsampling the zenith from all of the zenith adjacent ambient divisions.\n\n\nIt seems to me that statistically it isn't possible for this to make a\ndifference so maybe there is a bug in the ambient super sampling,  but it\nalso seems to me that statistically this must make a difference.\n\n\nSo I guess I'll just have to wait for Greg and others to weigh in...\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 8/13/09 4:05 PM, \"schwaj3 at rpi.edu\" <schwaj3 at rpi.edu> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006177.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "August 13, 2009 at 04:31PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006145", "id": "radiance-general_006177"}
