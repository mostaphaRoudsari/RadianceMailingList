{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nEven without this funny sampling behavior I think there could be a slightly darker patch on the ceiling due to the 1/3 x 1/3 square on the adjacent wall that has a 0% reflectance.  That dark portion of the ceiling could just have a stronger coupling to the 0% reflectance surface than the other surfaces around.  Do your radiosity renderings show any darker spots on the ceiling?\n\n\nCheers,\nZack\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\n  ZACK ROGERS, P.E., LEED AP, IESNA \n\n\nINTEGRATED DESIGN ASSOCIATES, INC\n437 Main Street\nLongmont, CO 80501\ntel: 303.848.8299, fax: 303.848.8290 \nwww.ideasi.com \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006181.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "August 17, 2009 at 10:24AM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006145", "id": "radiance-general_006181"}
