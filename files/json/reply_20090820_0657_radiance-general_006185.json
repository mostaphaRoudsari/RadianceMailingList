{"body": "Hi Francesco.\n\n\nA couple of comments:\n\n\nIf I understand correctly you are trying to render an image of a beam of\nlight passing through\na dielectric material. If you try to create an image you should use the\nrpict program and not\nthe 'rtrace' command line you used.\n\n\nYou mention that you don't understand the results but you don't show us what\nthey are.\nThe output of your command line should give you lux values but I don't know\nhow the\ninput relates to the geometry (haven't looked at it close enough).\n\n\nYour scene description below is incomplete. There are some '0's missing in\nthe descriptions.\nI hope that is an effect of copy-and-paste. Otherwise I doubt that the\nsimulation would run\nat all.\n\n\nDo you know about the docs in\n\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer\n\n\nin particular\n\n\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\n\n\n\nRegards\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006185.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 20, 2009 at 06:57AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006184", "id": "radiance-general_006185"}
