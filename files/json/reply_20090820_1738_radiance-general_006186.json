{"body": "Hi Francesco,\n\n\nRadiance doesn't compute \"caustics\" directly -- refractions of beam  \nradiation through dielectric materials.  You can visualize the  \ndisplacement of light rays by looking through a dielectric solid, but  \nthe beams of light will not be translated by default.  (It is possible  \nto get such behavior using the prism types, but it's not provided as a  \ndefault behavior because such modeling is expensive and not required  \nby most architectural environments.)\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006186.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 20, 2009 at 05:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006184", "id": "radiance-general_006186"}
