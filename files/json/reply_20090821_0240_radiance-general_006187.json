{"body": "Dear thomas,\nI am not rendering a picture. I would like to calculate the  \nilluminance value on\ndifferent sensors using rtrace to calculate the real position of the  \nbright stripes on the \"floor\" and the dimensions.\nI attache now part of the result (result-ff.txt) that I obtained with  \nmy simulations. If you look into the file you can understand that  \nradiance seems to calculate correctley the start point of both stripe  \n(last two columns): the bright stripe for the case without the  \ndilectric panel (4th column) starts at point 2454mm (Y value) far from  \nthe origin and the bright stripe for the case of the dielectric panel  \n(5th column) starts at point 2454.9mm (a bit further due to the ray  \nrefraction inside the dielectric material). But both the two stripes  \nend at point 2553.9mm and there is no more shifting.\n\n\nI also attach the rad files  (geometry-rad and sky.rad) and my script  \n(calc-refr.run) and the two sensors files (points1 and points2.grd).\n\n\nThank you very much in advance.\nFrancesco\n\n\n\n\nQuoting Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at googlemail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006187.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Frontini", "created_at": "August 21, 2009 at 02:40AM", "created_by": "Francesco_Frontini", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006184", "id": "radiance-general_006187"}
