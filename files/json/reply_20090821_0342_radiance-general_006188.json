{"body": "Francesco.\n\n\nAs Greg already wrote, Radiance is not suited for your type of calculation.\n\n\nThe difference in your results files might be caused by interpolation of\ncached\nvalues. You are calculating tiny steps (0.1units) in a large geometry (10000\nunits).\nI wouldn't trust Radiance to produce absolutely accurate results on that\nscale and\nthe differce you see is less than 2 units.\n\n\nYou can try to disable the ambient cache completely by setting -aa to 0. No\nneed\nfor an ambient cache file, then.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006188.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 21, 2009 at 03:42AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006184", "id": "radiance-general_006188"}
