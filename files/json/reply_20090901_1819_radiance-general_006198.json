There is also a converter \nfrom Radiance into Wavefront OBJ, but it is limited to polygon objects \n(works well for my scenes coming from CAD, but will not work with more \nsophisticated geometry). For checking the resulting meshes, Meshlab may \nbe a good choice, as it allows to apply lots of filter to support you \nfinding errors in the mesh. It can read the mesh formats (as far as I \nremember all three of them - obj, vrml-1, openinventor) exported from \nRadiance and its filters.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006198.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
