{"body": "Hi Christoph,\n\n\nI just registered, though I didn't pay the $420 I owe...  I was hoping  \nfor special treatment.  I do have something to present on the annual  \ncalculations, but need to throw together an abstract for that.  I'd  \nalso like to attend the pre-workshop event, and was wondering about  \nthe format for that and if there's anything I can do to help out.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006200.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 03, 2009 at 01:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006199", "id": "radiance-general_006200"}
