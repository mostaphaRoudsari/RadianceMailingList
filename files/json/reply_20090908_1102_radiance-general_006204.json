Please not by\nposting any attachments.. If you have a bright ring in the result - do\nyou have a bright ring in your source image, e.g. at the edge of the\nimage circle? How did you prepare the image, do you crop it? Does the\ncal-file expect a 180 fov. and does your image provide that?\n\n\nUnder 2) you write that the image is less bright then the original, but\nat the centre you have only an error of 1% - do you have a constant\nerror of 1%?\n\n\nAre you sure that the fisheye projection assumed by the script assumes\nyour camera/lens projection?\n\n\nDoes the source image include direct sun (visible)?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006204.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
