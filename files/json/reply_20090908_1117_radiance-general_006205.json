{"body": "Hi Lars, thanks for your reply, I've attached my scene description.\nSorry but I do not have an ftp where to upload them although thwy are\nvery very small files...\n\n\nTo reply your questions:\nI do not have any bright ring in the source image which is an angular\nfisheye view (180 fov) generated in radiance of a CIE sunny sky using\nthe option -s (I do not expect this technique to be of any use for\ndirect sunlight, only for the diffuse component) the image is uncropped\nand the cal file says: Projection of 2d image fisheye picture to source,\napplies to angular fisheye like Nikon 180 deg.\nAlthough I cannot find any geometrical distortion, it's only the value\nnearby the horizon that goes up.\nFor point 2, I have the error of 1% nearby the centre (really where the\n\"sun\" should be) and then it goes up as it approaches the horizon...\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006205.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "September 08, 2009 at 11:17AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006203", "id": "radiance-general_006205"}
