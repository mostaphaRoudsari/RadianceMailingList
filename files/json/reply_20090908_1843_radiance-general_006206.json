{"body": "Hi Giovanni,\n\n\nI have used fisheye.cal, which comes with radiance. I also used the\nangular fisheye with the vta-view, as you did. The only important point\nwas to translate the mapping, as fisheye.cal expected the image center\nto be +y (north in most models), while for sky capturing you point up.\n\n\nThe mapping for me is\n\n\nvoid colorpict skyhdrmapping\n11 red green blue sky.hdr fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx -90 -rz 180\n0\n0\n\n\nAnd sky.hdr has the north on the top when seen as a 2d image.\n\n\nI am not sure whether Peter's cal-file does any more advanced stuff\nrelated to his fisheye - it could be that he is correcting for some\nvignetting stuff that does not exist in you synthetic image. That would\nexplain the higher pixel values close to the edge.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006206.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
