{"body": "Lars,\nThanks a lot for this,\nIt seems to work although in a slightly modified version (rx +90)\nThe results are much closer in the central part of the image (I assume\nthe difference is only because of interpolation or anti aliasing\neffects...)And the brightest band at the horizon has almost disappeared\n(although not entirely... again is the anti aliasing to blame?)\nI've also noticed that for this process to work it is crucial that the\noriginal sky image has a normalized exposure (1) otherwise all the\nvalues are scaled down...\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006207.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "September 09, 2009 at 03:04AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006203", "id": "radiance-general_006207"}
