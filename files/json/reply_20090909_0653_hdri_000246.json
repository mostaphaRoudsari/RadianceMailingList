{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding here. I am sure that the\ndocumentation you refer to is related to the source images. These are\n8-bit coded, and allow values from 0-255. This means that below 20 and\nover 200 you get into the edges of this range. As the jpg's you get from\na digital camera are not linear mappings from luminance to pixel values,\nand a slight change in these edge pixel values is related to a huge\nchange in the luminance of the recorded scene, it gets impossible to\nreconstruct luminance values from such values. Have a look at the\ns-shaped response curve of your camera, it should explain this problem.\n\n\nSo hdr tools can use only this \"middle\" range, and this means that you\nmust make sure that the ranges of your overlap have a sufficient\noverlap. Also, of course, the darkest (shortest exposure time) image\nshould not contain any very bright pixels, and the brightest one\n(longest exposure time) no very dark ones. So if e.g. your brightest\nimage was taken with 1/2sec and has significant pixel values below 20,\ntake one more with 1sec time.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-September/000246.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
