{"body": "Hi Raquel,\n\n\nGenerally agreeing with Lars, I would like to add that it should not be\nimpossible\nto create a useful HDR image if the input exposures have RGB values greater\nthan\n200 or smaller than 20. Actually, as you pointed out it should be very\ndifficult to\ncapture bracketed sequences where any exposure fits into these limits.\n\n\nThe HDR creation algorithms generally employ a weighting scheme to underplay\nthe influence of over- and under-exposed pixels. This is usually a smooth\nfunction\ngiving higher weights to midtones and lower weights to extreme darks and\nlights.\nI think any tool that employs such a weighting scheme should be able to cope\nwith input images that have pixel values close to the edges of the RGB\nrange.\n\n\nCheers,\nOguz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-September/000247.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Oguz Akyuz", "created_at": "September 09, 2009 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "Oguz_Akyuz", "parent_id": "hdri_000245", "id": "hdri_000247"}
