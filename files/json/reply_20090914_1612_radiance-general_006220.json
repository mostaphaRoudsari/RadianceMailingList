{"body": "The star map that I have now is LDR, but I intend to create a new \nHDR version using the raw star data from Tycho-2. Unfortunately, \nthere are stars everywhere, so I'd need illums to cover pretty \nmuch the whole hemisphere. Since that'll wind up being 50-200 of \nthem, it will cost a lot in render-time, and add some complexity \nto the preprocessing. This is disappointing because a single glow \nsource would have sufficed, and accomplished almost the same \nthing.\n\n\nDo \"illum\" surfaces respond to \"rpict -ds\" ? I'll want smooth \npenumbras. If so, I can get by with fewer illums.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Mon, 14 Sep 2009, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006220.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "September 14, 2009 at 04:12PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006216", "id": "radiance-general_006220"}
