{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nI have never looked into night skies, but from what I observed, they \nshow little angular variance, as finally you have starts everywhere over \nthe dome. Maybe I am ignoring something important here, but can't you \nassume a gradient for the illuminance to be totally fine to light your \nscene? I would assume that towards the horizon you get much higher \nlevels due to \"light pollution\", but I cannot imagine that for the \nillumination of an object under the sky different \"densities\" of stars \nunder different angles really show up.\n\n\nBy the way, do you know the paper on night sky modeling by Henrik Wann \nJensen and others \"A Physically-Based Night Sky Model\"?\n\n\nCheers Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006221.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
