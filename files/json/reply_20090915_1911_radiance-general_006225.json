{"body": "Hi again...\n> I am not sure whether it is possible to force radiance to reuse an \n> ambient file without doing further refinement on it (...)\nThinking about this again... the fool-proof way would be to use the \nsimplified map for a first rendering run, derive ambient values from it \nand use these as -av values with -ab 0 and the high-res map in later \nruns. This should give you very fast and noise-free results...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006225.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
