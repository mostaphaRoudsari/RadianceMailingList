{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nOne additional thought that occurred to me this weekend. To simplify \nprocessing your star map through mksource (if this is the way you go), \nit might make sense to downsample (significantly) the super large hdr \nimage and then sample it back up to some manageable size. This should \nsmear out the values. Feeding this to mksource might then be easier.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-September/006229.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 21, 2009 at 06:16AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006216", "id": "radiance-general_006229"}
