{"body": "Hi there Jun,\n\n\nI'm not an expert and I'm sure that someone might correct me but.... you\nneed to apply the modifier that you are using to the glass description.\nthe term 'void' means that you are not applying a modifier. Also, you\nwill need to change the name of the modifier (or the name of the\npolygons) as I think that your polygons have been named 'clear'.\n\n\nTry this:\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    01_Clear_8_front\n10\n      0.077     0.082     0.082\n      0.857     0.894     0.877\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n01_Clear_8_front  glass   clear\n0\n0\n3     0.934     0.974     0.955\n\n\nPlease note the order.... Radiance will need to read what the modifier\nis BEFORE it can be applied to anything. I have never used this sort of\nmodifier before, so I'm not too sure on what the arguments are (and\nhence can't comment on them..??) and I'm not too sure why you have two\nof them (front and back) which are identical?\n\n\nhope this helps. Anyone else who can correct me on anything please but\nin!\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006233.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erik Moore", "created_at": "October 05, 2009 at 01:46AM", "created_by": "Erik_Moore", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006232", "id": "radiance-general_006233"}
