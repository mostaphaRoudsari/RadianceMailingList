{"body": "Hi Erik,\n\n\nThanks for giving some ideas on this and pointing in the right direction. I\nwas already stuck.\n\n\nIt seems BRTDfunc is already a material and we may not need the glass\nmaterial definition anymore (pls. correct me here).  \n\n\nAlso it may seem that we may need to add the use of glazing.cal as mentioned\nin http://finance.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/DesktopRadiance/message/14.  I\ntried the below definition and it worked.  Although I'm still not sure if\nthis is the correct way.  Any additional clues is highly welcome.\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    Clear\n10\n      0.077     0.082     0.082\n      0.857     0.894     0.877\n      0 0 0\n      glazing.cal\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nYou're right on the same numbers of front and back reflectance from Optics 5\n.rad file and will need to check the glass.  I think Optics 5 may have a bug\non Radiance export but will verify:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop5/2006_Radiance_Workshop/Pre\nsentations/Ward_RadianceFeatures.pdf\n\n\nThanks and best regards,\nJun\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006234.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Edilberto Calixihan", "created_at": "October 05, 2009 at 03:15AM", "created_by": "Edilberto_Calixihan", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006232", "id": "radiance-general_006234"}
