{"body": "Hello Erik,\n\n\nActually your reply was very helpful.  It pointed me to where else to look\nand think that BRTDfunc may be enough of a description.  \n\n\nMy rendered picture looks the same as using the \"glass\" material though, and\nit looks like I did not capture the glass reflectivity well.  Anymore help\nis very very welcome.\n\n\nCheers!\n\n\nBest regards,\nJun\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Edilberto Calixihan", "created_at": "October 05, 2009 at 04:10AM", "created_by": "Edilberto_Calixihan", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006232", "id": "radiance-general_006236"}
