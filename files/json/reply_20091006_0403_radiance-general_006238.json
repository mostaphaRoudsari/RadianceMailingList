{"body": "Thanks Jack and Erick,\n\n\nI got BRTDfunc to work on double glazing with glaze2.cal following the\nprevious post from Marija that:\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc double_glazing\n10\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_g),ft(t1_g),fr(rf2_g)),cr(fr(rb2_g),ft(t2_g),fr(rb1_g)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_b),ft(t1_b),fr(rf2_b)),cr(fr(rb2_b),ft(t2_b),fr(rb1_b)))\nft(t1_r)*ft(t2_r)\nft(t1_g)*ft(t2_g)\nft(t1_b)*ft(t2_b)\n        0 0 0\n        glaze2.cal\n\n\n0\n9\n        0 0 0\n        0 0 0\n        0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nCurrently trying out glaze1.cal and hope that I get it right.  Thanks for\nthe clues.  I also reversed the window surface normal to point to the room\ninterior where my camera is.  I may be able to modify the BRTDfunc and glaze\nparameters thanks to your clues.\n\n\nI was trying out various glass reflectance to see if it would affect the\nrendered image and it did.\n\n\nThanks very much!\n\n\nBest regards,\nJun\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006238.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Edilberto Calixihan", "created_at": "October 06, 2009 at 04:03AM", "created_by": "Edilberto_Calixihan", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006232", "id": "radiance-general_006238"}
