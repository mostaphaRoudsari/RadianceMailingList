{"body": "Hi Ignacio!\n\n\nThanks for the quick reply! Just to avoid misunderstandings, the -s \nparameter in falsecolor does not change the radiometric values but the \nscale that is applied to them in the resulting image (as this is a \none-way, this does not reallt matter). So with -s, you define the range \nof pixel values that will mapped to the color scale. The multiplier is \ngiven following -m, and the default (to get from radiometric to \nphotometric according to the internal efficacy of 153 lm/W that is used \nby Radiance) is -m 153. So that is why I was wondering whether giving -m \n1 would be enough.\n\n\nMy main concern is at the moment whether the HMI-source photometry is \ncorrectly transfered into radiometry by only using ies2rad with the \nlamptab (unfortunately I do not have more detailed information on the \nemission spectrum and luminous efficacy).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006241.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
