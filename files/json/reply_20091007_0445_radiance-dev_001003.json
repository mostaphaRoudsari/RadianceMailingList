{"body": "Hi,\n\n\n> I am a new user to radiance. I have compiled the Radiance V3.9 code in Ubuntu 8.1 and there were some errors during the compilation. I ran the tests in ray/test directory and the results are attached in text file. Kindly let me know whether the radiance installation is alright or I have to reinstall them.\n\n\nI doubt that the tests are uptodate at all, the Scons buildsystem doesn't seem\nto be maintained. You might want to look at what I'm doing for the official\nDebian packaging, see http://git.recluse.de/?p=debian/pkg-radiance.git;a=summary\nIt shouldn't be hard to build the current Debian version into proper packages\nfor older Ubuntu releases. I could even throw them into an Ubuntu PPA and build\nit for older releases.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                            Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n http://bzed.de                                http://www.debian.org\n GPG Fingerprints: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n                   ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485 DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-October/001003.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "October 07, 2009 at 04:45AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001002", "id": "radiance-dev_001003"}
