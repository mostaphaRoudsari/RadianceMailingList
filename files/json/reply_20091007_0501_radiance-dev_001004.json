{"body": "Hi Ganesh,\n\n\nI have not used the scons tool to compile radiance before. However, it \nlooks to me like these errors relate to testing compiled radiance \ncommands rather than actually doing the compile. To assure yourself of a \nclean compile it might make more sense to use the \" makeall\" script to \ndo a fresh compile:\n\n\n    ./makeall clean\n    ./makeall install\n\n\nthen if you get errors you can report those as they will relate to the \nactual compile process.\n\n\nDo people actually use Scons to build radiance? Is this something that \nshould still be maintained or perhaps removed?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-October/001004.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 07, 2009 at 05:01AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001002", "id": "radiance-dev_001004"}
