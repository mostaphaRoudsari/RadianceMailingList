This would be required \nto get correct radiance values for rgb from the candela-distribution of \na source. I would e.g. assume an efficacy of 100lm/W for my source, and \nif ies2rad would use 179 instead, the radiance values in my simulation \nwould be by far too low...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006246.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
