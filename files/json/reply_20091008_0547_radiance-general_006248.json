These are interpreted only by Radiance\ntools. However, it seems that you use this extension for scripting? What\nshell do you use? This question is most probably a shell-related one,\nnot a Radiance-related one.\n\n\nI am just not sure because of the file-extension...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006248.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
