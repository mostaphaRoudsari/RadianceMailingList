{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nlamp.tab provides information to adjust the lamp chromaticity and apply a lamp lumen depreciation factor based on the source type. Up until now, I always thought using -t white for all sources in the scene was safer (OK, easier) because I like to roll in my lamp lumen depreciation factor with all the other things that go into a total light loss factor (LLF). I consider lamp lumen depreciation, luminaire dirt depreciation and room surface dirt depreciation, maintenance factor, and the product of all those is the LLF, which I apply all at once with the -m option of ies2rad. This was my main rationale for using -t white for all sources, but also the distinct coloration of the different sources was a problem. I forgot that you could white balance the image after the fact with pfilt, though, which leads me to my next rabbit hole:\n\n\nGiven that one can do a final white balancing after the fact, it does seem that we should be striving for maximum accuracy with our electric light source descriptions and specifying the lamp type/color. Just playing with the lampcolor script, I get some different luminances by changing the lamp type. I used white, incandescent, and fluorescent, and spread 200 lumens over a 1 meter polygon, and ended up with 63.7, 60.5, and 54.1 cd/m^2 respectively. Since lampcolor uses the same lamp.tab data file as ies2rad does, we can expect similar variation in light sources created using ies2rad and using different lamp types. Seems like a potential for error to me, but then again obtaining accurate CIExy data and lumen maintenance values for all the new lamps coming out seems a bit daunting too. Is this splitting hairs? I'm curious what others in the community are doing in this regard.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Guglielmetti  IES, LEED AP\nBuilding Energy Efficiency Engineer\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n1617 Cole Blvd, MS-5202\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n303.275.4319\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006253.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 08, 2009 at 10:38AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006239", "id": "radiance-general_006253"}
