{"body": "Thanks Chris,\n\n\nYou are right-on, the reductions in luminance I was seeing were directly attributable to the lumen depreciation factors used for each light source. The color shifts are not having a net impact on the photometric values. I looked at five different light sources with lampcolor, converted the rgb radiance to luminance values, and the differences all correlated to the lamp lumen depreciation being applied. Phew.\n\n\nI will continue using white as a default light source color (and remind myself once again that that lumen depreciation is being applied if I do stray from white!).\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006256.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 08, 2009 at 02:49PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006254", "id": "radiance-general_006256"}
