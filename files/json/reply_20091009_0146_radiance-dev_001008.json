Look which header files are missing, search\nwhich package they're included in and install them\n- if you want to install to /usr/local, you might need to run the install part\nas root\n\n\nThe better solution for you might be to run\n\n\nsudo apt-get install radiance radiance-materials radiance-doc\n\n\nas Ubuntu 8.10 ships with radiance 3R9.\nDon't forget to read /usr/share/doc/radiance/README.Debian afterwards.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                            Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n http://bzed.de                                http://www.debian.org\n GPG Fingerprints: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n                   ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485 DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-October/001008.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "October 09, 2009 at 01:46AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001007", "id": "radiance-dev_001008"}
