{"body": "Ganesh.\n\n\nOne problem is that you don't have X11 development files installed (like\n\"X11/Xlib.h\", \"X11/Xutil.h\"). Add the package from your repository. That\nshould deal with most of the problems.\n\n\nThen you don't have permissions to add or delete files in \"/usr/local/\"\nwhere Radiance would be installed by default. You have to run \"./makeall\ninstall\" as a \"sudo\" command or as root.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-October/001009.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 09, 2009 at 01:54AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001007", "id": "radiance-dev_001009"}
