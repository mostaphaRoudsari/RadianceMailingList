{"body": "Hi Ganesh,\n\n\nThe key to your problem is written in the last line of the script  \noutput -- apparently, your version of Unix lacks a \"mail\" command, so  \nyou didn't get any notification.  I expect your results are sitting in  \nthe file you named in the working directory.  Did you check?  The  \nximage command may be used to display it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006258.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 09, 2009 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006257", "id": "radiance-general_006258"}
