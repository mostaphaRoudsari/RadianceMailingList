{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> I will continue using white as a default light source color\n\n\nHm, would that reflect the photometry to radiometry conversion in the\ncase of a source with line spectrum? I would have usually done the same,\nand used a WHITE keyword in my IES. However, I am not sure about the\nconversion of a source with a non continous spectrum to radiometric\nunits (which is what I need). I had been hoping that the lamp-lookup in\nies2rad might care about this.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
