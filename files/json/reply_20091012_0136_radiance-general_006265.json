When you say \"used a WHITE keyword in your IES\", do you mean using the \"-t white\" option in your ies2rad command, or actually adding a keyword to the ies file? Because ies2rad ignores the keywords in the ies file\n\n\nThat's not quite correct. ies2rad looks at the [LAMP] entry and\ntries to match an entry in lamp.tab to the string found. Mostly\nthat doesn't work because there is no standard in naming lamp\nsources. The few matches I remember were accidental.\n\n\nIt's better to specify the lamp type on the command line even\nif you're not actually interested in the light color. I even thought\nabout patching ies2rad to make the WHITE type the default and\nskip the lookup altogether. That would garantee a predictable\nconversion.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006265.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 12, 2009 at 01:36AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006254", "id": "radiance-general_006265"}
