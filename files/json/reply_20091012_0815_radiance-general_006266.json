{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nTwo words: \"my bad\". You are absolutely correct; if left to its own devices, ies2rad will scan the header lines for a lamp type and look for a match in the lamp.tab. Sorry about that! I guess I forgot about that option because it seemed so random I never understood why anyone would want to leave it up to such a potentially unreliable method, and have defaulted to using the -t option to explicitly specify my lamp types. Indeed, Greg notes in the manpage, regarding the whole [LAMP] header:\n\n\n\"This method of assigning colors to fixtures is less than perfect, and the IES would do  well to  include  explicit  spectral information somehow in their specification.\"\n\n\nIn any event, I apologize for the mis-information. If you ask me, I feel like this is one more reason to always use the -t option.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006266.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 12, 2009 at 08:15AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006254", "id": "radiance-general_006266"}
