{"body": "Hi Andrew,\n\n\nWith funding from Southern California Edison through the Heschong- \nMahone Group and separate funding from LBNL, I've been working on the  \n3-phase method described.  We have a few tools in the HEAD version of  \nRadiance now, which I'll be talking about next week at the Radiance  \nworkshop.  Unfortunately, I haven't prepared any presentation  \nmaterials yet, but if you make it to Boston, I will have something by  \nthen and we can have a nice conversation.\n\n\nThe lack of BTDF data is a serious issue, and could be addressed with  \nappropriate modeling.  I don't know how well rtcontrib would work for  \nthis, as I've never tried it, but it's an interesting suggestion.  The  \nfolks in the Windows group at LBNL have been using TracePro to  \ngenerate their BTDFs when they aren't taking measurements.\n\n\nIt's an ambitious project you have, and not something you're going to  \nsort out in an afternoon.  What's your deadline?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006287.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 15, 2009 at 01:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006283", "id": "radiance-general_006287"}
