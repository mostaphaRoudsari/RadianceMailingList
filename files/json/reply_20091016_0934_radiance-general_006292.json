{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for your reply.  Unfortunately I\u00b9m not going to Boston.  Now I have\nyet another reason to wish I was going.\n\n\nI\u00b9m glad you\u00b9ve been able to further develop the 3-phase method.  I see\nincreasing demand for this type of analysis for complex fa\u00e7ade shading\nsystems.  This is the fourth time I\u00b9ve started down this route \u00ad the other\nthree times stopped abruptly for various reasons.  Twice before with\npanelite products and once with an engineered scattering window film.  The\nemail I sent yesterday was a  partially complete left in my drafts folder\nfrom two months ago - the last time this I was looking into this approach.\n\n\nI don\u00b9t have a hard deadline yet.  The goal for now is to develop a working\nmodel and then focus on accuracy later.  Ideally I\u00b9d have something that\nworks in the next 2 weeks.\n\n\nHopefully Panelite will have measured BTDF data in a few months that we slot\ninto the analysis.  If measured BTDF data doesn't become available then\nwe\u00b9ll focus on improving the accuracy of the simulated BTDF.\n\n\nSo I guess my first step is approximating a BTDF with Radiance.  I was\nthinking I could a uniform sky above the panelite model as input and a\nhemisphere of points below as sensors.  With rtcontrib I could determine the\nlight output in a direction for each input direction.  The input directions\ncould be tregenza sky divisions (?).  The output could be phi/lambda\ndirections (?).  I imagine the key to a decent BTDF is lots of samples for\neach output direction.  Maybe I create a grid of 1000(00?) points in a plane\njust below the panelite and use a script to create a hemisphere of sensor\npoints centered at each grid point.\n\n\nI know very little about BTDF\u00b9s and even less about creating them so I could\nuse any tips, tricks, guidance, watch its, how are you going to account\nfor?s and examples that anyone is willing to offer.\n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006292.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 16, 2009 at 09:34AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006283", "id": "radiance-general_006292"}
