{"body": "Hi Andrew,\n\n\nI guess I should write a program or script to create a BTDF file for  \nan arbitrary shading system.  It's not particularly difficult to do  \nthis using rtcontrib, but I need to find time to do it.  The next  \ncouple of weeks are crazy between the workshop and the HDR Imaging  \nbook deadline, so I don't think I'll get to it before then.  I won't  \nbe much help with your deadline, unfortunately.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006294.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 18, 2009 at 11:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006283", "id": "radiance-general_006294"}
