{"body": "Hi (Zdravo) Marija,\n\n\nAs far as I could tell, the fix given by Perez in the erratum (link  \nbelow) is in the code:\n\n\n\t/* correction de modele de Perez solar energy ...*/\n\tif ( (epsilon > 1.065) && (epsilon < 2.8) )\n\n\nhttp://www.asrc.cestm.albany.edu/perez/publications/Solar%20Resource%20Assessment%20and%20Modeling/More%20Papers%20on%20Resource%20Assessment%20and%20Satellites/erratum-93.pdf\n\n\nNote that the AW model was based *only* on data from Berkeley.  This  \nis perhaps why the overcast conditions in the AW model are different  \nto CIE overcast (which has been validated as a reliable overcast model  \nfor many European sites).  See:\nJ.
