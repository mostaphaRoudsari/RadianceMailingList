{"body": "In your first image it looks like you may have light leaks at the right hand side where your floor meets the wall, possibly due to rounding error in your geometry export/conversion. Try building your walls with thickness and stopping your floor surface exactly at the inner wall surface if they're not already (i.e. inner and outer surface) to help keep stray rays out.\n\n\nThe aiming failure is because your surfaces appear to be triangulated, so the direct sampling routine anticipates a rectangular source, but some samples miss because the surface is only half a rectangle. Try checking that all your surfaces are precisely planar and exporting with a method that doesn't triangulate. If you're using obj2rad see the -f option.\n\n\nIf you have an oversized ground plane or full city modeled outside the building, your -ar value may not be high enough. Increasing ar should smooth out the interior ambient calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006305.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "October 30, 2009 at 06:40AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006304", "id": "radiance-general_006305"}
