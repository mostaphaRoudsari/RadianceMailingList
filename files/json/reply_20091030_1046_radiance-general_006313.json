{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI'm not able to reproduce this error with the latest version of  \nRadiance.  What version are you running?  Is anyone getting my e-mails?\n\n\nJack's example runs fine, and if you add a floor:\n\n\nvoid plastic gray\n0\n0\n5 .2 .2 .2 0 0\n\n\n!genbox gray floor 10 10 .1 | xform -t 0 0 -.1001\n\n\n...you get to see the shadows through the windows.  I also tried using  \n\"void\" instead of \"red\" as the first antimatter modifier and that  \nworks, as does making the wall infinitely thin (single surface), so I  \nthink you must be running version 3.8 or your cut-out surfaces are  \ncoincident or something...\n\n\nThe thing that doesn't work is using a non-void material as the first  \nantimatter argument to cut a hole in a single-surface wall.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006313.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 30, 2009 at 10:46AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006306", "id": "radiance-general_006313"}
