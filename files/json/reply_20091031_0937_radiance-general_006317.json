{"body": "David,\n\n\nIf you installed the Mac binaries in /usr/local/bin and the \nlibraries in /usr/local/lib/ray, then you don't have to run \nany \"makeall\" commands, and you are almost all the way there. You \nmay also want to copy the man pages from ray/doc/man \ninto /usr/local/man.\n\n\nAll you should need to do is set up your environment. If you are \nusing the bash shell (check with \"env | grep SHELL\") then add the \nfollowing lines to your ~/.bashrc file:\n\n\nexport PATH=.:/usr/local/bin:${PATH}\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\nexport MANPATH=/usr/local/man:${MANPATH}\n\n\nAnd then re-source that file with \"source ~/.bashrc\" and you \nshould be good to go. That's an effective installation path, as \nfar as I know.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to install Radiance on a Mac (or Linux machine) is to \nunzip everything in the /usr/local directory, change to the \nnewly-created /usr/local/ray directory, then in there type \n\"./makeall install\". That's also how I build for my Mac and Linux \nmachines. It helps because I can just move /usr/local/ray to \n/usr/local/ray_old when a new version comes out.\n\n\nI hope this helps! If you keep having problems, please post the \nerror messages, as you've already done. Among all the folks on \nthis list, we've seen them all.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Sat, 31 Oct 2009, David Appelfeld wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006317.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "October 31, 2009 at 09:37AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006316", "id": "radiance-general_006317"}
