{"body": "Rob,\n\n\nThe command-line options that work are basically just those: the \nmandatory time arguments (with a new year argument \"-y 2009\"), \nthe optional location (-a -o and -m), and turbidity (-t).\n\n\nThe program writes a complete sky description that should \nprobably be redirected to a file. For example:\n\n\ngenutahsky 10 31 13EDT -y 2009 -a 42.36 -o 71.06 -t 3 > sky.rad\n\n\ngenerates the sky above me right now. Then you can generate your \noctree as normal:\n\n\noconv sky.rad scene.rad > scene.oct\n\n\nMake sure that all of the ancilliary files (stardome.rad, \nTychoSkymap...hdr, *.cal) are put into either the current working \ndirectory or wherever the library files are.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Sat, 31 Oct 2009, Rob Guglielmetti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006320.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "October 31, 2009 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006319", "id": "radiance-general_006320"}
