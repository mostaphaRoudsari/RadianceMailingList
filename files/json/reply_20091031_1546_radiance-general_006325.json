In fact, that may confuse things a bit. I recommend you  \nleave the unpacked ray source folder someplace in your user directory.  \nWhat I do is just have a  radiance folder, and inside there an  \n\"install\" folder, where I download the head release archive (and keep  \na copy of the auxiliary files). I always unpack the HEAD release from  \nthere, so that the ray directory always has the latest source code  \nfrom which I can compile and install. I also add an entry in my  \nMANPATH variable to point to the ./doc/man folder inside my ray  \nfolder; this way whenever I call up a manpage for a radiance program  \nman is pulling it up from the latest HEAD release.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006325.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 31, 2009 at 03:46PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006316", "id": "radiance-general_006325"}
