It's an implementation of the so- \ncalled Utah sky model in Radiance. Works like gensky, but uses the  \n\"practical analytic model for daylight\" as proposed by Pretham,  \nShirley and Smits in a paper from 1999. Also incorporates nighttime  \nskies. Very fun stuff!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006326.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 31, 2009 at 03:59PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006322", "id": "radiance-general_006326"}
