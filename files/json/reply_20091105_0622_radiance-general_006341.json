The overcast\nsky created by gensky is the CIE standard overcast sky which is\nused for DF/ADF calculations.\n\n\nIf you think your results are to low you should check your the conversion\nfrom radiance values to DF. Are you using the right options for rtrace?\nIs your reference value (unobstructed sky) correct?\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Nov 5, 2009 at 11:43 AM, caria.roberto at tiscali.it\n<caria.roberto at tiscali.it> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006341.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 05, 2009 at 06:22AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000309", "id": "radiance-general_006341"}
