{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> Someone did and included it in the distribution. I think it's called\n> xshowtrace.\n\n\nGood hint. However, I think that this use case would require to go from \nthe source, not from the view point. I guess that one could get rtrace \nto get the intersection and direction vectors by taking the light source \nas first view point. But I am not aware of anyone who did that.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006342.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
