{"body": "Roberto,\n\n\nUse of gendaylit for overcast sky conditions would be wrong because  \nthe 'overcast' skies (note plural) produced by the Perez All-Weather  \nmodel do not correspond to the strict CIE definition, i.e. L_alt =  \nL_zenith(1 + 2sin(alt))/3.\n\n\nActually, gendaylit gives you a range of overcast types depending on  \nthe absolute diffuse horizontal illuminance.  The ratio between zenith  \nand horizon luminance seems to increase with higher values for  \nhorizontal illuminance.  As several users have noted, gendaylit bombs  \nout with a warning:\n\n\nWarning : skyclearness or skybrightness out of range ;\n  Check your input parameters\n\n\nfor certain input values.  The minimum diffuse horizontal illuminance  \nthat works appears to be 8603 (lux).  Try:\n\n\ngendaylit 7 1 12 -L 0 8603\n\n\ngendaylit 7 1 12 -L 0 8602\n\n\nThe diffuse horizontal illuminance upper limit for an 'overcast' sky  \n(i.e. direct normal illuminance = 0) is somewhere 80kLux and 90kLux.   \nWhich is, of course, improbably high for any sort of overcast sky.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006344.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "November 06, 2009 at 02:36AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000309", "id": "radiance-general_006344"}
