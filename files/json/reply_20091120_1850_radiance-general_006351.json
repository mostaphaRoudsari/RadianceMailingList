{"body": "Hi Anne!\n> Yes - have tried both - and no difference. I get however an oconv\n> warning that my srcs.rad file is empty.

If this does not work, you know that the initial scene\ndescription has problems to get rendered.\n\n\nOne thing that just catches my eye, why does your sphere have a negative\nradius (-1000)? If you wanted the normals to point inside, you should\nuse a bubble object instead of a sphere object still with positive\nradius. I do not know about the effect of a negative radius at all and\nwould guess that it is not valid.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006351.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
