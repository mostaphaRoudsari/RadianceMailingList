{"body": "Thanks Lars and Santiago,\nYes you are right, it doesn't make any sense to have the sun at infinite\ndistance outside the sphere of finite distance. And yes, I'll keep it\nsimple, no optimization with mksource at this point ;o).  And a third: Yes -\nRadiance is tricky, therefore it is so good that this list is active!\n\n\nHowever, when changing the 'sphere environment' from sphere to source I\ncannot display my scene any longer. My source description is\nenv_glow source sphereenv\n0 0\n4 0 1 0 360\nThe simulation approach now follows exactly the one in the Image Based\nLighting tutorial from Debevec, p. 31,\nhttp://www.debevec.org/CGAIBL2/ibl-tutorial-cga2002.pdf. I get a white image\nand the rvu message:\nrvu: warning - compute error for colorpict \"hdr_env\"\nrvu: Division by zero\nrvu: Division by zero\n\n\nDo you maybe also have tips on how I can solve this?\nThanks!\nAnne\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006355.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anne Iversen", "created_at": "November 23, 2009 at 05:38PM", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006348", "id": "radiance-general_006355"}
