{"body": "- Yes, I divided with zero in the .cal file. Including an if sentence\nsolved this problem - and now it works perfectly!\nThanks Santiago, from a smiling Anne.\n\n\nIt would however be nice if the location of the sun could be rotated without\nchanging the vector coordinates. I would like this to be possible because I\nhave calculated the sun position from the pixel coordinates of my original\n.hdr image, which I afterwards have rotated. I can of course take into\naccount the rotation in the pixel coordinates, but if the other approach is\npossible it would be easier for me ;o)\n\n\n/Anne\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006359.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anne Iversen", "created_at": "November 24, 2009 at 07:48PM", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006348", "id": "radiance-general_006359"}
