{"body": "Hi Thomas\n\n\nthanks for your quick reply. It took me a few days to try to understand the\npossibilities you suggested.\n\n\nThe 'falsecolor' sounds quite interesting, but as far as I can tell it does\nnot allow \"automatic\" evaluation, i.e. create a file / files that can be\nsomehow scanned for \"hit\" or \"no hit\" per surface. My problem is, that\nvisually evaluating images after the simulation does not seem practical due\nto form / size / repetitions.\n\n\nAnd I'm afraid I didn't understand if the stencil method could really help,\nbut it seems evaluation (or result) is still a \"picture\" - again not a \"hit\"\nor \"no hit\" information for a given surface. Actually, I didn't understand\nthe method, period (and haven't found the time to set up an example and play\naround with it).\n\n\nSomething like\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop7/Content/Augsburger/Germain\nAugsburgerPresentation.pdf, page 8, but with \"continuous\" and not\n\"discrete\" sensors that can be evaluated for hit-or-miss somehow is what I\nhave in mind.\n\n\nI must admit of course (if not clear from the above, anyway) that my\nknowledge of the possibilities of Radiance is rather limited.\n\n\nThanks\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "November 24, 2009 at 11:40PM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006346", "id": "radiance-general_006360"}
