I just used the rtrace output\noption to produce the material name of the hit surface.\n\n\nExample input:\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n\n\nExample output:\nskyglow\ngrey_40\ngrey_40\n\n\nIf you use a unique material name you can afterwards parse the\noutput with a simple awk one-liner to get the number of hits. Is\nthat more what you need?\n\n\n> And I'm afraid I didn't understand if the stencil method could really help,\n> but it seems evaluation (or result) is still a \"picture\" - again not a \"hit\"\n> or \"no hit\" information for a given surface.\n\n\nThe output is a picture if you want rtrace to produce a picture.\nIt only depends on the options for rtrace. The nice thing about\nthe stencil method is that it generates ray origins and directions\nover a surface, instead of a fixed size grid.\n\n\n> Something like\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop7/Content/Augsburger/Germain\n> AugsburgerPresentation.pdf, page 8, but with \"continuous\" and not\n> \"discrete\" sensors that can be evaluated for hit-or-miss somehow is what I\n> have in mind.\n\n\nStencil could create the x,y,z,dx,dy,dz coordinates but only\nfor one half of the cylinder (the one facing you). And the\nresolution would degrade towards the edges.\n\n\nPerhaps you could outline your problem. Someone might have\nanother idea.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006361.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 25, 2009 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006346", "id": "radiance-general_006361"}
