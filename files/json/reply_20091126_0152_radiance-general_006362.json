The multitude of\npossible switches for rtrace is quite a challenge, though.\n\n\nWhat I want to do is this: I have a large building with external shading\nthat has a non-trivial geometric form. This shading is to be opened (to a\ncertain degree) at a given azimuth only if no direct radiation which would\nhit the facade can get past in this location. So the task is to let the sun\ntravel around the building and for each position of interest check if any\ndirect hits can be found on any surface of the building fa\u00e7ade behind the\nshading.\n\n\nYour suggestion seems to imply that this should be possible with rtrace.\nDoes setting -dr 0 mean that only direct beams are considered by rtrace? Or\ndoes one need a good combination of -ds, -dt and -dc? The sun is the only\n\"active\" source of light. I would set reflection of all shading surfaces to\nZero.\n\n\nI am not sure what your input example describes. Having the material names\nof \"hit\" surfaces given would seem O.K. if this can be constrained to\n\"direct\" only, as the goal is to have \"no direct hit\".\n\n\nRegards\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006362.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "November 26, 2009 at 01:52AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006346", "id": "radiance-general_006362"}
