{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nI was out all last week for thanksgiving.  I hope my reply is not too late\nto be helpful.\n\n\nI haven't done the three phase method yet. I'm validating my bsdf data and\nhave been side tracked by other projects.  But I'll get to it soon...\n\n\n> Question is how to calculate Transmission matrix with BTDF values for the\n> specific window or group of windows?\nThis can be measured via a goniophotometer, exported from LBNL Window, or\nsimulated using Trace Pro, or radiance using rtcontrib.\n\n\n> I see it should be some file in xml format, but not sure how to create it when\n> classic transmittance and reflectance data are known for the glazing; and also\n> what format if has.\n\n\nThe BSDF data should be in LBNL\u00b9s window xml format.  I enquired LBNL about\nthe format in September and at that time the documentation wasn\u00b9t complete.\nI can send you the draft specification I received in September if you like\nbut it's probably worth contacting LBNL to see if documentation has\nprogressed.\n\n\n> Also for non-complex glazing systems (like double or triple glazings, without\n> internal blinds and similar), is it possible to compose this BTDF matrix\n> \"manually\"?\n\n\nLBNL Window 6 will write an xml format bsdf file for data a window system\ndescribed in it's program.  I found it helpful to do this to reverse\nengineer the XML file format.\n\n\nBut... The three phase method is intended for a system that requires a bsdf\nto characterize light transport.  If your material can be characterized\nusing a standard radiance material (like a simple double/triple glazing\nwithout blinds) than the more conventional daylight coefficient approach\n(one-phase?) will be easier, faster and more accurate.\n\n\nAndrew \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/24/09 12:51 AM, \"Marija Velickovic\" <maricanis at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n\n> Hi again,\n> \n> I've just found out that, I somehow skipped reading of mails with \"BSDF\" in\n> the subject, and found out that Andrew McNeil had similar problem last month\n> \n> In mail \n> http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006296.\n> html there is a note about script for BSDF calculation based on rtcontrib.\n> \n> Andrew, were script calculation results good?\n> Did you manage to make complete 3-phase calculation?\n> \n> Marija.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006368.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "November 30, 2009 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006354", "id": "radiance-general_006368"}
