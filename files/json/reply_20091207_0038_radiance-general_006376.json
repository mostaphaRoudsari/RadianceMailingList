{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nIt good to know that someone else had the same problem, even if we don't\nhave the solution (at least, for now).\nI know that Radiance is much faster and easier to use in Linux, since I'm\nusually using it there.\nI had an idea to include in some Python scripts in Windows rtcontib\ncalculation, and was exploring options with parallel prosesses. Even without\nthem, rtcontrib works fast and good enough in Windows.\n\n\nThanks again,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006376.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "December 07, 2009 at 12:38AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006369", "id": "radiance-general_006376"}
