{"body": "Claus.\n\n\nI used ImageMagick to convert from fisheye to rectangular projections.\nI wasn't much concerned with the accuracy so I can't tell if it's\nappropriate for you. You can find more here:\n\n\nhttp://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php\n\n\nhttp://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/polar/index.php\n\n\nI also remember that I used one of the Radiance binaries to convert\nfrom one projection to another. I can't remember which tool it was and\nwhich conversions are possible. If you use a non-Radiance source image\nyou have to convert it to Radiance hdr format and add the view\nspecification to allow the conversion.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 7, 2009 at 12:41 PM, Claus B.
