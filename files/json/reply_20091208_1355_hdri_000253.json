{"body": "Not sure where you see think the Mirrorball Closeup is wrong. When cropped right at the 180 deg circle, it fits the bill just fine.\n\n\nA free alternative is using Hugin: http://hugin.sourceforge.net\nAlso, there's the Photoshop Plugin Flexify2 (which I prefer for workflow reasons): http://www.flamingpear.com/flexify.html\n\n\nThere's a tutorial on all three methods in my book, pages 282ff. Can get it on www.hdri-handbook.com or on SafariBooks.\n\n\nBest,\nChristian\n\n\nOn Dec 8, 2009, at 12:04 AM, Claus B.
