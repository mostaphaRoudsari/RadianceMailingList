{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nFor daylight factor calculation in Radiance you can use *dayfact* script\nincluded in Radiance distribution.\nIt has interactive input ,so you can input all data you need, and it will\ncalculate Df and various related images.\n\n\nIf you want to calculate in only in few points, you can do it simple,\ncalculate illuminance in points inside the building for overcast sky (with\nrtrace program), and just divide this values with overcast sky horizontal\nilluminance value.\nFor example overcast sky for Paris for diffuse horizontal illuminance\n10000lux\ngensky 6 22 +11 -c -a 48.817 -o -2.483 -m -15 -B 55.866\n\n\n-B is irradiance an is calculated as 10000/179=55.866\n\n\nAnd rtrace command would be like:\nrtrace -I+ -h- -oov -ab 5 -ad 1024 -as 256 -aa 0.15 -ar 1000 octree.oct|\nrcalc -e '$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=$3;\n$4=(0.265*$4+0.670*$5+0.065*$6)*179'<points.txt >output.txt\n\n\n\n\nNote that you should put appropriate calculation parameters in rtrace to\nhave accurate results.\nrcalc command above converts rtrace output from RGB to 1 illuminance value.\n\n\nSo when you got illuminances inside the building just divide them with\n10000, to get DF values, or directly in rcalc divide with 10000 to get Df\nvalues on output:\n$4=(0.265*$4+0.670*$5+0.065*$6)*179/10000\n\n\nHope this helps,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006382.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "December 10, 2009 at 01:35AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006381", "id": "radiance-general_006382"}
