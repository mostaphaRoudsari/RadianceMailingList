{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nThe setting for trans are confusing to say the least (might be worth \nsearching the archives for threads on the topic). The mapping between \ntrans and something like glass is not 1:1. Note also that the Radiance \nglass material uses \"transmissivity\" not transmittance, this term can be \ncalculated from transmittance. How did you figure out the parameters \nthat you have for your trans material?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006383.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 10, 2009 at 06:12AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006380", "id": "radiance-general_006383"}
