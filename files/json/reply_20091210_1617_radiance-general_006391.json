{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for your response, that d= option behavior makes sense now, but leads\nto a question about the number of output directions in illum.dat...\n\n\nMy BSDF has 18 \"latitudes\"  and 24 \"azimuths\"  (432 divisions)\nThe resulting illum.dat is 13x39 = 507 angles\n\n\nAfter considering your response, I guess the difference between 432 and 507\nis a result of a BSDF pattern that doesn't match the typical radiance\nhemisphere division scheme used by mkillum?\n\n\nI'm guessing that mkillum gets from 432 to 507 by:\nsqrt(432/pi) = 12\n12*pi = 38\n12+1 x 38+1  =  13 x 39  = 507\nAm I close?  I don't have an explanation for adding one to each dimension.\n\n\nFinally, the sampling pattern of my BSDF (18x24) and the hemisphere division\nused by mkillum (13x39) results in double-sampling of some BSDF angles and\nnon-sampling of others.  In conclusion I would be best served by using the\ntypical radiance hemisphere division ( m x pi*m ) to generate a BSDF that\n\"agrees\" with mkillum.  (or should I stop speculating...)\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/10/09 2:55 PM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006391.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "December 10, 2009 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006388", "id": "radiance-general_006391"}
