{"body": "Sorry i made a mistake. I just want to compare the glass 3     0.325 0.325\n0.325  and trans 7     0.325 0.325 0.325 0 0 1 1 (not 0.3).\n\n\nIn trans, the transmissive specularity is 1 which means the total daylight\ntransmitted through the material will be specularly transmitted, like glass.\nSo i defined the transmissive specularity is 1.\n\n\nActually i had a look the webpage and i define the trans followed the\ninstruction in the page.\n\n\nNote also that the Radiance glass material uses \"transmissivity\" not\ntransmittance,\nso does trans use \"transmittance\" in the first three paremeters? What is the\ndifference between transmittance and transmissivity?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006393.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor Li", "created_at": "December 10, 2009 at 07:22PM", "created_by": "Victor_Li", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006380", "id": "radiance-general_006393"}
