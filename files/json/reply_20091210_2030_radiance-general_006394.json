{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nThat's some good guessing!  Yes, the difference is due to the very  \ndifferent sampling strata.  I had to check my code (line 444 of src/ \ngen/mkillum2.c) to verify.  I don't add 1, but round-off to the  \nnearest integer, rather than the lesser one.\n\n\nWith regards to the mismatch of samples, this does cause some issues,  \nparticularly near the zenith, where the altitude/azimuth strata used  \nby mkillum are a very poor match to the Klems/Tregenza strata used for  \nthe BSDF.  Mkillum does a reasonable job with normalization and sample  \ndistribution to make sure some rays go through each little window (and  \nthe s= setting can still affect this).  So long as the light and  \ndistribution are not simultaneously \"peaky,\" it all works out.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006394.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 10, 2009 at 08:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006388", "id": "radiance-general_006394"}
