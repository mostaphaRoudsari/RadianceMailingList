{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nTransmisivity is the amount of light NOT absorbed in one pass through the\nglazing.  Glass is a special case of dielectric optimized for glass that\naccounts for angular dependence of transmission and inter-reflection between\nfront and back surfaces  (but is only modeled as a single surface in\nradiance).  The reason for using transmissivity I believe is related to the\ndesire to maintain a valid input range of 0-1 for the parameters instead of\nsomething like 0 - 0.92.\n\n\nYou can find the equation to get transmisivity given transmittance at the\nbottom of this page:\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/dielectricdef.html\n\n\nA glazing with reported VLT of 0.325 has a transmisivity of 0.354 so the\nmaterial definition would be as follows:\nvoid glass glazing.325\n0\n0\n3  0.354  0.354  0.354\n\n\nAnd your other question - The first three parameters of trans is color which\naffect transmission and reflection.  Trans does not include inter-reflection\nor angular transmission properties exhibited by glass so the input values\nare transmission.\nAlso on this page there is a nice diagram describing how trans works:\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006396.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "December 11, 2009 at 08:35AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006380", "id": "radiance-general_006396"}
