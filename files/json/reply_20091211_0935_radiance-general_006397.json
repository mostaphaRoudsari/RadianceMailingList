{"body": "Hi...\n\n\n> What do you mean by this, Lars? Trans is merely a material that can model\n> diffuse transmittance, glass cannot. Both materials are used for daylight\n> apertures. Maybe I don't understand your statement (always a possibility).\n\n\nThe cause of confusion was the typo in the original email. The original aim of the experiment was to compare glass and trans for the same set-up (so the question could arise why results were not the same). This comparision is only possible for clear glass. I tried to express that, as far as I understood, trans is not ment for this case, and I would not expect 100% identical results.\n\n\nHowever, it may be interesting to have a comparision of the three modifiers\n\n\n- glass\n- dielectric\n- trans\n\n\nto really quantify the variance for a given scene. Maybe for only direct calculation, and then for some ambient bounces. I will take a look at my copy of RwR to see where to expect differences. However, we do not even know how far off the two results were, so the discussion is a bit lacking of the numbers.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006397.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
