{"body": "Thank you all very much!\n\n\nAndrew mentioned \"Transmisivity is the amount of light NOT absorbed in one\npass through the glazing.  \"\nDoes it mean that the Transmisivity is the amount of light transmitted and\nreflected by a meterial?\n\n\n\n\n>From the web \"http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/dielectricdef.html\" , \"\n*Transmittance* is the total light transmitted through the pane including\nmultiple reflections\"\n\n\n\n\nSo the difference between Transmisivity and Transmittance is the light\nreflected?\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Andrew's email, for glass with VLT of 0.325 has a transmisivity\nof 0.354. The glass is defined as\n\n\nvoid glass glazing.325\n0\n0\n3  0.354  0.354  0.354\n\n\nFor trans with VLT 0.325 and no diffse transmission. Can we difine it as the\nfollowing?\n\n\nvoid trans window.0.325\n\n\n7     0.325 0.325 0.325 0 0 1 1\n\n\nFor glass, the light transmitted would be specular transmitted,  is it\nright?  If right, what is the differrence between above meteirals definition\n-  glass glazing.325 and trans window.0.325?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006398.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor Li", "created_at": "December 12, 2009 at 07:36PM", "created_by": "Victor_Li", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006380", "id": "radiance-general_006398"}
