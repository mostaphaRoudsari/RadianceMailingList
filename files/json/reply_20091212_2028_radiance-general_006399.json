{"body": "Thank you very much!\n\n\nActually i uesed ECOTET exported to DESKTOP RADIANCE to calculate. The only\ndifferernce between Daylight factor and Illuminance calculation is the -B\n0.558659 definition in 11_SKY.RAD\nIn Daylight factor calculation the sky is defined as following:\n\n\n!gensky 12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000 -B 0.558659 | xform\n-rz -27.000\n\n\nskyfunc glow sky_mat\n0\n0\n4\n     1 1 1 0\n\n\nsky_mat source sky\n0\n0\n4\n     0 0 1 180\n\n\nskyfunc glow ground_glow\n0\n0\n4\n     1 .8 .5 0\n\n\nground_glow source ground\n0\n0\n4\n     0 0 -1 180\n\n\nIn Illuminance calculation, the definition is :\n\n\n!gensky 12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000 -B 0.558659 | xform\n-rz -27.000\n\n\nThe rest is all the same.\n\n\nFor converting the output, the ECOTECT can convert it automatically.\n\n\n\n\n2009/12/11 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006399.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor Li", "created_at": "December 12, 2009 at 08:28PM", "created_by": "Victor_Li", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006381", "id": "radiance-general_006399"}
