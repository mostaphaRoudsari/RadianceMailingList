But the reflections here are those that\nhappen between two parallel interfaces of a refracting material as the\nfront and back of a sheet of float glass. Some light is reflected at\nthe back of the sheet when the light exits the glass. This light will\ntravel back through the glass to the front and again a small amount\nwill be reflected towards the back and so on.\n\n\nThe formula to calculate transmissivity from the transmittance of glass\n(VLT) takes these inter-reflections into account and so you can model\nthe two interfaces of a single pane of float glass with one single polygon\nin Radiance and you don't have to calculate the reflections during the\nray tracing process.\n\n\n> According to Andrew's email, for glass with VLT of 0.325\n> has a transmisivity of 0.354.

But it\nis not the same as glass.\n\n\n> For glass, the light transmitted would be specular transmitted,\n> is it right? If right, what is the differrence between above meteirals\n> definition - glass glazing.325 and trans window.0.325?\n\n\nThe most obvious one is that \"glass\" is a specialised \"dielectric\"\nmaterial type which modulates the reflection according to the\nangle and refraction index of the material. So if you want to\nreflections/refractions of glass with another material you should\nstart with \"dielectric\" not \"trans\"\n\n\nThe \"window.0.325\" material defined above has not specularity\nand no roughness. The glass material has a visible specularity.\nJust create a small test scene with a bubble of glass/trans and\na light source (like the sun) and you will see the difference.\n\n\nIf you don't care about the particular refraction of glass and\nspecular refraction and only focus on VTL you could say the\nmaterials are similar or equal depending on your use.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006402.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 13, 2009 at 05:51AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006380", "id": "radiance-general_006402"}
