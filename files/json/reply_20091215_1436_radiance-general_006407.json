Sorry.\n\n\n$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/rtrace\n$ -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  397736 Dec 15 13:09 /usr/local/bin/rtrace\n$ which rtrace\n$ /usr/local/bin/RAY/rtrace (you idiot)\n\n\nOK, so that's sorted. But in testing out the -n option, I do notice a\nstrange behavior. If you have a bogus material definition in your scene\nfiles -- even if it is not referenced in the octree -- using rtrace with the\n-n option will throw a fatal error about the material definition and quit.\nAgain, this is not a material that is actually used in the octree, no ray\nwould ever need to evaluate the definition; it's an unassigned material that\nhappens to reference a .cal file that's not on my system. But I compiled an\noctree and I ran rpict twice on the same octree. Once without the -n, and\nthat ran fine. Then I ran the same exact command adding \"-n 10\" and I got\nthis error:\n\n\nrtrace: fatal - cannot find function file \"glaz.cal\"\n\n\nI went back and deleted the bogus material from my material file completely,\nrecompiled, and now rtrace -n works. Not sure what's going on there.\n\n\nThank you for this addition, Greg! It's nice to feed rtrace one grid and\nwatch top automatically fill up with all these rtrace processes!\n\n\n- Rob G.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006407.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 15, 2009 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006405", "id": "radiance-general_006407"}
