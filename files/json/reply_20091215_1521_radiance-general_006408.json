{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\n\nThe bogus material error is caused by the function preload_objs(),  \nwhich goes through and loads all the auxiliary data (including .cal  \nfiles) for all scene objects, whether referenced or not.  This  \nfunction is called by any of the shared-memory parallel execution  \nmodes to maximize static shared data, thereby minimizing system memory  \nuse.  The same thing would happen with the -PP option.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006408.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2009 at 03:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006405", "id": "radiance-general_006408"}
