{"body": "Actually i just export the model from ECOTECT to RADIANCE, and i chang some\nparameters and run the simulation manually like Marija has shown above.\n\n\nThe first time i calculated the daylgith factor in a grid\nI run it by define: gensky 12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000\n-B 0.558659,\n-B 0.558659 means the diffuse horizontal illuminance is 100lux outside then\nthe internal illuminance is the dylight factor.\n\n\nThe second time i just calculated the internal illuminance in a grid under\novercast sky in the same time as the first time. I defined the sky : gensky\n12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000\n\n\nIn the grid, i can calculate the external diffuse horizontal illuminance at\nthat time under overcast sky in the same point by  the external diffuse\nhorizontal illuminance = the internal illuminance/ daylight factor.\nHowever, i calculated the the external diffuse horizontal illuminance by\ndifferent points the results are different. Actually the results should be\nthe same because it the external diffuse horizontal illuminance. So why is\nit different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2009/12/13 Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at googlemail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006410.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor Li", "created_at": "December 16, 2009 at 01:57AM", "created_by": "Victor_Li", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006381", "id": "radiance-general_006410"}
