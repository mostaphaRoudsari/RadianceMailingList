{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nYou don't need 2 calculations, just one.\nWith the overcast sky:\ngensky 12 21 12.00 -c -a 31.400 -o -121.400 -m -120.000 -B 0.558659,\ncalculate internal illuminances with rtrace, and then just divide this\nvalues with 100lux (sky diffuse horizontal illuminance).\nNo need to calculate illuminances in the same point when there is no\nbuilding, since diffuse horizontal illuminance means exactly that:\n\n\n**\n*diffuse horizontal\nilluminance*<http://www.satel-light.com/guide/glosatod.htm#evd>:Illuminance\nproduced by the visible part of the diffuse solar radiation on\na horizontal surface on the earth.\n\n\nAlso, I think you should use sky with higher diffuse illuminance, at least\n1000lux, because with such low outside lux, like the ones you have, results\ninside may be too low, and errors due to ambient calculation may be more\nvisible.\n\n\nHope this helps,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006412.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "December 16, 2009 at 02:17AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006381", "id": "radiance-general_006412"}
