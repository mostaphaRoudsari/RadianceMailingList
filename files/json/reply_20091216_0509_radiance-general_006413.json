But other options in your rtrace command\nintroduce a rather high inaccuracy and some additional light which\nwill have a bigger effect on the results if you use an illuminance of\nonly 100 lux. If you use 10000 lux and devide by 100 you reduce\nsome of these effects.\n\n\n> The second time i just calculated the internal illuminance in a grid under\n> overcast sky in the same time as the first time.

Therefore the result of\ntwo identical calculations will be slightly different. Learning to choose\nthe correct options to minimise this difference is one of the challanges\nof Radiance.\n\n\nIn your example I assume that the first set of daylight factors is rather\ninaccurate. You now multiply this error by your internal illuminances\n(which might be inaccurate, too). If your daylight factor is off by 1%\nthis can easily result in a difference of a few hundret lux.\n\n\nIt would realy help us if you could mention the actual results\nof your calculations in your emails. Then we could see if the\nerrors are within the expected margin of your settings.\n\n\nYou should try your calculations with modified parameters\nas suggested and with an increased sky illuminance to see\nif your errors are still the same.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006413.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 16, 2009 at 05:09AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006381", "id": "radiance-general_006413"}
