{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nI followed your link and studied the description of the material GLASS in\nthe rayfront manual (see below).\nI found, that GLASS is a special form of dielectric for modelling a thin\nglas pane without internal reflections within the glas pane itself.\nGLASS produces one ray, which is transmitted, and a second ray, which is\nreflected - so far, so good.\n\n\nNow my question: I am looking for a diagram or an equation of GLASS, which\nshows the angle-dependancies. \nIt is well known, that with more normal incidence transmission of rays is\nincreasing and reflection is decreasing;\nwith more sloped incidence angle transmission of rays decreases and\nrefelctions increases ....\n\n\nWhere can I find a documentation about this angle dependancies of the\nmaterial GLASS ?\n\n\n-Gunter  \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006416.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gunter Pueltz", "created_at": "December 17, 2009 at 02:12AM", "created_by": "Gunter_Pueltz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006380", "id": "radiance-general_006416"}
