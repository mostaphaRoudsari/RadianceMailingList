{"body": "Dear Coralie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif you have the full spectro-data, there may be a different path: There is a tool called \u201cglaze\u201d (a script found in the standard radiance installation). With this script, you can convert Optics (\u201cOptics\u201d being the freeware program from the LBNL) spectral data into a more detailed Radiance description (type \u201cBRTDfunc\u201d) by exporting from Optics in \u201cRadiance Format\u201d and then entering this data in the \u201cglaze\u201d script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am laboring under the possible delusion that this is generally a better description for \u201cadvanced\u201d glazing products (and possibly any translucent materials). However, I am quite new at this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006417.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "December 17, 2009 at 02:47AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006415", "id": "radiance-general_006417"}
