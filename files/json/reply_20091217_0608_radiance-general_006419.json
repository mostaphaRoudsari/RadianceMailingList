{"body": "Hi Coralie and Achim,\n\n\nA couple of comments. Optics 5 models thermal and spectral optical \nproperties of a wide range of glazing based on measured data. However it \ndoes not contain a model for for diffusely transmitting materials. So \nfor modeling complex glazing systems and exporting data for use in the \n\"glaze\" script it is a great place to start, however it will not help \nwith the kind of data that it looks like Coralie has available, which \nsuggests a material with a large diffuse transmitting component.\n\n\nThere are a few things to note about the information that Coralie \nprovided. One is that it looks like one side is \"shiny\" or specular \nwhile the other is \"mat\" or diffuse. The trans material will not give \nyou control over what happens on each side of the material. Based on \nthis alone it is likely that this is a material that would be better \ncharacterized using the BRTDfunc material type. This allows for more \nflexibility in describing material behavior. However, this being said \nthere is one thing that is a little puzzling (there are others who may \nchime in on this who know more), this is that your measurments show \ndifferent transmittance (total) depending on the side of the material. \nIs this possible? This certainly cannot be modeled with the \"trans\" \nmaterial type.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAchim Geissler wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006419.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 17, 2009 at 06:08AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006415", "id": "radiance-general_006419"}
