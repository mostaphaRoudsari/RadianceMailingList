{"body": "Hi Coralie,\n\n\nI\u00b9m not familiar with Spectralon or if there are different varieties of\nspectralon, but all the hits of my quick search reveals a substance with\nhigh diffuse reflectance.  And your measurements suggest high diffuse\ntransmission.  Is it possible that you are confusing Td with Rd?  That would\nexplain concerns regarding inconsistent transmission values for front and\nback.\n\n\nAfter talking with a materials guy, I now know that it is possible for a\ncomposite material to have different absorbance depending on direction of\ntravel (ie if you have a silver coating on one side of glass, light from one\nside will pass through the glass twice while light from the other side may\nnot pass through the material at all).  So for me that is no longer a\npuzzle. \n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/18/09 9:45 AM, \"Coralie Cauwerts\" <coralie.cauwerts at uclouvain.be>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006430.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "December 18, 2009 at 10:19AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006415", "id": "radiance-general_006430"}
