If you find the opportunity, could you also test it with totally independent jobs?  In fact, varying multiple instances of the same job would do.  I'd dearly like to have my scepticism refuted.\n\n\nLemme see what I can do. Turns out, my recollection of rpict scaling was related to a different test I did, where I subdivided a view into 40 tiles and sent them off to a cluster, not to my local machine. So in that case it should have been expected that I got a linear speed-up because it was distributed to different physical cores. But I did do a test of mkillum with the -n option and I thought I saw a linear increase to 15 on my local machine. This was a little while ago and I'll have to dig it up and look closely at it, as well as do a proper test of rtrace. I'll let you know what I find out but I'm not optimistic at this point. =8-/\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006431.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 18, 2009 at 10:23AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006422", "id": "radiance-general_006431"}
