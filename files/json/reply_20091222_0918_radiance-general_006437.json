You use lookamb -h -d to print the\ncontents of the ambient file sans header to STDOUT, then pipe that back to\nlookamb with -r to roll them all up into one ambient file.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006437.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 22, 2009 at 09:18AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006436", "id": "radiance-general_006437"}
