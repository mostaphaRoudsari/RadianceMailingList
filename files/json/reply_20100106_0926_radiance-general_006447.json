{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nYou are correct -- weighting values are not applied for the <return>  \nreporting in ximage, corresponding to the radiant \"intensity\" for this  \npixel or area.  There is no agreed-upon weighting for radiance values,  \nonly luminance, which is the reason for the different choices.  You  \ncan always divide the 'l' report by 179 if you want a photometrically- \nweighted radiance quantity.  The 'c' command reports the RGB color,  \nbut adjusted by the current exposure scale, which is not really useful  \nas a radiometric quantity.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006447.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2010 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006442", "id": "radiance-general_006447"}
