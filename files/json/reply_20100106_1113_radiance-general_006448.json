{"body": "> There is no agreed-upon weighting for radiance values, only luminance\n\n\nOf course (duh)!  I get so used to working between irradiance and  \nilluminance using luminous efficacy models that I occasionally forget  \nsome of the R(r)adiance basics.  Nonetheless, to avoid confusion in  \nthe future, might I suggest an update to the ximage manpage?  Perhaps  \nsomething like:\n\n\n<return> \t\tDisplay the mean RGB radiance averaged over the area of  \ninterest.  [For a single value, the mean seems less arbitrary than the  \nmaximum value for any one of the channels.  Otherwise, some indication  \nof what the current behaviour is.]\nl \t\t\tDisplay the photometrically-weighted RGB luminance value in the  \narea of interest. This assumes that the image was correctly computed  \nin terms of luminance.\nThen again, if I'm the only person who's been bamboozled by this, it's  \nprobably not worth the mods to the man page.\n-John\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006448.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "January 06, 2010 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006442", "id": "radiance-general_006448"}
