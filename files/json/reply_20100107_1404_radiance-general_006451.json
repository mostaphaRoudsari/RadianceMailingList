Sometimes for whatever reason people's PATH statements do not include\nthe current directory (.) and so a reference to a file in scene/thing.rad\nwill fail, but a reference to ./scene/thing.rad would be found. Can you\nconfirm this?\n\n\n2. Also, Thomas has a Google Code site for his su2rad project. There may\nbe some stuff there that is helpful:\n\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/su2rad/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006451.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 07, 2010 at 02:04PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006450", "id": "radiance-general_006451"}
