I'm not quite sure about that because I did run my\nsimulations using relative paths without this variable set.\nMaybe the default value includes the current directory and\nit only breaks if you have it set and not included the \".\".\n\n\nHope that fixes it.\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006452.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 07, 2010 at 03:07PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006450", "id": "radiance-general_006452"}
