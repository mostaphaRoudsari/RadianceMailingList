{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nPerhaps you are experiencing rounding error larger than FTINY.  I\u00b9d suggest\nreplacing FTINY with a larger value (ie 2e-3) and seeing if black spots\nreduce.  A bit of trial and error might be necessary.\n\n\nIf that doesn\u00b9t work can you send more scene info?  I\u00b9d like to see your\nfalsecolor statement, your colorpict and mixpict material definitions and\nperhaps you could post your contour image in hdr format.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006456.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "January 11, 2010 at 10:19AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006455", "id": "radiance-general_006456"}
