You just want to identify pixels which are black\n(or nearly black) and the red, green and blue colours in the\nfalsecolor image. You can use ximage or pvalue to work out\nthe average value of a black pixel and the intensity of the\ncolours. I'd expect that 0.1 as a treshold value will give you\nbetter results; you might even go up to 0.5 given that the\ncontour lines are rather intense.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006457.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 12, 2010 at 01:03AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006455", "id": "radiance-general_006457"}
