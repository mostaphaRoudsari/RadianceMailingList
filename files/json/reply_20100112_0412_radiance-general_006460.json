{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nI tested the nonzero part of your mail. nonzero(r,g,b) = 1; returns the falsecolor image on the workingplane and nonzero(r,g,b) = 0; returns the image 3 on http://perhaugaard.blogspot.com/. \n\n\nThe error is elsewhere or?\n\n\n\n\n/Per\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Den tirs 12/1/10 skrev Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at googlemail.com>:\n\n\nFra: Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at googlemail.com>\nEmne: Re: [Radiance-general] Removing black areas in imagemapping\nTil: perhaugaard at yahoo.dk, \"Radiance general discussion\" <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nDato: tirsdag 12. januar 2010 11.55\n\n\nPer.\n\n\nI still think that your problem is the value at which\nmixfunc decides if the value from the fc image should\nbe used or not (based on your non-zero function).\n\n\nYou can try and replace the function once with\n\n\n\n\nnonzero(r,g,b) = 1\n\n\nand then with \n\n\nnonzero(r,g,b) = 0\n\n\nIn the first case you should get the whole surface\nin black (because every pixel is used), in the second\nyou should see nothing at all. (Mind you, I haven't\n\n\ntested these functions; I only assume they work!)\n\n\nAlso use phisto on your falsecolor image to see the\nactual values of the black pixels. It looks like there\nis a range of \"dark grey\" instead of black. If you convert\n\n\nyour image to tiff or ppm, edit the grey values to black\nin Photoshop and convert it back you might have a\nbetter result already. I'm sure there is also a way to\ndo this with Radiance tools but I don't have one ready.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006460.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Per Haugaard", "created_at": "January 12, 2010 at 04:12AM", "created_by": "Per_Haugaard", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006455", "id": "radiance-general_006460"}
