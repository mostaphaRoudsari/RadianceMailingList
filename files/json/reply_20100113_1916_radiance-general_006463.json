There are even \nslightly simpler ways to do it, still pcomb -e is the generic way for me \nto calculate on images.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006463.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
