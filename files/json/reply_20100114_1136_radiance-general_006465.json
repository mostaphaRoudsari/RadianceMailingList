{"body": "Jia,\n\n\nThere will always be some difference between two identical simulations in\nRadiance.  The monte carlo sampling method used by radiance is like rolling\nthe dice several times.  If your sample density is high enough your results\nfor identical simulations will exhibit minor differences.  However with a\nlow sampling density a few lucky hits or misses can skew the simulation\nresults significantly.\n\n\nThe radiance simulation parameters allow us to adjust the sampling density\nand other parameters to improve the correlation of the results.  Trouble is\nthere is no single set of parameter settings that works for every model.\n\n\nTo allow the group to best help you refine your simulation parameters you\nshould send the following:\n1 \u00ad The radiance commands you used to run your simulation.\n2 \u00ad The results of your simulations.\n3 \u00ad A description of your model\n4 \u00ad A rendering if you have one (proper etiquette is to upload the image to\na website and include a link in your email to the list).\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006465.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "January 14, 2010 at 11:36AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006464", "id": "radiance-general_006465"}
