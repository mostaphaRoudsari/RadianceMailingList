{"body": "Hello Andy:\n\n\nSorry for my late reply. I am new for Radiance and have to learn more to\nreply you.  Before discussing the previous question,   could I ask how I\ncan open the text editor and save as file with extension like .rad after I\ninstall Ubuntu 9.10 because I am unfamiliar with Ubuntu (Linux)?\n\n\nFor the question in my last email, I asked that because someone did some\nsimulations before but the results seems weird.  In those simulations,  two\nidentical small offices are developed with only one difference. In one\noffice, the angles of the blinds are 0 degree. For another, the windows\nare separated into three sections (the height for each section is the\nsame). The blinds with 0 degree are  also the same for each section.  The\nilluminance of the sensor points are calculated for the two\noffices. Theoretically, the illuminance should be identical or quite\nsimilar. But as I said in my last email, the illuminance shows  a big\ndifference.\n\n\nIn addition to your explanation, is that right another possible reason is\nthe computer hardware difference. For example, one computer may calculate\n5+3=8, while another calculates 5+3=7.8888.  If possible,  Is there any test\nfile to test the accuracy of computer before running Radiance?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006466.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "January 16, 2010 at 08:37AM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006464", "id": "radiance-general_006466"}
