{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nI am not at all the materials measurement/definition guru on this list,\nbut I do have some comments. First off, you should not use .03 for\nspecular transmittance based on the openness factor. You should specify\nthe transmittance. Have a look at the product specs for the shadecloth;\nsomewhere there should be a reporting (however roughly it may have been\nestimated) for the transmittance of the shade.\n\n\nNext, even though in theory the holes are allowing light to pass straight\nthrough, there will be some scattering at that interface due to the weave\n(especially in the case of your white colored shade), so there will be\nsome diffuse component to this material. And therein lies the rub:\nfiguring out how much of a diffuse component...\n\n\nI recommend finding out the transmittance of the cloth, and than taking\nsome fraction of that and putting that into the diffuse transmittance\nportion of the material definition. For example, if the shade has a\ntransmittance of 20%, maybe specify Td = .05 and Ts = .15. I'd also\nrecommend getting a sample; even if you can't measure it, you could at\nleast observe it under different lighting conditions and then mix and\nmatch Td and Ts until you achieve L^ar (looks about right). =8-)\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, January 21, 2010 10:45 am, kkonis at berkeley.edu wrote:\n> Dear list,\n>\n> I am trying to describe a nominally \"white\" roller shade fabric with a\n> 3% openness factor as a trans material type.\n>\n> I don't have a real fabric on hand to measure, I'm just trying to make\n> sure i understand the material definition parameters and then to do\n> some studies varying the openness factor of a hypothetical woven\n> roller shade material.\n>\n> 1) I'm curious to know if by setting parameter A7 to 1 i am achieving\n> my desired goal of representing a shading fabric that acts as an\n> opaque sieve (e.g. a cheese-grater: light passes only through the 3% of\n> the surface\n> which is void\n> (my interpretation is that diffuse transmission requires some portion\n> of incident light to pass through the threads)\n>\n> -any comments on the below process and resulting trans description\n> would be appreciated.......\n>\n>\n> # USING THIS FORMULA from RWR and previous email discussions:\n>\n> for the trans material:\n> A7=Ts / ( Td+Ts )\n> A6=( Td+Ts ) / ( Rd+Td+Ts )\n> A5=Sr\n> A4=Rs\n> A3=Cb / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )\n> A2=Cg / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )\n> A1=Cr / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )\n>\n> # INPUTS\n>\n> Td = 0          # ASSUME no diffuse transmission (e.g. fabric threads are\n> totally opaque)\n> Ts = 0.03               # ASSUME that (3% openness factor of shade\n> \"weave\")\n> means fraction of light transmitted as beam (e.g. not scattered\n> diffusely) = 0.03\n> Sr = 0\n> Rs = 0\n> Cb = 0.7                # Nominally \"white\" fabric surface (reflects 70%\n> of\n> incident visible light?)\n> Cg = 0.7\n> Cr = 0.7\n>\n> # CALCS\n>\n> A7 = (0.03) / (0 + 0.03) = 1\n> A6 = (0 + 0.03) / (0.7 + 0 + 0.03) = 0.0411\n> A5 = 0\n> A4 = 0\n> A3 = 0.7 / ( (1 - 0)*(1-0.0411) ) = 0.73\n> A2 = 0.7 / ( (1 - 0)*(1-0.0411) ) = 0.73\n> A1 = 0.7 / ( (1 - 0)*(1-0.0411) ) = 0.73\n>\n> # RESULT\n>\n> void trans my_shade\n> 0\n> 0\n> 7 0.73 0.73 0.73 0 0 0.041 1\n>\n>\n> thanks,\n>\n> Kyle Konis\n> PhD Student\n> UC Berkeley\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006476.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 21, 2010 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006475", "id": "radiance-general_006476"}
