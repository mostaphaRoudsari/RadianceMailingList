You will have \nlight hitting the front of the fabric being reflected back, the \"sides\" \nof the opening, being scattered, light passing through the openings \nwithout touching any material being transmitted as specular, light \nhitting the fibres but being transmitted as diffuse.... You can assume \nto get a pretty diffuse reflection, but the 3% information will not be \nenough to accurately descibe the transmissive properties. This would \nrequire either measurements (we have used a goniophotometer for this \ntype of materials) or a good model for the fabric where you could derive \nthe raypaths for different incident angles from.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006480.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
