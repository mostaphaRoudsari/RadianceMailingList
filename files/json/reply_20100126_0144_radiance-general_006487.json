{"body": "Victor.\n\n\n*.rif files are not used for rtrace comands. Whatever differences\nyou find they are not caused by settings in the *.rif file.\n\n\nIt has been a while since I looked at the rad code but I'm pretty sure\nthat INDIRECT only affects the \"-ab\" value of the rpict comand.\nDepending on your QUALITY setting is either INDIRECT = -ab\nor INDIRECT=-ab-1. To keep the -ab value constant you have to\noverride it in with the \"render=\" option.\n\n\nIf you get different values for rtrace calculations you either just\nsee the typical error of the stochastic approach of Radiance or\nyour other ambient options are not high enough and your result\nhave a large variation.\n\n\nHow do you use the rif file with rtrace? Can you send details of\nthe rtrace commands and some info on the scene?\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 26, 2010 at 7:40 AM, victor li <victorpirates at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006487.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 26, 2010 at 01:44AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006486", "id": "radiance-general_006487"}
