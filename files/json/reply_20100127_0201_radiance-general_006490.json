If\nyou have QUALITY=low then \"-ab\" will be your INDIRECT value,\nif you have QUALITY=medium or high then \"-ab\" will be the\nINDIRECT value + 1. It was written in a rush.\n\n\nIf you want to force a particular value for an rpict (or rvu) option\nyou can add it to the \"render=\" setting (like the \"-i\" in your case).\nRad will add these options at the end of the generated rpict\ncommand and so override all options that have been calculated\nfrom the QUALITY etc. settings.\n\n\n> For my setting in rtrace, other ambient options are high enough to avoid the\n> mistake.\u00a0[...] My setting is as following:\n>\n> rtrace -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1\n> -st .01 -ab 8 -aa .1 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 12 -lw .0005\n> -af 5.amb 5.oct < 5.pts > 5.dat\n\n\nI wouldn't call \"-aa 0.1\" and \"-ar 32\" particularly high. Can you\nproduce similar results for two calculations if you don't change\nanything?\n\n\nAs Lars already wrote, the accuracy of rtrace is definded only\nby the parameters above. The settings below have nothing to\ndo with it.\n\n\n> RESOLUTION= 640 480\n> DETAIL= MEDIUM\n> VARIABILITY= MEDIUM\n> QUALITY= MEDIUM\n> INDIRECT= 5\n> REPORT= 2\n>\n> render= -i\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006490.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 27, 2010 at 02:01AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006486", "id": "radiance-general_006490"}
