{"body": "Hi Lars:\n\n\nActually, i know what you mean, but the result is strange, it is not what we\nexpect. I donot know what is wrong in my setting. I used rad and rtrace\ncommand as follwoing:\nRAD 5.rif\nrtrace -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1\n-st .01 -ab 8 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -af\n5.amb 5.oct < 5.pts > 5.dat\n\n\nIn the .rif file:\nRESOLUTION= 640 480\nDETAIL= MEDIUM\nVARIABILITY= MEDIUM\nQUALITY= MEDIUM\nINDIRECT= 5\nREPORT= 2\n\n\nrender= -i\n\n\nSo the result of rtrace command would donot matter with the seting in .rif.\nHowever, if i changed the \"INDIRECT\" and keep any other settings the same,\nthe result of rtrace command is different.  Do you know the reason?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006493.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "victor li", "created_at": "January 28, 2010 at 07:02PM", "created_by": "victor_li", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006486", "id": "radiance-general_006493"}
