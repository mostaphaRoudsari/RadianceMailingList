What is the result of this, I think there is no \nview given in your RIF. Is there any result from the run of rad? I would \nexpect nothing to happen, as rad has nothing to do?\n\n\n> rtrace -I -h -dp 2046 -ar 32 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 \n> -sj 1 -st .01 -ab 8 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 12 \n> -lw .0005 -af 5.amb 5.oct < 5.pts > 5.dat\nHow is this related to your rad-call? Why do you have this low \nar-setting? Where are all these values derived from?\n\n\n> In the .rif file: \n> RESOLUTION= 640 480\n> DETAIL= MEDIUM\n> VARIABILITY= MEDIUM\n> QUALITY= MEDIUM\n> INDIRECT= 5\n> REPORT= 2\n>\n> render= -i\n>\n> So the result of rtrace command would donot matter with the seting in \n> .rif.

Run the rtrace-command with the same parameters \n(maybe increase the ar first) several times, and compare the output in \n5.dat.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
