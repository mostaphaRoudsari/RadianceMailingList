{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThis is really a bug.  Total computes products by converting to a log  \ndomain, which of course doesn't work for zero.  I can fix this  \nproblem, and will do so in the next release.\n\n\nCheers for pointing it out.\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  The reason for converting to log is that it allows geometric  \nmeans to be computed for almost any set of numbers, which would  \noverflow a straight product.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006496.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 29, 2010 at 09:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006495", "id": "radiance-general_006496"}
