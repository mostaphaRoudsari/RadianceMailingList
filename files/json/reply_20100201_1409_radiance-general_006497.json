{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nthe rtcontrib lesson has found a new home here:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.html\n\n\nThere are likely to be many typos, mistakes and inconsistencies left in \nit, but it's mostly done: Dynamic daylight simulations with Radiance's \nrtcontrib can be done. Well, sort of-ish.\n\n\nAs to the software--All scripts that are provided with the tutorial are \navailable as a download. The link is on the page. Everything was written \nto get a particular task done. There is absolutely no flexibility built \ninto any of the code. If you do decide to try some of the things that I \nhave covered and come up with some better/more elegant/more configurable \nsoftware or command lines, I'd be happy to hear from you. Please \nconsider sharing your experience.\n\n\nThank you all for the feedback, especially Greg! You've been extremely \nhelpful.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006497.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 01, 2010 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006471", "id": "radiance-general_006497"}
