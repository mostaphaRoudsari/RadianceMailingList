If I take your \nwords above literally, the \"results\" should be just one file in the \ncurrent directory called \"5.oct\". This will always look the same as long \nas you do not change the file name and scene description. So, if you \nexperience different results for different command sequences, exactly \nlist the commands in the order you executed them and specify what you \ngot as result. Usually, result will be a error message, one or more \nvalues or in some cases image files, that you could upload somewhere and \nrefer to by giving a link in your email. So far we have no reproduceable \nproblem description and cannot see what you really did or got back.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006499.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
