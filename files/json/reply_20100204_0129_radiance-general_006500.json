And run again, the result looks right and\nreasonable.\n\n\nIf i donot delete rif file. And simulate with differrent \"INDIRECT\" number\nin rif file and keep other settings the same. The results of illumiance in\nthe grid are differreent with the changing of \"INDIRECT\"\nI thought the results of illumiance would not change with the different\n\"INDIRECT\" However, it is not. I am confulsed by this. Do you know why?\n\n\n\n\n2010/2/4 Lars O.
