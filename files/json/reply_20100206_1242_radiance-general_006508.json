{"body": "As always, thanks for the response Greg.\n\n\nAs suggested I tried adding the -bn option, however ;rtcontrib' still  \nonly generates 248 unfinished files with the '-e MF:2' option.  All  \nworks fine with 'e MF:1'.  I tried sending the files to a ramdisk, but  \nstill no joy.\n\n\nI'm wondering if I did something funny when compiling the most recent  \nhead under OS X?  Has anyone had similar results using Linux or Cygwin?\n\n\nThanks,\nChris H\n\n\nOn Feb 5, 2010, at 11:00 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006508.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "February 06, 2010 at 12:42PM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006471", "id": "radiance-general_006508"}
