After rerunning all of the\nsteps with MF:2 I manage to get a similar result as Axel\ndid.\n\n\nPS:\nI rewrote the gen_yearvect script to allow the input of a\nMF value on the command line and replace the failed\ngendaylit calls with gensky. If anyone is interested I can\nsend it via PM. If you're following the tutorial you can't\nuse it, though, because other scripts still rely on the\npreset names for directories etc.\n\n\nCheers,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006511.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 07, 2010 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006471", "id": "radiance-general_006511"}
