Can't remember which\none had to use on Windows, though.\n\n\n> As I am planning to use a large number of images composted together I\n> would like to get rid of the header information and not being limited to\n> the number of images I can process (or at least being able to handle\n> some 100 files at once...).\n\n\nWith this weekend's HEAD I noticed that the -h command does\nstrip the headers from the input images, but the command used\nto create the output is still there in full length. I can understand\nthat this is the desired behaviour. If you plan to combine a large\nnumber of pictures I would recommend another pcomb command\nwith a single input file just to strip this header as well.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006513.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 09, 2010 at 02:17PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006512", "id": "radiance-general_006513"}
