{"body": "Sasa.\n\n\nCan you please be more specific about your problem?\nIn which context are you creating these *.dat files, which application\nare you using and what is the command you use to create the files (if\nyou know that).\n\n\nIf the *.dat files contain only a single value per line (lux level)\nthen there should be another file that contains coordinates. Usually\nthis has the form \"x y z dx dy dz\" (no comma!). Excel can import these\nfiles even if there is no comma in the line. You just have to set the\nfield separator correctly.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 16, 2010 at 10:36 AM, sasa.cemesova at tiscali.co.uk\n<sasa.cemesova at tiscali.co.uk> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006538.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 16, 2010 at 05:53AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006537", "id": "radiance-general_006538"}
