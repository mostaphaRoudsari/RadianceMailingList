{"body": "I usually find that for some reason if you assign the *.dat files to open with Excel, they open correctly without changing the extension (tabs are interpreted as column breaks). On the other hand, if you change the extension to .txt and force it to open with Excel, it doesn't do the formatting as you'd like it. For correct display of the text files in Excel 2007 try the Data menu tab, Text To Columns function. I forget what it's called in Excel 2003 and older, but I believe still in the data menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006539.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "February 16, 2010 at 07:00AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006537", "id": "radiance-general_006539"}
