{"body": "Hi Galen.\n\n\nWhich version of OS X are you using. I updated to Snow Leopard on a\n32-bit system and since then most of the applications I compiled\nmyself end in a segfault. I think the new Xcode is not set up properly\nfor a 32-bit system or the usual (auto)config rules do not work\ncorrectly for this configuration.\n\n\nException: I downloaded the Radiance HEAD snapshot last weekend and it\ncompiled and worked fine, including gendaylit. Greg's Makefiles seem\nto work just fine.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Sun, Feb 21, 2010 at 5:16 AM, Galen Burrell\n<Galen.Burrell at arup.com.au> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006547.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 21, 2010 at 12:48AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006545", "id": "radiance-general_006547"}
