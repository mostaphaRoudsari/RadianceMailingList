{"body": "Hi George,\n\n\nYou want to check out the manpage for \"ies2rad\", which is the Radiance\nutility for converting an ies photometry file to a Radiance light source.\nThere are a bunch of options so read it over carefully, but it works very\nwell. ies2rad will read in the ies file and create a luminous source based\non the dimensions it finds in the ies file. The output is two files: a\n.rad file that describes the luminaire and a .dat file that describes the\ndistribution. Using replmarks, another utility in Radiance, you can place\n\"markers\" in your model that can be replaced with the luminaires you\ncreate with the ies2rad utility.\n\n\nOn Mon, February 22, 2010 10:10 am, George Kramerich wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006551.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 22, 2010 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006548", "id": "radiance-general_006551"}
