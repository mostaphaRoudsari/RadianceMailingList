{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nSorry for the delayed response.  I think this is another report buried  \nin a box somewhere in my basement, but it's probably not worth digging  \nout.  Although the work was well-done by Anat, it compares a very old  \nversion of Radiance to Superlite, and in it I seem to remember we  \ndiscovered the problem of not subdividing large area sources (such as  \nwindows) for nearby points.  This led to the creation of the -ds  \noption.  Otherwise, the programs were in fair agreement.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006553.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 22, 2010 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006530", "id": "radiance-general_006553"}
