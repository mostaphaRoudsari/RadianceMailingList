{"body": "Barjesh.\n\n\nWhen you say you installed Radiance \"as per instructions\" did you\nfollow the Unix instructions and compiled Radiance within cygwin or\ndid you install Windows binaries?\n\n\nIf you installed Windows binaries you actually do not need cygwin. You\ncan run the individual programs from the Windows command prompt. The\nexecutables should be located in C:\\Radiance3.9\\bin\\.\n\n\nIf you installed Radiance the Unix way check where the binaries have\nbeen installed. The should be in \"/usr/local/bin\" (path within cygwin)\nor perhaps somewhere in \"/opt\". Search for a file called \"oconv\" in\nthese directories. Here is a command that will help:\n\n\n    find /usr/local -name oconv\n\n\n(replace \"/usr/lcoal\" if you want to search somewhere else). If that\ndoes not return a path to oconv then your installation was probably\nnot successful. Please provide more details about your installation\nprocess.\n\n\nIf you get a path from that try to use the full path in your command at first:\n\n\n/usr/local/bin/oconv room.rad > test.oct\n\n\nIf that works you just have to set your PATH environment variable to\ninclude /usr/local/bin. You probably also have to set RAYPATH to help\nRadiance find commonly used files.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 23, 2010 at 2:11 PM, Brajesh Lal <brajeshlal at yahoo.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006559.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 23, 2010 at 07:00AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006558", "id": "radiance-general_006559"}
