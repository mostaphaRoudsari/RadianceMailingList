{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nIf you want a direct export without the 3ds workaround, Schorsch has a \ndxf2rad that allows that as part of his commercial products.\n\n\nIf you go 3ds, which will break all your surfaces into triangles, it is \npossible to use Blender to do some \"healing\" on the mess. I usually \nexport the 3ds by layername, so that all objects (triangles then) from \none layer become one object. In Blender, I only have to select one by \none (but the number of objects is limited to the number of layers, so \nthat is fine) and de-triangulate the surfaces of the objects. Finally I \nexport the whole model as OBJ - which is supported in Radiance almost as \nwell as the native scene language ;-)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
