So basically you either support only anything \nbut the ACIS stuff (well, this means that you build you models \ncompletely out of 3dfaces), or you stay away from Autocad. Which is a \ngeneral rule, as they step-by-step removed all(!) exporters to \nnon-Autodesk formats to lock in users. As soon as you move to \nstandard-CAD-formats (such as step, iges, ...) you will have a choice of \ntools to do the conversion. Take a look at brlcad for example, it is a \ngreat conversion tool for 3d-geometry. But of course they support \ndocumented open standards, not propietary file-formats.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006571.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
