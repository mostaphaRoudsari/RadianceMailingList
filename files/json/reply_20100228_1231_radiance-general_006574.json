If that some day is incompatible or not available for the\nnext AutoCAD release then we will probably have to spend even\nmore money on some other apps like Rhino or Max and hope that\nthey can import AutoCAD and export polygons.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006574.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 28, 2010 at 12:31PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006562", "id": "radiance-general_006574"}
