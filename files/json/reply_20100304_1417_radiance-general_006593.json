{"body": "Hey Rob,\n\n\nWell it does seem a bit odd. I believe that rpiece defaults to -X = 4 \nand -Y = 4, if nothing is specified on the command line.\n\n\nIt does look like too many copies are being forked though, thus all the \nbash shells getting spawned and the error message for fork indicating \nthat no more resources are available.\n\n\nPerhaps as one test it would be worth explicitly setting -X and -Y and \nseeing what happens? Is this a standard system you are running on or a \ncluster of some sort?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006593.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 04, 2010 at 02:17PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006587", "id": "radiance-general_006593"}
