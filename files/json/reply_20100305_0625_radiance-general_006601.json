{"body": "Hi Thomas, \n\n\nI did specify a syncfile. Sorry I guess I left that out in my summary. There is a -F (syncfile) in the args too. The syncfile was simply created at the bash prompt with \"echo 1 8 > syncfile\", so it should not have any character or line ending issues. I will try leaving it all out there on the command line when I get in to the office today.\n\n\nThomas you mention that OSX is not case sensitive by default? I have never seen this behavior. How does one ensure that it is behaving in a case sensitive manner? Case insensitivity is kind of a problem with rpiece since there are -x and -X, -y and -Y options that are important!\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006601.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 05, 2010 at 06:25AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006587", "id": "radiance-general_006601"}
