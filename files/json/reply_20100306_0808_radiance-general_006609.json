{"body": "hi... as you may remember, I had the chance to have a closer look at  \nyour products. You do not need a programmer for modelling this.  \nTechnically the photon map extension is essential for you. modelling  \nmay require some cheats (especially if you have bent pipes attached)  \nand scripting to make the mirror system track the sun. Still no  \nprogramming.\nCheers\nLars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Lars O.
