{"body": "If the surfaces are \"partly specular\" then you can still treat it in  \nmkillum.  If it is purely specular, or has a purely specular  \ncomponent, it gets a bit more complicated and you'd have to use the  \nmirror type, but mkillum would still work so long as the surfaces are  \nflat.  The photon mapping method really only applies when your  \nsurfaces are both highly specular and curved, which I don't think is  \nthe case, here.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 06, 2010 at 09:24AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006608", "id": "radiance-general_006612"}
