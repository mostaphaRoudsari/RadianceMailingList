{"body": "Yes -- I missed that.  If there's an attached (specular) light pipe, I  \nagree that the photon map would be the best way to go.  You could  \nstill get by with mkillum and standard Radiance in cases where the sun  \nwas not striking the curved light pipe directly, only after bouncing  \noff the diffuse or semi-specular reflectors, but I'm not sure what the  \ncase is here.\n\n\nThanks for pointing that out.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006615.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 06, 2010 at 09:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006608", "id": "radiance-general_006615"}
