{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThis has been a problem for a while, as you know. A grand for a used copy on Amazon now, eh? WOW. Last time I checked, people were asking ~$300 for a copy, but that was years ago. I feel old, because I bought my copy of RwR by plucking a freshly-published copy off the shelf at my local bookstore a few blocks from work, but this was in nineteen ninety-(cough)! =8-)\n\n\nSeriously, the issue in the past is that Greg and Charles Ehrlich's supreme efforts were thwarted by what seemed to be a lousy print-on-demand publisher they secured a few years ago. I know they were going to look into other publishers and I think that hard copy was the way they wanted to work it. I do not know if they are close to finding a new publisher. \n\n\nOn Mar 7, 2010, at 1:24 AM, Lars O.
