{"body": "This is one of those recurring conversations, and I know it must seem  \nincredible that we haven't managed to sort this out in all the time  \nwe've had to spend on it.  The fact is, all of us have day jobs, and  \nno one knows how publishing works (other than the publishers).   \nCreating a new printing of a book, even a reprinting, somehow requires  \nsmall, meaningless (to us) changes in the ISBN and/or Library of  \nCongress number, which we don't know how to do.  Rob Shakespeare has  \nlined up a new printer, but they need to secure the rights from the  \nold printer, and none of us are sure what's going on with that, either.\n\n\nI'll use this as a reminder to get on it again, and if we can't  \nresolve it by Summer, I think we'll just release the PDF to the world  \nand solve it that way.  It's my least favorite solution, but at least  \nit is a solution.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006619.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 07, 2010 at 09:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006616", "id": "radiance-general_006619"}
