{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nmany thanks for your comments.

I am quite sure, that the differences are coming from the\npatch contributions. The calculation time for the rtcontrib run is extremely short,\nat least I think so.\nWhat are the critical parameters concerning accuracy for a rtcontrib run, I really\nwouldn't have any problems with longer computation time.\n\n\n\n\n> IIRC the multiplier for each patch contribution is calculated via genskyvec\n> at specified directions (saved in tregsamp.dat).

But can I say that as long as I compare\ndifferent daylighting solutions with the same (inaccurate) processes, I will get still\nvalid results?\n\n\nMany thanks and best regards\nMartin\n\n\n\n\n  -----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\n  Von: Thomas Bleicher <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\n  Datum: 08.03.2010 10:56:37\n  Betreff: Re: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib and rtrace-parameters\n\n\n\n\nHi Martin.\n\n\nOn Sat, Mar 6, 2010 at 5:37 PM, Martin Klingler\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006624.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Klingler", "created_at": "March 08, 2010 at 11:51AM", "created_by": "Martin_Klingler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006614", "id": "radiance-general_006624"}
