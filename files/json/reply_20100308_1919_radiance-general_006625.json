{"body": "Thanks to both Lars and Jack for your suggestions.\n\n\nI will try your suggestions tonight.\n\n\n   1. The different users are a pain - but not always easily resolved.\n      It seems that ranimate was designed to handle different users (at\n      least by the provision of the host username parameter) though I\n      have not looked at the source code.\n   2. I had the same errors to a different remote workstation with the\n      same user name just a different folder location due to the mount\n      command!\n   3. I suspected there might be a 'environment' error with ssh not\n      running the .bashrc - will check that out. From the errors, it\n      appears that the rpict program was found and run - maybe this is a\n      bogus error. Will check tonight after resolving the ssh 'environment'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nTerrance Mc Minn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006625.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance Mc Minn", "created_at": "March 08, 2010 at 07:19PM", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006621", "id": "radiance-general_006625"}
