{"body": "Hi Terrance.\n\n\nSince I upgraded to Snow Leopard I had various problems with compiling\nmy own binaries. Luckily, Radiance's makeall script works fine,\nalthough I only use them on my machine.\n\n\nWith Snow Leopard Apple switched to gcc 4.2 and a few new core\ntechnologies under the hood.\n\n\nTo produce binaries that run on 10.4 you have to install the 10.4u SDK\ncomponent of Xcode. To use it you have to set the \"-isysroot\" option\nin gcc.\n\n\nYou have to use gcc 4.0 as compiler, not gcc 4.2. I think it also only\nworks if you produce 32bit binaries (which you would want to do\nanyway).\n\n\nPlus there are probably a number of other things. I recently found\nthat I couldn't run an application because OS X 10.5 needs to be at\nthe right patch level ...\n\n\nAll in all I now think that it is safest to compile on a 10.4 system.\nThis will run on 10.5 and 10.6 but is much less hassle to set up.\n\n\n\n\nJust my less-than-2c,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006628.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 09, 2010 at 01:56AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006626", "id": "radiance-general_006628"}
