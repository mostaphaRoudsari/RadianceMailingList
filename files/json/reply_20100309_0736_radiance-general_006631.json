{"body": "Dear Cramer,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are extensively using GenCumultativeSky as part of the GSD Rhino\nToolbar for Radiance/Daysim. The toolbar is currently used in five GSD\nstudios and we intend to publicly release it later this year. (Matthias\nis using it in his GSD class as well so you can talk to him about it.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenCumultativeSky produces cumulative radiation maps based on EPW files.\nWe are properly validating it right now but I think that it will yield\nvery similar results to RADMAP. I got the source code form Darren\nRobinson earlier this year and modified it a bit so that it can now read\nin EPW files and you can select time of day and year intervals for a\nmore detailed analysis. If Darren is OK with it, I can share the\nmodified code with anybody interested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW, this is a good way of announcing to this group that we will be\noffering another three day executive education program on 'Daylighting\nBuildings' on July 14-16 2010. In the program we will be covering a\nrange of topics from climate-based daylighting metrics to glare analysis\nof simulated and real daylit spaces using HDR images generated with\nPhotosphere and Radiance as well as annual daylight glare probability\ncalculations and the above mentioned Rhino plug-in for Radiance/Daysim.\nYou can sign up at\nhttp://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10\n1838\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01838> .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing. \n\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\n\nGund Hall 331, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu> \n\n\nResearch <http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/> , Sustainable\nDesign Workflows\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/tutorials.html>\nExecutive Education on Daylighting\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01838>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006631.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "March 09, 2010 at 07:36AM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006630", "id": "radiance-general_006631"}
