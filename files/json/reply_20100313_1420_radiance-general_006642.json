The \"sun\" is created as a source but not the sky\ndome (see below).\n\n\n> # gensky 3 7 10:30CET +s -a 57.013056 -o -9.988333\n> # Local solar time: 9.98\n> # Solar altitude and azimuth: 22.4 -32.9\n> # Ground ambient level: 11.1\n\n\nThese lines are just comments with useful stuff about the sky.

What's missing is a geometry it can be\napplied to. I assume you have used gensky on the command line and\nsaved the output to a file. Add the following lines at the end of the\nfile:\n\n\n# basic glow material for sky; brightness is defined by 'skyfunc'\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\n# sky dome: 'source' type with skyglow material covering upper hemisphere\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\n# material for ground; use same brightness function but reduced to 10 percent\nskyfunc glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4 0.1 0.1 0.1 0\n\n\n# apply 'groundglow' to source covering the lower hemisphere\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180\n\n\n# end of sky and ground description\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006642.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 13, 2010 at 02:20PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006641", "id": "radiance-general_006642"}
