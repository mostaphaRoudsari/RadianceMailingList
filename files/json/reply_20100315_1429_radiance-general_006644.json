{"body": "Hi Terrance,\n\n\nThis is the as-designed behavior for ranimate.  The basic assumption  \nis that you have an NFS-shared filesystem or the like where user names  \nare preserved.  Therefore, even if you are logging in as a different  \nuser on the remote machine, it assumes you want to execute ranimate in  \nthe originating user's home directory, and you have set up directory  \nand file permissions accordingly.  I suppose I should add a check on  \nthe remote directory, and if a full path is given, forego the cd to  \nthe originating home directory.\n\n\nThe recommended workaround if this is not the case is to write your  \nown remote ssh-replacement and do whatever custom things you want done  \nwith that, assigning the RSH variable in the .ran file.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006644.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 15, 2010 at 02:29PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006621", "id": "radiance-general_006644"}
