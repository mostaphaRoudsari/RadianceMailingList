{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nI installed your Mac Radiance 4.0 binaries and all is well except when I try to use rvu with X11.\nrad foo.rif works fine and produces an hdr image\n\n\nrad -o x11 foo.rif produced this error\ndyld: Library not loaded: usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib\nReferenced from: /usr/local/bin/rvu\nReason: image not found\n\n\nAt first, I did not have a /usr/X11 directory, but I do have usr/X11R6\nSo I copied the contents of X11R6 into a new folder at same level called X11 (don't cringe!) and got this error\ndyld: Library not loaded: usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib\nReferenced from: /usr/local/bin/rvu\nReason: Incompatible library version: rvu requires version 9.0.0 or later, but libX11.6.dylib provides version 6.2.0\n\n\nWhen I copied back all the Radiance 3.9 binaries, I can view in X11 again.\nDo I need to update X11 or something?\nI'm on a Intel Core2 Duo Mac OS 10.4.11\n\n\nThanks\nRob Fitzsimmons\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006649.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Fitzsimmons", "created_at": "March 17, 2010 at 03:32PM", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006645", "id": "radiance-general_006649"}
