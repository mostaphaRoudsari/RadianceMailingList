{"body": "Sorry, I plead ignorance to how X11 gets installed under various  \nversions of Mac OS X.  Mine was pre-installed, I think.  There is a  \nsymbolic link from /usr/lib/X11R6 to X11 (in the same directory) on my  \nmachine, but I'm not sure how it got there.  There are only dynamic  \nversions of the X11 libraries near as I can tell, so static linking  \nfor the purposes of binary distribution isn't supported.\n\n\nRob G's suggestion to recompile yourself is probably best.  Sorry I'm  \nnot more help.  Anyone else have a solution?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006651.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2010 at 09:18PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006645", "id": "radiance-general_006651"}
