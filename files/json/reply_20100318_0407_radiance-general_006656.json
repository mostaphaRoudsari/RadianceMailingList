{"body": "Hi Anselm.\n\n\nI don't know if Relux produces plain Radiance RGBE HDR images. If so\nyou can modify them using the tools provided in the Radiance\ndistribution. You will have the command line, though.\n\n\nTo mix two (or more) images you can use the program pcomb. You can\nspecify a multiplier for each image. For example, to mix\n\"downlight.hdr\" with 60% and \"wallwash.hdr\" at 40% you would use the\ncommand:\n\n\npcomb -s 0.6 downlight.hdr -s 0.4 wallwash.hdr > room_6_4.hdr\n\n\nUsing HDR images as input will give you the 'correct' amount of light\nin a space. However, if you are only interested in a 'visual' fade\nbetween the two you can simply convert the two images to a 32bit TIF\nor BMP image and use the controls you know from Photoshop. I would\nthink Relux has tools to do that. If not this is the equivalent\nRadiance command line:\n\n\nra_tiff images.hdr image.tif\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 18, 2010 at 10:09 AM, Anselm von Held\n<anselm.von-held at arup.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006656.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 18, 2010 at 04:07AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006655", "id": "radiance-general_006656"}
