{"body": "Dear Alejandro,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaysim/Radiance does not distinguish between simple and simple geometries. (Of course, if a sensor is located  in a wall it should yield zero lighting unless your ambient accuracy value is set too high.) My suspicion is that you are reading in a wrong set of sensor points into Ecotect. Ecotect has no intrinsic way of making sure that a DA file actually goes with your current sensor grind. It is up to you to make sure that the two are consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006668.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "March 23, 2010 at 07:39AM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006667", "id": "radiance-general_006668"}
