{"body": "Hello all:\n\n\nI have some questions relating to gensky command.\n\n\n(1) The book of \"Rendering with radiance\" says luminous efficacy is set to\n179 for all CIE sky models. Is that true for current version?\n\n\n(2) If I know Solar direct radiation and diffuse radiation, I hope to use\nPerez's (source: Modeling daylight availability and irradiance components\nfrom direct and global irradiance, 1990 solar energy) models (that is,\ninterpolate two CIE sky model according to radiation), is that possible to\ngenerate a new sky luminance distribution model by interpolation of two\nstandard CIE model in Radiance in order to calculate the interior\nilluminance more accurately?\n\n\nThank you,.\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006674.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "March 25, 2010 at 06:20PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004434", "id": "radiance-general_006674"}
