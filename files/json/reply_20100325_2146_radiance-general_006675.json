Check the manpage for gendaylit. I have been using it lately for some studies based on TMY weather file info and it works well!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006675.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 25, 2010 at 09:46PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004434", "id": "radiance-general_006675"}
