{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\ngendaylit was only included in the source distribution for the last couple months (maybe even less than that, the days are blurring together lately). Not sure what you mean by \"it\" was developed in 1994. Are you using pre-compiled binaries, or some kind of rpm distribution? If so, I doubt you have gendaylit installed, as this was included in the Radiance source distribution only recently. Gendaylit has been around a while, but prior to the new Radiance release, you had to go get it and compile it yourself. If you are compiling from source, then you could grab the latest official release (announced very recently) and compile, and you'd have it. \n\n\nAt any rate, it's worth seeking it out one way or another because you can use it for precisely what you're talking about. \n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006678.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 25, 2010 at 10:05PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004434", "id": "radiance-general_006678"}
