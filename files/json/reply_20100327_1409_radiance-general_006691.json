{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nYour compile results are strange.  It seems like all the binary files  \nare being compiled, but the final copy to your executable destination  \nis usually skipped.  This may be due to a false error being reported  \nby the linker or some other configuration problem.  I would try  \nrerunning \"makeall install\" a second time to see if that doesn't fix  \nit.  It shouldn't be necessary, but something is wrong with your build  \nsystem.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006691.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 27, 2010 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004434", "id": "radiance-general_006691"}
