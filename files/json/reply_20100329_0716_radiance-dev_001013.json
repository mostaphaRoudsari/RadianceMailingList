{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nI had a quick look at your output, and it appears that the header is  \nbeing written with '\\r\\n' at the end of each line rather than the  \nexpected '\\n' alone.  This causes problems especially for the  \nresolution string.  The pcompos program (and most others in Radiance)  \nset binary mode before writing any output.  Somehow, your script is  \nbypassing this step, but I didn't have a look at it and don't know  \nPython, anyway, so probably couldn't be much help.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-March/001013.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 29, 2010 at 07:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001012", "id": "radiance-dev_001013"}
