{"body": "Thanks Greg.\n\n\nI made a few more tests and it turns out that the same image data\nwritten directly to a file works fine. The problem is apparently\nintroduced when I write to stdout.\n\n\nThe '\\r\\n' vs '\\n' makes sense because that's where Python insists on\ntaking control and doing the right thing for the platform. I have to\nfigure out how to stop that.\n\n\nThanks,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 29, 2010 at 3:16 PM, Gregory J.
