{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nIf you haven't passed the picture through pfilt or otherwise  \nintroduced an exposure change, then it would be much faster to use  \npcompos to extract the value you're interested in.  E.g.:\n\n\n\tpcompos -x 1 -y 1 rendered_image.hdr -Xpos -Ypos | pvalue -h -H -d\n\n\nIf getinfo shows one or more EXPOSURE= lines in the header, then the  \nabove won't quite work and you'll need to use pvalue.  The syntax for  \nthe command you want is:\n\n\n\tpvalue -o -h -H rendered_image.hdr | rcalc -e 'eq(a,b):if(a-b+.5,b-a+. \n5,-1);and(a,b):if(a,b,a)' \\\n\t\t-e 'cond=and(eq($1,x_location),eq($2,y_location))' -e '$1=$3;$2= \n$4;$3=$5'\n\n\nNasty, eh?  It's also slow.  Use pcompos if you can.  A faster  \nalternative to the above is to use sed:\n\n\n\tpvalue -o -h -H rendered_image.hdr | sed -n 's/^ *x_location   \n*y_location //p'\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006710.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 05, 2010 at 09:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006707", "id": "radiance-general_006710"}
