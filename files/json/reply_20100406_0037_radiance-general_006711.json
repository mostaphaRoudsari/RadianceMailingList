This can be done just using pcomb. Make \nsure to include the -o switch to eliminate any display settings \n(exposure etc).\n\n\nBe aware that \"center\" is the optical axis and not necessarily the \ncenter of the sensor, so you must find out the pixel position of it.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006711.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
