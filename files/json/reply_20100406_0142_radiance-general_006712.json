{"body": "Chris.\n\n\nI assume you want to extract a single Lux value from an image.\n\n\nMy first idea would be to use pcompos to reduce the image size to a\n1x1 image and then have pvalue convert that to R,G,B:\n\n\npcompos -x 1 -y 1 image.hdr -xpos -ypos | pvalue -o -d -h -H\n\n\n-xpos and -ypos are the negative offset of the pixel you want to\ncalculate. So if you want to know the value at (321,123) it would be\n\n\npcompos -x 1 -y 1 image.hdr -321 -123 | pvalue -o -d -h -H\n\n\nYou have to experiment with the offset. You might have to add or\nsubstract  1 to get exactly the pixel you want.\n\n\nThe you just use the standard conversion of  R,G,B to Lux with rcalc:\n\n\npcompos -x 1 -y 1 image.hdr -xpos -ypos | pvalue -o -d -h -H | rcalc\n-e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)*179'\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 5, 2010 at 10:53 PM, Chris Humann <chris at coolshadow.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006712.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 06, 2010 at 01:42AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006707", "id": "radiance-general_006712"}
