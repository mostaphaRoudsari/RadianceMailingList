{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\n> I have a rules of thumb for setting -lw:\n> - to trace every ray spawned, -lw should be roughly 1/(ad^ab)  - watch out, every ray may be too much!\n> - if you have settings that produce a nice result with rpict try dividing -lw by the number of sky divisions for rtcontrib.\n>\n> I seen significant grainniness improvements by reducing -lw.\n\n\nThanks for that. It's interesting that you set -lw to 1/ad^ab, not just \n1/ad. Will try this out. I also feel that the number of sky divisions \nshould have an impact on -ad (especially for sunny skies), but I can't \nquite put my finger on it.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006721.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "April 09, 2010 at 03:16PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006719", "id": "radiance-general_006721"}
