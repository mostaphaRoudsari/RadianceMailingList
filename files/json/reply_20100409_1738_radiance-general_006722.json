{"body": "Using -lw set to 1/(ad^ab) can be a bit extreme, but as I said you  \nshould set -lw no higher than 1/ad.  The smaller the value, the less  \nnoisy your indirect result, but a bit of experimentation on time/ \nquality trade-off is (as always) a good idea.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006722.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 09, 2010 at 05:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006719", "id": "radiance-general_006722"}
