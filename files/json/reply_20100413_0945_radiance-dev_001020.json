{"body": "Hi Daniel.\n\n\nI believe the update of the scons scripts for 3.9 is largely due to\nFrancesco's efforts with mingw. I tried to compile 4.0 a few weeks ago\nand search the list for mails about compiling on Windows. Most of\nFrancesco's comments where already in place.\n\n\nI didn't get too far with my own efforts although I was surprised that\nmost of the core apps did compile fine. I had to change a few bits\nhere and there and modify the includes. I also came across the time_gm\n(?) issue and replace it with a function that is part of time.h on\nWindows. I think it's only used to produce a time stamp and at that\nmoment I just wanted to see if I could get the stuff to work at all.\n\n\nIn the end I gave up when it came to rtcontrib and all the definitions\nfrom ray.h where suddenly not available any more. I couldn't find what\nwas wrong with my limited knowledge of C and because it was just\ncuriosity that made me do it in the first place I gave up.\n\n\nI hope someone who is actually using Windows will pick it up soon.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 13, 2010 at 5:15 PM, Macumber, Daniel\n<Daniel.Macumber at nrel.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-April/001020.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 13, 2010 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001019", "id": "radiance-dev_001020"}
