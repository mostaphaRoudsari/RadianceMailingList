{"body": "Brajesh,\n\n\nIf you want more accurate sun vectors, I would suggest trying out \nthe libnova package:\n\n\nhttp://libnova.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nIt's pretty easy to build, and comes with some example code that \nwill help you build a lightweight sun vector program quickly.\n\n\nI use libnova to compute sun, moon, and star placements for a \nRadiance tool that I made called \"genutahsky\" (which works very \nmuch like gensky, but creates a more thorough, colorful, but \nless-flexible sky description). More on that tool here:\n\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/radiance/\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Thu, 15 Apr 2010, Brajesh Lal wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006733.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "April 15, 2010 at 10:35AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006730", "id": "radiance-general_006733"}
