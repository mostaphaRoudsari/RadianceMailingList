{"body": "In simple terms, if any of the three surfaces that the ray has hit have\na direct source shining onto it, the ray will pick up the direct light\nreflected from those surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, I can see why you would think a very small light source with\nlittle probability of ray intersection would rarely contribute to the\nambient calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Behalf Of Jia Hu\nSent: Tuesday, April 20, 2010 1:11 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello all:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf ab (ambient bounces) =3, after a ray reaches three times of diffuse\nbounces and does not hit any lighting source, then how should Radiance\ndefine the value of this ray, for example, radiance or irradiance, in\norder to calculate the radiance at the viewpoint using backward ray\ntracing?   I read chapters about calculation methods in the book,\nRendering with radiance, but still a little confused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nJia\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006736.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 20, 2010 at 01:57AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006735", "id": "radiance-general_006736"}
