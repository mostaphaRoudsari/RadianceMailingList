{"body": "Sorry, I just want to clarify my question.\n\n\nFor the methods used in Radiance, there are three parts to calculate: direct\ncomponent, specular indirect component, and diffuse indirect component.\n\n\nFor the direct and specular components, the value of contribution is got by\nhitting the source, is there any limit for the number of bounces for these\ntwo component?\n\n\n But for diffuse component, how can we define the value after the number of\nbounces (the value of \"ab\" ) is exceeded since the diffuse\ncomponent considers those without hitting any source? The rays hitting the\nsource will be discarded because the other components have considered them.\n\n\nThank you,\njia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006739.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "April 20, 2010 at 04:56AM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006735", "id": "radiance-general_006739"}
