{"body": "Yes. That's the idea.\n\n\n-av is just a way to recover the ambient light that would be lost due\nto a limit on ambient bounces. To understand how -av influences the\nresults you can run a test scene once with a high '-ab' (say 6 or 7)\nand '-av 0 0 0' and then reduce the '-ab' to 2 or 3 and increase the\n-av value. When the two results are more or less the same you have\npicked the right -av.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 20, 2010 at 12:39 PM, Jia Hu <hujia06 at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006740.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 20, 2010 at 04:59AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006735", "id": "radiance-general_006740"}
