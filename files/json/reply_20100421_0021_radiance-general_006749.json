{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nVery nice tool and easy to use! I think Radiance users in windows will be\nvery happy with this tool!\n\n\nJust one thing to check.\nWhen I start program before main window is opened, I got an error:\n\"The procedure entry point EtwTraceMessage couldnt no be located in the\ndynamic link library ntdll.dll\"\n\n\nWhen I close error message, program is opened it seems that all features are\nworking without problems.\n\n\nI'm using Windows XP Professional.\n\n\nThanks again for such a useful tool,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006749.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "April 21, 2010 at 12:21AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006747", "id": "radiance-general_006749"}
