{"body": "Nick.\n\n\nIn Radiance geometry and material definition go hand in hand. You\ncould try evaluating the surface normal to chose the correct material\nin a custom expression but that would increase your render time\nsignificantly.\n\n\nAs an alternative you could use the same geometry with a small\nz-offset. If you have all the blinds in a separate *.rad file use the\n-m option of xform to give them a new modifier:\n\n\n!xform -m grey_mat blinds.rad\n!xform -m chrome -t 0 0 -0.001 blinds.rad\n\n\nThat will offset the blinds by 0.001 units down and use the material\n'chrome' for this 'side'.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 21, 2010 at 5:16 PM, Nick Hubof <nhubof at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 21, 2010 at 02:21PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006752", "id": "radiance-general_006754"}
