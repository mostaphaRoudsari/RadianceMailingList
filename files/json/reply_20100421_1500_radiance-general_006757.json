{"body": "Thank you for the replys. I ended up trying the mixfunc route and that worked well.\n\n\nSo since you fixed that issue, I have one more issue that I don\u2019t know can be resolved easily. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese blinds also have 1/32\u201d  perforated holes spaced about 1/32\u201d apart. \n\n\nPicture: http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/DSC_0103.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have tried  the perforate.cal mixfunc, to create this effect, but as I rotate the blinds to simulated them shut or half shut the function doesn\u2019t work, because the blind rotates along the z axis. So what results are elongated holes when the blinds are closed.\n\n\nvoid mixfunc Perforation_Chrome\n\n\n6 Chrome void z_hole perforate.cal -s 0.00079375\n\n\n0\n\n\n1 0.4\n\n\nIf any of you have suggestions to get around this issue it would be much appreciated.\n\n\nThank you again for the help on the previous issue!\n\n\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006757.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Hubof", "created_at": "April 21, 2010 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Nick_Hubof", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006752", "id": "radiance-general_006757"}
