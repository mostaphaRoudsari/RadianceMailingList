{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nIf you are interested in material performance of these blinds, I am not really sure that perforate.cal is what you want use. How are you transforming the geometry of the blinds to get the rotation?\n\n\nAnother way to do this would be to split your blind geometry in half with an opaque half that use the blind mixfunc and a translucent half built either use some combination of trans and mixfunc definitions or perhaps using a simple form of BRTDfunc to account for front and backside reflectance and material transmittance. If I recall correctly the manufacturer provides some transmittance information...\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless Phone\n\n\n----- Reply message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006758.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John de Valpine", "created_at": "April 21, 2010 at 04:33PM", "created_by": "John_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006752", "id": "radiance-general_006758"}
