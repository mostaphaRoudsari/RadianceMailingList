{"body": "Jack,\n\n\nThank you for the suggestions. The series of blind rotations are modeled separately (so that I can easily add and subtract them for the scene) and I have also modeled a little less than half of the blind to be ready for the perforation material. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to match the blinds physically without using a trans material. The project we are working on requires us to match a photo of a space that uses these blinds. We not only want to match the space aesthetically but also have accurate illumination plots and luminance rendering data. \n\n\nThe perorate.cal looks good when the blinds are in the horizontal (open) position, it is when we render the other angles that the perforations become stretched. I have had success in the past altering the axis that these .cal files use, but when I have the blinds angled between straight up/down and horizontal then I run into the problem.\n\n\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006759.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Hubof", "created_at": "April 21, 2010 at 05:29PM", "created_by": "Nick_Hubof", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006752", "id": "radiance-general_006759"}
