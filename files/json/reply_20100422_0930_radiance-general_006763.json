{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nSo if I understand correctly, you have blind geometry modeled at different rotations where you then turn on only the rotation that you want to render. If your blinds only run in one direction then you should be able to apply a rotation to the perforated material. If not then Thomas' suggestion of modifying perforate.cal to use UV coordinates is probably the way to go.\n\n\nFrom an accuracy point of view I am not sure that using perforate.cal to model the holes and spacing is actually going to be accurate from the standpoint of evaluating illuminance as the holes are rather small and will be dependent on image resolution. Thus my suggestion to consider trans or BRTDfunc where measured transmittance can be applied. Perhaps others can jump in and let me know if I am missing something on this.\n\n\nFrom the standpoint of a luminance simulation, ie a rendering, then if in your views you might actually be close enough to see the holes then using perforate.cal might be nice. But you might want to examine some photos or check out an installation to understand how much of the perforation you actually perceive.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless Phone\n\n\n----- Reply message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006763.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John de Valpine", "created_at": "April 22, 2010 at 09:30AM", "created_by": "John_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006752", "id": "radiance-general_006763"}
