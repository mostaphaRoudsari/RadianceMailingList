If you give an argument that would\nnot work with falsecolor/falsecolor2 it won't work in wxfalsecolor.\n\n\nIf you set the DEBUG property of FalsecolorImage it will report all\ncommand lines and how they are passed to Popen.\n\n\nHth,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-April/001023.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 23, 2010 at 03:18PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001022", "id": "radiance-dev_001023"}
