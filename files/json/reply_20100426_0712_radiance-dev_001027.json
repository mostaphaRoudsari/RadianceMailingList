{"body": "If you let me know which version of Scons is best to use I'd happily\ntrack it down & install it as I'm doing all this building on a virtual\nmachine anyway.\n\n\nI was following the How-To guide at\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=how_to_compile_radianc\ne_using_the_mingw_tools_and_scons & had to figure out that Python 2.x is\nrequired for Scons, not Python 3.x so picking the right version of Scons\ntoo would be a great help. Looking at their repository in Sourceforge\nthere are 1.1, 1.0.1 & 1.0.0 available. Once I figure it out I'll update\nthe Wiki page.\n\n\nTried updating to Python 2.6.5 & Scons 1.3.0, still the same issues as\nyou'd expect. Going to try Scons 1.1.0 now & see how it goes.\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher \nSoftware Deployment & IT Administrator\nT: +44 (0) 141 945 8500 \nF: +44 (0) 141 945 8501 \n\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com \n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
