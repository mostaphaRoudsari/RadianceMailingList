Looks like\nI should have tested the installation code more thorougly,\nbut I just didn't expect it to suddenly cause trouble.\n\n\nThe problem is hat several files in the Radiance source tree\nexist in identical duplicates. SCons tries to install both of\nthem onto the same target, for which it has no solution.\nI don't currently have access to the most current distribution,\nbut in my source tree those are:\n\n\nray/lib/clockface.hex   ray/src/gen/clockface.hex\nray/lib/surf.cal        ray/src/gen/surf.cal\nray/lib/lamp.tab        ray/src/cv/lamp.tab\n\n\nSolution: The SConscript files in the  the ray/src/gen and\nray/src/cv directories each have a variable assignment near\nthe bottom of the form:\n   LIBFILES=Split('a b c d')\nIgnoring any syntactic variations, the problem files are part\nof the 'a b c d' list. Just remove them one by one (leaving\nsome whitspace as seperator for the remaining entries) until\ninstallation succeeds.\n\n\nObviously that is only a stop gap measure for now. The real\nsolution would be to eliminate the file duplication. As far\nas I can tell, the makeall script currently installs each of\nthem twice, one copy overwriting the other.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-April/001029.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 27, 2010 at 12:57AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001019", "id": "radiance-dev_001029"}
