{"body": "Dear Jack and Lars,\n   Thank you very much for the timely modeling advice-- yes, I can see \nhow calibrating the photographs can help with selecting the right color \nfor the stone and brick.  Also, thanks for the tips on color variation \nstrategies.\n    I will let you know what I come up with for the texture.  I know its \na cross between an art and a science in doing so (e.g. see the \"forest\" \nexample below)-- just thought maybe someone have studied this material \nbefore.  On a related note, have there been discussions on having a \nmaterial database at radiance-online/elsewhere?\n   On a project where I had to quickly model how a forest would impact \nthe lighting on a facade, I hacked perforate.cal instead of trying to \nmodel the actual trees (trunks, branches, needles, yuk).\n\n\nThis was the real scene:\n\n\nhttp://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/forest.jpg\n\n\nand this was what was modeled:\n\n\nhttp://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/model.jpg\n\n\nand the script I hacked:\n\n\nhttp://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/forest.cal\n\n\nGiven more time I would have tried to increase the density of the dot \npattern near the ground/etc.\n\n\n- Dan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006775.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Glaser", "created_at": "April 27, 2010 at 10:02AM", "created_by": "Dan_Glaser", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006743", "id": "radiance-general_006775"}
