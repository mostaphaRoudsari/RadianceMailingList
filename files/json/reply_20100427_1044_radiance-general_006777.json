{"body": "Hi Dan,\n\n\nThere have been questions and discussions on a material database. But I \nthink that given the quantity and variety of materials out there this \nquickly gets out of control. Consider glazing alone with something like \nOptics5  (a complete software package!) for dealing with this class of \nmaterials.\n\n\nPerhaps another way to consider the forest is by estimating an average \ntransmittance and then just using a trans material. One could even vary \nthis over some vertical dimension.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nDan Glaser wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006777.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 27, 2010 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006743", "id": "radiance-general_006777"}
