{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nGood timing.  Jan & I were just discussing this, and trying to settle  \non a final set of dates.  Apparently, there is a conflict with the  \noriginal dates suggested for September, as the Bausim-Conference is  \ntaking place in Vienna from the 22nd to the 24th.  The October dates  \nweren't good for me, either, so Jan suggested Sept. 20-22nd --  \noverlapping Bausim with an optional third day (Wed.) to cover one or  \nmore special topics.\n\n\nAnyone have any objections to a Sept. 20-22 schedule for the 2010  \nworkshop?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006778.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 27, 2010 at 10:26PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006776", "id": "radiance-general_006778"}
