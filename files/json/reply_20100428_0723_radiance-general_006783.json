{"body": "Hi Brajesh,\n\n\nUsually a few months before the workshop there is a call for speakers and\nthe results of that will define the core content. In the past there has also\nbeen a tutorial component to some of the workshops (last year there was an\nall-day HDR imaging tutorial). I'd expect an update on cost and content\nafter the call for speakers goes out.\n\n\nI am hoping to make it out there this year, and the new dates work for me,\nso, yay.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 4/28/10 5:00 AM, \"Brajesh Lal\" <brajeshlal at yahoo.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006783.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 28, 2010 at 07:23AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006776", "id": "radiance-general_006783"}
