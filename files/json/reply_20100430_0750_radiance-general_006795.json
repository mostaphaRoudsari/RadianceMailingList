{"body": "Our office uses Autodesk Ecotect mostly because of its ability to handle\nillumination grids, it is also well suited to export to Radiance. However it\nisn't the best modeling program, so typically modeling in other programs and\nimporting is one of the best options.\n\n\nWhen we bring in Revit models we import them as a .dwg.\n\n\nBut when we bring in a Sketchup model it is imported as a .obj.\n\n\nMost architectural models have more detail than what is needed for daylight\nanalysis or renderings, so alter the models within their native modeling\nprogram (Revit, Sketchup) first while thinking of how Ecotect/Radiance will\nhandle it. Good luck.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006795.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Hubof", "created_at": "April 30, 2010 at 07:50AM", "created_by": "Nick_Hubof", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006785", "id": "radiance-general_006795"}
