{"body": "I have modeled the reflective blinds that we had discussed in this thread earlier, but I would like your opinion on the rendering settings. I could do a bunch of tests at low resolution but even with our 8 processor mac it still takes a while and I would get faster results asking all of you smart people out there. \n\n\nHere is an image of the blinds in an open position. \n\n\nhttp://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/genzyme_2010_04_21_c1.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting image has many reflection spots on the ceiling, which is the problem.
