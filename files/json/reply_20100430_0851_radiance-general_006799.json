{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nUnfortunately, you've hit upon the one case that Radiance doesn't  \nreally handle properly:  curved, specular window coverings.  Your best  \nhope at this point is to add some roughness to the specular side of  \nyour surface and use mkillum to generate an output distribution.  If  \nyou could measure a BTDF for the blinds and give it to mkillum that  \nway, you'd be golden, but I don't expect that you have such a thing.\n\n\nEventually, we hope to create a tool that would allow you to model  \nthis (and other types) complex fenestration, but we're a few months  \naway from having that ready.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006799.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 30, 2010 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006752", "id": "radiance-general_006799"}
