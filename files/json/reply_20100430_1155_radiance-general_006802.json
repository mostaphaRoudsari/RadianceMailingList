{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nThis was more of a struggle than I expected.  I don't know what I did  \nwith my old color wheel, so I tried to come up with an expression to  \ngenerate a new one based on the Wikipedia page on HSV conversions.   \nIt's not quite what I was going for, but it's OK:\n\n\npcomb -x 512 -y xres \\\n-e 'xc:xres/2;yc:yres/2;xr=(x-xc)/xc;yr=(y-yc)/yc' \\\n-e 'rv=.7349*xr-.3495*yr;gv=-.2651*xr+.2279*yr;bv=-.2651*xr-.9268*yr' \\\n-e 'max(a,b):if(a-b,a,b);Y=1-max(rv,max(gv,bv))' \\\n-e 'in=1-xr*xr-yr*yr' \\\n-e 'ro=if(in,Y+rv,.5);go=if(in,Y+gv,.5);bo=if(in,Y+bv,.5)' \\\n| ra_tiff - color_wheel.tif\n\n\nWhen the user chooses a color, you'll have to map back to linear RGB  \n(undoing the 2.2 gamma) and normalize.\n\n\nHope it works!\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I didn't notice the trick of going to \"plastic\" when  \ntransmission is zero -- very nice!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006802.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 30, 2010 at 11:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006792", "id": "radiance-general_006802"}
