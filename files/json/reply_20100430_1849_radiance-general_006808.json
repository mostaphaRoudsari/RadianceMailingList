{"body": "Hello:\n\n\nFirst thank all of you for the replies.\n\n\nI tried some ways mentioned, I am confused with some of the methods.\n\n\n*(1)* When I export Revit to fbx and then use FBX converter (provided by\nautodesk) to convert fbx to .obj file.  The .mtl file just contains the name\nof materials without any other data such as RGB, or reflectance.\n\n\nAlso I tried to use: obj2rad -n objfile.obj > obj.data .    I found all the\nmaterials in .obj file should be defined. Some of  them are as follows:\n\n\n\"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188653_\"\n\"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188781_\"\n\"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188881_\"\n\"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188971_\"\n\"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__189016_\"\n...... too long\n\n\nShould I define so many materials? Maybe I should delete some of them if\nthey use the same materials.\n\n\n*(2)* I am stuck with the command obj2rad. I just know some basic knowledge\nof .obj file such as its basic structure, the basic command of obj file.\nBut  I can not follow the man page of obj2rad, such as mapping rule file.\n\n\nIs that right the mapping rule file in this command contained the texture\nand materials (like those in Radiance) or some images?  Should I write\nup the mapping file by myself or just find from somewhere?   I have no idea\nof what the mapping file is so, Could someone send me one or two\nsmall examples of map files or others related to this command?\n\n\n*(3)* When the building model is complicated, is that reliable for this\ncommand? I mean whether it makes mistakes about the surface normals. Is\nthere any point that should be noted when using export Revit file to\nRadiance?\n\n\n\n\n*(4)* If I export .dwg, the torad autolisp (\nhttp://www.schorsch.com/download/torad/) seems to be used for AutoCAD\nR11-14. If I use Polytrans, for example, should I convert obj file? Is there\nany better way?\n\n\n*(5) *I do not have a SketchUp pro, so I just browsed the su2rad for free\nversion of SketchUp, it seems easy to understand.\n\n\nSorry for so many confusions and questions.\n\n\nAs always, Thank you all.\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006808.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "April 30, 2010 at 06:49PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006785", "id": "radiance-general_006808"}
