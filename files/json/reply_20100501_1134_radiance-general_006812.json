Front or back does only\nmatter if you use a emitting material like 'glow' or 'light' which\nonly emits to the front side.\n\n\n> In .obj file, the\u00a0face with vertex index 1, 2 and 3 and\u00a0face with vertex\n> index 3, 2 and 1 should have opposite normals,\u00a0 So are the materials added to\n> the two surfaces are different.\n\n\nThe front face of a polygon is defined by the right-hand-rule. But\nsince front and back material are identical it does not really matter.\n\n\n> ...\n> vn 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000\n> vn 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000\u00a0 (this all zeros casue errors when using\n> obj2rad)\n> ...\n\n\nThat's what I meant about the quality of the *.obj files. You only\nneed the vertex normals if you want a smoothed surface (for example\nfor a round column) instead of the faceted polygons. If you can't get\nit to work with -f you can just delete all the lines starting with\n\"vt\".\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006812.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 01, 2010 at 11:34AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006785", "id": "radiance-general_006812"}
