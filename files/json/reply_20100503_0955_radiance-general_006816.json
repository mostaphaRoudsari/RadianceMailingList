It\nworks fine on Safari (OS X) and Chrome (OS X).\n\n\nChrome on Windows 7 works but the labels are not visible (might be\nrelated to my vm-ware shared drive). These labels are crated by\njavascript which is unfortunately compacted and very hard to modify.\nThey could easily be made static which would make the widget/html\nusable on Windows/Chrome, too.\n\n\nFirefox shows the sliders as text fields. The sliders (as used) seem\nto be a Webkit only feature. It should be easy to translate that to a\ncross platform toolkit like jQuery. Dojo is already part of the mix\nsomehow.\n\n\nAll in all it seems trivial to produce a stand alone javascript\nversion of this.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006816.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 03, 2010 at 09:55AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006792", "id": "radiance-general_006816"}
