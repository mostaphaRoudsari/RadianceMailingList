So for a browser/web based\npage they have to be replaced.\n\n\n> I've also received feedback that it doesn't work in OSX 10.4 which\n> is a bummer, and probably related to the webkit sliders.\n>\n> I'm not sure what to do about the labels.\n\n\nThe labels are no big deal. The static text can be placed in the main\nhtml file. The surrounding DIVs are already there; they are just not\nfilled in by javascript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006818.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 03, 2010 at 02:11PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006792", "id": "radiance-general_006818"}
