{"body": "If you have access to Rhino you could use that also to open a DWG file and export to OBJ. If the DWG is separated by layers you can assign each layer a material name in Rhino, which will be carried into your OBJ export and kept successfully via obj2rad. Occasionally I\u2019ve seen bad DWG export that when opened in Rhino moves some surfaces out of place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis process usually creates good OBJ/RAD files. The Rhino OBJ export also allows you to select the polygon size/count you require depending on how complex your geometry is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006821.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 05, 2010 at 06:15AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006819", "id": "radiance-general_006821"}
