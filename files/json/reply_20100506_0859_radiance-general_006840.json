{"body": "Giovanni.\n\n\nIt's your lucky day! It turns out that I have all my packaging\nrequirements here on my work PC. I have added a \"-s auto\" option and\ntested it a tiny bit. You have to do the rest.\n\n\nI couldn't send you the file via PM so I have uploaded a zip with the\nbinary here:\n\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor/falsecolor2.zip?attredirects=0&d=1\n\n\nIf the link doesn't work go the attachments at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nTo the rest of you out there: I really haven't done much testing. Use\nat your own risk. There will be another release of\nwxfalsecolor/falsecolor2 soon which will include this feature (and\nmore).\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006840.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 06, 2010 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006833", "id": "radiance-general_006840"}
