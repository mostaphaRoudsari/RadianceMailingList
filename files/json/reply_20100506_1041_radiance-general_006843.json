Then you could use the data to \ne.g. fit a trans material to it. The normal incidence alone is not \nreally suitable to reflect the incident distribution for a window...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006843.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
