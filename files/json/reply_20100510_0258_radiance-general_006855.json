{"body": "Chris,\n\n\nXform2 is an additional program that IES created.  Similar to xform,  \nIES uses xform2 to create rectangles of arbitrary dimension for, it  \nseems, use as workplanes (and perhaps other functions).  It does this  \nby applying arbitrary scaling in the x and y dimensions  \n(independently) on a unit square polygon (z = 0.8) and translating the  \noutput to the desired location in the scene.  In addition to the usual  \nxform options, xform2 has -sx and -sy to perform the scaling in the x  \n& y dims.\n\n\nI came across this IES peculiarity when transferring IES created  \ngeometry to other platforms for simulation using standard (UNIX)  \nRadiance.  In those instances it was simply a matter of stripping out  \nthe xform2 commands, which didn't affect the building geometry since  \ntheir use was confined to generating workplanes.  However, from the  \nerror messages that you posted it seems that xform2 is being used for  \nmore general transformations where xform would suffice.  Perhaps IES  \nhave replaced xform with their own xform2. As an aside, I'm surprised  \nto see any form of xform/2 command used for general building geometry  \ncreated in IES because I expected its 3D modeller to create explicit  \ngeometry (for all but the workplanes).\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006855.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 10, 2010 at 02:58AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006852", "id": "radiance-general_006855"}
