{"body": "Thanks John and Lars\n\n\nI tried a few things based on your comments, e.g. calling up xform\ninstead of xform2, making sure that the location input is ok, but\nunfortunately without success.\n\n\nThe problem really seems to be specific to certain computers. One file\nwhich ran fine yesterday on my colleagues computer, didn't work on mine\nwhen I tried to run it just afterwards.\n\n\nCould it be that there is something in e.g. my windows registry that\ncauses this issue? The batch files created by VE include the following\nline before they run the radiance programs:\n\n\nSET PATH=C:\\Windows;C:\\Windows\\system32;C:\\Program Files\\IES\\VE\n6\\apps\\ray\n\n\n\n\nCheers\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Begert\n\n\nAssociate\n\n\nsbe \n\n\nsustainable built environments \n\n\nInnovative ideas, collaborative design, practical solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006858.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Begert", "created_at": "May 10, 2010 at 11:14PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Begert", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006852", "id": "radiance-general_006858"}
