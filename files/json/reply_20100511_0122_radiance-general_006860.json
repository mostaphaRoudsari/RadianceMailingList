{"body": "Another peculiarity of IES, at least the Radiance part, is that it  \ndoesn't like to work from anything other than the system disk, i.e.  \ntrying to work from a project saved on USB stick/drive nearly always  \nleads to problems (I imagine it's the same for FW drives). You're  \nadvised to save a project as a CAB file and copy that if you want to  \ntransfer a project between computers. Probably best to ensure also  \nthat the various PCs are running the same version of IES.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006860.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 11, 2010 at 01:22AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006852", "id": "radiance-general_006860"}
