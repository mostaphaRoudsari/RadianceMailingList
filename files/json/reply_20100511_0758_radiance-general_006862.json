{"body": "Cramer,\n\n\nIt appears that your system's X11 header files are not in \n/usr/include/X11. Every error in the output is because the \ninstaller is looking in /usr/include/X11 for header files. The \nwarnings are all ignorable. And rtrace is still running the old \nversion, which doesn't have the \"-n\" option.\n\n\nDo an \"ls /usr/include/X11\" and see if that directory contains \nfiles like \"Xutil.h\" and \"Xlib.h\". If not, see if \n/usr/include/X11R6, or some other directory like that contains \nthem. Once you've found them, when you run the makeall script, \nchoose to edit the makefile. Change the \"-I/usr/include/X11\" to \nreflect the header files actual location.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nPS. I use Fedora (10 now) and things work.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006862.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "May 11, 2010 at 07:58AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006861", "id": "radiance-general_006862"}
