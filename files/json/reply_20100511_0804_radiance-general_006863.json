Unfortunately the makefile doesn't have a 'build' target,\nso you could restrict the sudo to just the installation step.\n\n\n> Lots of\n> scary things flashed by, and i caught various warnings going by.\n\n\nUse the following to capture the output into a file:\n\n\nsudo ./makeall install | tee build.log\n\n\nThat will copy all the output to \"build.log\" and you can inspect it\nlater in detail.\n\n\n> It then\n> stopped with \"There were some errors.\" So I tried an rtrace job that I know\n> runs on 3.9, and it still runs.
