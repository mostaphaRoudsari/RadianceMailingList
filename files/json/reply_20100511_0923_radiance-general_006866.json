{"body": "Mark, Jack, & Thomas,\n\n\nThanks for the tips! I tried adding the libx11-dev and csh packages, but \nit still didn't work. So I (gave up and) grabbed Jack's compiled version \nfrom his ftp site, copied the files to the right places, and it now \nreports 4.0 as the version for rtrace and rvu.\n\n\nI'm hung up a new error though, rtrace reports that it can't find \n\"inglas.cal\". Does that sound familiar to anyone? It could be a file one \nof my german colleagues made that I lost in the process, but \nunfortunately they've all gone home for the day already...\n\n\nThanks again,\nCramer\n\n\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth at transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth at transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in \nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006866.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cramer Silkworth", "created_at": "May 11, 2010 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "Cramer_Silkworth", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006861", "id": "radiance-general_006866"}
