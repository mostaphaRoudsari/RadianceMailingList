{"body": "Hi Cramer,\n\n\nThis must be a special cal file that your firm has developed. For any \ncustom cal files that we develop I place them in a separate library \n(separate from the radiance standard lib), this way we know what we have \ndeveloped. If your firm has used a similar model for any custom files \nthen you may just need to find out \"where\" they are on your 3.9 \ninstallation and make sure that RAYPATH is also pointing to your custom \nlibrary location.\n\n\nIt is a bit puzzling that removing the -n 4 switch makes the rtrace run \nwork...\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCramer Silkworth wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006868.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 11, 2010 at 09:50AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006861", "id": "radiance-general_006868"}
