{"body": "Hi Dan,\n\n\nI don't know why you wouldn't use the rtrace -om option, but doing it  \nyour way, you just need the right syntax:\n\n\n\trcalc -e '$1=if($3-2*$1-2*$2,1,0)' test.dat > test_res.dat\n\n\nI chose these factors based on your material that reflects 5x as much  \nblue as red and green.  The above should work for white illumination  \nand assuming you don't have other blue materials in your scene.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006871.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 11, 2010 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006870", "id": "radiance-general_006871"}
