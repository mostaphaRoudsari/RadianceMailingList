{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> I don't know why you wouldn't use the rtrace -om option\n\n\nI'm also eventually testing the direct solar reflectance from my trace point so I felt that the rcalc method would answer both questions.  It would probably have made it more clear if I explained that originally.  Thanks for the quick response, it works like a charm.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nDan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006872.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Fitzpatrick", "created_at": "May 11, 2010 at 02:51PM", "created_by": "Dan_Fitzpatrick", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006870", "id": "radiance-general_006872"}
