{"body": "Greg & All,\n\n\necho $RAYPATH currently yields nothing, so maybe that's the problem (but \nPATH does include usr/local/bin). My problem is, i'm not really a linux \nguy, and googling how to set it returns no fewer than a gazillion \ndifferent places that PATHs are set. Can you tell me where the best \nplace would be, and what exactly the line is (in Ubuntu 9.10)? Sorry, I \nknow it's a newbie question, but there doesn't seem to consensus on the \ninternet (not that there ever really is) on how to do this.\n\n\nBernd, adding the build-dep packages didn't solve the compiling problem. \nIf the setting raypath doesn't fix it, I'm starting with a fresh install \nof the OS with all packages selected. Radiance is the only thing I use \nthis machine for, so it's not really a big deal.\n\n\nThanks,\nCramer\n\n\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth at transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth at transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in \nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006874.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Cramer Silkworth", "created_at": "May 12, 2010 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "Cramer_Silkworth", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006861", "id": "radiance-general_006874"}
