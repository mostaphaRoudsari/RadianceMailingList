Did \nyou (exactly) follow Bernd's instructions, not only adding the packages? \nWhat the procedure he described does is actually building Radiance on \nyour system, but not by simply copying the binaries to /usr/local, but \nby integrating them into your system using the package manager whenever \nit is possible. Just follow his steps one by one.\n\n\nI would strongly advice users to go this way - the generic \n/usr/local-approach leads to a lot of confusion with people ending up \nwith a mess of files in that directory. This makes debugging difficult \nand successful updates become challenging. Nothing to say against it as \nlong as one really keeps track and can do a rm -R /usr/local from time \nto time - but impossible to maintain for a casual user.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006875.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
