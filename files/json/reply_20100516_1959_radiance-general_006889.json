{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI 100% agree, Radiance has always been able to be used for \"dynamic\" \nsimulations, as it has always been scriptable. The fact that over the \nlast few years, several additions have been added in for the convenience \nof people working with weather data does not even touch the core. I know \nthat people like the brand-alike words a lot, but it is misleading here. \nThe fact that Radiance got the name it carries is one of the brilliant \nthings in it - it reflects the fact that it simply models radiant \ntransfers and at the same time already gives the units. This is clear. \n\"Dynamic\" can be anything - sounds great but is not clear. So - why not \nwrite what we are doing - using e.g. Radiance with models based on \nweather-data?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006889.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
