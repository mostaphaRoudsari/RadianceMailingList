{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI may be wrong, but I see two different primary applications. As far as \nI understood, rtcontrib is optimized for operation with weather data. \nEspecially patch-based sky models seam to be a perfect application. The \nphotonmap is currently not all that efficient in these applications. On \nthe other hand, it allows to include a forward-raytracing step without \nmodifications in the scene (well, maybe adding photon-ports to \noptimize). Maybe it is because of I never did it, but modelling a facade \nwith non-planar light shelves sounds scary to me to attempt using \nrtcontrib, while almost trivial using the photon-map. On the other hand, \nI admire the potential of rtcontrib when used with sky patches or a \nbunch of light sources. Maybe it is because there is no such compact \ndocumentation available for using rtcontrib with redirecting structures \nas the photon-map manual. So - from my perspective - it would be perfect \nto have both. Pmap to easily include a very generic forward raytracing \nstep. Rtcontrib as an optimization for those who know what they are doing.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006890.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
