{"body": "Greg and all,\nIt seems that I was running the scene with an Ambient resolution that was\ntoo high. I ran the scene at ar=2056 and had problems with frames dropping\nwith the fisheye cameras and then again with section perspectives (clipping\nplane). I reduced the ar=1028 and all was well. The renderings turned out\nfine and no frames were dropped.\nThanks,\nNick\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006892.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Hubof", "created_at": "May 18, 2010 at 09:24AM", "created_by": "Nick_Hubof", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006883", "id": "radiance-general_006892"}
