{"body": "Hi Nick,\n\n\nI have no idea what was causing this, but Jack de Valpine said offline  \nhe's seen similar issues with rpiece and image sections (pieces) that  \nhave very little going on, like the corners of your image.  It may be  \na race condition that the NFS lock manager isn't handling properly,  \nbut nothing I can really do much about.  I don't know how the ambient  \nresolution would affect this, so it's a puzzle.  It could just be  \ncoincidence.\n\n\nIn related news, I just made an enhancement to the \"rad\" executive  \nprogram to run rpiece automatically when -N is set >1 and only a  \nsingle view is being requested.  It even does automatic recovery if  \nthe rendering gets interrupted.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006893.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 18, 2010 at 10:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006883", "id": "radiance-general_006893"}
