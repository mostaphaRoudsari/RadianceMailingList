{"body": "Hi Christian,\n\n\nI really appreciate your efforts on this.  I took out the redundant  \ndefinition of quit() in raypwin.c -- this should have been removed  \nearlier.  I will check this in along with the other changes needed to  \nthe SCONS system.\n\n\nAs for the timegm() -> time() substitution, are you sure these calls  \nhave the same semantics?  It seems to be a direct conflict with the  \nstandard POSIX call, which returns the current time.  Very different  \nfrom timegm(), which converts calendar times to seconds elapsed since  \nthe epoch.  Can you point me to an online API somewhere?\n\n\nThanks!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-May/001034.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 21, 2010 at 06:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001032", "id": "radiance-dev_001034"}
