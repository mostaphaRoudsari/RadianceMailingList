{"body": "Hi Cramer,\n\n\nIt all depends on the complexity of the spaces.  The corporate HQ project I\nmentioned some time ago looks like it will meet NC 2.2 Platinum\nrequirements.  We've got Tim Metcalf at Kalwall doing the LEED NC2.2\nDaylight modeling as we speak (they keep their glazing properties\nproprietary for the skylights).  It is a ca. 1972 2 story Federalist box\nwhich is redesigned with a lot of curtainwall, two central atria with\nKalwall roof skylights to supplement the perimeter offices with punched\nwindows.  Glazing Factor doesn't work in our case because there are a\nvariety of openings that interact with the interior spaces (and it is\nconservative, no bounce).  Option 3 (measurement) looks like it might work\nbased on some preliminary test I did at the site, but who it is time\nconsuming and problematic near the great Lakes around the equinoxes.  I'll\nlet you know what the modeling tells us.\n\n\nHow's it going?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGary\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, May 25, 2010 at 2:35 PM, Cramer Silkworth\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006909.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Gary Ashford", "created_at": "May 25, 2010 at 12:24PM", "created_by": "Gary_Ashford", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006907", "id": "radiance-general_006909"}
