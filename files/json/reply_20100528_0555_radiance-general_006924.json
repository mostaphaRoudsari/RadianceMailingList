If you copied this command correctly from\nyour source then you need a better source of information.\n\n\n> % echo \"0 0 0 0 0 1\"\u00a0 |\u00a0 rtrace\u00a0 -h\u00a0 -r+\u00a0 -w\u00a0 -ab\u00a0 1\u00a0 sky_uni.oct\n\n\n> May I ask in order to do the same thing what DOS commands I should use do\n> the same thing in the command window of a Windows XP or Vista system when\n> I'm using the Desktop Radiance?\n\n\nYou can create a file \"points.txt\" with \"0 0 0 0 0 1\" in it (ASCII\ntext file, not a Word doc!). These are basically the coordinates of\nthe point you want to test (0,0,0) and the direction in which you\npoint your virtual sensor (0,0,1 = \"up\"). Now use this command on the\nDOS prompt:\n\n\nrtrace -w -h -ab 1 sky_uni.oct < points.txt\n\n\nLater on you will want to test more than just one point. Then you can\njust add a new line for each point to the file and you will get one\nline of output (r,g and b value) for each line/point.\n\n\nPS: If you can install applications on your system then you should\nreplace the Radiance installation from Desktop Radiance with a more\nrecent version. You can download a Windows installer for the 3.9\nversion here:\n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=Downloads&func=prep_hand_out&lid=23\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006924.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 28, 2010 at 05:55AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006923", "id": "radiance-general_006924"}
