{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nThere are some papers out there trying to give algorithms for  \ncalculation of flux through mirror pipes. Two typically unsolved  \nproblems are that they either assume purely diffuse or purely specular  \nreflection, and are difficult to apply to different sky conditions -  \ncloudy, sunny, all the distributions are hard to get in there. It is  \npossible to do simulations in radiance, which may require extensions.  \nHowever modelling a complete system is challenging.\n\n\nBy the way, depending on what you are exactly modelling, glow may be a  \nuseful option. I do not know how large these luminous areas are  \nthough...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006925.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
