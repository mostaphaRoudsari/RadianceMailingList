{"body": "Hi Kevin,\n\n\nThe daylight coefficient method usually puts the sun's energy into 1  \nto 4 sky patches, so the rtcontrib method will work, though it won't  \ngive very accurate shadows.  The total energy should still be correct  \nif you do it right.\n\n\nAnother approach is to create a set of suns at different positions in  \nthe sky corresponding to the expected trajectory throughout the year,  \nand interpolate these results in a separate rtcontrib run.  I have  \ndone it both ways, and the latter technique tends to produce slightly  \nmore accurate shadows.  The -dr option will work properly if you do  \nthis to calculate reflected beam radiation.\n\n\nI regret that I don't have a script to provide,  but my 2005  \npresentation covers this in overview:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop4/cd/website/PDF/Ward_rtcontrib.pdf\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006930.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 01, 2010 at 09:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006929", "id": "radiance-general_006930"}
