{"body": "Hi Terrance,\n\n\nThe trouble is that you are using the -i rendering option as if it  \nwere part of a view.  Very clever, and it works if you don't use the - \nN option of rad, but the mechanism behind the -N option with multiple  \nviews is that the view= variable is written to the stdin of an rpict  \nrunning with the -S and -PP options, which shares memory on a  \nmultiprocessing platform.  In this mode, rpict just ignores any non- \nview options on stdin, which is why it isn't working as expected.\n\n\nThe latest HEAD allows you to run rad with -N on a single view (i.e.,  \n\"-v Plan\" or \"-v Plan-i\" in your case), and it runs rpiece to split  \nthe work.  With your rad input file, you could run two rad processes,  \neach with -N 4, one for each type of image, and get your job done in  \nparallel that way.\n\n\nI usually have a separate rad input file if I'm using the -i option,  \nwhich I attach to the render= variable.  I had never thought of doing  \nit your way.  Reprogramming rad to properly handle non-view options in  \nview= settings would be a bit of work....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006932.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 01, 2010 at 09:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006931", "id": "radiance-general_006932"}
