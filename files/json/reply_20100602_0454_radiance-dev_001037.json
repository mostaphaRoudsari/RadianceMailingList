Try to add a print statement before this line to\nsee the value of RAD_COMPAT (and possibly all the other vars). Once\nyou know which value is not a list you can either search where it get\nset (wrongly) or modify the above line to something like\n\n\nALL = RTSCENE + RTPIC + STD + RTNET + [env.get('RAD_COMPAT',\"\")]\n\n\nor similar.\n\n\n> What I have tried to do:\n> ****\n> If I replace line:\n> opts = Options(OPTFILE, ARGUMENTS) with\n> opts = Variables(OPTFILE, ARGUMENTS)\n> only depreciation warning is removed, and the rest of the error remains.\n\n\nThe error is raised by the Python interpreter in the \"ALL = ...\" line\nabove. Modifying \"opts=\" will have no effect here.\n\n\n> ******\n> For error in line 81, I've tried to replace this path string with list in\n> SConscript(), but the same errors again.\n> ****\n\n\nThe error is not in line 81; it's in line 47. It just get's passed up\nthrough the stack until it reaches the top level function SConscript()\nin line 47 where the Python interpreter complains.\n\n\n> Comment out line 81.
