{"body": "Greg, all:\n\n\nSo what is the protocol for determining the number of patches the sun's energy is distributed across? In Axel Jacob's (excellent) tutorial on rtcontrib three patches are used to represent the sun regardless of whether the Tregenza or the finer Reinhart patch density/distributions are used, but you mention one to four patches being used, Greg.
