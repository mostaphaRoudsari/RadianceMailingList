{"body": "It should work.  Did you try it?  The main requirement is that your  \nmist has a finite extent.  Beware that the sun is a lousy source for  \ncreating visible beams in a uniform fog, as it floods light  \neverywhere.  Similarly, redirected light by mirrors will likely be  \ndrowned out by the scattering of sunlight throughout the participating  \nmedium, unless you have some way to reflect the light from unfoggy  \nregions to foggy regions.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006935.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 02, 2010 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006933", "id": "radiance-general_006935"}
