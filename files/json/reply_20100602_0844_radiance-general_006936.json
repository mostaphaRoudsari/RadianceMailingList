{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nGenskyvec always picks the three closest patches, regardless of the  \nsky resolution.  It would be difficult to use a sky resolution high  \nenough that one patch would be the better choice.  I only mentioned  \nthe 1-4 range because that's what people have done, not as a  \nrecommendation per se.\n\n\nThe important thing is to distribute energy according to which patches  \nare closest, so if the sun really is in the middle of a particular  \npatch, very little energy would be given to neighboring patches.  That  \n\"very little\" should probably be zero in some cases, but I don't think  \nit ever quite is in genskyvec with the weighting function I use.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006936.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 02, 2010 at 08:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006929", "id": "radiance-general_006936"}
