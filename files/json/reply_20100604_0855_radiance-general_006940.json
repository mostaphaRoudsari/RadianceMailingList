{"body": "The short answer is 'no,' the reason being that you only need to turn  \nan object into an \"illum\" if its contribution is significant, which is  \nthe opposite of the reason you would want to turn something into a  \n\"glow.\"  If its influence is local, then treating it as whatever it is  \nin the default calculation (using \"glow\" with an effective distance of  \n0) should work fine in the ambient calculation.  Naturally, there are  \ncases where it doesn't quite.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006940.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 04, 2010 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006939", "id": "radiance-general_006940"}
