{"body": "Hello Brajeshlal(?)\n\n\n> I took 7 Cr2 images of the sky with combination of two different f-stops, to get the range 17 stops.\n> When i assembled them i get blue tint on the final HDR image. What can be the possible reason that i am getting blue color?\n\n\nYou did not give much detail on what you try to do. What are the sky \nconditions - do you have the direct sun on you images? What is Cr2? What \nmeans blue tint - I would not be surprised if the sky has a blueish \ncolor, that is what I observe usually.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-June/000258.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
