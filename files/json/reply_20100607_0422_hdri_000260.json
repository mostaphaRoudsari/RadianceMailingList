{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI was referring the paper\"Direct HDR Capture of the Sun and Sky\" and try to the experiment. Canon Eos 1Ds Mark II with Kodak Wratten ND filter 3.0 is placed in upward direction to capture the sun and sky images. Almost in 50 sec i took 7 raw images ( Canon CR2 format). f4 - 1s, 1/4 and 1/30 and f16 - 1/15, 1/125, 1/1000, 1/8000. Then calculated relative stops between them and used HDRShop 3.0 ( uses directly CR2 format) to assemble it as HDR image.\nThe image was having bit surroundings and clear sky was and have direct sun. \nAfter assembling it i got the entire HDR image with Blue color tint. I was wondering why i am getting that Blue color tint . Is it camera problem or ND filter or assembling software (HDRShop)   or some thing else.\n\n\n\n\n Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-June/000260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brajesh Lal", "created_at": "June 07, 2010 at 04:22AM", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal", "parent_id": "hdri_000000", "id": "hdri_000260"}
