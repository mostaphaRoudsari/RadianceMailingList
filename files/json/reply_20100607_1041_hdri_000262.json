One thing that comes to my mind is that getting a relieable response curve for the camera over the whole luminance range and for all three channels may be challenging. I do not know what you use to derive the response of the sensor from. If it is a typical greyish indoor scene, you probably cannot do it with the filter in place. If you use the real sunny sky for calculating the sensor response, the different channels may perform different for the direct sun. Just a guess though.\n\n\nDid you try other software, and did this result in the same blue tint?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-June/000262.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
