{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nThe process to create a texture from flash/no-flash photography works,  \nbut is fairly involved.  For some time, Mashhuda & I have been working  \non creating a user interface to make the process more straightforward,  \nbut it is still a work-in-progress after 2 years.\n\n\nAll I have at this point is a set of programs and scripts that rely on  \ndcraw and exiftool.  I have compiles for Mac OS X (10.4 and later, PPC \n+Intel), but no easy way to copile on other platforms.  If I provided  \nthese, you would still need some instructions on how to calibrate your  \nflash & lens, and probably a fair amount of hand-holding through the  \nprocess.\n\n\nIn addition to the single flash method described in the Siggraph paper  \nand my talk, there is a 3-flash method that works better, but requires  \nmore hardware.  Here are the relevant papers:\n\n\nWard, Greg, M. Glencross, \"A Case Study Evaluation: Perceptually  \nAccurate Textured Surface Models,\" Sixth Symposium on Applied  \nPerception in Graphics and Visualization (APGV), September 2009.\nGlencross, Mashhuda, G. Ward, C. Jay, J. Liu, F. Melendez, R. Hubbold,  \n\"A Perceptually Validated Model for Surface Depth Hallucination,\" ACM  \nTrans. Graph. (special issue SIGGRAPH 2008), August 2008.\nI'm attaching some text describing the process for the single-flash  \nmethod.  If you're still interested after reading all this, and have a  \nMac you want to try it on, I can provide the programs and scripts to  \nyou in a separate e-mail.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006942.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 08, 2010 at 09:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006941", "id": "radiance-general_006942"}
