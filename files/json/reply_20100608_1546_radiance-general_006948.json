{"body": "Hi Jill,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe IESNA is trying to have a stronger presence in daylighting.\nFor the past 6 years or so they have had a Daylighting Institute along\nwith a Lighting Institute which occurs for 2 days before the exhibit\nhall opens at LightFair.  This includes two days of daylighting specific\npresentations and relates to the \"Daylighting Pavilion\" they now\ndistinguish on the LightFair floor.  From 2004 - 2006ish there was also\na loose daylighting forum at LightFair organized by New Buildings\nInstitute (I believe) where industry representatives got together to\ndiscuss the state of affairs.  Not much came from that and it fizzled.\nThere is also two IESNA committees focused on daylighting - the\ndaylighting committee (chaired by Kostas Papamichael and working on a\nDaylighting RP-5) and the daylight metrics subcommittee (chaired by Lisa\nHeschong and working on a dynamic daylight metric).  This year, as part\nof a Daylighting Plus research project and the metric subcommittee\nefforts, there was a new Daylighting Forum held at the end of LightFair\nfor 2 days.  Many of the who's who in daylighting attended and there\nwere good general discussions about the state of affairs for\ndaylighting, the need for metrics for a variety of code applications,\nand the idea of making it a more regular forum came up - though nothing\nconcrete that I know of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd like to see a daylighting forum continue as part of IESNA's\ndaylighting institute, and I'd like to see it occur in combination with\nthe classes during the LightFair event.  Alternatively, perhaps there\nshould be or already is a strong daylighting component to the CIE\nactivities.  I know there is some activity relative to climate based\ndaylight simulation but am not as familiar with CIE activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nZack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006948.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "June 08, 2010 at 03:46PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006910", "id": "radiance-general_006948"}
