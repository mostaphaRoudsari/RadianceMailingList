{"body": "Just to make sure we're all talking about the same thing, when you say\n\"render these images ... In different sizes\" I assume you mean the image is\nthe same size but the dumbell object is resized. (?)\n\n\nOne way to keep your dumbell assembly to remain constant is to place all the\nobjects (two boxes and the column) into one .rad file, and then scale/array\nthat .rad file with its own xform operation(s). Then all the components will\nmaintain the same spatial relationship.\n\n\nBut I may be totally misunderstanding what you're trying to do (no coffee\nyet).\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 6/9/10 7:51 AM, \"Begum Erten\" <bgm.erten at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006951.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 09, 2010 at 07:24AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006949", "id": "radiance-general_006951"}
