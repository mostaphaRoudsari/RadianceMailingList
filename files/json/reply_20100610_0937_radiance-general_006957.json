{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nMGF requires that identifiers begin with a letter, and they can't  \ncontain spaces.  The rad2mgf program doesn't check to make sure  \nidentifiers are legal in MGF, so this is the problem.  You need to  \nrename material and modifier names that don't begin with a letter, or  \nI need to update rad2mgf to fix identifiers.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006957.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 10, 2010 at 09:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006944", "id": "radiance-general_006957"}
