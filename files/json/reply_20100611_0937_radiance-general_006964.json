{"body": "Thanks, John!\n\n\nBut I think the rad file I used should be OK because it only contains five\nsimple boxes and I can use rvu to generate a rendering for it.\n\n\nJust now I tried to use the table.rad file got from Axel Jacobs' tutorial\nand the objline still doesn't work. Moreover, there's an error message\nshowing in the Terminal:\n\n\n*fatal - cannot open file \"/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/vchars.mta\", mode \"r\"*\n\n\nI sense my Radiance has got big problem. What does this error message mean?\n\n\nShould I reinstall Radiance?\n\n\nWhat are the correct and detailed procedures to install Radiance on Mac OS X\nSnow Leopard?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006964.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang \u5f20\u5180", "created_at": "June 11, 2010 at 09:37AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang_\u5f20\u5180", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006962", "id": "radiance-general_006964"}
