{"body": "Oops. Yeah, I guess step zero is: \"get the developer tools installed on your system\". Sorry about that!\n\n\nThe developer tools (now called XCode) include the compiler and the program \"make\", which you need to compile the source code (and its absence on your system is causing all your error messages there). XCode is a free (but large) download from Apple:\n\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html\n\n\nYou have to create a developer account, but its free and amounts to a login/password. Grab XCode and install it, making sure you install all the X11 dev stuff, then go back to that ray directory and try rerunning ./makeall install and we'll go from there.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006972.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 11, 2010 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006962", "id": "radiance-general_006972"}
