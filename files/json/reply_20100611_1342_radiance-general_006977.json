{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nCould the -I+ option you're giving to rtcontrib be substituted with  \nthe -i+ option?  The former would compute an array of irradiance  \nvalues surrounding your -vp setting, rather than an irradiance image  \nof intersected surfaces.  I wouldn't think the images would look very  \nsimilar in this case.  Did you compare the appearance of rtcontrib -I+  \nversus rpict -i?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006977.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 11, 2010 at 01:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006976", "id": "radiance-general_006977"}
