If you have a dome with a wide-angle \ncamera, transmission is about perpendicular for all directions. If you \nhave a flat glass, it is not. Do you want to a cube-shaped box with five \ncameras?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006985.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
