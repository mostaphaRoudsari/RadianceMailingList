{"body": "Hi Gunter,\n\n\nThe usual reason that the binaries from the src/px directory fail to  \ninstall is because the TIFF library isn't building properly.   \nUnfortunately, there are many reasons why this might happen, and  \ndebugging it is beyond my abilities.  You'll just have to remove  \nra_tiff and normtiff from the PROGS= list in src/px/Rmakefile and  \nrerun \"rmake install\" there.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 16, 2010 at 08:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_004689", "id": "radiance-general_006999"}
