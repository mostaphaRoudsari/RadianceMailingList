{"body": "The default turbidity factor changed in 2006, but it seems Axel must  \nhave been using an older version of gensky.  Neither the new result or  \nthe old result is \"correct\" in the sense that the sky is unreal.   \nAbsolute values never mean much in daylighting calculations unless you  \nhave a measured sky.  This is why we recommend using the -B (-r) and - \nR (-r) options to calibrate gensky output against measurements if you  \ncare about absolute levels.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/007007.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 23, 2010 at 07:35AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007006", "id": "radiance-general_007007"}
