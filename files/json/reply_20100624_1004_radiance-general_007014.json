The questions are\n\n\n- rectangular or round section\n- only specular or specular plus diffuse\n- sunny or overcast / cloudy sky\n\n\nHave a look at the photon map if you need a very general approach.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/007014.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
