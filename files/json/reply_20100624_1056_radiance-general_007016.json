{"body": "Hi Cramer,\n\n\nRadiance should parse materials.rad (only) if you include it into your  \nscene. I guess you are referring to the file materials.rad from the  \ndistribution. If you include it, you should also have the required cal- \nfiles on your syste\n. So just make sure that your RAYPATH is set correctly for your  \ninstallation!\n\n\nBesides that, including default material files can be tricky. Radiance  \ndoes not complain about defining a modifier using the same name  \ntwice... you may end up with unexpected results if some default  \nmaterial definition overwrites what you wanted to use. Just take care!\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
