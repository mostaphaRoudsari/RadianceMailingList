{"body": "Thanks, Pally.\n\n\nI don't know what to do about most of this, as I don't understand the  \nSCONS build system Schorsch developed.  I did remove the outdated  \nlinks to the zip archives from radiance-online.org.  I would have  \nliked to update these, but I don't know where they are supposed to get  \nbuilt or why they are not.\n\n\nRegarding the problems with Radiance4R0.tar.gz, this file does not  \nhave the since-release changes to the HEAD, but the idea always is to  \ndrop the HEAD on top of whatever you have and update it that way, so I  \nsee nothing to do there.  I have copied the 4R0 sources and libraries  \nover to radiance-online, but I'm afraid it's a bit of a mess right  \nnow.  The scripts aren't computing the correct patches, and a number  \nof other things are broken there as no one is maintaining that website  \nat the moment.  (The usual resource allocation issues.)\n\n\nOn your 2nd issue below, I am looking at Sconscript and I see  \nclockface.hex and surf.cal mentioned only once, so maybe this has  \nalready been fixed?  As I said, I don't really understand this build  \nsystem.  If you can be more specific about which lines you had to  \nchange, that would be helpful.\n\n\nI don't know what to say or do about your 3rd issue, as there could be  \nany number of things going wrong, and no way for me to tell from here.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-June/001045.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 29, 2010 at 11:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001039", "id": "radiance-dev_001045"}
