{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nAxel's tutorial is correct, but it is slightly simpler to use the  \ngensky -B option (rather than \"-b\") if you are starting from the  \nhorizontal illuminance.  First, apply the 179 lumens/watt conversion  \nfactor:\n\n\n\t10,000 lumens/m^2 * 1 watt / 179 lumens => 55.87 watts/m^2\n\n\nUsing this in your gensky command:\n\n\n\tgensky 12 4 +12:00 -a 51 -o 0 -m 0 -c -B 55.87\n\n\nYou should get the output below.  (I'm not sure why the tutorial has  \n\"21\" as the month for the first argument -- I'm assuming this is a  \ntypo.)\n\n\n# gensky 12 4 +12:00 -a 51 -o 0 -m 0 -c -B 55.87\n# Local solar time: 12.00\n# Solar altitude and azimuth: 16.8 -0.0\n# Ground ambient level: 17.8\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n2 skybr skybright.cal\n0\n3 2 2.29e+01 3.56e+00\n\n\nThe reported \"Ground ambient level\" is actually the diffuse horizontal  \nillumination in disguise.  If you multiply 17.8 by pi and 179, you  \nshould get what you started with as your horizontal illuminance.  This  \nis one way to check.  Another method is to run rtrace with just the  \nsky and compute the horizontal irradiance using the -I option.\n\n\nI hope this clears things up.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007029.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 01, 2010 at 09:43AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007027", "id": "radiance-general_007029"}
