{"body": "Hi Cramer,\n\n\nYou don't need to \"pregenerate\" the ambient file for rtrace purposes,  \nbut you can.  The disadvantage is that it will take about as long to  \npregenerate the file as it does to run rtrace, though the subsequent  \nrun should go very fast.\n\n\nSharing values via an ambient file with -aa non-zero allows parallel  \nprocessing to actually work in Radiance.  It doesn't require a  \nprecalculation, though.  The only reason to do that is to get slight  \nmore accurate and/or smoother results.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007032.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 02, 2010 at 01:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007018", "id": "radiance-general_007032"}
