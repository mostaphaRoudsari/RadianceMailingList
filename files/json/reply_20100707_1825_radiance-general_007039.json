{"body": "Thank you very much. I am learning the tutorial of Axel Jacobs. It is very\ngood.\n\n\nIn Ubuntu, I built materials,  rad, sky.mat, sky.rad and .vf. files, when I\nuse oconv to compile them, I have to input the command into the terminal\nwindow of Ubuntu to execute the command. Can I just run a script which\ncontains multiple commands such as oconv and rvu?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007039.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 07, 2010 at 06:25PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007037", "id": "radiance-general_007039"}
