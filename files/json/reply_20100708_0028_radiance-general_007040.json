{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nthe typical way to automize the steps required to get an image from  \nyor scene is to write a rif-file and let rad (look at the manpage of  \nrad) determine what has to be done. It is a bit like using make. I  \nwould recommend not to copy one of the complete and complex rif-files  \ncoming with the examples, but to start with a minimal one.\n\n\nThis again is very nicely doable following Axel's tutorial!\n\n\nGood luck, cheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
