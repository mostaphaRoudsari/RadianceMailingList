However, for anything\nmore complex (even as simple as floating point arithmetic) you will need\nother Unix tools like bc, awk and sed which means you will have to\nlearn their command syntax, too.\n\n\nIf you plan on post-processing your results (calculate average, create plots\nor summary reports) then I would recommend Python. It's a powerful\nlanguage but still easy to learn. Once you have worked out how to read\nfiles or how to use the \"subprocess\" module to run Radiance commands\nyou can do everything you could do with BASH.\n\n\nFor both there are good learning resources available on the net and\nthey are a common choice to control Radiance simulations. So you\ncan't really go wrong here.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007048.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 09, 2010 at 01:34AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007046", "id": "radiance-general_007048"}
