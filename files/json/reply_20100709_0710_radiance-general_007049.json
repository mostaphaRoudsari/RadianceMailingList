{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI think that for most types of Radiance automation/scripting, I would \nsuggest the following:\n\n\n    * make - for automating basic repetitive tasks including calls to\n      rad or other radiance programs\n    * perl or python - offer robust programming capabilities. Both are\n      quiet industrial strength, although I have been a perl person for\n      a long time, my impression is that coding in python is perhaps a\n      bit cleaner (shocked gasps from those who know me...)\n\n\nThis being said, a few comments on the following:\n\n\n    * bash/csh - if you end up needing to reference/modify any of the\n      scripts that are included with the Radiance distribution then you\n      will need to get some understanding of these scripting languages\n    * bc/awk/sed - it has been a long time since I have had to deal with\n      any of these, I would suggest that it would be easier to do in\n      perl/python\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Bleicher wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007049.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 09, 2010 at 07:10AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007046", "id": "radiance-general_007049"}
