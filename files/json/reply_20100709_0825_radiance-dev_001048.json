{"body": "Hi Pally,\n\n\nThanks for the additional information.  I can make the changes you  \nsuggest to remove the \"duplicate\" installs, but can you reassure me  \nthat I'm doing the right thing by pointing out WHERE these files are  \nbeing duplicated?  I can find no other mention of them in any of the  \nSConscript builds.\n\n\nAs Thomas pointed out, Windows is not a maintained platform for  \nRadiance at this point, and any changes I make to the SCONS files have  \nassociated risks, since I can't even test them.  Nevertheless, I have  \nchecked in the changes you suggested and added in the one C program  \n(dctimestep) that was missing.  I don't know what to do about the Perl  \nscripts, if anything.  Suggestions are welcome.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-July/001048.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 09, 2010 at 08:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001039", "id": "radiance-dev_001048"}
