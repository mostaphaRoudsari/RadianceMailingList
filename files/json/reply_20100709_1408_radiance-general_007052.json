{"body": "My experiences with Python as a control language are very positive. \nThere's a similar case to be made for all the \"concise\" interpretive \nlanguages: Python, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and so on, which even includes such \ntools as LISP, which is the granddaddy of them all. I like Python \nbecause of the computer science attitudes which underly its design: it \nis readable (at least if one grew up with a European language), \nreliable, and *small*--the manual for the basic language can be read in \nan hour, though the libraries are extensive.\n\n\nRhino 5 is planned to use the .NET implementation of Python as its \nprimary scripting language, though other .NET languages will be \navailable.\n\n\nRandolph Fritz \u2022 RFritz at lbl.gov\nEnvironmental Energy Technologies Division \u2022 Lawrence Berkeley Labs\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007052.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "R Fritz", "created_at": "July 09, 2010 at 02:08PM", "created_by": "R_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007046", "id": "radiance-general_007052"}
