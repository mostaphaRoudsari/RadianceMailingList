{"body": "Thank you. That makes it clear that something is possible. But what? As \nof version 3.5, Mental Ray (the base of iray) had some serious \nlimitations in physically based rendering. In Labayrade and \nFontoynont's 2009 CIE 171:2006 testing, it could not, for instance, \nsimulate a clear sky. Iray is based on Mental Ray 3.8, and it is \npossible that some of those problems have been resolved since version \n3.5, but there does not seem to have been any testing published that \nsays so. Mental Image's iray site doesn't mention CIE 171. The \nLuxrender site doesn't mention any testing at all. Are you aware of any \ntesting that shows accuracy of either of these tools in the physical \nsimulation of light?\n\n\nGreg, have you looked at this at all?\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nRef: Labayrade, Raphael, and Marc Fontoynont. \u201cUse of CIE 171:2006 Test \nCases to Assess the Scope of Lighting Simulation Programs.\u201d CIE Light \nand Lighting 2009, n.d.
