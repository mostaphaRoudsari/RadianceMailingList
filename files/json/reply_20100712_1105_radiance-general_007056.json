{"body": "I'm not aware of any physical simulation of light software using gpu, \nbut probably it would be interesting to externalize ray-geometry \nintersections in radiance. I think there is already gpu code(as \nlibraries or open source) that makes that intersections. Radiance \ninstances, meshes, memory management ... would be some issues to solve, \nmaybe waiting a bit the ray-geometry intersections will be normalized in \ngpus and it will be easier to send rays and geometry from radiance to \nthe cards\n\n\nEl 12/07/2010 19:05, R Fritz escribi\u00f3:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007056.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Munarriz", "created_at": "July 12, 2010 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Munarriz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007053", "id": "radiance-general_007056"}
