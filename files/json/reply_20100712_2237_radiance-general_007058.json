{"body": "Hello:\n\n\nI  made a simplified python code as bellow.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\nfileHandle = open ('final.txt', 'w')\nfileHandle.write ('%s %s %s \\n' % (12,25,89))\nfileHandle.close()\n\n\n# valueIll = open ('final.txt', 'a')\ncreBlinds = subprocess.Popen(\"genblinds %s %s %d %d %d %d %d \\\n          | xform -rz -90 -t 2 2 2 >> final.txt \" % ('white', 'VBlinds', \\\n          0.03, 2, 3, 15, 30), shell=True)\nfileHandle .close()\n\n\nfileHandle = open ('final.txt', 'a')\nfileHandle.write ('%s %s %s \\n' % (52,86,506))\nfileHandle.close()\n\n\nWhat I expect is the text generated by \"Gneblinds\" are located between '12\n25 89\" and \"52 86 506\". But I find the text in the second line is (52 86\n506) and the following text is generated by \"genblinds\". Could someone give\nme some advice  to fix this problem?\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007058.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 12, 2010 at 10:37PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007046", "id": "radiance-general_007058"}
