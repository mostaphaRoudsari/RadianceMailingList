{"body": "From Rendering With Radiance there are a few tables describing how the rad command calculates the various ambient settings. The \u2013ar setting is determined by a formula a*d. The value of \u2018a\u2019 ranges from 8 for low accuracy to 64 for high accuracy. The value of \u2018d\u2019 is largest scene dimension divided by dimension of zone of interest.\n\n\nSo for example trying to get high accuracy for a model that\u2019s 50x50x50m and looking for detailed results in a 5x5x5m room:\n\n\na * d = ar setting\n64 * (50/5) = 640\n\n\nThat should give you a starting point, and if you still see too much variation between calculation you can try setting parameters even more rigorously.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "July 13, 2010 at 07:38AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007057", "id": "radiance-general_007064"}
