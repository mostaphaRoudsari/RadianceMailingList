I\nthink it starts a new process for each new input line.

Imagine\nyou have a grid of 1000 points and you set \"-x\" to 50 then your output\nwould be printed to the screen (or a file) in 20 chunks of 50 values.\n\n\nI once set \"-x\" to 1 to have each new point printed and save to my\noutput file as soon as it was calculated (mostly to get feedback on\nthe calculation progress). However, that seemed to increase my\nrendering time so I dumped that very quickly and reverted to feeding\nsmaller chucks of coordinates to rtrace instead.\n\n\nI have to speculate about the connection between \"-x\" and \"-n\" here\nbut i think that if you allow more processes (-n) than points in a\nscan line (-x) then rtrace simply can't start enough processes. This\nwould mean that each point creates it's own process.
