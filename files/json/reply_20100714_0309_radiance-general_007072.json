However this is one of the core use cases for \nthe pmap extension. The pmap approach would be by doing an accurate \ngeometrical description and have mkpmap do the forward tracing. As far \nas I understand you are interested in the angular-dependent reflectance \nof the prism sheet in you case, so maybe using a good fit to measurement \ndata would also be an option (in that case with \"classic\" Radiance).\n\n\n> he put some questions related to Fresnel diffusers simulation.

I have modeled light ducts with prism sheets, and got \nsome result, but as I said I have not been able to validate it yet \nagainst measured data. In my opinion doing such comparisions is the \ncritical task...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007072.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
