However according to what you wrote \nearlier I would rethink the idea to take only one reading. You mentioned \nhaving blinds. If the sensor is hit by the sun, it will give readings \nseveral magnitudes higher then a sensor just some centimeters aside, as \nblinds would typically cast very distinct shadows. You would not find \nthis in you single reading. To detect such cases, it may be useful to \nhave a grid of sensors instead and, beside the illuminance, monitor also \nthe deviation of all the sensors at the same sky condition as an \nindicator of how representive you sensor reading is.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007074.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
