{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nrad understands some special variables named after the command they  \naffect to pass such options. There used to be a render= setting in the  \nrif-file, but now you should be able to pass all rpict options by a  \nline such as rpict=-ab 2 -ad 512 -lw 0.002 and so on. Please check the  \nmanpage for rad again.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
