{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nHow did you create your geometry? What kinds of changes are you trying \nto make? Depending on the extend of the changes, updates or \nmodifications it probably makes much more sense to use a 3D modeling \napplication to make these changes and then re-export the geometry to \nRadiance.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJia Hu wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 15, 2010 at 01:07PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007084", "id": "radiance-general_007085"}
