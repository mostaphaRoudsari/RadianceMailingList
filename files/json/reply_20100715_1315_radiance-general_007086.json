{"body": "Hello Jack:\n\n\nI create the majority part of the geometry in Revit and then export the\ngeometry to Radiance. In Radiance, I will add some other geometries (not\ncomplicated), such as lighting, blinds , simple furniture and windows.\nAnother reason I want to know the coordinates is that when I adjust\nsome view parameters such as the view point I also need to know the\ncoordinate.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007086.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 15, 2010 at 01:15PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007084", "id": "radiance-general_007086"}
