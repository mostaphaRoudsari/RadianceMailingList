{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nI have never used Revit, but if it really does not show the model vertex \ncoordinates or if it changes them during export, you should still find \nout by wrapping you scene into a cube that you can use as a reference \ncoordinate system. Create a simple cube of e.g. 100m x 100m x 100m so \nthat all you model is inside, and find the reference point of you model \n(usually you will have some reference point that is known and used for \nthe plans). Get the coordinates of the reference point relative to the \ncorners of the cube. Then import the scene into Radiance and get the \nbounding cube of the scene (getbbox yourmodel.rad). This should give you \nthe coordinates of the cube after import into Radiance, at least unless \nRevit rotated or scaled the model during export. From these you can find \nthe reference point's coordinates in the Radiance scene. Still, really \nstrange if there is no simple way to keep the coordinates from Revit and \nread them out from the CAD...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
