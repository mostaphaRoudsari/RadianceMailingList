For all objects that you wish to \nadd later, create a triangle and export it, too. Then use replmarks to \nreplace all triangle markers with your additional geometry, such as \nblinds. No need to know extract exact co-ordiantes with rvu.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007089.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 15, 2010 at 02:08PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007084", "id": "radiance-general_007089"}
