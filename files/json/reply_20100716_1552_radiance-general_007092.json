{"body": "Hi Randolph:\n\n\nI do not know what data you have and your reseasrch aim and thus will talk\nabout what I know about this issue. I am sure others have better ideas.\nGenerally, if you have direct and diffuse irradiation data (you can get real\ntime data from your local weather station, check DOE EnergyPlus program),\nyou can try Perez model (gendaylit program in Radiance) which determines the\nsky type according to the irradation value (see Perez's paper in 1990).\n\n\nIf you use gensky, you have to specify the sky type. On the other hand, you\ncan also try gensky to find a best sky model fitting your measured data.\nWhen using gensky, it would be better to use measured illuminance values\nrather than measure irradiation value. I remember someone mentioned that the\nirradiation data required by gensky is only visible range (I saw a post\ntalking about this)?\n\n\nCheers,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007092.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 16, 2010 at 03:52PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007091", "id": "radiance-general_007092"}
