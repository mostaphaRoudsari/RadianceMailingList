{"body": "I assume you meant to compare \"-aa\" and \"-ar\" in your first sentence.   \nThese are not two variables that affect the same behavior -- not much  \npoint in that.  Rather, think of the -ar setting as determining a  \nscene resolution below which the accuracy of the indirect calculation  \n(as determined by the -aa parameter) will start to relax.  If you  \ndivide your global scene size (the fourth value reported by \"getinfo - \nd octree\") by the -ar setting, you will get the scene size below which  \nthe indirect calculation will begin to lose accuracy.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007098.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 18, 2010 at 11:31PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007094", "id": "radiance-general_007098"}
