{"body": "Hello:\n\n\nIf I set -x to 0, and -y to 1, does that mean the program will not exit\nuntil it finishes all calculations for all points?\nIf I set -x to 5 and -y to 1, does that mean the program will exit after the\ncalculation for five points (only one line) is finished? In this case, I\nhave to run this program again to continue the calculation for the left\npoints?\n\n\nGenerally, if I set -x to 0 and want the program finishes all calculation at\none time, do I need to set -y?\n\n\nThanks,\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007104.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 19, 2010 at 11:14AM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000060", "id": "radiance-general_007104"}
