{"body": "> If I set -x\u00a0to 0, and -y to 1, does that mean the\u00a0program will not exit\n> until it finishes all calculations for all points?\n\n\nJust try it: use a small octree and a file with point and direction input and do\n\n\nrtrace -w -ab 1 -x 0 -y 1 scene.oct < input.pts\nrtrace -w -ab 1 -x 0 -y 1 scene.oct < input.pts\nrtrace -w -ab 1 -x 5 -y 1 scene.oct < input.pts\n\n\nThe first line is the default for rtrace (-x an -y 0).\n\n\n> If I set -x to 5 and -y to 1, does that mean the program will exit after the\n> calculation\u00a0for five points (only one line)\u00a0is finished?

The default for rtrace is to\ncalculate all the lines in the input file. But if you have a file with\n1000 points you will not see the results before the last of these\npoints has been calculated. Therefore you may want to split your input\nin smaller files of say 100 lines each or set \"-x\" to 100. Then rtrace\nwill write out the results for every group of 100 lines. Don't set\n\"-x\" too low, however, or you will notice a slow down of the\ncalculation.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007106.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 20, 2010 at 02:31AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000060", "id": "radiance-general_007106"}
