{"body": "There is a special case for \"glow\" sources to take care of this.   \nQuoting from the Radiance reference manual <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Materials \n >:\n\n\nGlow\nGlow is used for surfaces that are self-luminous, but limited in their  \neffect. In addition to the radiance value, a maximum radius for shadow  \ntesting is given:\n         mod glow id\n         0\n         0\n         4 red green blue maxrad\nIf maxrad is zero, then the surface will never be tested for shadow,  \nalthough it may participate in an interreflection calculation. If  \nmaxrad is negative, then the surface will never contribute to scene  \nillumination. Glow sources will never illuminate objects on the other  \nside of an illum surface. This provides a convenient way to illuminate  \nlocal light fixture geometry without overlighting nearby objects.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007111.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 20, 2010 at 11:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007109", "id": "radiance-general_007111"}
