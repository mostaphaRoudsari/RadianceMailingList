{"body": "Hello Greg:\n\n\nThank you. I also find a similar thread you replied:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000963.html\n\n\nI shall change the luminaires material type to \"glow\" (with maxrad = 0). In\nthis case, the shadow rays will only be sent to illum rectangle and not be\nsent to the luminaire (inside illum rectangle). This case is just similar\nwith the window (as sky is \"glow\" type).\n\n\nCheers,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007112.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 20, 2010 at 01:58PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007109", "id": "radiance-general_007112"}
