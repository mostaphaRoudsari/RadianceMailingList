{"body": "Hello:\n\n\nIf I set maxrad in the \"glow\" type of luminaires to a positive value, say,\nthe diagonal of the luminaire dimension. The shadow testing will happen if\nthe distance between the luminaire and the point is less than maxrad, right?\nIf the illum rectangles encloses the luminaire, is  there shadow testing if\nthe distance of the point from luminaire is still less than maxrad (and the\npoint is outside of the illum rectangle) ?\n\n\nCheers,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007113.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 20, 2010 at 04:28PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007109", "id": "radiance-general_007113"}
