The light that is emitted from\nthe luminaire is already accounted for in the illum material\ndefinition which is created from an IES file. Therefore you do not\nwant your glow to contribute to the illumination of the scene and\nmkillum 'hides' it's light contribution.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007116.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 21, 2010 at 01:57AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007109", "id": "radiance-general_007116"}
