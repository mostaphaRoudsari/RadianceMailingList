{"body": "Thanks, I am more or less understand what you said. I also made some\nexperiment and discover:\n\n\n(1) the maximum \"influence radius\" is not equal to sceneSize/ar but\ninfluenced by aa and ar.\n(2) the minimum \"influence radius\" is equal to sceneSize * aa /ar and it\nhappens in the complex geometry, e.g, corner.\n(3) If a sample ray falls within the \"influence radius\", it will get ambient\nvalue by interpolation of cached ambient value.\n\n\nBy the way, I can not search such terms as \"-ar\" or \"ar\" in the mailing list\narchives because the system warns it is not a valid word.\n\n\nThanks for patience.\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007117.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 21, 2010 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007094", "id": "radiance-general_007117"}
