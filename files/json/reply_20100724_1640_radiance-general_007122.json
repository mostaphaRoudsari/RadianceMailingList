{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nare there any news on that? Would be great to have the book available again! If\nissues with printers are a problem (issues != legal stuff) I'm willing to help.\nThere are various places which sell PDF documentation and printed books about\nopen source software and I'm sure they would be willing to help. Unfortunately I\nknow nothing about what to do with/against booksurge - as it seems they're owned\nby amazon now: http://www.booksurge.com/ and you should be able to transition\nyour books over to amazon/createspace:\nhttps://www.createspace.com/Special/L/TransitionGuide.jsp?ref=459373&utm_id=4985\n\n\nMaybe that helps.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\nOn 03/07/2010 06:40 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007122.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "July 24, 2010 at 04:40PM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006616", "id": "radiance-general_007122"}
