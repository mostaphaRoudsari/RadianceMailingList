Because it's only the direct component that matters here it is\nrelated to the portion of sky visible from this point. It's also based\non the CIE overcast sky so it matters which part of the sky you can\nsee. Is that the same concept as your \"Facade Sky View Factor\"?\n\n\n> By Vertical Daylight Factor we mean the ratio of the illuminance level of a\n> point on vertical building facade (i.e. the vector of the sensor of that\n> point is perpendicular to the facade surface) to the illuminance level of a\n> point on horizontal plane under standard CIE overcast sky (please correct me\n> if the definition is wrong).\n\n\nDoes that include the reflected part?\n\n\n> Via Radiance, is there a way to split the illuminance level of a point on\n> vertical surface into 1) the light coming directly from the sky dome and 2)\n> the light reflected by surrounding building surfaces and ground plane?\n\n\nFor the direct part simply use \"-I -ab 1\" in your rtrace command (or\n\"-i -ab 1\" if you want to calculate pictures):\n\n\necho \"0 0 2 0 1 0\" | rtrace -w -h -ab 1 -I scene.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)*179' > facade_direct.lux\n\n\nThen calculate the total of direct and reflected component by\nincreasing \"-ab\" to an appropriate value:\n\n\necho \"0 0 2 0 1 0\" | rtrace -w -h -ab 4 -I scene.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)*179' > facade_total.lux\n\n\nThe reflected light is the difference between total and and direct\ncomponent. You can also render images and subtract the images from\neach other. See the 'pcomb' command for details.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007124.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 26, 2010 at 01:32AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007123", "id": "radiance-general_007124"}
