{"body": "Note that setting -ab 1 may not count sky component diffusely transmitted through trans materials, as that's considered another bounce. Maybe this is fine, depending on interpretation of your intention - \"direct contribution of the sky to a point on a vertical plane.\"\n\n\nIf you need to set -ab 2 or higher to count diffuse transmission in this first part, you could set all your non transmitting materials to zero reflectance, or the ambient include/exclude options may serve the purpose, see -ae, -ai, -aE, and -aI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007126.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "July 26, 2010 at 06:46AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007123", "id": "radiance-general_007126"}
