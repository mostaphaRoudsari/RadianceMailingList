{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI believe I had a script or .cal file or something at one time to  \ncompute the specularity from separate \"specular included\" and  \n\"specular excluded\" measurements, but I can't find it.  The  \ncalculation is pretty simple, though.  Just subtract the \"excluded\"  \nfrom the \"included\" Y values and divide by the the \"included\" Y  \nmeasurement to get the specular percentage for a metallic material  \nwith colored highlights.  For a plastic material, the specular  \nfraction is the \"included\" minus the \"excluded\" Y over 100 (assuming a  \n0-100% scale for Y).\n\n\nThe material color is the \"included\" Yxy converted to RGB for metal,  \nand the \"excluded\" Yxy converted to RGB for plastic.  The conversions  \nare given in ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal.  You can quickly spit out  \nthe matrix coefficients for this conversion using:\n\n\n\trcalc -n -f xyz_rgb.cal -o cmat.fmt\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007128.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 26, 2010 at 01:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007127", "id": "radiance-general_007128"}
