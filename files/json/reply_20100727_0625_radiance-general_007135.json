{"body": "Ji,\n\n\nPython is quotes-agnostic, so long as you start and end with the same type,\nit doesn't matter what's in between. In other words, you can use\ndouble_quote='\"' to store the \" character, or single_quote=\"'\" to store the\n' character. To save the string \"', you'd have to do something like\nboth_quotes='\"'+\"'\". Triple quotes are for multiline strings (and comments).\n\n\nAdditionally, I think you'd need a pipe, which might not be Windows\nfriendly, or an intermediate file.\n\n\nYour command would be:\n\n\n\n\n#! /bin/python\n\n\nimport os\n\n\n#with pipe\nrtrace_command1 = 'rtrace -I -ab 1 -h -w -oov -u- scene.oct < sensor.pts | '\n+\\\n                  'rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)\" > result.dat'\n\n\n#with intermediate file\nrtrace_command2a = 'rtrace -I -ab 1 -h -w -oov -u- scene.oct < sensor.pts >\ntmp.file'\nrtrace_command2b = 'rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)\" < tmp.file >\nresult.dat'\n\n\n\n\n#should be equivalent:\nos.system(rtrace_command1)\n\n\nos.system(rtrace_command2a)\nos.system(rtrace_command2b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007135.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Smith", "created_at": "July 27, 2010 at 06:25AM", "created_by": "David_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007130", "id": "radiance-general_007135"}
