{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nfirst I would recommend Paul Bourke's website. He has documented a lot \nof his work on fisheye projections, though mostly on domes:\n\n\nhttp://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/miscellaneous/domefisheye/\n\n\nIf you want to work on flat surfaces, you would probably need some \ncubical mapping.
