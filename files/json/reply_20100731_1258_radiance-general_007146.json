{"body": "Hi Chew Wei,\n\n\nthe difference is that there is no reasonable way to define the dome  \nusing light. Light is perfect for small intense sources. At every ray  \nintersection, Radiance can efficiently test for light sources by  \nsending a Ray to the source. This is more efficient then sending rays  \nto random directions trying to find a source, which is the mechanism  \nto treat a glow source. However, in the case of a sky dome, you would  \nhave to subdivide the source a lot or, if you have defined e.g.  \npatches as light sources, you need to test a lot of these patches. For  \nthe typically rather smooth gradient of sky luminance this does not  \nmake sense in most cases compared to having a continous glow source  \nwith a gradient applied.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
