{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nit should be the same, but of course development continued after 3.7  \nand maybe some fixed bug or other change in the code led to different  \nresults. My first guess however would be a change in the default  \nparameters. That would mean that you may be running rtrace with  \ndifferent settings without even knowing it. Please do a quick check by  \nrunning \"rtrace -defaults\" on both platforms and check for differences  \nin the output.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
