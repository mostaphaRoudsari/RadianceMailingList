Radiance has its own\nsupport for OBJ files (via obj2rad or obj2mesh) so if you can convert\nyour CAD geometry to obj that might be a way for you.\n\n\nYou also can use SketchUp to load DWG files. If you don't have the Pro\nversion of SU you need to download a separately available plugin for\nDWG/DXF support. Then you can use my own script to export to Radiance\nformat or directly to Daysim:\n\n\nhttp://su2rad.googlecode.com/files/su2rad_daysim_r03.zip\n\n\nAnd finally, if you have Rhino available there is a new tool for Rhino\nthat provides (among others) Daysim support:\n\n\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html\ndownload: http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Aug 5, 2010 at 10:32 AM, Hind Dirani <hdirani at eegroup.info> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007156.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 05, 2010 at 03:10AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007155", "id": "radiance-general_007156"}
