Compared to\nall the other 3D apps out there it is easy and intuitive to use. The\nmodels for DAYSIM will not be too complex either so should be able to\ndo all your modeling in SketchUp.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007158.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "August 05, 2010 at 04:01AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007155", "id": "radiance-general_007158"}
