{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nThanks for your swift reply ... sorry I couldn't reply yesterday.\n\n\nYou're right, the \"-dv\" option does not disable direct view of glow materials. The far clip plane tip is great, though. Thanks.\n\n\nYou understood my question perfectly. Yes, I wish to use the image as an HDR light source. Your idea of carving the process into separate steps is viable, but messy and cannot really be automated.\n\n\nI think I'm gonna go with the excellent idea of computing the irradiance on a per-pixel basis ... I have looked at your stencil \"tutorial\" and think I can re-create something that would suit my purpose. Allow me to return to you if I run into severe problems, though :-)\n\n\nBest\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "August 05, 2010 at 05:44AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007152", "id": "radiance-general_007159"}
