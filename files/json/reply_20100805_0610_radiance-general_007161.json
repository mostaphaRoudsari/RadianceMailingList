{"body": "I think Lars is saying you can calculate irradiance based only on the radiance values of your back-projected image, without any ray-tracing. Important to note that this - and most of this discussion - assumes your back-projected image is captured in a calibrated way such as what Photosphere/hdrgen can do (there's a separate forum for HDR images if you're unsure).\n\n\nRadiance = Irradiance * Reflectance / Pi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Just an idea... if you assume all materials to be lambertian, you just need the reflectance of any visible surface to be able to calculate the irradiance it receives...?\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007161.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 05, 2010 at 06:10AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007152", "id": "radiance-general_007161"}
