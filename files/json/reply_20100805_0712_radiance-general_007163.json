{"body": "One other hint... for anyone who is entering the world of building \nmodels, I can recommend formZ. It combines CAD and modelling features \nand supports a broad range of 2d and 3d formats. We have used it with \nsuccess to create models for Radiance via dxf (and then Schorsch's \ndxf2rad) and obj, and I have also verified that you could even use \nbrlcad as a converter to keep all CAD data in IGES and convert \niges-obj-Radiance (that would mean a neutral CAD standard linked to \nRadiance).\n\n\nHowever the most important is to learn modeling for simulation is \ndifferent from producing architectural drawings. And... I usually use a \ntext editor for that reason, no CAD.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007163.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
