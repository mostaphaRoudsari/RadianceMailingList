{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> Radiance = Irradiance * Reflectance / Pi\n\n\nThat was the idea, yes, assuming that the ultimate goal is to get \nirradiance.\n\n\nAs Christopher mentioned, using some raw exposure will probably not \nallow you to get any approximation of pixel Radiance. You can try \nmultiple exposures to widen the dynamic range, but in any case you need \ncalibration. I would recommend spending some time with an integrating \nsphere to calibrate the response and to validate the results over the \ndynamic range you expect to cover.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007164.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
