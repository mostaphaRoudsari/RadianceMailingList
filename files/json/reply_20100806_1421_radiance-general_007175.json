{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI would agree with Christopher on Rhino and Sketchup. Blender does \nexport obj also and does seem to be a robust application, although my \nmain experience with it has been testing it to process obj geometry.\n\n\nI think the challenge is figuring out a suitable workflow for those who \nneed to use Autocad for whatever reason.... However the traditional \noptions (TORAD and RADOUT) are pretty ancient at this point and have the \nfollowing problems:\n\n\n    * TORAD - if I recall correctly this still only deals with surface\n      geometry which is fine if you know how to model this way...\n    * RADOUT - same issue as TORAD with respect to geometry and the last\n      version of Autocad that it could run in was Autocad 2000\n\n\nFor me I think that the most suitable intermediate geometry format is \nOBJ. It is open and there are lots of applications that can read and \nwrite the format. The challenge is figuring out how to get from Autocad \nto OBJ.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Rush wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007175.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "August 06, 2010 at 02:21PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007155", "id": "radiance-general_007175"}
