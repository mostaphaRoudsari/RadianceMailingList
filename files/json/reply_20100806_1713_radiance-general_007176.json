{"body": "Hello:\n\n\nCurrently, I mainly use Revit and Rhino to convert fbx to obj, following\nJack's advice. It works well. If you stick to AutoCAD, besides using torad\nor dxf2rad or radout, you may also consider the following approaches.\n\n\n     (1) export dxf/dwg from AutoCAD\n     (2) import dxf to Ecotect (free of charge for student version) OR\nimport dwg to REVIT (free of charge for student version)\n     (3) export rad from Ecotect OR export fbx from Revit.\n        (3.1) if you get fbx file, you should use FBX converter provided by\nautodesk (free) to get an older obj file and then use Rhino or others (not\nsure) to rebuild surface normal because there is likely someting wrong with\nthe obj file directly exported by revit.\n        (3.2) if you export rad directly from Ecotect, you should assign\nmaterials in Ecotect to get .mat file.\n\n\nCheers,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007176.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "August 06, 2010 at 05:13PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007155", "id": "radiance-general_007176"}
