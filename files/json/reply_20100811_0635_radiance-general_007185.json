{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nJust as an aside here. Note that if you do this (ie add an additional \ngensky call) it will also generate a skyfunc. This could be a problem \ndepending on which order the gensky calls are made.... For example:\n\n\n   1. gensky with actual sun position\n   2. gensky with \"reflected\" sun position\n\n\nThe second skyfunc for the second gensky is the one that would get \napplied to the \"sky.\"\n\n\nRegarding, the original question, I tend to agree with Thomas that the \nthing to do would be to actually model some simple surfaces to \napproximate the surrounding conditions.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars Grobe wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007185.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "August 11, 2010 at 06:35AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007182", "id": "radiance-general_007185"}
