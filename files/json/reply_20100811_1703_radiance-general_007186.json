{"body": "Hi Thomas, Lars and Jack\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your answers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aim is to determine what performance the blinds need for protection.\nSo I identified a few critical cases, one includes reflection from\nsurrounding buildings towards the west. These have very reflective\nfacades, which means that they get some glare on this side during the\nmornings. Since it is a rather simple model and because I lack detailed\ngeometry data of the surroundings, I thought adding a sun in the view\nfor the as a reflection is a bit quicker than placing a mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, thanks again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings from Melbourne\n\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Begert\n\n\nAssociate\n\n\nsbe \n\n\nsustainable built environments \n\n\nInnovative ideas, collaborative design, practical solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007186.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Begert", "created_at": "August 11, 2010 at 05:03PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Begert", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007182", "id": "radiance-general_007186"}
