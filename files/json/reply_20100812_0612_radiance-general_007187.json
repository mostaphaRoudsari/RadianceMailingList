{"body": "Another comment is that adding a sun instead of a mirror assumes an infinitely large reflective facade. Depending on the angle of the sun and maximum height of surrounding buildings there may be times that the sun doesn't actually reflect onto your area of interest. Or there may be situations where your building shadows the reflective fa\u00e7ade and reduces the reflection.\n\n\nAlso, the adjacent building would block some portion of the sky contribution to your site - but with the sun definition it adds the reflection without blocking any sky.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007187.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 12, 2010 at 06:12AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007182", "id": "radiance-general_007187"}
