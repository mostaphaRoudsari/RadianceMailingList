{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nI suppose this belongs in a FAQ.  If you read the fine print on the -i option, you'll see that it differs in an important way from -I.  In the -i case, rays are traced to surfaces, where irradiance is then computed.  Using -I, rtrace computes irradiance from input interpreted as measurement points and orientations.  Thus, you don't need to have actual surfaces where you measure using -I.\n\n\nIn short, your two calculations are measuring different values, probably at different positions in the scene as well as in different directions.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007193.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 16, 2010 at 12:12AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007192", "id": "radiance-general_007193"}
