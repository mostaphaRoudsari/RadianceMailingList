{"body": "Thanks Greg, Casper!\n\n\nReally excited seeing cd/m2 values coming from an .jpg image.\nI'm interested in finding out what the value of my backlight is (600 cd/m2 photosphere tells me).\nDoes that seem reasonable? Isn't that perhaps a little low of 4* 18 watt tube lights ( they're old\u2026 )?\nI just read in the HDRI book that your hdr viewer has 5000 cd/m2? Pretty impressive..\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007197.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "jelle feringa", "created_at": "August 18, 2010 at 07:44AM", "created_by": "jelle_feringa", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_007197"}
