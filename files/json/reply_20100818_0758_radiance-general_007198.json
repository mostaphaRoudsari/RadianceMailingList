{"body": "Could be reasonable. In a diffuse transmission situation I think it should be Luminance (cd/m2) = Back Face Incident Flux (lm/m2) * Diffuse Transmission (%) / Pi...   if your 18W CFL have degraded to 1000 lumens each then 4 * 1000 / 1 m2 * 50% / Pi = 636 cd/m2. Maybe your light box is smaller than 1 m2 but the diffusing surface is probably less than 50% transmission.\n\n\nIdeally you should try to find a luminance meter you can use to verify your camera calibration in photosphere.\n\n\n > I'm interested in finding out what the value of my backlight is (600 cd/m2 photosphere tells me<http://jelleferinga.com/files/P1040667.jpg>).\n> Does that seem reasonable? Isn't that perhaps a little low of 4* 18 watt tube lights ( they're old... )?\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007198.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 18, 2010 at 07:58AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_007198"}
