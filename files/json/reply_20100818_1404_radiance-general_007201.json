One thing to keep in mind is that a camera exposure \ncalculation may use different spectral weights than a luminance meter.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007201.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
