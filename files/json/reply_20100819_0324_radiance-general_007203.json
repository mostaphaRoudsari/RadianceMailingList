I tend to insert a \nprint-command right in front of the command call to see whether all \nvariable names and such get resolved as expected. In my experience, \nquoting and typos are the worst origins of errors in interpreted scripts \n(and the reason people like compiled languages doing much more checks).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007203.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
