{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe test in \"sourcehit()\" in src/rt/source.c works with the following priority for overlapping sources:\n\n\n1) Distant source modified by \"light\" or \"illum\" with an alternate material type.\n\n\n2) Distant source modified by \"illum\" with no alternate material type.\n\n\n3) Distant source modified by \"glow\" type.\n\n\nIf there are two or more sources, the first one found (in scene file order) is used.\n\n\nHope this clears things up!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007210.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 22, 2010 at 03:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007209", "id": "radiance-general_007210"}
