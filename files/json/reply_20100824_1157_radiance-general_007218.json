Hm, of course we have the \nchoice between various sky models and related generators, Mark's work \nbeing the latest addition. What is it that you are missing? Cloud \npatterns? Spectral distribution? Or the uber-gensky creating a \ndistribution from a simulation of athmosphere, sources etc itself so \nthat we could finally do light simulations on Mars' trabants?\n\n\n> We might be dangerous, if we had the funding...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007218.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
