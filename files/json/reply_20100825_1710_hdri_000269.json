{"body": "I have a very detailed tutorial for removing yourself from a mirror ball shot in my book: www.hdri-handbook.com . Basically, you would shoot it from 2 angles (90 deg apart) or better 3 angles (120 deg apart), crop and unwrap each, layer them in Photoshop, use the Filter - Offset to align them all, and then rub through to remove the bad spots.\n\n\nNot shooting mirror balls anymore. Fullframe fisheye lenses give better quality and enable me to shoot faster on set. (also shown in tutorials in the book.)\n\n\nBest,\nBlochi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-August/000269.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Bloch", "created_at": "August 25, 2010 at 05:10PM", "created_by": "Christian_Bloch", "parent_id": "hdri_000266", "id": "hdri_000269"}
