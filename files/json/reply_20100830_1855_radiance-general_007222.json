{"body": "Computing seven bounces (-ab 7) is very expensive, even for a small number of points.  You end up filling the indirect irradiance cache, which takes some time even on 4 processors.  I would recommend either reducing the number of bounces, or taking advantage of a path tracing approach like so:\n\n\n\trtrace -w -h -I -ab 7 -n 4  -ad 2048 -as 0 -aa 0 -lw 1e-5 -lr -10 -u+ office.oct < points.inp\n\n\nSetting -aa 0 and -lw 1e-4 limits the number of paths to roughly 100,000 per point, which should run pretty quickly while maintaining accuracy.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007222.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 30, 2010 at 06:55PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007221", "id": "radiance-general_007222"}
