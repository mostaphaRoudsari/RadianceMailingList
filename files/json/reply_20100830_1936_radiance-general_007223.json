{"body": "Hello Greg:\n\n\nBecause there are blinds in the office and the rays are only from the\noutside sky (no light source in the office), is your approach still accurate\nenough in this case? I am not familiar with this approach. Does your book,\nRendering with Radiance, have some introductions to such options as \"lr\"\n\"lw\". I checked the last several chapters and did not find \"lr\" and \"lw\".\nThanks,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007223.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "August 30, 2010 at 07:36PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007221", "id": "radiance-general_007223"}
