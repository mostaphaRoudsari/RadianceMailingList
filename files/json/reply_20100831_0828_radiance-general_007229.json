{"body": "You don't say which way the differences go.  Are they consistently higher or lower?  If higher, then you may be getting a more accurate result from the path tracing method due to Russian-roulette termination.  If the path tracing results are lower, then you may need to decrease the -aw value further.\n\n\nTo answer your earlier quesiton, the -lr setting should be greater (in absolute value) than the -ab setting.  They are similar.  The reason a separate -ab setting is provided is because indirect irradiance is much more expensive to compute than other types of reflection, such as specular rays that do not create multiple branches in the ray tree.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007229.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 31, 2010 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007221", "id": "radiance-general_007229"}
