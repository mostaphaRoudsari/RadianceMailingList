{"body": "Hello:\n\n\nI report the progress. I decrease -lw to 1e-6 and -lr to -12. The results\nseem consistent enough. If I only change lr to -15 or only -lw to 1e-6, the\nconsistence still exists. So, should I change both?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007232.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "August 31, 2010 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007221", "id": "radiance-general_007232"}
