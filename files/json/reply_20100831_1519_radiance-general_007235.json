{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nGlad you found the error in your script.\n\n\nrtcontrib outputs an image or value for each bin starting at 0 up to the last bin that has a value.   So it could be that a the last few bins don't contribute to your scene so no image is created.  You can force rtcontrib to write all images/values using the -bn option.  Try setting -bn 146  if you're using tregenza.cal or -bn Nrbins if you're using reinhart.cal\n\n\nAlso, for the next step you may want the new (since July 1) version  of dctimestep.  It allows you to combine daylight coefficient images like so:\n\n\ngendaylit [options]    |  genskyvec -m 1   |   dctimestep myimage_%03d.hdr > output.hdr\n\n\nwhere the \"myimage\" bit matches the -o output specification used in rtcontrib.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Aug 31, 2010, at 1:59 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007235.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "August 31, 2010 at 03:19PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007234", "id": "radiance-general_007235"}
