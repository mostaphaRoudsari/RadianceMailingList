{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nYeah, for some reason, that \"no view in file\" error was never making it to\nthe command line when called from within a script.\n\n\nThanks very much for these tips! I initially thought that it was that there\nno values found so no images were created for certain patches, but there are\ndefinitely some \"black\" images being created, so I ruled that out. Good to\nknow about the -bn option. Thank you.\n\n\nThis new option to dctimestep is awesome!!! Definitely makes quick work of\nwhat I'm currently trying to do in bash and it's giving me a headache. I'll\ncheck it out now. Thanks to you and Greg I assume?\n\n\n=8-)\n\n\nDid I say thank you?\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nP.S. Thank you. A beer for you and a root beer for Greg.\n\n\nOn 8/31/10 4:19 PM, \"Andy McNeil\" <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 31, 2010 at 03:28PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007234", "id": "radiance-general_007236"}
