{"body": "One more thing:\nIf you have a single surface under the sky, its SVF can easily be calculated as: SVF=(1+cos(a))/2 where a is the tilt angle of the surface (a=0 for a horizontal surface; a=90 for a vertical surface; a=180 for an horizontal surface oriented towards the ground)\n\n\nYou can then check your radiance calculations by comparing your results with this formula.\nFor instance by printing a graph like this:\n\n\nbgraph | x11meta\nAdata=!\"cnt 181 | rcalc -e '$1=0;$2=0;$3=0;a=$1*PI/180;$4=sin(a);$5=0;$6=cos(a)'  | rtrace -h -w -I -aa 0 -ab 1 s.oct | rcalc -e '$1=recno;$2=$1'\"\nBdata=!\"cnt 181 | rcalc -e 'a=$1*PI/180;$1=recno;$2=(1+cos(a))/2'\"\nxlabel=tilt\nylabel=SVF\n\n\nYou should see that the two curves totally overlap!\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007245.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "September 01, 2010 at 01:54AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007241", "id": "radiance-general_007245"}
