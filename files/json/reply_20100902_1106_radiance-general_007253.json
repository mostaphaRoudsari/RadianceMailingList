{"body": "> I have here LBNL Window 5a output describing the optical properties of a\n> glazing system. Can I use this with Radiance & if so, how?

That one is supported by a special preprocessing \ntool \"optics2rad\". From the manpage:\n\n\noptics2rad converts Optics 5 output to correct Radiance input.\n\n\nDoes this help?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007253.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
