{"body": "> When I export this model to radiance, I get the following error:\n>\n> 3020: WARNING: Light object 87 is producing no light - check color and\n> lumen output.\n\n\nSo and how is your \"FloodlightNoShielding\" defined in Ecotect?\n\n\n> Indeed, when I look into the RAD file, I see the following:\n>\n> FloodlightNoShielding_dist light FloodlightNoShielding\n> 0\n> 0\n> 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.000 0.000 0.000\n>\n> When I render it this way, there is no artifical lighting.

The\nthree values define the intensity of the light source in W/m^2. The\nright value for your _flood_light depends on the definition of the\ndistribution and the size of the fitting in the model.\n\n\n> Now, the\n> problem is, there are so many fixtures in the model that I cannot edit the\n> RAD file each time before simulation.

Is there a bug or is there something that I am missing?\n\n\nBug is always possible with Ecotect but I expect that - as the error\nsuggests - you definition of the light (a type of material in Ecotect)\nis wrong.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 06, 2010 at 07:03PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007259", "id": "radiance-general_007260"}
