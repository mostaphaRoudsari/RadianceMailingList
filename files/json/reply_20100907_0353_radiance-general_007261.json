{"body": "Dear Jan,\nAlthough I have the flight and hotel booked, I will not know if I can go\nuntil the last minute. For this reason I haven't registered yet.\n\n\nIs it possible to keep a place for me on standing by? If I'm coming I\nwould also like to attend the advance course on Wednesday. If so can I pay\nthe registration on arrival?\n\n\nEven if I can't make it Axel will.\nRegards,\nLuisa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007261.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Luisa Brotas", "created_at": "September 07, 2010 at 03:53AM", "created_by": "Luisa_Brotas", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007246", "id": "radiance-general_007261"}
