{"body": "Depending on the version of Ecotect (5.5 works, 5.6 doesn't) you can\ntry and place a file in your material repository folder. Ecotect can\nthen look for each material for a file with the same name in this\nfolder and will use the contents of the file instead of converting the\nmaterial properties - which is does pretty badly anyway.\n\n\nSo find your material repository, create a file called\n\"FloodlightNoShielding.rad\" and add a working light description to\nthis file. Then export again with the right option - I forgot the name\nbut it's pretty obvious.\n\n\nIf that works and changes your light definition in Radiance we can\nthen talk about what should go into this file. If it doesn't work you\ncan also export the lights as markers and replace the markers with the\nproper Radiance description after the export.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n2010/9/8  <omoltay at mimtarch.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007265.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "September 08, 2010 at 07:35PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007264", "id": "radiance-general_007265"}
