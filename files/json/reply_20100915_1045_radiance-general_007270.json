{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> DO we need to buy the train ticket in advance from frankfurt airport?\n\n\nTypically it is easier / cheaper if you get a ticket online some days in \nadvance (www.bahn.de). However, you can also get it at the train \nstation, which is attached to the airport. ICE is the fastest train \nclass, IC and EC are also fast - if your take a RE or RB it will be some \nsmall banlieu-train, avoid it!\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007270.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
