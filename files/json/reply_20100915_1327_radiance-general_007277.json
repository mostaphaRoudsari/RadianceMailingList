{"body": "Hi Marion,\n\n\nYou should have a look at Building Controls Virtual Testbed (BCVTB): https://gaia.lbl.gov/bcvtb/FrontPage\n\n\nBCVTB can be used to link various simulation programs.  The user manual describes how to use Radiance with BCVTB (it's done via system command actors to call scripts).  TRNSYS is on the list of programs to be connected with BCVTB, but I don't think it has been done yet.  \n\n\nMichael Wetter at LBNL is the person to contact about BCVTB and connecting simulation programs.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007277.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "September 15, 2010 at 01:27PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007273", "id": "radiance-general_007277"}
