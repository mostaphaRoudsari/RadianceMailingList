{"body": ">> Has anyone seen these when trying to convert Rhino OBJ exports? What do  \n>> they mean?\n\n\nDear Randolph,\n\n\nI have encountered this before with a complex Rhino model as well. Luckily  \nOBJ files are plain text.\n\n\nIn my case, a few of the points in my obj file were given a normal of 0 0  \n0 which obj2rad did not like. I fixed it by running a find and replace on  \n\"vn 0 0 0\" with \"vn 0 0 1\" without any negative consequences.\n\n\nThe specific errors of bad face or triangle seem to come from bad vt  \n(vertex texture-coordinate) data in your OBJ file, so I would start by  \nlooking there.\n\n\nBest regards,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007293.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "September 21, 2010 at 04:34AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007291", "id": "radiance-general_007293"}
