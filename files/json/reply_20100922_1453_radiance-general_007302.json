{"body": "> Is it possible to accelerate these process? Are there any tools \n> available, which can input the CAD data in RADIANCE?\nYes.  Exporting to OBJ, the old Wavefront format, and importing to \nRadiance using obj2rad is a popular one right now.  If you are using \nSketchUp, Thomas Bleicher has an export plugin which you can download.  \nThere are some AutoCAD export tools--look on the web--, but Autodesk \nhas been making it steadily more and more difficult to distribute any \ntool without paying royalties to Autodesk, and so far no-one has been \nwilling to take on the problem.\n\n\n> Another topic are the lamps in RADIANCE: How is it possible to get lamp \n> information in RADIANCE? Exits there any tools, too?\nBasic tools are part of the package.   IES photometry for the luminaire \ncan be bound to a few simple surface forms, which can then be used to \nwrap visible lamp geometry.  ies2rad does the basic job of taking an \nIES photometry file and converting it to Radiance format, but coding is \nrequired to create a lamp that both radiates light and has a visible \nform.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph M.
