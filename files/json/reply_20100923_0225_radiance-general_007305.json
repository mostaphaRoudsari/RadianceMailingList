{"body": "There is even anelaborate Radiance-frontend for Blender.\n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=Pages&func=display&pageid=1\n\n\nI have been using formZ, which combines CAD and modeling functionality, and exported obj files. Obj files are the best supported input besides the native Radiance formats rad and mgf.\n\n\nHowever, I think it is a good idea for a beginner to follow the tutorial and create at least one scene by hand. It helps understand what geometry will be in Radiance, give some understanding also on limitations when using CAD, and may be helpful if you ever expect problems.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
