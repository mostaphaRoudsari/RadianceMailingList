{"body": "Christoph,\n\n\nImaging technology is awfully cheap these days. I think something could \nbe improvised with standard filters and a moderately-priced camera, but \nit would take some expertise to design, fabricate, and calibrate.  \nDesign expertise, of course, we have on this list, fabrication and \ncalibration, not so much (at least, I don't think we do.)  Have you \nthought about wandering over to your local physics department & asking \nfor help?  Or perhaps to MIT?  It might make a good student project.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\n\n\nOn 2010-09-23 10:05:56 -0700, Reinhart, Christoph said:\n\n\n> Dear all:\n> \u00a0\n> I am looking for an affordable (<$3000) set of devices that can measure \n> the spectral power distribution of light sources in the visible range \n> as well as wavelength dependant surface reflectances.
