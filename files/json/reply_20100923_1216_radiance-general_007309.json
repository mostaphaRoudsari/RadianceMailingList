If he can design, fabricate, and calibrate  \ngoniophotometers, I'm sure he'd be up to spectral power measurements. ;^)\n(Is PAB still on this list?)\n\n\nChris, we missed you at the workshop, btw.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSystem Administrator\nInstitute for Applied Mathematics\nBonn University\nEndenicher Allee 60\n53115 Bonn\nGermany\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007309.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "September 23, 2010 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007306", "id": "radiance-general_007309"}
