{"body": "Hi folks,\n\n\nmy two cents thoughts:\n\n\nAirfares from Europe would be very much the same. In fact, in late August, the north-Atlantic-to-west-coast route is likely even more expensive then Europe to Singapore. Aug to Mid-Oct is still high season for USA, but not so much for Singapore (except during racing days down there, around end of September). With hotel prices and cost of living lower in Singapore, the whole trip is likely even more economic for Europeans.\n\n\nA hands-on approach to the tropics might also remind us Westerners on the northern sphere about different sun paths, shading strategies and materials.\n\n\nLast, but not the least, Asia, the regions around Singapore and relatively close-by India are regarded as upcoming regions, with an increase in building activities. So for advances in daylighting in those regions and helping to avoid mistakes already experienced by others, it would be more efficient to show expertise in Singapore than an annual gathering of the already converted at LBNL. The audience would include more new users and perspectives that way, which would be in the interest of LBNL as well.\n\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning our Radiance folks down-under and ongoing work there.\n\n\nbest regards\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007324.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "September 28, 2010 at 02:26AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007320", "id": "radiance-general_007324"}
