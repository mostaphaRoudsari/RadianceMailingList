{"body": "I agree with Peter that having a Radiance workshop in Asia would help to widen or firmer establish the Radiance community in an important region. Having said this, the workshop will only be effective if a sufficient number of us are planning to go. It might be beneficial to piggyback on another conference, e.g. Building Simulation will be in November in New Zealand. I do not think that too many people will want to fly to Asia twice in only a couple of months.\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007325.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "September 28, 2010 at 04:42AM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007320", "id": "radiance-general_007325"}
