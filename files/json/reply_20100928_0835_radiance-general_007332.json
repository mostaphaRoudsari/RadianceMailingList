{"body": "While I was looking forward to a North American location for 2011 (making it\neasier for me to get funded to go), Peter and Christoph make very good\npoints. Christoph's suggestion of piggybacking on SimBuild probably makes\nthe whole thing more palatable for many faced with the prospect of traveling\neven further to the workshop than they did this year.\n\n\nSince this is already off the rails, I'm going to throw another boulder on\nthe tracks; Jennifer & I were thinking that NREL would be a great place to\nhost the 2011 Workshop, here in Colorado. I did not realize 2011 locations\nwere going to be discussed at the workshop or I would have mentioned it\nearlier. We just finished our new Research Support Facility (RSF), which is\na 220,000 ft^2 net-zero energy building, and we have plenty of other\nrenewable energy research going on here as well that we could tour/show off,\nincluding our work with Radiance. It's a more central location for North\nAmerican folks, but I also respect the many good ideas for having it in\nAsia. Just wanted to throw it out there.\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 28, 2010 at 5:42 AM, Reinhart, Christoph <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007332.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 28, 2010 at 08:35AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007320", "id": "radiance-general_007332"}
