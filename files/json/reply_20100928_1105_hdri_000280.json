{"body": "Some quick responses:\n\n\n1)  You do need to use the -o option in your pcomb command, but it only applies to the immediately following input file.  Therefore, you need to put the \"-o\" between your two file names, or change their order to keep the absolute values.  Displaying the output with ximage, you can use the \"-e auto\" option to bring the values in the the correct range for display (i.e., tone-map the result).\n\n\n2) There is no easy way for Photosphere to figure out whether a fish-eye lens is being used.  I would have to create a lens database similar to Photoshop CS5's and read the hidden maker tags in the Exif file, and still it would only work \"sometimes.\"  You are better off adding or correcting the VIEW= string as Jan suggests using the \"vinfo\" command in Radiance.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-September/000280.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 28, 2010 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000273", "id": "hdri_000280"}
