{"body": "Hi Greg - I have it up running now. Had to install xcode. Btw: Installing\nxcode has some really nice side-effects that I wasn't aware of. Have tried\nto install e.g. convert and m4 on my mac but with no luck - have used these\nreally convenient programs on Linux. However, these programs are included in\nxcode, so now rsensor maybe does what I want it to (just need to plot the\nrays to verify that I get the right directions) and in addition I can make\nuse of the other programs. HURRAY!\nThanks again Greg. Have a great day!\n/Anne\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 1\nDate: Tue, 28 Sep 2010 11:24:31 -0700\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007336.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anne Iversen", "created_at": "September 28, 2010 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007271", "id": "radiance-general_007336"}
