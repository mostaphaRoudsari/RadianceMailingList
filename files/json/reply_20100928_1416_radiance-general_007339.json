{"body": "So I got rid of the \"void\"s, and found another apparently good face \nwhich draws the \"Bad Triangle\" message.\n\n\nIt's a very long file--the error occurs at line 12104.  So far I have \nnot been able to construct a short example; the same face are accepted \nwithout complaint.  If I don't use a mapping file, the conversion runs \nwithout incident.  This is beginning to look like an obj2rad bug.\n\n\nAnyone have a workaround to suggest?  Also, anyone actually used a \ndebugger with obj2rad?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007339.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
