{"body": "Wow.  It seems we are faced with an embarrassment of riches, with multiple attractive offers for hosting next year's workshop -- and the year after that!\n\n\nI'm going to suggest we have a period for proposals and discussions, after which we'll ask people to vote for their favorites.  I'm going to make it about \"attendance probability\" rather than absolute preference, asking people to predict their chances of attending the workshop next year based on each of the choices offered.  After all, what matters most is that we get ourselves together for a healthy exchange.  Exotic surroundings are great, but not if only a few people can make it.  I hope there is agreement on this much.\n\n\nSo, let's give ourselves until the end of October to discuss proposals, make our pleas and lobby for our favorites, then we'll put it to a vote during the month of November.  I will take the responsibility of setting up a website where people can cast their ballots for next year.  I'm going to leave the 2012 decision for 2011, if that's OK with everyone.  If we do end up in Singapore next year, I'm going to propose that 2012 be on the North American continent.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007342.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 28, 2010 at 03:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007320", "id": "radiance-general_007342"}
