That worked + the solution was easier than I thought it could\npossibly be!\nI also had to do the same trick on tmaptiff.c (put tiffio.h above tmprivat.h)\nand on tmapcolrs.c I had to move rtprocess.h also to be also above tmprivat.h\n\n\nAfter these changes compiling went like a charm.\n\n\nBest Regards.\n\n\nGuy\n\n\n(No idea how to reply on a message on the mailing list, I hope this works)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-October/001053.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "October 03, 2010 at 12:42PM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001051", "id": "radiance-dev_001053"}
