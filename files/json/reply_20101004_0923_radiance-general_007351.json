{"body": "Hi Andrew,\n\n\nyes, evalglare needs a 180\u00b0 fish-eye(-vta)- LUMINANCE image. Internally\nit calculates the vertical illuminance as Greg mentioned before.\n\n\nA value of 0.4756 is a rather high value (-> 48% are disturbed by glare).\n\n\nAt the last building simulation conference, I suggested some \"glare\nclasses\" based on user assessments, which may help to interpret the DGP\nvalues.\n(table 5 in http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0944_951.pdf ).\nFurther details can be found also in my dissertation \"Daylight Glare in\nOffices\", which will be available in some days as pdf on our web-site.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007351.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "October 04, 2010 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007347", "id": "radiance-general_007351"}
