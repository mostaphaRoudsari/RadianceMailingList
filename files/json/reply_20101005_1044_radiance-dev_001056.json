{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nThanks for trying. And I am glad that everything compiled correctly,\nhowever:\n\n\nFor Gendaylit you also need a library file called: 'perezlum.cal'\n\n\nI added this also to ray\\scr\\gen\\SConscript the line should be:\nLIBFILES = Split('illum.cal rev.cal skybright.cal glaze1.cal glaze2.cal\nperezlum.cal')\n\n\nThis way the file perezlum.cal is also copied when doing a scons install and\nRadiance will be able to interpreted and use the output of Gendaylit.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nGuy\n\n\n\n\nHi,\n\n\nI've managed to install latest HEAD Radiance in Windows 7, after changes\nsuggested by Guy.\nAll Radiance programs are compiled correctly.\n\n\nGeneral procedure for installation I use, is the one described on\nFrancesco's Wiki page\nHow to compile Radiance using the MinGW tools and\nScons<http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=how_to_compile_radiance_using_the_mingw_tools_and_scons>\n\n\nSo when Radiance site is updated, notes about compilation procedure should\nbe put on the site and also Windows installation file (for those who don't\nwant to compile files manually).\n\n\nCheers,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-October/001056.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "October 05, 2010 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001051", "id": "radiance-dev_001056"}
