You further specify the location's latitude and longitude with\n'-a' and '-o'. The sun position and altitude are calculated from these\nvalues.\n\n\n> What is the \u20182 skybr skybright.cal\u2019 in the third part \u2018void brightfunc\n> skyfunc\u2019 meaning?\n\n\nThe output of gensky is basically a brightness distribution definition\nfor a sky dome. The brightness is defined by a function in the file\n'skybright.cal'.\n\n\n> And why is the third line in every part 0??\n\n\nThat's the standard notation for Radiance materials (and other\nobjects). You have a base definition (like in 'solar' above) which\ndoes not need any advanced options or parameters. Then there is\nadvanced definition of 'skyfunc' which adds two parameters on the\nsecond line - that's why it starts with a '2'. I don't know if the\nthird line is used at all in Radiance but I expect they had plans for\nit back in the days when it was defined. For now it just says '0' to\nindicate that there are no further arguments on this line.\n\n\n> 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I want to call this command \u2018gendaylit 2 5 15 -a 37.42 -o 122.4\n> -m 120 -W 280 280 -g .1\u2019 I will get this error:\n>\n> C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance\\bin\\gendaylit.exe 2 5 15 -a 37.42 -o 122.4 -m 120 -W 280 280 -g .1\n>\n> file coeff_perez.dat cannot be opened\n> lect_coeff_perez does not work\n>\n> Does everyone of you know why I get this error?
