RAYPATH should point to the directory which contains the\nsupporting files for Radiance (*.cal and *.dat files and possibly\nothers).\n\n\nGiven the location of your gendaylit binary\n(C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance\\bin\\gendaylit.exe) I would expect that all\nyour supporting files are installed in C:\\cygwin\\opt\\radiance\\lib. I\ndon't know how Cygwin works and if you have to add the leading\n'C:\\cygwin' to RAYPATH or not but the coeff_perez.cal file should be\nin this directory.\n\n\n> Also I'm not sure which parameter I have to use for the -W parameter.\n> I used -W 280 280, but maybe this is my mistake.\n> Can you explain me what is the meaning of these two values?\n\n\nThe values as such are fine. I get a results on my system with the\nsame command line. However, gendaylit is know to produce errors for\ncertain combination of parameters. So you have to be careful with the\noutput of gendaylit and check if is useable or not.\n\n\nThe -W option tells gendaylit to produce a sky based on direct-normal\nand diffuse-horizontal irradiance which are commonly given in climate\ndata files. For more details read the man page of gendaylit.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007355.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 06, 2010 at 01:20PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007354", "id": "radiance-general_007355"}
