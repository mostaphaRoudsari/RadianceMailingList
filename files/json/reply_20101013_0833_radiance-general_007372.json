{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nIn the latest HEAD, I have changed the behavior of rtrace so if -x is anything but 1 and -y is non-zero as well, ray flushing does not take place.  It was really a performance issue rather than an issue with artifacts, however.  You should get acceptable results with the 4.0 release.\n\n\nI can only suppose that you are seeing lines in  your example because you are not sharing the irradiance cache between processes.  I recommend you add a -af option to do so.  Also, it may indicate that your -ad parameter needs to be a little larger.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007372.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 13, 2010 at 08:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007370", "id": "radiance-general_007372"}
