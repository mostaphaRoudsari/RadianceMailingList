But if you can spare the time for the calculation there is\nno harm in it.\n\n\n> There should be no radiation falling on a point inside a closed space,\n> right?\n\n\nRight. But the box is only a geometrical box and not a physical one.\nIf your box has only a single polygon layer as \"wall\" then you might\nsee the result of interpolation along the edges here. Try to enclose\nyour box in another larger box and do your tests again.\n\n\nWhen you model a real test scene try to model the inside and outside\nof a wall separately. That should avoid errors due to interpolation in\nyour results.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007387.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 20, 2010 at 07:04AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007386", "id": "radiance-general_007387"}
