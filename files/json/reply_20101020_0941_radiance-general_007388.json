{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nThomas is essentially correct.  The lack of thickness to your walls means that the occasional ray can \"escape\" out the corners of your box, permitting light to leak in during your calculation.  Using a sphere rather than a box, you'll find your value goes to zero.  Or, adding a second box to enclose your first one also fixes the problem.\n\n\nThese kinds of errors are inherent to floating point calculations, and people have written entire Ph.D. theses addressing the problem.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007388.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 20, 2010 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007386", "id": "radiance-general_007388"}
