I felt it was \ncertainly one of the great moments of the workshop. Radiance (or lets \nsay Greg) has done a lot of progress in supporting certain applications \nby adding the matrix-based toolchain. Still, fast progress usually needs \na critical review. And that is where you stepped in on the workshop - it \nis really important that people know what it means to reduce angular \nresolution, where it is useful and where it has to fail. As well as to \nunderstand the limitations of other approaches, such as functional \ndescriptions, in Radiance's current implementation. I somehow feel that \nsuch a discussion on the limitations and implications of the approach \nmay be even a valueable addition to the (great!) tutorial Andy wrote for us.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007395.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
