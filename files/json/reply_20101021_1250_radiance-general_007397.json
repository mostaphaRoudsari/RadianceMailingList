{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nThe errors for ezxml are preventing librtrad.a from being made.  Missing librtrad causes all the subsequent errors (ld missing -lrtrad).  \n\n\nThe part of ezxml_parse_fd that uses MADV_SEQUENTIAL is supposed to be left out when compiled on CYGWIN.\n\n\nFrom ezxml.h:\n/* disable MMAP on CYGWIN, seems to cause problems... */\n#ifdef CYGWIN\n#define EZXML_NOMMAP\n#endif\nI'd suggest changing those lines in ezxml.h to:\n/* disable MMAP on CYGWIN, seems to cause problems... */\n#define EZXML_NOMMAP\nSo that EZXML_NOMMAP is defined.  ezxml.h can be found in ray/src/common/\n\n\nI can't test this myself, so no promises that it'll work.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007397.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 21, 2010 at 12:50PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007396", "id": "radiance-general_007397"}
