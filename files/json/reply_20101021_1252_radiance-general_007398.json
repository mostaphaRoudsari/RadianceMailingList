{"body": "Hi Claus\n\n\nYou can find the same error report for the 3R9 release here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000870.html\n\n\nGrep posted a solution back then as a reply to the email which is also in\nthe archive:\n\n\nTry adding \"-DEZXML_NOMMAP\" to the rmake script and rerunning\n\"makeall install\" in the main directory or \"rmake install\" in the src/\ngen directory.  Th ezxml.c module is new with this release and was\nprovided by a third party, so I'm not well familiar with its\nportability issues.  So far, it seems quite robust.\n\n\n\n\nCygwin is not very popular since precompiled MinGW binaries are available or\nthe Cygwin users a quiet bunch here on the list.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n2010/10/21 Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007398.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 21, 2010 at 12:52PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007396", "id": "radiance-general_007398"}
