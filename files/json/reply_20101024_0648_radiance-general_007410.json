{"body": "Thanks Thomas,\n\n\nI was missing the .; and now it finds the 3mmClear.xml file.  Sorry about such a basic error, and to think I have fallen over with that one before.  It now can't find reinhart.cal, I will dig around and sort out exactly how my .profile RAYPATH should be written, It clearly must be the way I have written that.\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAndrew\n__________________________\nAndrew Bissell\nB.Eng(Hons) C.Eng MSLL MCIBSE MIET\nAssociate Lighting Designer\nCundall Light4\nDirect: 0161 200 1235\nMobile: 07899 907 978\nOffice: 0161 244 5660\n\uf050 Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007410.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrew Bissell", "created_at": "October 24, 2010 at 06:48AM", "created_by": "Andrew_Bissell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007408", "id": "radiance-general_007410"}
