This is\nonly important if you write your own *.cal files.\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Oct 24, 2010 at 8:48 AM, Bissell, Andrew <a.bissell at cundall.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007411.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 24, 2010 at 07:00AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007408", "id": "radiance-general_007411"}
