{"body": "Thank you, Greg, Thomas, and Randolph!\n\n\nWe've tried according to your suggestion by using a box with \"thickness\",\ni.e. the walls of the box are composed of two layers of polygons, with the\nnormal of the external layer pointing outward, and the nomal of the internal\nlayer pointing inward.\n\n\nHowever, it seems the irradiance reading of the center of this box still\nvaries depending on the thickness of the wall, or the distance between the\ntwo layers of polygons.\n\n\nThe variation seems irragular as well, i.e. we got zero reading for the\ncentre for one thickness, but we then got non-zero reading when the\nthickness is reduced or increased.\n\n\nIs it still related to the float point calculation matter?\n\n\nOr, should we simply ignore this issue because the non-zero reading is still\nfairly small and can be rounded to zero if the precision required is not\nthat high?\n(e.g. for an overcast sky which will produce a horrizontal illuminance of\n10,000lx the illuminance reading of the center of the box is 0.00249131lx)\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007413.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "October 24, 2010 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007386", "id": "radiance-general_007413"}
