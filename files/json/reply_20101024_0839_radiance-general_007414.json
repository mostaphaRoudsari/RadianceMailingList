{"body": "Ji.\n\n\nHave you tried Greg's suggestion to enclose the scene in a sphere already?\n\n\nFor practical purposes you can ignore the small error introduces by\nthe interpolation. Any reasonably lit space will show illuminance\nvalues which are several magnitudes above that. However, you should\nstill verify that it is indeed the interpolation that causes your\nreadings.\n\n\nIf you get zero values with an enclosing sphere that's a good\nindicator for it. You can also render a hemispherical image towards\nthe ceiling and the floor. Interpolation errors should show as bright\nspots along the edges.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Sun, Oct 24, 2010 at 10:18 AM, Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007414.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 24, 2010 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007386", "id": "radiance-general_007414"}
