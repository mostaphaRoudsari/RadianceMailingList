{"body": "> Hi all,\n> is there a way to import to Radiance cameras set on Rhino?\n\n\nHi Roberto,\n\n\nThe ViewportProperties command in Rhino will show you XYZ values for the  \ncurrent camera location and target location. The camera location XYZ  \nvalues can be used directly for the -vp parameter in rpict. The -vd  \nparameter should be derived by subtracting the camera location values from  \nthe camera target values, constructing a vector relative to the camera  \nlocation.\n\n\nIf you're using DIVA for Rhino, this is automatically done when exporting  \none or multiple camera views.\n\n\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007417.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "October 27, 2010 at 06:58AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007416", "id": "radiance-general_007417"}
