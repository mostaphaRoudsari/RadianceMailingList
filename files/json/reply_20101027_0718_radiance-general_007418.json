{"body": "Sorry to double-post, but I almost forgot, the vh and vv horizontal and  \nvertical angle parameters can be roughly determined based on the viewport  \nlens length, since Rhino uses a 35mm camera. If you're always using a the  \nsame length camera lens, this only needs to be done once.\n\n\nVH = 2.75*(180/pi) * atan[(36 / (2 * lenslength))]\nVV = 2.75*(180/pi) * atan[(24 / (2 * lenslength))]\n\n\nThe 2.75 is a correction factor that I found from experience approximates  \nthe rhino viewport quite closely. Its probably also good practice to take  \nthe floor of these values.\n\n\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007418.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "October 27, 2010 at 07:18AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007416", "id": "radiance-general_007418"}
