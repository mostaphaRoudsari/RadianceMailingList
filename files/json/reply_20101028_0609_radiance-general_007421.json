{"body": "Hi Giovanni,\n\n\nI will give a short answer and then try to follow-up later with a longer \nexplanation. Regarding the diffusing interlayer, as I recall Optics 5 is \nnot really set up to deal with diffusing materials (unless this has \nchanged recently). Regardless, any material definition exported to \nRadiance format will be in the form of three materials: a glass \ndefinition and a front and back side BRTDfunc. Note however that the \nBRTDfunc (unless this has been changed) is a very simplified material \ndefinition that is not set up to account for angular variation. There \nare a couple of options to convert Radiance output from Optics 5 to \nsomething more useful: A) optics2rad or B) glaze. These are both scripts \nthat come with the standard Radiance distribution.\n\n\nI am not sure what to suggest for how to manage the diffuse component. \nThis can probably be incorporated into a BRTDfunc definition. Regarding \nthe fritting, I agree with your presumption that if you are any \nreasonable distance from the building then the individual makeup (lines, \ndots, whatever), will disappear in most cases. It is possible to build \nup frit glass definitions (based on percent coverage) using the glaze \nscript.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/28/2010 7:49 AM, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007421.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 28, 2010 at 06:09AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007420", "id": "radiance-general_007421"}
