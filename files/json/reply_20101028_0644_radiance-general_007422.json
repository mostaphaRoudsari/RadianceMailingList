{"body": "Thanks Jack,\n\n\nI have done some more reading on the mailing list and found a few useful\nposts describing opt2rad and glaze.\nBoth seem really useful, although glaze seems likely the most\ninteresting option because (if I understand correctly) allows for frit\nand angular dependencies in transmission/reflection.\n\n\nUnfortunately I am using radiance on windows using the Ming-w compiled\nversion and I do not find the files in my bin or lib folder (but I find\nglaze2.cal). Is there a version of these available for windows?\n\n\nAlso Glaze supports only two glass panes with an interlayer or can cope\nwith three-ply build ups?\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007422.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "October 28, 2010 at 06:44AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007420", "id": "radiance-general_007422"}
