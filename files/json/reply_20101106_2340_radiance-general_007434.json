On Unix execvp() is used, \nunless a shell is specifically chosen.  On Windows, which doesn't have \nan analog of execvp(), arguments are escaped for the MS C runtime \nlibrary.  So scripts aren't dependent on the platform.  I've used this \nand, in fact, it works.   Also, personally, I prefer working with \nPython lists to csh variables, but I doubt you would!\n\n\n> Can you share a little more of your broader vision?
