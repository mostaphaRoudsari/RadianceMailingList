{"body": "I think this is a wonderful idea - I'd be willing to \npitch in what Python coding \nI can.\nPython has a lot of great data-processing libraries, \nand as people have noted, \nit would make a much better cross-platform API to Radiance \nthan the command-line.  \nI'll take Python over shell scripting any day!\nI think the first step would be for someone to write a Python API - \nthere are lots of ways to implement it \nfrom just wrapping the shell commands to \ncloser integration, \nbut if you have a stable API people can get started using it \nwithout re-writing their scripts constantly as Radiance-Python evolves.\n\n\nBest,\nSevern Clay-Youman\nwww.lesbetes.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007437.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Severn Clay-Youman", "created_at": "November 08, 2010 at 06:01AM", "created_by": "Severn_Clay-Youman", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007431", "id": "radiance-general_007437"}
