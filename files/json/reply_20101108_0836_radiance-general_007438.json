{"body": "Well, it sounds like there is significant groundswell around this idea.  I suggest that interested parties/developers organize a host site for this effort and someone (Dave?) take charge of the project.  It's not something I can personally help with, and there aren't enough spare resources or Python experts at LBNL to manage such a project as far as I know.  Ongoing maintenance is something to think about as well, as new Radiance releases will likely continue to have some minor changes and some major additions.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007438.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 08, 2010 at 08:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007431", "id": "radiance-general_007438"}
