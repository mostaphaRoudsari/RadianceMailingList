Python 2 vs 3 is more likely to cause additional\nwork than the Radiance interface.\n\n\nHowever, I can see that an additional advantage of this project\ncould be that the remaining CSH scripts (and possibly Perl scripts)\nin the main Radiance distribution get finally pythonized. In that\ncase should the new scripts be kept separately or should they\nfind their way back into the distribution?\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007439.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 08, 2010 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007431", "id": "radiance-general_007439"}
