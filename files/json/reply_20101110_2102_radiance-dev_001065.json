{"body": "Hi Guy, Randolph, et al.:\n\n\nGuy of course I recall your recent post on compiling Radiance for Windows with scons. Great work, a great follow-up to all the hard work Francesco Anselmo did years ago to get a MinGW compile. My post was in no way meant to trivialize the work you and others are doing.  What we are looking to do at NREL is to create a cmake environment that is easy to maintain, that would provide nightly builds of Radiance for Windows, with a dashboard environment that would allow us to stay on top of any new changes to the code base (that seem to be coming fast and furious lately (a good thing)). I have been using Radiance for a ling time, but I can still remember the bleeding edge pain I went through in the mid 90's trying to learn UNIX sysadmin skills before I ever got to run oconv. I think a reliable repository for Windows binaries of the complete Radiance suite that keeps pace with development (which is very active these days) is important and novel. It also in no way means the scons work you have done is irrelevant. \n\n\nRandolph, I'm sorry but I simply don't agree with you on your assessment of cmake. Internally, we are using cmake to keep pace with an agile development cycle involving a couple dozen software engineers, working on cross platform (Win/Mac/Linux) builds of our analysis platform. The idiot typing this email is able to maintain binaries on his OSX systems, and the Windows systems he has running on his VMs, with minimal knowledge of cmake. It's a big system, but it allows experts to allow novices to do expert things, and everywhere in between, developers of all stripes have access to source code and cross platform functionality that encourages participation. \n\n\nOur intent is to offer a couple of alternatives here. \n\n\n- Rob\n____________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-November/001065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 10, 2010 at 09:02PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001059", "id": "radiance-dev_001065"}
