{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI am not sure wether I get your answer correct. The horizon is (almost) at an infinite distance, and moving up 700m doesn't change that much. In fact, you apply your sky distribution which depends on angles, not carthesian height, to a source object to make it appear infinitely distant in Radiance.\n\n\nI would try to get a good representation of the horizon line (in degrees from the ideal horizon) to assess shadowing. Reflective properties in the mountains can be interesting, too, e.g. if you have snow for a long period of the year. In general getting climate data for such an exposed location is interesting.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O. Grobe\n\n\nOn Nov 15, 2010, at 22:45, \"Randolph M.
