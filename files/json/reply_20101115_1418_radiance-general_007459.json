{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nIt's a bit tricky to modify skybright.cal to account for an elevation causing the horizon to be below a 0-degree altitude, but it's possible.  First, you should check that it's necessary.  The formula you want for the angle below the horizon is:\n\n\n\ttheta = acos(R/(h+R))\n\n\nwhere R is the radius of the Earth (about 6360 km) and h is the distance above the horizon (sea level, presumably).  Even from the top of Mt. Everest, the change in the horizon is only about 3 degrees, assuming you could see something at sea level from there, which I'm not sure you could.  (Anyone who's been to the top of Everest, please pipe in.)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007459.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 15, 2010 at 02:18PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007457", "id": "radiance-general_007459"}
