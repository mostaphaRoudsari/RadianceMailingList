{"body": "Hi Jack and Thomas,\n\n\nThank you for your help, I tried evalglare yesterday and he worked well.\nBut regarding my results have got couple of questions:\n\n\n- i'm doing a glare study for an office (10m depth). I think glare will not be a problem for a person located at 9m away from the window, isn't it?\n- when my calculation is completed, i've 2 warnings messages:\n        low brightness scene\n        vertical illumiance < 380 lux.\nDo they impact the calcul?\nSo should i proceed a glare study only for the first 5m from the window?\n\n\nHow can i fix the warnings?\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAlex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Wed, 17 Nov 2010 11:22:18 -0500\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007466.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "alexis Loubeyre", "created_at": "November 18, 2010 at 01:49AM", "created_by": "alexis_Loubeyre", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007461", "id": "radiance-general_007466"}
