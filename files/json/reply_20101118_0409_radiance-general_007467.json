{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> Thank you for your help, I tried evalglare yesterday and he worked well.\n> But regarding my results have got couple of questions:\n>\n> - i'm doing a glare study for an office (10m depth). I think glare will\n> not be a problem for a person located at 9m away from the window, isn't it?\n\n\nHm, that may be to easy... e.g. if your office is on the West facade and \nyou directly look into the sun, it may be even worse at 9m distance...\n\n\n> - when my calculation is completed, i've 2 warnings messages:\n> low brightness scene\n> vertical illumiance < 380 lux.\n> Do they impact the calcul?\n> So should i proceed a glare study only for the first 5m from the window?\n\n\nEvalglare includes the vertical illuminance into its glare predictions, \nand (Jan can tell more about this) has been developed under conditions \nwith higher vertical illuminance. So look at all the 9m, but be careful \nwith those low-illuminance-locations.\n\n\n> How can i fix the warnings?\n\n\nNo way to fix, it is a warning to catch your attention, not a bug to fix ;-)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007467.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
