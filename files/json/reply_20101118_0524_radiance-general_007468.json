Evalglare might be happier with that (or it expects far\nmore than that; I honestly don't know).\n\n\n> Do they impact the calcul?\n\n\nEvalglare has been verified in a study on a small office space.\nI'm sure Jan has put some thought into the general application\nfor this new metric. You can find his dissertation here:\n\n\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/veroeffentlichungen/nach-jahrgaengen/2010/buecher-und-beitraege-zu-buechern/dayligth-glare-in-offices\n\n\n> So should i proceed a glare study only for the first 5m from the\u00a0window?\n\n\nI would first verify that evalglare produces reliable results\nin this office space. And then just go ahead and test the\nfull depth of the office. If you get a low probability for glare\nthat's also something to show.\n\n\n> How can i fix the warnings?\n\n\nNothing to fix; just make sure your using the right tool here.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007468.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 18, 2010 at 05:24AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007461", "id": "radiance-general_007468"}
