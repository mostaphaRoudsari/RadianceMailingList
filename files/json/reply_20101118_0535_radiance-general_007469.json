Evalglare \nintruduces illuminance on the eye plane (if you think of a human eye as \na flat sensor) into the calculation, which stabilizes results for \nextended, non-uniform sources (window seen from close with a lot of \ndetail behind). This is referred to as vertical illuminance (as \nilluminance on a vertical plane). And completely different from the \ntypically workplane illuminance, which would be referred to as \nhorizontal illuminance or illuminance that a infinitely small imaginary \nhorizontal surface at e.g. 0.9m heigth would receive.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007469.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
