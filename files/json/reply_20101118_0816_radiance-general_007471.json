{"body": "Regarding the glass definition, what you wrote makes sense although I didn't check the math.\n\n\nRegarding mirror, it is fully specular - all of the 0.965 reflection in your definition below would be reflected in a purely specular manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Thursday, November 18, 2010 10:57 AM\nTo: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nSubject: RE: [Radiance-general] transmission/transmissivity\n\n\nHi everyone\n\n\nIn radiance manual, when you want to create a glass material, we use this function:\n\n\nvoid glass id\n0\n0\n3 rtn gtn btn\n\n\n\n\nwhere tn is the transmissivity which comes from this formula:\n\n\ntn = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn\n\n\nwhere Tn is the transmittance.\n\n\nFor example, if i have light transmission for a window equal to 60% (given by a manufacturer), do i have to calculate tn with Tn =0.6\n\n\nand then put my results in the function, so with this example we'll have: tn = 0.65 with Tn = 0.6?\n\n\nvoid glass id\n0\n0\n3 0.65 0.65 0.65\n\n\nOther type, other question:\n\n\nfor a mirror, what is the default specularity if I define default mirror with this function:\n\n\nvoid mirror window\n0\n0\n3 0.965 0.965 0.965\n\n\nThank's a lot for your help.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAlexis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007471.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "November 18, 2010 at 08:16AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007470", "id": "radiance-general_007471"}
