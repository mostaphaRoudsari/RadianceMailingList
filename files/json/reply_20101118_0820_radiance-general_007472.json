The change from transmittance to transmissivity\naccounts for internal reflections in the glass. Please note that\nstrictly speaking this formula should be applied to a single sheet\nof glass. If you want to model a double glazing unit the glass\nmaterial does not properly represent the angular dependency\nof the light transmission. To accurately model this you should\nuse a tool like Window which allows you to export a description\nof the glazing for Radiance.\n\n\n> Other type, other question:\n>\n> for a mirror, what is the default specularity if I define default mirror\n> with this function:\n>\n> void mirror window\n> 0\n> 0\n> 3 0.965 0.965 0.965\n\n\nThe mirror material in Radiance does not represent a totally\nreflecting surface as in real world. It is used to accurately represent\na reflection of a light source (like the sun) in a scene.\n\n\nRegards\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007472.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 18, 2010 at 08:20AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007470", "id": "radiance-general_007472"}
