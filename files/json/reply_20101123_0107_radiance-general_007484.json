{"body": "Dear Everyone\n\n\nI've just found out my problem, it came from link for the materials. In Ecotect 2011, the path for the material folder is good but the link in radiance didn't work. I'll try to fix or will use Ecotect v5.\n\n\n So I'll continue to work on my project and be aware of my results!\n\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n\nAlexis\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007484.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "alexis Loubeyre", "created_at": "November 23, 2010 at 01:07AM", "created_by": "alexis_Loubeyre", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007482", "id": "radiance-general_007484"}
