Ecotect 5.6 could not substitute Radiance material\ndescriptions based on the file name (i. e. you have a material called\n\"wall\" and Ecotect would use the description in the file \"wall.rad\"). If\nthat is indeed what's still broken in Ecotect 2011 then Autodesk did\nindeed just slab on a new version number on the same old product.\n\n\nBTW: I 'fixed' the problem for 5.6 by writing my own export routine\nin Lua which did search for material files. Quite a bit of work, though.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007486.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 23, 2010 at 05:58AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007482", "id": "radiance-general_007486"}
