{"body": "Hi Roberto,\n\n\nI do not think that you can do that. Here is one approach that would work:\n\n\n    assume an octree of material/geometry that is to be used as an\n    instance: object.oct\n    NOTE this probably should be a \"frozen\" octree\n\n\n    define: instance.rad\n\n\n        void instance object\n        4 object.oct -t 0 0 0\n        0\n        0\n\n\n    then you can do one of the following:\n\n\n    define: array.rad\n\n\n        !xform -a 10 -t 1 0 0 -a 10 -t 0 1 0 instance.rad\n\n\n    OR\n\n\n    do: xform -a 10 -t 1 0 0 -a 10 -t 0 1 0 instance.rad > array.rad\n\n\n\n\nNote also that you could use markers and replmarks to achieve deploying \nan instance object repeatedly.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007489.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 23, 2010 at 12:18PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007488", "id": "radiance-general_007489"}
