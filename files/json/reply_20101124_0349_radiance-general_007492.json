Thus if you compile a scene before running rtrace or \nrpict on it, a regular octree is fine, while, if you want to build up a \nlibrary of octree-objects, you would probably prefer this library to be \nindependent of any other files and thus use frozen octrees. Another \nadvantage of frozen octrees here is that speed.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007492.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
