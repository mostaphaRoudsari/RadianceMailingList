{"body": "Hi,\nFinally I've tried to pipe the rays from rsensor to\nrtcontrib...unfortunately without any luck. I've just installed the HEAD\nagain but this hasn't solved my problem. No errors or messages are\ngenerated, so I don't have any 'feeling' of what might be going wrong...Am I\nmissing something in my command line below?\n\n\nrsensor -vf views/WattStopper.vf sensors/WattStopper_LS-290C.dat . |\nrtcontrib -c 10000 -fo @rtc.opt -e MF:1 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -o\nresults/photosensors/patches/p%d.dat -m sky_glow -w octrees/SBi_Whitesky.oct\n\n\nmy view file is as follows:\nrvu -vtv -vp 10.86 0.84 9.025 -vd 0 -1 0 -vu 0 0 1\n\n\nthe sensorfile is the WattStopper_LS-290, with the exact same data as used\nin SPOT. This file contains 10000 points, why I have added the -c 10000, to\nobtain the average value from the traced rays as output.\n\n\nBest regards,\nAnne in snowy Denmark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007497.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anne Iversen", "created_at": "November 28, 2010 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007271", "id": "radiance-general_007497"}
