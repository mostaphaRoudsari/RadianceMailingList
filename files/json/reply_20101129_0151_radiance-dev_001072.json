Until\nsoftware runs in less time that it takes to press a key it will be\nsignificant.  I package a lot of software and by the time I die I will\nhave spent the equivalent of a whole year waiting for software to compile\nbut that will pale compared to the decade I will have spent debugging\nother people's software.\n\n\nAs I'm building a radiance package I have to rebuild multiple times\nbecause:\n+ The package includes multiple architecture isaexec versions of the key\nexecutables and the complete compile is done for each.\n+ I first have to determine which arches, flags and compiler to use.\n+ I've had to rebuild the whole package many times for the, ahem,\nproblems in radiance (not relocatable \"define DEFMAPFILE\n\\\"/usr/local/lib/ray/lib/arch.map\\\"\", timegm, the ambient bug, version\nstill wrong, examples broken by hdr renaming, issuing different source\ndistributions with the same 4R0 name, etc.)  Each change I make requires\na traceable patch and build, hence full package rebuild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-November/001072.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James Lee", "created_at": "November 29, 2010 at 01:51AM", "created_by": "James_Lee", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001070", "id": "radiance-dev_001072"}
