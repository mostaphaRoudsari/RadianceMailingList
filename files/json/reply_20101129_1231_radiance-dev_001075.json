{"body": "Hi James,\n\n\nThanks for answering my question(s) -- I have updated the src/cv/Rmakefile for the next release.

Guess it was added right after the 4.0 release in response to some difficulties with the MINGW build.  You can pick it up from CVS if you want it, or from HEAD.\n\n\n>>> the ambient bug\n> \n>> Could you be more specific?

As it is, it takes days of my time, and I never get it quite right.  I don't really make new releases for bug fixes -- that's why we have HEAD.  Since this bug has been there for years and years, and only recently manifested due to some change in FreeBSD, I don't think it affects all that many users.  I do apologize for the inconvenience, but the next release probably won't happen until sometime in Spring.\n\n\n>>> version still wrong\n> \n>> ??\n> \n> I see you've fixed this in the new 4R0, I was using an older 4R0.

As you have pointed out, the release process is a bit haphazard.\n\n\n>>> examples broken by hdr renaming\n> \n>> I am sorry about that.

The file \"pinebark.hdr\" picture should be in with the supplementary files in the ray/lib directory:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R0supp.tar.gz\n\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't fix the references in the ray/obj/cabin directory -- sorry about that!  I will fix it for the next release.\n\n\nThanks again for your help!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-November/001075.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 29, 2010 at 12:31PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001070", "id": "radiance-dev_001075"}
