Here is what  \nI found:\n\n\nA full windows directory path does not work specified with either  \nbackslashes or forward slashes. i.e. C:\\boston.epw and C:/boston.epw both  \ncause your error.\n\n\nPutting the simple filename as in the example you show above also causes  \nsuch an error.\n\n\nHowever, there is light at the end of the tunnel! For me, putting a path  \nname such as ./boston.epw works.\nexample: GenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 1 -o -104 -m -105 -r -E -time 0 24 -date  \n1 1 12 31 ./boston.epw > example.cal\n\n\nThis markup is exactly what DIVA uses in its generated batch files;  \nhowever I was not aware that conventional file location inputs would break  \nthe program. Just make sure that your current working directory and the  \nlocation of the epw file are the same.\n\n\nLet us know if you continue to have problems.\n\n\nBest of luck,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 29 Nov 2010 22:23:49 -0500, Kam Shing Leung <citykam at yahoo.com>  \nwrote:\n\n\n> Dear Christoph,\n>\n> Thanks for your quick reply.
