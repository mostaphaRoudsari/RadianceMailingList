As it is, it takes days of my time, and I never get it quite right.  I don't really make new releases for bug fixes -- that's why we have HEAD.  Since this bug has been there for years and years, and only recently manifested due to some change in FreeBSD, I don't think it affects all that many users.  I do apologize for the inconvenience, but the next release probably won't happen until sometime in Spring.\n\n\nBut it should be possible to do most parts of a new release automatically. My\nguess is still that switching to a proper revision control system would make\nthings easier for you - using branches in cvs is a bit insane, but branches\nwould make it easy to prepare a new release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                            Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n http://bzed.de                                http://www.debian.org\n GPG Fingerprint: ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485  DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-November/001076.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "November 30, 2010 at 01:49AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001070", "id": "radiance-dev_001076"}
