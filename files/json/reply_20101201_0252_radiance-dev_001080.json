Which requires somebody who knows at least the basics of\nradiance... If somebody from the radiance community is willing to work on it, I\ncould bring them into contact with some people from Fedora.\n\n\nSince radiance is in Debian and Ubuntu we have more and more installations -\nhere are the popcon stats from Debian for example: http://deb.li/n7tU\n\n\n\n\n> b) Radiance code is not always easy to handle, e.g. since the built\n> process never followed the mainstream.

CMake doesn't support that many\nplatforms and I find it pretty confusing, too. Same for SCons, which is at least\nwritten in Python...\n\n\nIn the debian/rules file I'm using the RMakefiles, but I've patched a lot in\nthem before it was easy to use for building the packages with them. Thanks to\nGreg the patches are applied in CVS these days. Took me some time to figure out\nwhat the best way is to build the packages, but it was not too hard to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> d) There are a number of enhancements that would be very useful to have\n> in Radiance: Algorithmic features that actually extend the work that can\n> be done with Radiance, thoughts on getting the code more modular, built\n> process, test process.

I'm always wondering if we hit\nalignment or endianess or other issues on the various platforms which are\nsupported by Debian.\n\n\n> \n> e) make, dmake, gmake, RCS, GIT, subversion etc. : All nice and cool and\n> useful.

I wouldn't even mind to host it...\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                            Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n http://bzed.de                                http://www.debian.org\n GPG Fingerprint: ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485  DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-December/001080.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bernd Zeimetz", "created_at": "December 01, 2010 at 02:52AM", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001078", "id": "radiance-dev_001080"}
