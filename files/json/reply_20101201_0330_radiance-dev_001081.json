{"body": ">> 5) Checking compile and building for the few supported systems\n(sometimes days of delay and looping back to step 1).\n>\n>If it would be easier to create a new release, you could release a -RC\nversion and wait for feedback. So finding a fast way to create releases\nwould fix that point for large parts. \n\n\nThis is one of the major bugbears I have with Radiance releases. I've\nnever seen a single software package which has only HEAD or major\nreleases available because it just doesn't work as we've seen here.\nReleasing betas and/or release candidates from the HEAD would allow\npeople to test using a known package & would make people a lot more\nlikely to build & test before a release. Also the bake time for betas\nand/or release candidates give you time to fix known issues & the\npressure to make sure everything works for release should be eased by\nthis. The down side is that you'd either need to create a release branch\nfor each release which from what I've heard isn't easy in CVS (I'm used\nto Perforce where everything is easy) or lock HEAD until a release is\nready.\n\n\nIf you're dead set against releasing patches/minor updates such as 4.0.1\netc then betas/release candidates are the only workable solution that I\ncan see.\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher \nSoftware Deployment & IT Administrator\nT: +44 (0) 141 945 8500 \nF: +44 (0) 141 945 8501 \n\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com \n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
