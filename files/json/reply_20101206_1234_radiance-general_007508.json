{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nThe 2009 presentations are available here\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/RadianceWorkshop2009.html.\nMaybe a link can be added (again) from Radiance Online to our site? It\nwould be ideal if somebody copied the 2009 presentations to Radiance\nOnline as our school's website will get reorganized soon.\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007508.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "December 06, 2010 at 12:34PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007506", "id": "radiance-general_007508"}
