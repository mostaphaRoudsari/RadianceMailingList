{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nWe haven't received copies of the 2010 slides Jan as yet, and the 2009 workshop isn't linked, but you can find the presentations here:\n\n\n\thttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/RadianceWorkshop2009.html\n\n\nI see Christoph responded as well, so I'm sure he added this.  We should have a link to it, and I'll make sure we do when we get the 2010 presentations up.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007509.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 06, 2010 at 12:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007506", "id": "radiance-general_007509"}
