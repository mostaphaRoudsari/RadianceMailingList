{"body": "Evening John.\n\n\nI think bin 0 was \"reserved\" for the ground. Therefore, if you don't have a\nground material, it would be black. In my own tests I also found other bins\nto be completely black but I was told that was because of my primitive test\ngeometry. Doing Axel's tutorial test room seemed to work for me at the time.\nI could reproduce the results he got with similar accuracy.\n\n\nAbout pcomb: It may take quite a long time to process all the images. You\ncan try and split the one long pcomb command into a few smaller pcombs and\nthen combine the resulting images. If you suspect a single image to be\ncorrupt just exclude that from the process and see if the pcomb command\nfinishes.\n\n\nIf you are familiar with bash scripting you can run a first loop and combine\neach images separately with a known good image. This should at least show\nyou if there are images that pcomb can't handle.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007526.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 09, 2010 at 08:12PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007523", "id": "radiance-general_007526"}
