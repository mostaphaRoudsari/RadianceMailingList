{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nThe \"recno\" variable should work in rcalc, if that's what you're talking about.  I use it all the time.  The Finder isn't very bright when it comes to HDR images -- long headers may confuse it.\n\n\nUse the new dctimestep rather than pcomb to combine images.  If you don't have the new version of dctimestep, use the -h option to pcomb to avoid ridiculous header lengths.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007528.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 09, 2010 at 11:24PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007523", "id": "radiance-general_007528"}
