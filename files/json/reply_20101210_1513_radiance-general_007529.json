{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nI find that completely black hdr images consistently crash preview.  It will also crash finder if you use finder in one of the modes that show a preview of the image like cover flow or the columns. \n\n\nAlso, I've never been able to get Axel's command for random color images to work on a mac the way it is written in the tutorial.  When I try it rcalc waits patiently for input that doesn't exist.  But you can't add -n because then recno is invalid.  If you give it simple input using cnt (ie. cnt 1 | rcalc ) it doesn't work because all the values are seeded with the same number (recno is 1 every time).  Instead I used the $RANDOM variable to seed rcalc's rand function like so:\n\n\npcomb $(for i in {000..145}; do \\\n\t\techo \"-c $(echo $RANDOM | rcalc -e '$1=rand($1);$2=rand($1+.3);$3=rand($1+.7)') \\\n\t\timages/patches/p$(printf \"%03d\" $i).hdr\"; done)>  images/sky_colourcomb.hdr  \n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly this solution is not elegant.  If it's elegance we're after we could use the new capability in dctimestep (which wasn't available when Axel wrote his tutorial):\ncnt 145 | rcalc -e '$1=rand(recno);$2=rand(recno+.3);$3=rand(recno+.7)' | dctimestep images/patches/p%03d.hdr >  images/sky_colourcomb.hdr  \n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nOn Dec 9, 2010, at 11:24 PM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007529.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "December 10, 2010 at 03:13PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007523", "id": "radiance-general_007529"}
