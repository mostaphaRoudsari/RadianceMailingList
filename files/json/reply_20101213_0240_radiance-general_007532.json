{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nI have never heard about a case where ambient data became critical \nmemory-wise... Why do you think that there is a problem with memory in \nyour case? How much memory does the rpict process occupy?\n\n\nIf you have a lot of detail geometry that does not contribute \nsignificantly to the diffuse-indirect illumination of your scene, you \ncan use the ambient exclude parameters of rpict/rtrace (-ae and -aE).\n\n\nIf you use too many instances, or if you create them in a wrong way, \nthey will slow down the rendering. Each time a ray hits an instance \n(passes the bounding cube it fits into), it has to check for collisions \nwith any surface inside that instance. So if you have a lot of \noverlapping instances with little geometry contained in each, or \ninstances with a bad ration of width/length/height, a lot of unnecessary \nintersection checks will happen. Instances improve memory efficiency at \nthe cost of rendering time. It is important to balance the two. So only \npack compact, high-res geometry into instances.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007532.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
