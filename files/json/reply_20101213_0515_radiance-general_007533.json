{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nWhen a Radiance job is running (rpict, rtrace, rvu, etc) the whole scene \n(octree) is indeed in memory. It is not being loaded from disk as \nneeded. Depending on how your model is made and with what level of \ndetail this can get very big. Where possible and convenient in makes \nsense to try to put your scenes together in a thoughtful manner. On the \nother hand scene complexity/size does not necessarily mean longer \nsimulation times (eg, complex exterior scene under sun/sky only lighting).\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007533.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 13, 2010 at 05:15AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007488", "id": "radiance-general_007533"}
