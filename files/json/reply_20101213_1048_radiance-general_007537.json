Do not create an IES file if you do not need to.... it is \neasier to directly create a Radiance dat-file from the plot. There are \nuseful tools to extract data from plots, which let you define the axis \nlocations and units and then translates your mouse clicks on the graph \nto a data table. Especially if you have a symmetric distribution, it is \nnot too much work to make this a useful Radiance dat-file.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007537.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
