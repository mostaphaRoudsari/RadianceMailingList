{"body": "Hi Fran\u00e7ois,\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way to change the way the glaze script works regarding its requirement that one surface be uncoated glass.\n\n\nThe trouble is one of combinatorics.  Unless we incorporate a database containing all the possible front and back coating combinations, or a model like Optics has for computing the combined effect, we can't produce the correct output.  What we really need is a more general glazing modeler that can account for every possible configuration and produces a reliable Radiance material.  Maybe Window6 will provide this at some point, but we aren't there, yet.\n\n\nAs you suggest, it would be nice to have at least the ability to give a single-pane glazing as part of a dual-paned system as something precomputed by Optics, but I don't think you can just substitute values in the database and get it to work.  You'd have to reprogram the script a bit, and that's not a very inviting prospect....\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 14, 2010 at 04:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007544", "id": "radiance-general_007546"}
