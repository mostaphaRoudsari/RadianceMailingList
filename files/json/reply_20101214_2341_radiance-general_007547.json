I\nresolved it by commenting out these three lines near the top of the file\npersist.c:\n\n\ntypedef void (sighandler_t)(int);\nstatic sighandler_t sig_io;\nstatic sighandler_t sig_alrm;\n\n\nI should warn you that I didn't look into the problem too deeply, so\nthat may or may not be the best solution!\n\n\nDoing exactly \u201cas I was told\u201d I arrived at error free compilation, and I have had no problems running RADIANCE programs since.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg at 01CB9C33.4B597490]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007547.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "December 14, 2010 at 11:41PM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007545", "id": "radiance-general_007547"}
