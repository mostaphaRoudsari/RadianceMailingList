I have to boot into \na Windows installation (and Windows does not easily boot in virtual \nmachines any more since Vista) each time I want to start one of these \ntools, which even require administrator rights to install on a Windows \nmachine. Unfortunately it looks as no attempt had been made at all \nduring development to separate the database, calculation and \nGUI/controller code, so I do not expect these tools to become more open \nor platform independent. So did you ever come accross any development in \nthese fields?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007548.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
