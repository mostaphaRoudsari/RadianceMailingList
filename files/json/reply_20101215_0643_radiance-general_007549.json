{"body": "Dear Lars\n\n\none tool that may possibly be a bit more open is WIS. In any case, off and\non there is an error message from a \"solver\".

I have to boot into \n a Windows installation (and Windows does not easily boot in virtual \n machines any more since Vista) each time I want to start one of these \n tools, which even require administrator rights to install on a Windows \n machine. Unfortunately it looks as no attempt had been made at all \n during development to separate the database, calculation and \n GUI/controller code, so I do not expect these tools to become more open \n or platform independent. So did you ever come accross any development in \n these fields?\n\n\n Cheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n _______________________________________________\n Radiance-general mailing list\n Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n(mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\" class=\"autolink)\n http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n(http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\"\ntarget=\"_blank\" class=\"autolink)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007549.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "December 15, 2010 at 06:43AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007544", "id": "radiance-general_007549"}
