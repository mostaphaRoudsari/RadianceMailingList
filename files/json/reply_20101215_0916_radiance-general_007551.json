{"body": "Mehmedalp\n\n\nSince we're a bit out of ideas here could you post the output of the getinfo\ncommand for both pictures. That might help us understand what happened to\nthe images.\n\n\nAfter reading your initial email again I found one other possible reason:\n\n\nwxfalsecolor ignores pixels with red value of 0. Due to the limitations of\nthe RGBE image format a value of 0 in one channel means a black pixel. In\nreal live black pixels do not exist and are therefore ignored when an\naverage is calculated. This was done to allow a rectangular selection over a\nmasked image area without the mask contributing to the average.\n\n\nYou can see if a pixel contributes by moving the mouse over the image after\nyou have loaded the data (happens automatically for small images). If you\nsee an r,g,b value next to pixel position in the status bar the pixel does\ncount. If it's a black pixel it will show only the position.\n\n\nSo if your averaged area contains black regions these regions will be\nignored by wxfalsecolor but will count as 0 in ximage or Photosphere. This\nmight account for wxfalsecolor reporting a larger value than Photosphere.\n\n\n\n\nI really should document these things someday ...\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007551.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 15, 2010 at 09:16AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007530", "id": "radiance-general_007551"}
