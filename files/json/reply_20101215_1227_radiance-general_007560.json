The hardware itself is very powerful.\nI'm working on printing HDR data, so this lets me cross reference with the original radiance data. Yay.\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007560.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jelle Feringa", "created_at": "December 15, 2010 at 12:27PM", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007559", "id": "radiance-general_007560"}
