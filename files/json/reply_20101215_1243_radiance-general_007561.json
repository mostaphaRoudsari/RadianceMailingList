{"body": "Hi Jelle,\n\n\nIf you are using another system with different RGB primaries than Radiance, you should make sure you are using those in your conversion.  This probably means you want to alter your command a bit:\n\n\n\tximage -ov input.hdr | rcalc -f xyz_rgb.cal -e 'CIE_pri(i)=CIE_709(i)' -e '$1=179*X($1,$2,$3);$2=179*Y($1,$2,$3);$3=179*Z($1,$2,$3)'\n\n\nThere are a few different primaries to choose from in xyz_rgb.cal -- the default ones are the Radiance primaries, which differ slightly from the CCIR-709 (sRGB) primaries I've specified above.  You can also enter your own primaries if you know them.  Just follow the example in the xyz_rgb.cal file.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007561.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2010 at 12:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007559", "id": "radiance-general_007561"}
