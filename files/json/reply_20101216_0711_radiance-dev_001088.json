{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\nIt is a bit difficult to sort through.  Search for the following line:\n\n\n\tiscontb = if(btwn(0,v,1),btwn(.4,frac(ndivs*v),.6),-1);\n\n\nChanging the 0.4 and 0.6 values will affect the width of the bands.  These fractions are relative to the spacing of band values.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-December/001088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 16, 2010 at 07:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001087", "id": "radiance-dev_001088"}
