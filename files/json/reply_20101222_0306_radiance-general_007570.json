I have no idea why, but the data comes as \na MS Access database file. It is possible to open such files using \nvarious open source tools, e.g. I managed to load it into Openoffice. \nThe database contains one table called GlazingProperties which is \nprobably the one to look for.\n\n\nActually I wonder whether one should hint the developers at migrating \nthat database to some SQL. That would not only make it possible to \nconnect other tools easily, but also would allow the maintainers to \nupdate records of their database without redistributing the whole huge \ndownload. That is actually what network connectivity of databases was \nmade for.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007570.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
