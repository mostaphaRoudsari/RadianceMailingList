{"body": "Hi Lars, \n\n\nSorry again for late answer.\n\n\nI think it is a memory problem because I monitored it with top and memory is quickly reducing and as soon as it goes under 100 MB or so (when it probably starts swapping to the HD) processors use drops to 0.something %. I've got 8 GB memory and ambient files are big up to 1.5 GB (very high settings). In the worst case the octree is 600 MB.\n\n\nUnfortunately the detail is all in a shading device (it is actually a transmittance study) so, no chance for using ambient exclude. And there are no overlapping geometries in the single instances and the instances replication is done by xform using the bounding box for spacing. Also care has been taken in taking away vertical faces at the boundaries to avoid overlapping surfaces. \n\n\nSo what I understand from this is that if rpict loads ambient files in memory as well as octrees, in the worst case I will have for each rpict calculation 1.5 + 0.5 + some work memory in use (I don't know how to quantify this). As I cannot run more than 2 processes, the work memory is probably bigger than  [7.5(available ram  memory) / 3 (max processes before it runs out of memory)] -[1.5+0.5] = 0.5 GB, which makes sense to me. \n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nAs Jack was saying I should have organized the model better, but still is good to understand what happened for future use.\n\n\nThanks for all your help and Merry Christmas to you both and to all the radiance community :-)\n\n\nLucio Boscolo Mezzopan\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007572.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lucio Boscolo", "created_at": "December 23, 2010 at 04:18AM", "created_by": "Lucio_Boscolo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007488", "id": "radiance-general_007572"}
