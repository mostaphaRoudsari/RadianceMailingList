{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nIf you are executing in parallel on a shared memory machine, are you using the -PP option to rtrace (or rpict)?  This can help to reduce memory, especially on jobs where you are loading in a substantial ambient file to start.\n\n\nAnother approach is to abandon ambient caching entirely, which makes sense in scenes where you have a lot of important detail, but what's most important about it is the aggregate behavior.  I think your problem falls into that category.  Unfortunately, whatever -a* settings you have worked out will have to be rethought when you do this.  I should have a good guide for how to set these parameters, but you basically start by setting -aa 0, at which point -af, -ar, and -aw settings become irrelevant (no caching), and the -ad and -as settings should be changed.  You also should look at the -lw and -lr settings, because they will have a strong influence over how deep the ray tree is explored.\n\n\nAxel Jacobs offers a brief treatment of these settings on page 12 of his rtcontrib tutorial, currently linked at:\n\n\n\thttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf\n\n\nIt's probably worth a try.  I use -aa 0 routinely when modeling blind systems in mkillum, for example.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007573.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 23, 2010 at 09:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007488", "id": "radiance-general_007573"}
