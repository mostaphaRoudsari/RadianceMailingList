{"body": "Hi Milan\n\n\ndepending on your slat geometry be aware that practically no real-world venetian (slat type) blind closes \"90\u00b0\". Actually, quite typical products have a closing angle of approx. 75\u00b0 at the most. And this leads to additional light transmission in the closed position, of course (for light colors, in any case).\n\n\n> write it. Thank you anyway. But, how can I use mkillum surface on the inner side\n> of the blinds? I checked, when the blinds is down (angle=-90) the surface normal\n> of slats points into the office.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007581.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "December 29, 2010 at 02:36AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007574", "id": "radiance-general_007581"}
