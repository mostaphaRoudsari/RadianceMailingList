I have done some preliminary calculations, and when I\nuse rtrace with -ab 8 (for more accuracy), calculation takes a long time (4 - 5\nmin). If I want to calculate illumination for few more points, I will increase\nthe calculation time for few times. For now, I will just avoid situations when\ndirect sunlight passing between the slats.\n\n\n> This is just a general representation of the angular dependent\n> transmission/reflection of the glazing.

I did not know that, how you say,\nsome of the angular dependence is accounted for in the material primitive\n\"glass\". I can live with \"It's not very accurate\".\n\n\n> If you use mkillum you have to replace the window material with the\n> definition created by mkillum.
