{"body": "Hi Marija,\n\n\n> To render illuminance on a work plane, no need to input additional desk\n> geometry into the scene.

I do not plan to add a furniture.\n\n\n> You can define sensor point on the workplane area.\n\n\nMy first plan was to define a few sensor points, but when I use rtrace with -ab\n6 or 8 (for more accuracy), calculation takes a long time. For now, I will\ndefine just one sensor point.\n\n\n> Then for created octree and these set of points (save points in some file),\n> you use rtrace -I option to calculate illuminance.\n> Here is example command\n> rtrace -I+ -h- -oov -ab 3 -ad 2048 -as 512 -aa 0.05 -av 0 0 0 -ar 100\n> room.oct < sensors.txt | rcalc -e \"$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=$3;\n> $4=(0.67*$4+0.265*$5+0.065*$6)*179\"  >illuminance.txt\n> So rtrace command above calculates irradiance for sensor points defined in\n> \"sensors.txt\". Then you pipe it to rcalc to convert it to illuminance.\n> You have similar method in dayfact.csh script (included in Radiance\n> distribution), so you can explore it.\n\n\nEverything you've written here is useful, and I think it will help me.\n\n\nI am from Serbia. Where are you from? Because of your name and surname, I guess\nthat you are from Serbia, B&H or Croatia.\nIf I am right,\n   then Hvala i pozdrav,\nif I wrong,\n   then Thanks and regards.\n\n\nMilan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007584.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Milan Cakanovic", "created_at": "December 29, 2010 at 07:23AM", "created_by": "Milan_Cakanovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007574", "id": "radiance-general_007584"}
