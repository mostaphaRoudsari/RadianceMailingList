In that case, I can use\nthe glass surface as an mkillum input, and no need for any intervention on\nblinds (I leave them as they are). Is this OK?\n\n\nCheers,  Milan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007587.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Milan Cakanovic", "created_at": "December 29, 2010 at 11:53AM", "created_by": "Milan_Cakanovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007574", "id": "radiance-general_007587"}
