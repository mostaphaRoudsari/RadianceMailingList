Plus: if most ambient bounces are expected to happen in between diffuse blinds, you need the high setting of -ab only for mkillum. When running rtrace, you can probably stay at ab set to about 2, and that means you can follow previous advices to calculate irradiance for more then one point.\n\n\nBy the way, you are looking at diffuse reflective blinds, right?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007588.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
