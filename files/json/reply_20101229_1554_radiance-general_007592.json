{"body": "Hi Lars!\n\n\n> Perfect.

But, when you say \"high\nsetting of -ab\", what is high? Is that maybe -ab 8, or maybe more?\n\n\n> When running rtrace, you can probably stay at ab set to about 2, and that means\n> you can follow previous advices to calculate irradiance for more then one point\n\n\nI will do that.\n\n\n> By the way, you are looking at diffuse reflective blinds, right?\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nCheers, Milan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007592.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Milan Cakanovic", "created_at": "December 29, 2010 at 03:54PM", "created_by": "Milan_Cakanovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007574", "id": "radiance-general_007592"}
