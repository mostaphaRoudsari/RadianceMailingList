{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nI am also a little puzzled by your results.  As Thomas mentioned, glow surfaces are included in the indirect calculation, so unless you specified a positive radius value for your glow materials, they should not light your scene at all with -ab 0.  The complexities of your command line are mostly unnecessary.  You should be able to simplify it to:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -x $XRES -y $YRES -vf $NAME.vp \\\n|rtrace -h -fff -opN $NAME.oct \\\n|rtrace -ffc -x $XRES -y $YRES -I -ab 1 -aa 0.1 -ad 4096 -ar 0 $NAME.oct > $NAME.irradiance.hdr\n\n\nRays with zero normals will be evaluated as (0 0 0) by the second rtrace, and an epsilon is always added to the origin in the direction of the normal when using the -I option, so your rcalc command, while clever, is unnecessary.  I changed your -ab to 1 and got rid of the other unnecessary options.  I set -ar to 0, since you seem to want a very high resolution result.  I added -aa 0.1 for the same reason.\n\n\nIf you are still getting this peculiar noise pattern after these changes, please post your scene description and I'll have a look at it.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Regarding mailing list policy on attachments.  In general, I prefer that people not attach large files to e-mails, and people have been very good about this, posting larger images on websites, instead.  Small JPEGs (less than 100K or so) are acceptable; likewise small text attachments are OK.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007595.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 30, 2010 at 03:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007589", "id": "radiance-general_007595"}
