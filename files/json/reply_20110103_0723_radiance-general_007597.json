{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nI think if you want to get a smoother result from your ground plane you \nwill need to be more careful about how it is constructed. Direct \nsampling (subdivision of the source) occurs relative to the \"center\" of \nthe ground plane geometry, which is why you may not be seeing what you \nexpect. Additionally if the center of a ground plane object is \"under\" \none of the buildings this will contribute to some of the effects that \nyou are seeing. As a test I would consider constructing the ground plane \nof multiple polygons (probably should be quads) where the edge of a \ngiven polygon meets the edge of a building side at the \"ground.\"\n\n\nI think that another thing to add into your command line is to set \ndirect jitter (-dj). I think you could start out with with -dj .7 and \nsee what happens.\n\n\nI would try reconstructing your ground plane first and then run as is \nwith your original command line, then you can try setting -dj to further \nadjust things.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007597.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 03, 2011 at 07:23AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007589", "id": "radiance-general_007597"}
