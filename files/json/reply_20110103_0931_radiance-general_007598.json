{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nAt least this explains most of your artifacts.  The direct calculation really doesn't work very well for abutting surfaces, so you are better off using zero radii on your glow materials.  How are you even seeing a pattern, though?  Glow materials don't reflect light.  I thought you had some glow materials and some regular ones.  Are you using a mixture between a glow material and a diffuse material?  I could then understand your results.\n\n\nIf you use -ab 1 and zero radii for your glow materials, then your results should be much improved.  You don't need to break up your ground plane.  I don't think you will ever be satisfied with the output, otherwise.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007598.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 03, 2011 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007589", "id": "radiance-general_007598"}
