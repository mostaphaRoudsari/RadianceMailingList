{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nRemoved -ds 0.02, replaced radius 100 with 0 in the glow materials (there are only pure glow materials in the scene, no mixtures, no diffuse), re-ran rendering (but kept 10 by 10 genbox tiled groundplane ... frankly I forgot to comment back in the old single large genbox groundplane). Rendering done in about 25 minutes on my 4 year old core duo laptop.\n\n\nBingo.jpg shows results ... just the way I always mentally pictured that it would/should.\n\n\nThanks. Also to Andy for providing an explanation on the subdivision.\n\n\nThis is so great 'cause now I can get on with what I needed the irradiances for ... I can hardly wait :)\n\n\nIn addition to being just what I was needing (and essentially have been needing since August 2010 but have been too busy to pursue) these renderings actually have a very pleasing aesthetic side to them.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007600.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "January 03, 2011 at 12:29PM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007589", "id": "radiance-general_007600"}
