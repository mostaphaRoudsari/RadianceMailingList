{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThanks for pointing out this error.  The falsecolor C-shell script was replaced with a Perl script written by Axel Jacobs, and I guess this particular option wasn't tested.  There was a set of single-quotes that needed to be double-quotes, which I have fixed and checked in this morning.  It should appear in tomorrow's HEAD.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007602.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 04, 2011 at 09:02AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007601", "id": "radiance-general_007602"}
