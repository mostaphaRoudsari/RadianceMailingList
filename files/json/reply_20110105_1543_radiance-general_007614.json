(And \nit's not documented in the general case, only for text files.)  This \nwill produce an a4-size page, though.  Preview will stretch and squash \nit for printing.\n\n\nI think the following command is an improvement on all three methods.  \nIt creates the typeset document correctly and does not require a change \nto system files.\n\n\n> groff -Tps -mandoc -c -dpaper=letter -P-pletter `man -w rtcontrib` | \n> open -f -a Preview\n\n\nWish this stuff just worked.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nBack to the bit mines...\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007614.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
