If sunlight is getting through the blinds, we're doing \nit wrong, so I think I'll try rtcontrib, though I probably need to \nconsult with the rest of my team first.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007617.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
