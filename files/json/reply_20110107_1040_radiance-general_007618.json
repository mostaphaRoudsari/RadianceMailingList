{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you so much for your detailed answer (and sorry for being late again exploring it). \n\n\n-aa method is a good one, but I am a little concerned this will impact a lot on rendering time in a scene like mine in which many ab are required and a very high number of rays (it is a comparison between shading systems to work out transmittances).\n\n\nThe -PP option seems to be what I need, but I am not sure I understand it. Please tell me if the following is correct.\n\n\nI start an rpict (or rtrace) with a -PP namefile option.\n\n\nI start other rpict or rtrace wit -PP namefile (the same) and they will share memory (ram?)\n\n\nAmbient file instead will be shared by using -af and the same ambient file for all the processes.\n\n\nIs this correct?\n\n\nI believe -S is not needed with the -PP option, am I right?\n\n\nCan I share with -PP between rpict and rtrace processes?\n\n\nThank you for your help, one of my colleagues run into the same issue today, so it would be very good if we manage to solve this! \n\n\nHave a nice day!!!\n\n\nLucio \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007618.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lucio Boscolo", "created_at": "January 07, 2011 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "Lucio_Boscolo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007488", "id": "radiance-general_007618"}
