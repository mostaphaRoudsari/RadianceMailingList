{"body": "Hi Lucio,\n\n\nThis is somewhat confusing. -PP enables multiple process on the same \nmachine to share memory. What is shared is memory space taken up by the \noctree. Ambient values are shared via the ambient file (-af), so they \nare not shared in RAM between processes (eg there is not a message \npassing mechanism for communicating back and forth between processes). \nAt given points processes will write out the ambient data that has been \ncalculated (by the given process) and held in memory to the ambient \nfile. As processes do this they also read in the ambient values from the \nfile (hope I get this right), so this is the method of sharing ambient \nterms.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\nOn 1/10/2011 10:06 AM, Lucio Boscolo wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007623.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 10, 2011 at 07:44AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007488", "id": "radiance-general_007623"}
