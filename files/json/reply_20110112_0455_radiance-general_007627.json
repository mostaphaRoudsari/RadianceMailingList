{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nyou can use pfilt to do that. The -x and -y parameters allow to set a \ntarget resolution. Many use them like -x /2 -y /2 to downsample, but you \ncan also do the opposite by setting -x /.5 -y /.5 and achieve upsampling.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007627.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
