{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThanks! That was also my immediate idea ... then I read the man-page and saw that when using -x xres, xres has to be less than or equal to the target device. And when I read that I was reading it too quickly and simply \"reading\" (or getting the understanding) that xres needs to be less than or equal to the input resolution.\n\n\nSorry. One can say I was not reading what was written, but rather what I was fearing to read.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007628.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "January 12, 2011 at 05:24AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007626", "id": "radiance-general_007628"}
