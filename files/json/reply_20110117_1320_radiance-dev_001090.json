{"body": "Hi Bruce,\n\n\nThere is the parallel rendering chapter in \"Rendering with Radiance,\" and the following short write-up:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/parallel.html\n\n\nAs with most of the rest of Radiance, add-on libraries are avoided, so no OpenMP, MPI, etc. is used.  Also, making ray-tracing work with SIMD is notoriously difficult, so parallelization is course-grained.\n\n\nI can e-mail you the parallel rendering chapter if you don't have the book.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-January/001090.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 17, 2011 at 01:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001089", "id": "radiance-dev_001090"}
