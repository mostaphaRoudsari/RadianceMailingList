{"body": "Claus.\n\n\nI just downloaded your file and opened it in SketchUp. I had to update\nto the newest version of SU (released last week) but I think that's the\nsame version you have.\n\n\nI then installed su2rad from a fresh download from the project site.\nHowever, I had no problems exporting the scene in any mode.\n\n\nThe import from 3DMax creates a SketchUp component which\ncontains another component with the geometry (12 triangles).\nsu2rad can handle this structure.\n\n\nI have checked the code again and I don't know why it would\ntry to replace the component with an IES file. This should only\nhappen if the component is created from a *.skp file and a *.ies\nfile with the same name exists next to *.skp file.\n\n\nTo debug this please open the Ruby console window in SketchUp\nand type:\n\n\n$SU2RAD_LOGLEVEL = 4\n\n\nThen start the su2rad export function. You should see a number\nof messages printed to the Ruby console. If the export finishes\nwithout error it should also create a log file of the export in the\n\"logfiles\" directory. If you can send me the text from the console\nor the file I might be able to see what's going on on your machine.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007638.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 17, 2011 at 02:34PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007635", "id": "radiance-general_007638"}
