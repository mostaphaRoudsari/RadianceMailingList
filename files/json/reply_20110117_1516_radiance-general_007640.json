{"body": "Thanks Claus.\n\n\nI think I understand now what's going on\n\n\n2011/1/17 Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk>:\n> I open Ruby console, set LOGLEVEL and ran export.\n> Here's the output (dunno if it matters but apparently there\n> is some complaint about a convert.exe not being found):\n\n\nNot an issue here. \"convert.exe\" is used to convert textures\nto tiffs which can then be converted to *.hdr files for Radiance.\nIf you don't have it you can't export textures, that's all.\n\n\nNow on to the log:\n[...]\n> [I] OBJECTS:\n> [I] RadComponent: '' [def='skp2C40']\n> [V] ies data file 'C:/Users/cbm/AppData/Local/Temp/skp2C40.tmp' found\n> [V] replacement file 'C:/Users/cbm/AppData/Local/Temp/skp2C40.tmp' found\n\n\nOk. The only top level entity in your scene is the component \"skp2c40\".\nThis component is created via export to a file \"skp2C40.tmp\" and then\nloaded into your current file. su2rad tries to find an *.ies file by\nsubstituting a \".ies\" extension for a \".skp\" extension. However, since\nthe file doesn't end with \".skp\" nothing is substituted and the path to\n\"skp2C40.tmp\" is returned as IES path. Therefore no geometry is created\nand the whole export is replaced with an ies2rad command.\n\n\nTemporary fix for now: delete the file\n'C:/Users/cbm/AppData/Local/Temp/skp2C40.tmp' and any other skp*.tmp\nfiles you might find there.\n\n\nI can send you a file with a fix for su2rad later.\n\n\n> [E] No such file or directory - C:/Users/cbm/Desktop/3dstoskpimport/radiance/objects\n\n\nHere is the real problem of the export: Because there is no geometry\nthere is also no \"objects\" directory. The script tries to list it's contents\nand crashes. Another thing I need to change.\n\n\nIf you can get rid of the wrong IES replacement above this should not\nbe an issue any more.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007640.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 17, 2011 at 03:16PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007635", "id": "radiance-general_007640"}
