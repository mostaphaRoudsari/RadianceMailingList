{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThe calculation of the coefficients for red green and blue conversion to luminance (Y) is spelled out in src/common/color.h.  The math is a little bit complicated, and I admit that I do not fully understand its relationship to the geometry of the CIE horseshoe diagram, so I'm not sure I can resolve your conundrum.  I know you have to account for the white point, which in the case of the Radiance color space is set to neutral gray (x,y)=(1/3,1/3).  It looks like the CIE formulas, which I copied out of a text somewhere, apply ratios of cross products, but I really have no idea why.\n\n\nI'm sorry I can't be of more help.  If I knew of a text that explained this intuitively, I would refer you (and myself) to it....\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007644.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 18, 2011 at 07:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007634", "id": "radiance-general_007644"}
