You need shadows to see the shape of objects.\n\n\nYou seem to be new to Radiance so I am speculating a bit about your\nproblem: Your rendered an image but everything that is not in direct\n(sun)light is totally black?\n\n\nIf this is the case you have to add the option \"-ab 2\" to your rpict\ncommand line to calculate the light in areas that only receive\nreflected light. Depending on your scene you should increase the \"-ab\n2\" to \"-ab 5\" or \"-ab 6\" to capture the ambient light more accurately.\nHowever, I assume that you also need to set other parameters to\nimprove the quality of your rendering/calculation.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007647.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 20, 2011 at 07:00AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007645", "id": "radiance-general_007647"}
