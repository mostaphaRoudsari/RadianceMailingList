{"body": "Brajesh.\n\n\nBefore I go into too much detail about a scripted solution please\nconfirm the following:\n\n\nYou have a static scene and want to show this scene under different\nlighting conditions; specifically you want to show changes of the\nlight (sun?) direction.\n\n\nIf you only want one directional light source (sun but no sky) you can\nmodify a typical sky description as created by gensky. For example,\nthe following gensky command creates a sun 45 degrees east of south\nand 45 degrees zenith elevation:\n\n\ngensky -ang 45 -45 +s\n\n\nThe corresponding Radiance description looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n# --- begin sky description ----\n# gensky -ang 45 -45 +s\n# Ground ambient level: 14.8\n\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 6.77e+06 6.77e+06 6.77e+06\n\n\nsolar source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107 0.5\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n2 skybr skybright.cal\n0\n7 1 9.56e+00 2.12e+01 5.71e-01 0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107\n# --- end sky description ---\n\n\nThe line \"4 0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107 0.5\" has as the 2nd, 3rd and\n4th argument the sun direction as x,y,z vector.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a set of image with changing sun direction you have to\n\n\n1) replace the (x,y,z) vector in the sky definition with one of your\nlight vectors\n2) create a new scene octree from the sky definition and the scene geometry\n3) render the image\n4) give the new image a recognisable name (\"img_x_y_z.hdr\")\n5) rinse and repeat\n\n\nDepending on your computer environment and your scripting skills you\nhave a number of choices to accomplish this in detail. If you need\nmore information please provide more details about your situation,\nknowledge and operating system.\n\n\nPlease note that the above modification will not create a complete sky\ndefinition. If you want to simulate the effect of natural light (sun\nand sky) then you should not modify the sky description file directly.\nThis modification will also not take into account the change of\nsunlight intensity during the day.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 20, 2011 at 3:35 AM, Brajesh Lal <brajeshlal at yahoo.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007648.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 20, 2011 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007646", "id": "radiance-general_007648"}
