{"body": "Hi Thomas,\nSorry for ambiguity. I need shadow pixel ids of the scene.\nI am wondering if i can disable or enable the shadow casting feature of a \nparticular object or scene ( like any other 3D packages). Then i can \nhave rendered image with and without shadow. Their difference can give me shadow \npixels. \nOr\nIf i can render the scene with some constant background color, then i can read \nthe shadows pixel ids (low pixel value) in matlab.\n\n\nmy scene has only diffuse objects  ( diffuse reflectance can be of any value, no \nblack object) and a single direct light.   \n\n\n Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007649.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brajesh Lal", "created_at": "January 20, 2011 at 07:39AM", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007645", "id": "radiance-general_007649"}
