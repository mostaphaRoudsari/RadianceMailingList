{"body": "Another option is to use rtcontrib to separate light source contributions.  Something like:\n\n\n\tvwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf view.vf \\\n\t\t| rtcontrib -ffc `vwrays -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf view.vf -d` -ab 0 -dj 0 -ds 0 -o shad_%s.hdr -m src1mat -m src2mat -m src3mat input.oct\n\n\nThe id's \"src1mat,\" \"src2mat\" and \"src3mat\" must correspond to different materials for different sources in the octree.  Each will produce a separate output file from rtcontrib, \"shad_src1mat.hdr,\" \"shad_src2mat.hdr,\" and \"shad_src3mat.hdr\".  If you have many sources, you can put the different material names into a single file and use the -M option to load it. \n\n\nAfterwards, you can use Thomas' trick of thresholding the results to determine what is in shadow from what is not.  The \"-dj 0 -ds 0\" options make all the sources act as points, but if you want penumbras to show up in the output, you can remove these options.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007651.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 20, 2011 at 12:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007645", "id": "radiance-general_007651"}
