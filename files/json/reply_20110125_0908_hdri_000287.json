{"body": "Hi Jason,\n\n\nI assume you are assembling your images using Photosphere or hdrcvt.\nUnless the single exposure that doesn't over-expose the light\nsource(s) has values very close to the maximum (255), you should be OK\nas far as accuracy.\n\n\nThe best accuracy is achieved using RAW shots and the raw2hdr Perl\nscript that calls hdrgen, dcraw, and exiftool.  This process avoids\nthe issue of camera response by going straight from the linear CCD or\nCMOS sensor values.  This makes more of a difference to color accuracy\nthan luminance, but it's worth pursuing if accuracy is your goal.  If\nyou're interested in this under Mac OS X, I can post a package for\nyou.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 25, 2011 at 8:20 AM, jason huang <jasonhuang1115 at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000287.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000287"}
