{"body": "Indeed. If by non-saturated you refer to every single channel.\nWith the sun, for example, it happens quite often that the Luminance histogram indicates you're good, but when you look at the red channel that still clips.\n\n\nHowever, there are other problems with environments that have primarily small concentrated light sources.\n- Most alignments fail for the most under-exposed images. Well, you shoot your pano on a tripod anyway.\n- You need to be very careful editing the HDRs, even a resize with the wrong filter can cause color fringes. Stick to Bilinear to be safe.\n- IBL needs sampling settings beyond insane.\nUltimately, these concentrated light sources are perfect examples of direct illumination sources. Brute-forcing this through a GI render pipeline makes little sense. It's much more efficient to represent these concentrated light sources with actual 3d lights, and in turn limiting the DR in the environment map. Also gives you more artistic control over shadows. Some people like to paint out direct light sources completely, but I prefer blurring them out with the rest of the environment to keep some ambient contribution (think hazy spill light).\n\n\nHope this helps,\nBlochi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan 25, 2011, at 8:20 AM, jason huang wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000288.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Bloch", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 10:47AM", "created_by": "Christian_Bloch", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000288"}
