Mksource samples\nan HDR environment map and creates direct Radiance light sources to\nrepresent bright concentrated regions found in the map, moving much of the\nflux to the direct calculation -- more efficient and less artifacts.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000289.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 10:58AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000289"}
