{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI'd add that when you have point sources, usually the main factor affecting accuracy is lens flare (especially with the sun) and/or \"bleeding\" of the source in the background. I don't know of any way to avoid this, as it happens as soon as the light enters the camera. With a separate measurement to calibrate image values this can be compensated to some extent. In some cases an illuminance measurement can be useful if it is not possible to measure the source luminance directly.\n\n\nCheers,\nSantiago\n\n\nPS:  Greg, you mention raw2hdr as a Perl script, but what I found is csh, is there a different version?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000290.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 11:25AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000290"}
