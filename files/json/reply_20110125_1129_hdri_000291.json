{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nThis thread is getting interesting to me as well. I was not aware of the mksource tool. Any chance I can find some documentation about how it works? \n\n\nI tested Paul Debevec's Median Cut approach some years back ... Tested it against another method. The other method demonstrated similar accuracy with half the directional light sources. \n\n\nMy Ph. D. Student has been trying to fuse HDR images from fisheye images of the sky (including the sun). We were using HDRshop. Capturing spanned 13  f-stops and we could not get HDRshop to fuse HDR properly. In the end we gave up. \n\n\nDo I really need to get a Mac just to fuse proper sky HDRs??\n\n\nBest\nClaus\n\n\nSent from my iPod\n\n\nOn 25/01/2011, at 19.59, \"Guglielmetti, Robert\" <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000291.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 11:29AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000291"}
