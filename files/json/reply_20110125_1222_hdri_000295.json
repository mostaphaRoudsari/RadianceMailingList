{"body": "Hi Mehlika,\n\n\nThanks to you as well. I already have your paper ... my student and I studied it in the fall we had problems of fusing our sky capture images (or maybe it could have been another earlier paper of yours with some of the same ideas in it? This one seems a little more detailed than I remember... anyway nice work).\n\n\nWe just didn't feel like taking the jump to photosphere, seing as we have been using HDRShop for so many years.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000295.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 12:22PM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000295"}
