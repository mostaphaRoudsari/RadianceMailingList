{"body": "Hi Claus,\n\n\nIf you are grabbing the HEAD release you should have the latest manpages, but the default \"makeall\" script does not automatically link to the docs not does it attempt to place them in a common location. I usually add the \"/ray/doc/man/\" directory to my environment. I can send you a pdf of that particular manpage if you are interested, but it is just a manpage \u2014 it shows you how to use the tool, not how it works. AFAIK, there haven't been any papers published on it.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000297.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 01:37PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000297"}
