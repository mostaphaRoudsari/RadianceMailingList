{"body": "Hi Claus!\n\n\nI am not optimistic about capturing sky and sun using a simple camera. Without worrying about hdr codes - unless you achieve an exposure quick enough to have a non-saturated sun image, the hdr code cannot do the magic and invent pixel values. You may try low-transmission filters, but that costs you the weaker sky luminances. So probably, hardware needed.\n\n\nCreating hdr images from ldr stacks definitely works without a Mac. Hdrgen and pfstools are just two of the many options available.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
