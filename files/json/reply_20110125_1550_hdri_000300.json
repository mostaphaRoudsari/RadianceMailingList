Time and camera handling are definitely a\nproblem for getting an honest (and alignable) LDR series. Greg has a paper\non this someplace, I think. Can't find it right now...\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000300.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 25, 2011 at 03:50PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000300"}
