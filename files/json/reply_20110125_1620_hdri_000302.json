{"body": "Hi Rob et al,\n\n\none thing I could imagine to avoid setups with mounting internal filters (or, even worse, combining filter wheels and fisheye lenses ...) during the somewhat time-critical process of taking an exposure series... Did anyone try yet to use a short-pass filter at 350nm assuming a smaller direct/indirect ratio at short wavelengths, trying to apply models os spectral angular sky distributions to calculate back luminances? Or is this just a silly idea introducing too many uncertainties to remove a basic mechanical problem...?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
