{"body": "There was a brief mention of the source creation algorithm I developed for mksource in the 2005 workshop notes:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop4/cd/website/PDF/Ward_talk1.pdf\n\n\nAs for man pages, you can always get to these online via:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/whatis.html\n\n\nI just noticed that the entry for mksource was missing, so I added it.  Others are probably missing as well.  Sigh.
