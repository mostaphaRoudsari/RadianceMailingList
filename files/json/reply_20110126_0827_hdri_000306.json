{"body": "Hey, Bloch,\n\n\nThanks a lot for all these tips. Very valuable to me.\n\n\nActually, just like you mentioned, I converted these light sources\ninto CG lights to better address GI sampling issue and to have more\nflexible control on lighting.\nFor interior shot, I reconstruct the set as rough geometry via\nphotogrammetry and project fill-light-only environment map onto these\ngeometries to capture animated environment maps for ambient lighting.\nThen, I cut light sources from the original environment map and set up\narea light sources with these cut-out HDR textures based on original\nlighting apparatus real-world positions.\n\n\nI have thought about requesting this kind of feature to be added into\nfuture sIBL sets (for interior shot) for physically-based lighting\nsetup. But I have no clue how to approach it as it involves much more\npreparations than simply separating diffuse and reflection component\nof the lighting as well as extracting light sources as traditional CG\npoint, spot, or directional lights.\n\n\nBest,\nJason\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-January/000306.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "jason huang", "created_at": "January 26, 2011 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "jason_huang", "parent_id": "hdri_000286", "id": "hdri_000306"}
