{"body": "I don't think it's all that difficult to create an IES file from scratch\n(assuming one has a proper test report and either IES LM-63 or Ian's great\npaper that Thomas cites below). Lighting Analysts has a nice piece of\nsoftware called \"Photometric Toolbox\" that guides you through the process\nof generating your own IES file as well. But again, this assumes you have\na photometric test report with all the candela values in hand. If you\ndon't have that, Thomas' suggestion of trying to find a similar product\nthat has been tested is the way to go.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 1/31/11 6:31 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at googlemail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007655.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 31, 2011 at 08:53AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007654", "id": "radiance-general_007655"}
