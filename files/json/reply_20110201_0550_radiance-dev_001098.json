{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nThere used to be a modified implementation of Radiance using MPI. I \nnever used it, and it was based on a release that is pretty much \noutdated by now. The code modifications together with a paper titled \n\"MPI-parallelized Radiance on SGI CoW and SMP\" were published by Roland \nKoholka, Heinz Mayer and Alois Goller in 1999.\n\n\nMost critical tools in Radiance supports coordinated processing on \nmultiple cores by now. This is clearly aiming at platforms providing \nseveral CPUs/cores per node, not at SIMD. I am not aware of any attempt \nto port the code to GPUs or other specialized cores.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-February/001098.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
