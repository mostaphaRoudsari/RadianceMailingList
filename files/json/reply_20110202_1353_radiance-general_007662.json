{"body": "I believe there was one bug that got squashed, definitely a few very\ncool/useful tools added, since 3.8. But yes if you have non-guru Radiance\nusers (the fact that there *are* non-guru Radiance users says a lot about\nthe Radiance-based tools out there like su2rad, SPOT, DAYSIM, etc), I can\nsee the point of sticking with something stable.\n\n\nIn support of a project here at NREL, we are working on creating a build\nsystem that will provide automated cross platform builds of the HEAD, with\na dashboard to monitor for build errors and possibly do unit tests. So on\nthe horizon we will be able to offer stable HEAD binaries for all\nplatforms. That's the goal, anyway...\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 2/2/11 9:12 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at googlemail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007662.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 02, 2011 at 01:53PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007657", "id": "radiance-general_007662"}
