Use the same type of light for one type of fitting.\n\n\n2) When you export to Radiance you get the option to export lights as\nmarkers. This creates triangles with the correct rotation which you\ncan use with \"replmarks\".\n\n\n2b) I think the lights are always exported last so you can edit your\nexported scene.rad file and split it into a geometry.rad and\nmarkers.rad. Makes it easier to update the geometry when the fittings\nstay in the same place.\n\n\n3) convert the IES file to a Radiance file with ies2rad:\n\n\n$ ies2rad -t WHITE -m 0.7 myfitting.ies\n\n\nThis will create a myfitting.rad and myfitting.dat file which describe\na light source with 70% output of the values in the IES file. The -m\noption is the best way to apply depreciation factors.\n\n\n4) now use replmarks to replace the triangles in the \"markers.rad\"\nfile with the light source description:\n\n\n$ replmarks -x myfitting.rad Light.123.4 markers.rad > lights.rad\n\n\n\"Light.123.4\" is the modifier that was assigned to the triangles by\nEcotect. This should have some resemblance to the light type you used\nwhen you placed the lights.\n\n\n5) do the usual Radiance stuff with the new scene files:\n\n\noconv geometry.rad lights.rad > scene.oct\nrvu scene.oct # to check that there are lights in the scene\n[rpict/rtrace as desired]\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit of this method is that you can control each step and\nmodify the output or type of the light fittings. If you define and\nexport the lights in Ecotect you have to replace the whole scene\nwhenever you make a change to the fitting.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007671.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 03, 2011 at 11:48AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007670", "id": "radiance-general_007671"}
