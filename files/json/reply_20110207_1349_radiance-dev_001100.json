{"body": "That's because -g is expecting an argument (the ground reflectance).  If you give \"-c\" after, it probably calls atof(\"-c\") which returns 0.\n\n\nIn general, Radiance doesn't have very paranoid argument checking.  If you don't give a legal command line, many Radiance programs just muddle through (or crash if they try reading past the last argument).  The exceptions to this are the rendering programs and a few utilities that call badarg() to check command argument types.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-February/001100.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 07, 2011 at 01:49PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001099", "id": "radiance-dev_001100"}
