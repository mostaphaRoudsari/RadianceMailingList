{"body": "Hi Roberto!\n\n\n> When I use falsecolor I get a file with 1K size and the tiff comand\n> gives me \"bad picture:\n>\n> falsecolor pics/lum_gensky_sky_$months[$i].$days[$i].$hours[$i].pic -\n> m 179 -s 10000 -l cd/m2 -n 10>  pics/lum_gen_sky_$months[$i].$days\n> [$i].$hours[$i].fc.pic\n\n\nYou can pass the image data to be used as value input by falsecolor using\n\n\n\"falsecolor -i filename.hdr > output.hdr\"\n\n\nor by sending to to stdin, e.g.\n\n\n\"cat filename.hdr | falsecolor > output.hdr\"\n\n\nSo just add a \"-i\" in front of the input filename in your script.\n\n\nBesides that, I would recommend not to use the outdated pic-extension, \nbut the officially registred hdr-extension. But that is a side-not.\n\n\n> echo cloud cover for index $i is $cloud[$i]\n\n\nDoes this work up to here?\n\n\n> Maybe the if function is not able to read the data values?\n\n\nI have to admit that I do not like bash when working on strings and \narrays too much. I usually switch to perl whenever I need to process \nstrings, even if it is just splitting a record.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007680.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
