{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\n> tmp/p000.hdr does exist, as do all the other 248 images (for MF:2). \n\n\nActually there should be 578 images, so you're probably exceeding the limit on number of open files.  On a mac the default is 256.  Once you hit the limit nothing else is written and you're left with a bunch of image files with a header and no data.\n\n\nTo check the limit type:\nulimit -a\n\n\nTo change the limit to 1024:\nulimit -n 1024\n\n\nChanging it this way only applies to the current shell.  If you use a shell script you might need to add it to the script.\n\n\n- Andy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb 10, 2011, at 1:03 PM, Galen Burrell wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007683.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 10, 2011 at 01:51PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007682", "id": "radiance-general_007683"}
