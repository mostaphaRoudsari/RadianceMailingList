{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI got a response from the DIVA mailing list - the program does not\nallow the user to input calibration factors (-r -R -b or -B) for the\ngensky command (I chose to use Rhino in combination w/ the plugin\nDIVA-for-Rhino since I do not have access to a Unix machine and\nbecause of its user-friendly interface). Will see if I can workaround\nthis problem as described below.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 14, 2011 at 7:09 PM, J.

It is called as in the below example,\n!gensky 09 21 09 +s -a -16 -o 48 -m 45\n\n\nYou can't put in the calibration factors using -r -R -b or -B as Greg\nsuggests via the DIVA GUI. However, by editing the filename_sky.rad in\nyour DIVA temp folder and by running the simulation using\nfilenameimg.bat you could short-circuit the GUI and add a calibration\nflag to the gensky command. Note that every time you run a\nvisualization from the GUI, you'll need to re-edit the sky.rad file if\nyou decide to do this.\n\n\nThe other option, if you have direct and diffuse radiation data, is to\nuse the Perez sky distribution via gendaylit. DIVA has a gui frontend\nto this which you can choose by selecting the Perez Sky option under\nsky condition in the metrics dialog.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 14, 2011 at 4:02 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007687.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Krystyna Zelenay", "created_at": "February 14, 2011 at 08:02PM", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007685", "id": "radiance-general_007687"}
