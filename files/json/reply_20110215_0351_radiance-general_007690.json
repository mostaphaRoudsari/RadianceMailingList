{"body": "Thanks Lars, \nI see how that's a possibility but it would mean running separate images\nand to filter each of them. \nIt might work on a run over a day in winter but it seems unpractical\nover a longer period of time (if you where to do this over a year you\nwould end up with about 4k images!) I was planning to run only one\nsimulation with multiple sun positions. Eventually as an optimization\nthe sun position can be clustereed according to tregenza patches and\neach patch weighted based on the number of sun hours it represents (so\nyou don't even need 4000 sun but maybe only 300...)\nAny hint on that?\nThanks,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007690.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "February 15, 2011 at 03:51AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007688", "id": "radiance-general_007690"}
