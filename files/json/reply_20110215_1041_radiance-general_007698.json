{"body": "For those of you using Daysim, there is a fast subprogram called\ngen_directsunlight that you can use for this purpose. The program places\nyour  scene in a glowing sphere and  then shoot rays from your work\nplane sensor towards the direction of the sun if the direct radiation\ncomponent is above 50WM/m2 (according to the annual climate file). The\nresulting *.dir file reports a \"1\" if direct sunlight hits the sensor\nand '0' otherwise for every hour in the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007698.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "February 15, 2011 at 10:41AM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007688", "id": "radiance-general_007698"}
