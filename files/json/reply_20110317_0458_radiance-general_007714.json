{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> I need to know the z depth of each 3d point.

How do i use -z option ?\n\n\nDidn't your command line work? I would probably avoid using the \n.hdr-extension for a depth-map, as its content are not hdr (in rgbe) but \nonly floats.\n\n\nBesides rpict, you could also use rtrace if you do not need the \nradiance/irradiance map but only the depth map. Probably I'd do that, as \nI could directly access the data then transparently without worrying \nabout scanline ordering and reading binary files :-)\n\n\nLook at the possible output values of rtrace (from 'man rtrace'):\n\n\n(..)\n-ospec    Produce output fields  according  to  spec.   Characters\n           are interpreted as follows:\n\n\n                  o    origin (input)\n\n\n                  d    direction (normalized)\n\n\n(..)\n\n\n                  L    first intersection distance\n\n\n(..)\n                  p    point of intersection\n(..)\n\n\nSo lots of data you can get for finding the first point of intersection \nseen from a point of view. vwrays gives you ray directions to shoot at \nyour scene.\n\n\nMaybe this is helpful, maybe someone has a working example using rpict's -z?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007714.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
