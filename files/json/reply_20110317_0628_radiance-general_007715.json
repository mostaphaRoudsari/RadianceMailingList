{"body": "Hi Krystyna,\n\n\nI suggest having a look at at Axel Jacobs document on \"Understanding \nrtcontrib\":\n\n\n    http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf\n\n\nOn pages 30-32 he provide some excellent explanation of processing \nweather data for Radiance and gendaylit. According to this, the best \ndata points to use are direct normal and diffuse horizontal irradiance \n(W/m^2) which should be provided to gendaylit AS IS (eg without any \nadditional factoring for Radiance). Irradiance data points are suggested \nas the best option as apparently not all weather stations actually \nmeasure photometric data, meaning that such values if not measured are \nderived from the radiometric data points.\n\n\nNote reading further will provide some potential cautions on gendaylit \nas well....\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007715.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "March 17, 2011 at 06:28AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007712", "id": "radiance-general_007715"}
