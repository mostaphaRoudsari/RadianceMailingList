{"body": "Hi Brajesh,\n\n\nLars is right that you can use vwrays with rtrace to get more flexible output.  The Z-buffer file is a string of binary floats, and not formatted as such.  You need to pass it through pvalue if you want to produce a (grayscale) image.  You can use the following sequence if you like:\n\n\n\trpict -x ResX -y ResY -z  depth.zbf  -vf  camera.vp  scene.oct > scene.hdr\n\tpvalue -r -h -df -b `getinfo -d < scene.hdr` depth.zbf > depth.hdr\n\n\nNotice the back-quotes above, which substitute the resolution output of getinfo -d on the command line.  You can then view \"depth.hdr\" as a grayscale image or convert to color using falsecolor:\n\n\n\tfalsecolor -l Depth -s auto -m 1 -i depth.hdr > depth_fc.hdr\n\n\nIf you don't want the grayscale image at all, you can combine your pvalue and falsecolor commands like so:\n\n\n\tpvalue -r -h -df -b `getinfo -d < scene.hdr` depth.zbf | falsecolor -l Depth -s auto -m 1 > depth_fc.hdr\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007716.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2011 at 08:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007713", "id": "radiance-general_007716"}
