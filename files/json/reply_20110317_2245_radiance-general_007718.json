{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nThank you very much for your input.\n\n\nI am considering using horizontal (direct and diffuse) irradiance data\nsince this is the required DIVA input. However, now I am wondering if\nI can actually use TMY3 data since I think these may be hourly\naverages calculated for the 60-minute period preceding the timestamp.\nWhile I could subtract 30 minutes from the timestamp, this would only\nbe an approximation at best.\n\n\nI wonder if anyone knows of any sources of instantaneous GH direct and\nGH diffuse irradiance data (required input for DIVA) or a way I could\nuse the TMY3 hourly averages?\n\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 17, 2011 at 11:01 AM, Reinhart, Christoph\n<reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007718.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Krystyna Zelenay", "created_at": "March 17, 2011 at 10:45PM", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007712", "id": "radiance-general_007718"}
