{"body": "Hi Lars/ Greg,\n\n\nI tried with small expression in a cal file.\n\n\nAs i know camera position and Camera view direction from camera.vp file.\nI suppose rpict is similar to rtrace in terms of internal processing.\n\n\nThe depth of the 3d point will be = T *cos theta\nI suppose \" T \" returns distance from camera to point of intersection as per \nrayinit.cal\n\n\nIf CP = Normalized Vector from camera to Point of intersection ( Px, Py, Pz) \n\n\n\n\ncos theta = (CP) dot product  (normalized view vector)\n\n\ntherefore my cal file has\n{\n3dDepthshader.cal\n} \n\n\nred=T * ( (CPx * ViewX)+CPy * ViewY)+Cpz * ViewZ)) ;\n\n\nis the correct way to compute ?\n\n\nAnyway i will try with your given techniques too.\n\n\n Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007719.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brajesh Lal", "created_at": "March 18, 2011 at 02:36AM", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007713", "id": "radiance-general_007719"}
