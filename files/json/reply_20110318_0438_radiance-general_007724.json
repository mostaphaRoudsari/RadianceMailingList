{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> but when i tried falsecolor i get error\n> bash:/opt/radiance/bin/falsecolor: /bin/csh: bad interpreter: Permission\n> denied\n\n\nDo you have /bin/csh installed?\n\n\nAs Thomas mentioned, you can choose the projection using -vt with \nvwrays. That allows you to directly get z-depth for a parallel projection.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007724.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
