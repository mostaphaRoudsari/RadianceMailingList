{"body": "Hi Brajesh,\n\n\nIt sounds like you should download the latest version of falsecolor, which uses Perl instead of the C-shell.  It seems that the C-shell is not properly installed on your system.  I will send this to you in a private message, so you don't have to download the entire HEAD.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007722.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 18, 2011 at 09:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007713", "id": "radiance-general_007722"}
