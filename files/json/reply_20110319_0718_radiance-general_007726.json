{"body": "Hi David!\n\n\n> I am trying to get transmission matrix of a shading system with genBSDF.\n> The system is made from double glazed window and glass louvres with silk\n> screen print with coverage of 55%.\n\n\nIs the print translucent? For transmittance, it makes a difference \nwhether you have a translucent print (resulting in reduced direct \ntransmittance + scatter) or an opaque, purely reflective print \n(resulting in only reduced direct transmittance).\n\n\n> I am not sure what \" Tr    Tg    Tb    Rcr    Rcg    Rcb    Rgr\n> Rgg    Rgb    Part \" should be used for frit.
