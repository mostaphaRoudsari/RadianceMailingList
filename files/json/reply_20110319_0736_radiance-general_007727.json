{"body": "Hi Lars and David,\n\n\nFor the glaze script what is needed for the frit material is T (rgb), \nRcoated side (rgb) and R glass side (rgb) all measured at 100% coverage \nwith the frit material. In the past I have been able to get this \ninformation from glazing manufacturers. It does necessitate a call to \nthe manufacturer and speaking to someone on the technical side who can \nget the information.\n\n\nNot sure what the system is that you are simulating. Have you taken a \nlook at what Window 6 can provide?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/19/2011 10:18 AM, Lars O.
