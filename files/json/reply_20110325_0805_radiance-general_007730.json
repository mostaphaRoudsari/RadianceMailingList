{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nGreg Ward managed to get evalglare to compile back in '09 at the Radiance\nWorkshop. I don't recall what changes he made to make it happen, but he got\nit to work. It appears that this compiled executable is contained in the OS\nX binary archive available for download from www.radiance-online.org. I have\nhad a few \"bus error\"s when using this version, but it works on many images.\nMaybe you could try that version? Option B is to use the windows version on\na VM, which is what I usually do.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007730.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 25, 2011 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007729", "id": "radiance-general_007730"}
