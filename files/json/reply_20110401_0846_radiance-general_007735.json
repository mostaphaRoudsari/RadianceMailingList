{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nthe current status of pmap is:\n\n\nI have a patched version to on of the latest  head release (of December\nI guess). I've already tested it and made some validations. This looks fine.\nI will put it on the server soon (by end of next week or the week after).\n\n\nFor those of you who are using daysim: I've also tested a pmap-version\nof daysim! This works in principle (I already used it for a project),\nbut before releasing some small issues must be fixed first. This will\nneed maybe another 4 weeks.\n\n\nBUT: The windows compilation haven't been done or tested....\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars O.
