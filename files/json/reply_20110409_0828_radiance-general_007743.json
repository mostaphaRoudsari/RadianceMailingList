{"body": "Terrance,\n\n\nThose are good questions. In lieu of actual machinery that would \nreturn real reflectances, I'd had to come up with a scheme that \nwould get get me close. The basis of the scheme is that RGB \nscreen values aren't reflectances, and they shouldn't be treated \nas such.\n\n\nI'll normalize to 0.8 or 0.9 because there is no real \"pure \nwhite\" in real life. Even white paint is rarely over 0.8. And \nwith models with complicated geometry, even 0.8 requires a hefty \nnumber of ambient bounces to balance the energy---light really \ncan penetrate into some deep spaces with 0.8. Consider that with \na reflectivity of 0.9, only 10% of the energy is killed after \nevery bounce, and you'll see that -ab will need to be \nprohibitively high to get an accurate rendering. And I choose \nRadiance for its accuracy, but I haven't got all month for a \nresult.\n\n\nThe squaring of the result is to push the values down closer to \nzero. Most of the interesting colors are in the 0.2 range, and \nthat's just a hack to get closer. I am sure there's a better way, \nbut that's easy to remember and quick to compute.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Sat, 9 Apr 2011, Terrance Mc Minn wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007743.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "April 09, 2011 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007736", "id": "radiance-general_007743"}
