{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nHere's a helpful tutorial for using Ecotect in conjunction with DAYSIM/Radiance:\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf\n\n\nHere's another tutorial, but it is geared specifically towards DAYSIM:\nhttp://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/daysim-tutorial.pdf\n\n\nThe Ecotect square 1 website used to have quite a bit of useful\ninformation, including how to position a camera but am not sure where\nand if this information was moved after the merger with Autodesk. I\nthink it may have been moved here: http://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/\n\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 13, 2011 at 10:36 AM, dharam <dharmesh.124 at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Krystyna Zelenay", "created_at": "April 13, 2011 at 10:58AM", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007753", "id": "radiance-general_007754"}
