Calibration?.\n\n\nI don't know what Photosphere does, but if you have worked out your \ncalibration factor like so:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/calibrate.shtml\nthen you can use hdrexpo:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/hdr/hdrexpo/index.shtml\n\n\nDepending on how accurate you need the per-pixel luminance values, you \nmight also want to look into vignetting correction, but as far as I'm \naware, there is currently no simple cmd line approach to this. See\nhttp://www.new-learn.info/learn/about/doc/jacobs_hdr_varna2007.pdf\nfor a paper on this, and\nhttp://www.new-learn.info/learn/about/doc/pres_jacobs_hdr_varna2007.pdf\nfor the presentation to go with it.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nPS: WebHDR will be down for the next couple of days.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007758.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "April 14, 2011 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007756", "id": "radiance-general_007758"}
