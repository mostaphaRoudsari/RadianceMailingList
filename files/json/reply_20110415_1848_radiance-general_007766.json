{"body": "Hi Krystyna,\n\n\nGoogle led me straight to a little Radiance material collection at the BPS wiki site:\n\n\n\thttp://archbps1.campus.tue.nl/bpswiki/index.php/Radiance\n\n\nI wish there were more there, but the nice thing about a wiki is that everyone can contribute.  Measuring materials and getting them right in Radiance is time-consuming, and usually tackled on a per-model basis.  As an architect, I'm sure you appreciate how variable even something as basic as gray masonry blocks can be.  Even if manufacturers produced to a uniform reflectance, the material pattern and scale can vary significantly.  Nevertheless, it would be a big help to just have a comprehensive set of generic materials.\n\n\nWe should probably link the above in Francesco Anselmo's wiki site, which is also worth a look\n\n\n\thttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=material_collections\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007766.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 15, 2011 at 06:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007763", "id": "radiance-general_007766"}
