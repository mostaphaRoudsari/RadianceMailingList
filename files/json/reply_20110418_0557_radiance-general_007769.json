{"body": "Hello Claus\n\n\nUnfortunately the texture export in su2rad is not very sophisticated. It's\nnot a good way to produce Radiance textures anyway.\n\n\nTo solve your problem you can try one of the two options:\n\n\n1) Select all the textured faces, right click and choose \"texture -> make\nunique\" from the context menu. This will create six identical materials with\na uniform mapping for each face.\n\n\nor 2) Use the attached script to export the cube to *.obj and then use\nobj2mesh to convert the *.obj file to a Radiance mesh with textures. The\nauthor of this OBJ exporter says it does the \"make unique\" step during the\nexport. Please note that I have not used this script myself and I don't know\nif it modifies your  materials during the export.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n2011/4/18 Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen <cbm at create.aau.dk>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007769.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 18, 2011 at 05:57AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007768", "id": "radiance-general_007769"}
