{"body": "Hello Thomas,\n\n\nWell, I tried both your suggestions to no avail.\n\n\nThen I more or less stumbled upon a \"solution\". If I avoid placing any part of the geometry in octants with negative coordinates then texturing works with no problems.\n\n\nHave no idea why that would be the case, though.\n\n\nAfter export I can !xform the object to any octant of the scene no problem...\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007770.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "April 19, 2011 at 06:08AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007768", "id": "radiance-general_007770"}
