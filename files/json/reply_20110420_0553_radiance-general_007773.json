{"body": "Hi Rob\n\n\nI feel a litle lost here .... have two doubt :\n\n\n- The first is how to specify Radiance calculate irradiance\n\n\nI was searching  where to specify -I (the capitol i) to rtrace in Radiance\nto calculate irradiance instead radiance and I found in Autodesk Ecotect\nCalculation wizard - Radiance Analysis (step 10-11) the -I blank, but i dont\nknow what to do because is already wrote and have a blank beside. Others\ncommand have diferents values. I\u00b4m in the right place to specify?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- My second doubt is in what place i need to  \"mutiply the rgb irrandiance\nvalues by V lambda\"  I need to be in Analysis Grid Management - Edit Grid\nData in Ecotect ?\n\n\nRob I\u00b4m  really  thankful for your help.\n\n\nBest regards\n2011/4/15 Ignacio Fajardo <primiark at gmail.com>\n\n\n> Thanks for your help! I\u00b4m gonna be honest, I need to study your answers.\n> Once I get there, I will certainly write you again!\n>\n> Best Regards\n>\n> 2011/4/15 John Mardaljevic <jm at dmu.ac.uk>\n>\n>> Hi Zack,\n>>\n>> Indeed, the CIE skies can be defined by diffuse horizontal illuminance or\n>> zenith luminance.
