{"body": "Hi Ignacio!\n\n\nIt is always a bit confusing when folks think they ask about Radiance, \nbut actually have questions related to Ecotect's user interface. So \nwithout knowing Ecotect, I try to help a bit:\n\n\n> - The first is how to specify Radiance calculate irradiance\n>\n> I was searching where to specify -I (the capitol i) to rtrace in\n> Radiance to calculate irradiance instead radiance and I found in\n> Autodesk Ecotect Calculation wizard - Radiance Analysis (step 10-11) the\n> -I blank, but i dont know what to do because is already wrote and have a\n> blank beside.

So you do not pass any value (and thus there also \ncannot be a default). Basically rtrace -I interpretes input \ncoordinates/directions as sensor locations (coordinate) and sensor view \ndirections (directions). So 0 0 0 0 0 1 would be location (0,0,0) \npointing up (0,0,1).\n\n\n> - My second doubt is in what place i need to \"mutiply the rgb\n> irrandiance values by V lambda\" I need to be in Analysis Grid Management\n> - Edit Grid Data in Ecotect ?\n\n\nNo idea, usually you need to weigh the RGB (unless you do everything \nwith grey values) and multiply with the luminous efficacy in Radiance to \nget from radiometric to photometric units, but I have no clue where this \nis hidden in Ecotect.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007774.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
