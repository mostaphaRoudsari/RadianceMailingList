{"body": "Hi!\n\n\nRob I visit your website and I like a lot your radiance renders!! just\nperfect, I render with other programs and maxell is closer to radiance, but\nradiance gives you data... more usefull.\n\n\nAbout my LEED doubts I answer myself, because Ecotect give the options to\ncalculate Radiance (luminace) cd/m2 or Irradiance (illuminance) lx/m2, so,\nI\u00b4m sure that we are ok with that because you choose cd/m2 option.\nNow, to convert cd/m2 to cd/ft2 for LEED  I need to convert each node\nvalues - V*0.092903 (V is the node value, and 0.09... is the value to\ntransform 1cd/m2 to cd/ft) in Ecotect you can do that in grid management.\nI hope this informations can be usefull ... anyway, comments  are welcome to\nbe sure what I\u00b4m doing.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011/4/20 Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007776.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Fajardo", "created_at": "April 21, 2011 at 11:51AM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Fajardo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007750", "id": "radiance-general_007776"}
