{"body": "Hi Ignacio,\n\n\nWhat website did you visit? Because I can point you to a bunch of other websites with far nicer Radiance renderings than mine!  =)  I agree though, Radiance is nice because it gives you useful data, not just \"pretty pictures\".\n\n\nOK, your second paragraph below is quite the unit salad. Let's sort this out as best I can, not having Ecotect to look at. You say \"Ecotect give the options to calculate Radiance (luminace) cd/m2 or Irradiance (illuminance) lx/m2\".  You're mixing and matching quantities here. For LEED daylighting calcs, you ultimately need illuminance. This is lumens/m^2, NOT lux/m^2.  1 Lux = 1lm/m^2. So, just make sure you are asking for illuminance.  Not irradiance, not luminance, but illuminance -- which should be in lux, or lumens/m^2. Next, you mention this node value conversion. I assume a node value is a calculation grid point. Your conversion value is correct to convert from metric units to imperial units. So, assuming you are indeed calculating illuminance, in lux (lumens/m^2), then multiplying those values by 0.0929030436 will convert the values to footcandles (lumens/m^2).\n\n\nHope this helps, I'm not really sure about any of the GUI specific questions you have because I don't use or have Ecotect.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007777.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 21, 2011 at 02:37PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007750", "id": "radiance-general_007777"}
