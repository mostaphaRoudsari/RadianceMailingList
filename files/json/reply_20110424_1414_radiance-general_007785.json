{"body": "Dear Rob and Lars\n\n\nSearching on internet I realize that I\u00b4m very lucky to be in the same mail\nlist with both of you. Let me show me respect and gratitude.\n\n\nI still have a question in units to use for LEED calculations and I write\nbelow some important data to remember:\n\n\n* Robert told us to use for LEED :*\n\n\n Illuminance lm/m2 (lumens/m2)*\n*\n\n\n*Radiance web site :*\n\n\nRadiance / Luminance (W/sr.m2, cd/m2)\n\n\nIrradiance / Iluminance (W/m,lux)\n\n\n*Ecotect options:*\n\n\nLuminance Image (cd/m2)\n\n\nIluminance Image (lux/m2)    may be, must mean  lm/m2\n\n\n* LEED requeriements :*\n\n\n25 footcandle min\n\n\n500 footcandle max\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Rob and Lars I\u00b4m going to use *Iluminance image* Options on Ecotect to\nhave result in lux (lumens/m^2), then multiplying those values by\n0.0929030436 will convert the grid values to footcandles (1lm/m2 = 0.09\nfoot-candle)    http://www.convertworld.com/en/illuminance/\n\n\nLEED mentions that 75% of the zone must be between 25 and 500 footcandle, So\nIf I do the conversion (Lumens/m2) x (0.09)   that  value in the grid point\ncan be use to complete the % of area for LEED.\n\n\n\n\nLars you correct Rob about a mistake in theunits\u2026\n\n\nROB: *\u201cSo, assuming you are indeed calculating illuminance, in lux\n(lumens/m^2), then multiplying those values by 0.0929030436 will convert the\nvalues to footcandles (lumens/m^2).\u201d*\n\n\nLARS: *Actually lm/ft2. You see what a mess the mixing of metric and\nimperial system leads to if these typos appear even in Rob's explanation.***\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 But the units still  footcandles right?  The confusion was that Rob meant\nlumens/ ft2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys\u2026please confirm the information above is correct and have a look to the\nwebsite if you have time.\n\n\n\n\nI will gladly take any comments.\n\n\nCheers!!\n\n\n\n\n2011/4/22 Rob Guglielmetti <rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007785.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ignacio Fajardo", "created_at": "April 24, 2011 at 02:14PM", "created_by": "Ignacio_Fajardo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007750", "id": "radiance-general_007785"}
