{"body": "There are a whole bunch of people on this list that I'm thankful for knowing; it's truly a great bunch, and I have learned a lot from these people, both on- and off-list. To answer your question, yes, it sounds like the \"illumimance image\" option is what you want, since it gives you a result in SI illuminance units (lux) -- which you can convert to footcandles with that multiplier so that the LEED reviewers are happy.
