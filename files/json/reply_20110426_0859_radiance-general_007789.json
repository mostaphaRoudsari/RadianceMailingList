{"body": "The ambient resolution affects the image quality depending on the size of the scene relative to the size of the area of interest (for example the size of the ground plane relative to the size of an interior room). So if you have a 10m scene, and add a ground plane to make it 100m total, the -ar setting should be raised just to keep image quality the same as it was without the ground plane. If the image wasn't very smooth to start, then raising -ar even further may help.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007789.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 26, 2011 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007787", "id": "radiance-general_007789"}
