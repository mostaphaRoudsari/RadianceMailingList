{"body": "Hi Anne,\n\n\nI agree that you should try the glow window.  If you are using the rsensor program as your script seems to indicate, rays will be distributed over the window independently from how you've defined it.  Only the secondary bounces will care if it's a light source or a glow and whether it's subdivided, and those should not matter to the results.  This leaves the puzzle of why your output varies so much in the first place.  \n\n\nHave you tried generating hemispherical fisheye views from the sensor position under the different simulation conditions?  This is always my favorite way of debugging such problems.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007794.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 28, 2011 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007791", "id": "radiance-general_007794"}
