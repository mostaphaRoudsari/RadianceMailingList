{"body": "Hi Anne,\n\n\nHmmm.  I didn't notice that you're using rsensor to generate rays.  Unfortunately my suggested pattern for subdividing the window is useless.  And using glow probably won't make much difference - unless your sensor has a tight and/or peaky sensitivity distribution.  Can you share information about the sensors sensitivity?  Maybe share the sensor dat file?  Also, is your sensor on the ceiling or the window head?\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 28, 2011, at 11:42 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007795.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 28, 2011 at 01:50PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007791", "id": "radiance-general_007795"}
