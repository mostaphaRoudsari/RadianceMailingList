{"body": "Please excuse any cross postings ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear colleagues, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day\nexecutive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will\nagain be offering on July 6-8 2011 at Harvard University, Graduate\nSchool of Design. Course participants will acquire a range of\ndaylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to\nstate-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography\nfor glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be Rhino\ncombined with our DIVA plug-in <http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/>  that\nexports Rhino scenes into Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare and - starting\nthis summer-  EnergyPlus. Simulation outputs include:\n\n\n-          Daylight factor and indoor illuminance distributions for LEED\nIEQ Credit 8.1 Compliance (Radiance)\n\n\n-          Annual radiation maps for urban studies\n\n\n-          Climate-based metrics including daylight autonomy and useful\ndaylight illuminance (Radiance/Daysim)\n\n\n-          Physically based scene visualizations (Radiance)\n\n\n-          Glare analysis under selected sky\nconditions(Radiance/Evalglare)\n\n\n-          Annual glare maps (Daysim/Evalglare)\n\n\n-          Thermal loads calculations (EnergyPlus and Radiance/Daysim)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe physical assumptions underlying these simulation programs and\nperformance metrics will be discussed in detail. The first two days will\nconsist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software\ntutorials, and exercises. Day two will start with a lecture on circadian\neffects of light by Professor Stephen Lockley form the Harvard Medical\nSchool. Participants will be given the opportunity to calibrate their\npersonal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways of\nhow to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day,\nparticipants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired\nanalysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own and to go over\nspecific problems or simulation challenges with the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can sign up for the program at\nhttp://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10\n2042.
