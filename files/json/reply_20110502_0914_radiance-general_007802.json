{"body": "Hi Anne,\n\n\nI believe David is correct.  I should have looked at your command more closely.  The -I+ switch does not belong.  If you remove it (or set -I-), then the computed radiance values will be accumulated according to the distributed rays out of rsensor, then split again into Klems direction bins by rtcontrib.  The *.vmx files will each contain a single row of 145 RGB coefficients, which processed through dctimestep with the window's BTDF file will ultimately yield a single sensor value at each time step.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense.  I find it a bit confusing, myself!\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007802.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 02, 2011 at 09:14AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007791", "id": "radiance-general_007802"}
