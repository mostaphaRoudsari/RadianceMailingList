And they should just cause noise that is a fraction of the values from the direct sampling of the window by rsensor.  So the only way I can think that glow vs. light would make a sizable difference is if your sensor is somewhat shielded from the window (by sensitivity or by placement) and/or most of the rsensor samples a sent to surfaces near the window ( ie focused sensitivity).  Neither of these seem to be the cause though using -I+ would have had the effect of masking the direct contribution from the window in a similar way because rsensor rays that hit the window don't return a direct value but instead start an iluminance calculation on the window. \n\n\nI'd suggest that while you are running everything again without -I that you also simulate using classic Radiance techniques (ie not the three-phase method). \n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007803.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 02, 2011 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007791", "id": "radiance-general_007803"}
