{"body": "E(global-h) = E(diffuse-h) + E(direct-h)\n\n\nor\n\n\nE(global-h) = (-B value) + (-R value)\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is different than the values used for gendaylit -W or -L which require direct *normal* and diffuse horizontal. But for gensky it seems the horizontal value is used for both diffuse and direct components, so take advantage of the additive nature of light.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007810.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 06, 2011 at 06:24AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007806", "id": "radiance-general_007810"}
