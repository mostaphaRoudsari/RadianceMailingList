{"body": "Hi David, Greg and Andy,\nHave been in Lausanne for a great Daylight Symposium, so it's first now I\nfind the time to look at your comments.\n\n\nMy bummer! You're right, the -I does not belong. Thanks for noticing the\nmistake and explain the reason why :-) :-). This is no excuse, but I did\nfind it myself when comparing rsensor 'cosine distribution' (from SPOT\ndistribution) to a simulation with a standard sensor point, and have been\nwondering why??\n\n\nAnd yep - Andy, I'll run it all again. Both three phase method and standard\nRadiance technique. I'll let you know how it works out.\n\n\nTHANKS :-)\nBest,\nAnne\n\n\nOn Mon, May 2, 2011 at 9:00 PM, <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007811.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anne Iversen", "created_at": "May 07, 2011 at 11:04AM", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007791", "id": "radiance-general_007811"}
