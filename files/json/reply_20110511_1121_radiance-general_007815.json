{"body": "2011/5/11 Sotiris Papantoniou <sotos.enveng at gmail.com>\n\n\n> Hi Thomas,\n>\n>\n>\n> I am running Ubuntu 11.04 and I installed Radiance through Synaptic package\n> manager\n>\n\n\nSo I suspect that you have installed the incomplete package.\n\n\n\n\n> I copied the \u201ccoeff_perez.dat\u201d file but gendaylit again did not work\n> because it could not access \u201cdefangle.dat\u201d\n>\n\n\nYes. That too was mentioned in the post I pointed you to.\n\n\nI have now download the source code from the site but when I copy the file\n> to /usr/share/radiance the file has an \u201cX\u201d on the top  right of its image.\n>\n\n\nCan you be more specific, please. I assume you are neither familiar with a\nUnix/Linux system nor the command line. I also assume that you have unpacked\nthe source package and copied the two files \"coeff_perez.dat\" and\n\"defangle.dat\" to /usr/share/radiance.\n\n\nNow, if you still get errors it might be related to the permissions of those\ntwo files (which might be indicated by the \"X\" you are referring to). Open a\nconsole window and type the commands\n\n\nsudo chmod 644 /usr/share/radiance/coeff_perez.dat\n/usr/share/radiance/defangle.dat\nsudo chown root:root /usr/share/radiance/coeff_perez.dat\n/usr/share/radiance/defangle.dat\n\n\nAfter the first command you will have to provide your password to get the\nrequired privileges.\n\n\nWith this your Radiance installation should be complete.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007815.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 11, 2011 at 11:21AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007805", "id": "radiance-general_007815"}
