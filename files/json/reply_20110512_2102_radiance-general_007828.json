{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI assume you've done the obvious and made sure the file \"geometry/BSDF_old_open.rad\" exists and is readable.  Try issuing the command with \"./geometry/BSDF_old_open.rad\" instead and see if that works.  If it does, that means that your RAYPATH environment variable doesn't include the current working directory ('.') as part of the search.  This normally goes in front, e.g., \"RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray\".\n\n\nThe xform command is special in that it searches the RAYPATH directories rather than taking file names you give it literally.  This simplifies creating a library of often-used objects, but can be confusing in other contexts.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007828.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 12, 2011 at 09:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007827", "id": "radiance-general_007828"}
