{"body": "Thanks Jack, Thomas:\n\n\nI'm likely to delay the porting of Photosphere to Linux after I get the Mac version working in wxWidgets.  Especially given my lack of Linux experience, and that I'm doing this on the side of my two paid positions, I don't want to get overwhelmed into sloppiness.\n\n\nLars also had a good (off-list) suggestion to distribute the GUI code in source form and the rest as linked libraries, which could probably be made to work across all Linux installations more easily.  That may be the way to go; I'm not sure.  The easiest for me of course would be to find someone else to do the work who knows what they're doing, but I've already enlisted and imposed upon two of my friends to help me out.  I've compensated them somewhat for their time from my own pocket, but I'm hoping to capitalize on their efforts and get a little revenue stream going in addition.  We'll see...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-May/000316.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 13, 2011 at 10:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000312", "id": "hdri_000316"}
