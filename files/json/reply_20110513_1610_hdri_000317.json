{"body": "Hi Greg and all!\n\n\nGreat news that Photosphere can make a jump into Linux!\n\n\nLars' suggestion is great, but there are also some possibilities \nto make a cross-distro binary package:\nhttp://listaller.nlinux.org/ or https://launchpad.net/listaller\nhttp://zero-install.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nOtherwise we can try it the Blender way:\ndecide on a target amount of money you want to reach to free the source code\nand wait for enough people to pay and exceed the target, then free the code ...\nI think it's an interesting business model ... and the HDRI community is rather large ...\n\n\nOther than this, I'm happy to help in my spare time, I've done a bit of wxwidgets \nprogramming and packaging for linux and windoze.\n\n\nCiao ciao,\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-May/000317.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Francesco Anselmo", "created_at": "May 13, 2011 at 04:10PM", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo", "parent_id": "hdri_000312", "id": "hdri_000317"}
