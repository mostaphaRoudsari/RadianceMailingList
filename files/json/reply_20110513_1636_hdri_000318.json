{"body": "Hi Francesco,\n\n\nThanks for the links and your helpful offer.  Much as I like open source in general, in order for the model to work it needs either (a) the original programmer to remain closely involved, or (b) a generic enough utility that a group of talented programmers will take it over.  Radiance definitely falls into the (a) category, and I suspect Photosphere is similar.  I probably will free the code at some point, but if I target compensation for the time and money I've sunk into it, we'll never get there.  No, I fully expect my eventual decision to be an arbitrary one.\n\n\nMeanwhile, if you help me port it to Linux, I'll be happy to funnel a good chunk of the proceeds your way.  Support requirements mandate that in any case.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-May/000318.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 13, 2011 at 04:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000312", "id": "hdri_000318"}
