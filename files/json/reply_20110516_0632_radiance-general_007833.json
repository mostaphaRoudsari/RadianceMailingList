{"body": "If you model estimated geometry surrounded by the \"impostor surfaces,\" would this impact your results depending on how you are estimating glare? If you use luminance for glare evaluation, do you get the luminance value of the faux luminaire geometry behind the illum \"impostor surface\" or do you get the luminance value of the IES illum?\n\n\nIf you get the value of the IES file then the detailed geometry is just for show in any renderings. If you get the value of the detailed geometry then you're back to the question of if it's accurate.\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007833.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 16, 2011 at 06:32AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007821", "id": "radiance-general_007833"}
