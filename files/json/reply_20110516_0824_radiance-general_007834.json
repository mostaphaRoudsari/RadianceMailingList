Since what the rendering shows is the false luminaire geometry, \nthat's what a direct view of the luminaire will show.  So you would \nhave to use a straight \"light,\" not an \"illum,\" to get a calculation of \nglare looking into the luminaire.  This will not produce a realistic \nimage, but I expect that, for a T5 fluorescent, it would produce a \nuseful glare calcuation.  As Lars points out, it probably won't be as \nuseful for LEDs fixture that allows for a direct view of many small \npoints of light.\n\n\nI wonder if HDR images of an LED fixture would provide a useful basis \nfor glare calculation.  I suppose one could, if one had the resources, \nmove the camera around the luminaire, the way a photometer does, and \ncreate multiple images which, if we had a way of getting those images \ninto Radiance, might provide a fairly accurate basis for glare \ncomputation.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007834.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
