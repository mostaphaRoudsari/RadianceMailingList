I suppose one could, if one had the resources, move the camera around the luminaire, the way a photometer does, and create multiple images which, if we had a way of getting those images into Radiance, might provide a fairly accurate basis for glare computation.\n\n\nThey do, in the crude sense of just looking at contrast ratios. Never tried with a fisheye lens and running evalglare, but I actually have a slide showing an LDR image alongside a HDR image that was tonemapped with pcond -h that suggests the discomfort of looking at an LED striplight, that I am presenting at Lightfair in (yikes) less than two hours. Gotta go!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007835.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 16, 2011 at 09:23AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007821", "id": "radiance-general_007835"}
