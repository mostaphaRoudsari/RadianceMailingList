I suppose one could, if one had the resources, move the camera around the luminaire, the way a photometer does, and create multiple images which, if we had a way of getting those images into Radiance, might provide a fairly accurate basis for glare computation.\n\n\nI think we hit near field photometry here. HDR images may be a useful input. Anyone who did this in Radiance so far?\n\n\nBasically you need to end up with Radiance(position,direction) as a function. If you have enough HDR images, where you can relate pixel positions to location at luminous surfaces under known directions, this should be doable using Radiance tools.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007838.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
