{"body": "What exactly is your question? Of course you can start multiple rtrace or whatever processes, they will not care about each other. If you run more processes then CPUs, they will slow down, same is true (even worse) if you exceed available memory. If you have lots of scenes, you can write a script to automate the handling. You may also like batch processing queues if you have a lot of processes to distribute. Still, it is impossible to answer your question if it is that general.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
