{"body": "Hello Lars and Christopher,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy idea is to run many simulations, for now up to 1200, in order to create data for a fuzzy system.  I have many simulations because I have a glass part of a building which has 4 sets of blinds which are autonomously controlled. If I am thinking correctly when the angle of each blind changes we have a new scene, which is separately simulated. For each scene I am running a new rpict command to see the result. I found out that in the University we have a grid-computer which is working on Linux. From the grid-computer web-site I read the following: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslators\n\n\n*\tC (gcc 4.1.2 <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/>   gcc44  4.4.0)\n*\tFortran77  <http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/languages/fortran/> & 98 (gfortran 4.1.2 gfortan44 4.4.0)\n*\tC++ <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/>   (g++  4.1.2  g++44 4.4.0)\n*\tJava <http://java.sun.com/>   (jdk 1.6.0  gcj   4.1.2)\n*\tPython <http://www.python.org/>   2.4.3\n\n\nData bases\n\n\n*\tMySQL 5.0.77 <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/> \n\n\nComputational Systems\n\n\n*\tMatlab 7.9.0 <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/> \n*\tOctave 3.0.5 <http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/about.html> \n*\tR-2.12.2 <http://www.r-project.org/> \n\n\n*\tManagement systems and grid operations\n*\tTORQUE 2.3.6 <http://www.clusterresources.com/products/torque-resource-manager.php> \n*\topenMPI 1.4.1 <http://www.open-mpi.org/> \n*\tmaui 3.2 <http://www.clusterresources.com/products/maui/> \n\n\nThis is the software of the grid. So I was thinking, to install Radiance on the grid and run the commands from it. So my main question is if I can use radiance on a grid-computer, and If I use the advantage of the grid by running in parallel the same command. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, since I was in a hurry to get some results, I am creating the combinations in Matlab and I am running rpict from DOS. I know it is old but I for now I have in the University only an Win OS computer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope I managed to give you some details. If not please tell me so, in order to reply again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSotiris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007843.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sotiris Papantoniou", "created_at": "May 18, 2011 at 03:29AM", "created_by": "Sotiris_Papantoniou", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007840", "id": "radiance-general_007843"}
