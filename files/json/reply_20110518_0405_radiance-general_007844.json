{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> My idea is to run many simulations, for now up to 1200, in order to\n> create data for a fuzzy system.  I have many simulations because I have\n> a glass part of a building which has 4 sets of blinds which are\n> autonomously controlled. If I am thinking correctly when the angle of\n> each blind changes we have a new scene, which is separately simulated.\n> For each scene I am running a new rpict command to see the result. I\n> found out that in the University we have a grid-computer which is\n> working on Linux. From the grid-computer web-site I read the following:\n\n\nTwo options:\n\n\nA) Create your scene octrees, name them according to your parameters. \nCreate a rif-file with the settings you use. In this rif-file, you use \ndummies names for the critical parameters that should not be shared \n(e.g. all file names including the ambient file). Write a script that \nloops through all the possible names (and thus setups), replaces the \ndummy by the current scene name, runs rad on the rif file. sed is a very \nuseful command for doing so.\n\n\nB) Create one rif file, and replace the varying parts of your scene (can \nbe material definitions, geometry, ...) by shell commands (preceded by \n!) that produce the output. In the simplest way, this command can just \nreturn the value of an environment variable that is altered by your \nscript. E.g. in your script, you set the variable myVariableMat=\"void \nplastic thisTimeItsWhite 0 0 5 1 1 1 0 0\", and in your material \ndefinition file, you reference it by adding a line !echo $myVariableMat.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007844.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
