{"body": "Hi Sotiris,\n\n\nThere are several things that you are going to have to figure out in \norder to take advantage of the compute resources available at your \nuniversity. Hopefully there is some administrative support that can \nprovide some basic advice. But I think that you will need to figure out \nthe following, and this is likely not going to be an fast learning curve \nunless you are accustomed to working with this type of system and the \nscripting that will likely be involved. It will take some trial and \nerror, but once you get it figured out it will probably be well worth \nthe effort to have such a resource available.\n\n\n   1. You will need to figure out how you need to install your\n      application (Radiance) to make it accessible to the cluster.\n   2. You will need to figure out how to script radiance to to make the\n      scene changes that are needed. This might involve some selection\n      of: make, csh, perl, python or whatever other scripting language\n      you enjoy. I think that it may also be possible to control through\n      Matlab/Octave (see\n      http://web.mac.com/geotrupes/iWeb/Main%20site/RadBlog/E549E7F4-6DA2-4D78-8F91-74A4691ED86A.html\n      at Giulio Antonutto's site). If the only variation in your scene\n      is going to be the orientation of the individual blind slats, then\n      there are a number of ways to script this and one option might be\n      to consider looking at the radiance program ranimate with the\n      ANIMATE variable set to a script to rotates the slat geometry by a\n      given increment or parameter, with this you could also change\n      other scene conditions such as the position of the sun/sky\n      condition. But this could also be done with the other scripting\n      methods I indicate.\n   3. Lastly you will need to figure out how to submit your radiance\n      rendering job to the grid. Based on the information that you\n      provide it is most likely that this would be done via \"qsub\" which\n      is a job submital routine for Torque, which looks to be the\n      queuing system for the cluster (Maui takes care of how the\n      resources are actually allocated). Unfortunately this (job\n      submittal with qsub) also requires some scripting, however there\n      should be \"howto\" resources available from the system\n      administrators of the cluster. Such a script will have parameters\n      indicating what resources (nodes, cpus, cores and time are needed\n      for the job) as well as what the job comprises. In this case you\n      would probably want to script something that actually generates\n      1200 separate \"jobs\" that can then be submitted individually to\n      the cluster as resources become available. If you \"owned\" the\n      cluster you would be able to do things more simply using ranimate\n      to distribute the job over selected cluster nodes.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007845.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 18, 2011 at 05:15AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007840", "id": "radiance-general_007845"}
