{"body": "Hello again Lars,\n\n\nI have a script already working and giving results but, it is slow, taking\nunder consideration that is using only 1 core. The script, made in Matlab,\nworks in the following way\n\n\n1) 5 embedded for (degrees of each blind and sun position)\n2) creates a new folder\n3) copying necessary 5 files to make the combination (1 of 1280)\n4) copies the standard files (materials, geometry, view)\n5) Oconv the files\n6) rpict is creating the image and stores it to a standard folder with all\nthe results\n7) go to number (1)\n\n\nThis is in general my script. It works but 7 minutes per simulation for 1280\nsimulation, equals...  90 hours. \n\n\nThis is why I need the grid, and apart from that since I can run the\nsimulations in parallel (thank you for the info), I can save some time until\nRadiance is installed, setup and test for many simulations.\n\n\nOnce again thank you for your time\n\n\nSotiris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007846.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sotiris Papantoniou", "created_at": "May 18, 2011 at 06:04AM", "created_by": "Sotiris_Papantoniou", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007840", "id": "radiance-general_007846"}
