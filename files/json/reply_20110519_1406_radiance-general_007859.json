{"body": "Hi Sandy,\n\n\nI'll start by saying that we are very welcoming of beginners at the workshop.  We haven't planned a beginners tutorial during the seminars but  beginners will probably find John's seminar presentation on the ambient calculation parameters (-ab -ad -ar -aa etc) to be helpful.\n\n\nThe presentations during the workshop are given by attendees.  At this point there is no way to know what they will be.  Presentations at past workshops have cover a range of topics.  \n\n\nWhen I was a beginner I found the workshop to be inspiring.  While much of the detail was beyond my capability, conceptually it was all very interesting.  I also found the time between presentations, (coffee breaks, lunch and workshop dinner) when I had the opportunity to talk with more experienced users to be particularly valuable for beg.  The workshops provided the motivation I needed persevere. \n\n\nIf you are a complete beginner I'd suggest working through tutorials before the workshop.  But if your using Radiance now, you're probably know enough to find value in the workshop.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\nPS - Here's a great presentation from Rob at his second workshop (after attending the workshop a year before as self-described newbie).   http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop2/cd/Guglielmetti/abstract.html  Hopefully well have some presentations from relatively new users this year too.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007859.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 19, 2011 at 02:06PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007837", "id": "radiance-general_007859"}
