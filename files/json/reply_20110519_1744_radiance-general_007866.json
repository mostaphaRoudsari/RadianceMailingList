{"body": "Hi Greg again,\n\n\nI have just reinstalled Radiance completely last week, because when I\ngenerated rendering with three-phase method I have got light coming somehow\nfrom wrong side and Andy suggested to reinstalled it.\n\n\nI guess you may be right with the system limits. Because I have exceeded\nnumber of opened files before and there could be maybe some other limit\nwhich I am exceeding. Unfortunately I can not change the limits, I have\ncontacted the servers support but they cannot change it.\n\n\nThe parameters are quite high. I may reduce some but then I have to run\nwhole simulation again, also for the sensors which I have got results for.\n\n\n\n\n-ab 5\n-ad 2048\n-as 0\n-aa 0\n-lw 1.00E-12\n-ds 0.1\n-dj 0.9\n-dt 0\n-dc 0.75\n-n 4\n\n\nI have started to run the simulation again and I will see how it goes. My\nfurther step will be probably reduce the parameters.\n\n\nThank you for your advices.\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007866.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Appelfeld", "created_at": "May 19, 2011 at 05:44PM", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007861", "id": "radiance-general_007866"}
