{"body": "Yeah, your parameters are set really high.  Setting -lw 1e-12 means that in the limit, you will trace a trillion rays for every input ray, and these trillion rays will have to be summed up by rtcontrib.  You're probably running out of RAM in your rtcontrib process.  I wouldn't bother with the -n 4 -- it won't speed things up and it makes your memory problem worse.  Try using -n 1 and -lw 1e-9 or greater.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007867.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 19, 2011 at 07:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007861", "id": "radiance-general_007867"}
