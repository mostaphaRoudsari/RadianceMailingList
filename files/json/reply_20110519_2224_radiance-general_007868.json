{"body": "Strange error.  Out of curiosity, what happens if you use \"-t default\" instead of \"-t white\"?  Also try giving the file as \"./LLM154T5.ies\" instead.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the error message doesn't give much clue about where it's happening or why.  It could even be an error in the IES file.  If there's a tilt data file that's missing or contains a nul byte, that might cause it as well.  You could try e-mailing me your file off-list as an attachment.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007868.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 19, 2011 at 10:24PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007860", "id": "radiance-general_007868"}
