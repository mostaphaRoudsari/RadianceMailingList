{"body": "Hi Dharam!\n\n\nI think people (including me) already tried to hide some hint in \nprevious replies that this is not an Ecotect mailing list, that Ecotect \nis a package sold by a company that should be able to provide support \nfor their software which you paid for, but that we happily answer \nRadiance-related questions here. I short terms: please do not continue \nto bother people with questions about Ecotect. We do not know, we do not \nwant to know, or we do not want to discuss it here. Seriously.\n\n\n> can anyone please help me in taking out output results from radiance\n> images in the form of TEXT.

OR is there a direct way for output in numerical form.\n\n\nI think the answer to the Radiance part of the question is obvious. Type \nman pvalue, read the manpage of pvalue online, or read the tutorials \n(e.g. Axel Jacob's great work). As it documented, all Radiance tools \nstarting with p are performing pixel operations. Images are 2d maps of \npixels, and pvalue extracts these. In general, all non-binary data \nleaving Radiance is text. There are lots of tools in Radiance to process \nthe text output, my favourites are rlam, rcalc,... read the \ndocumentation and you will find everything you need.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007876.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
