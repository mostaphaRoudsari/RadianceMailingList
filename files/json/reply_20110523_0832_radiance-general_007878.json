{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nIf I understand your e-mail correctly, you are seeing this error using the NEW material, not the OLD one.\n\n\nI cannot reproduce your error.  I assume from your earlier e-mails that you are using the latest HEAD of Radiance.  You should make sure that everything is up-to-date and try it again.  In particular, we fixed some problems last December in the normalization of results.  The dctimestep program has also been improved and corrected.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007878.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 23, 2011 at 08:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007877", "id": "radiance-general_007878"}
