{"body": "Chris,\nMy feeling is that it could be an exposure tag issue.\nI think Santiago presented at one of the Radiance workshop a script to undo exposure compensation, maybe in 2008 \nI had a similar issue playing with the files from my camera. (in my case I need to add the aperture tag and play with the multiplier manually (pcomb) to get the right HDR settings, and of course I am using the aforementioned Santiago+Greg script)\nI have some more info in the office. WIll come back.\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-June/000324.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giugi", "created_at": "June 02, 2011 at 02:03PM", "created_by": "Giugi", "parent_id": "hdri_000323", "id": "hdri_000324"}
