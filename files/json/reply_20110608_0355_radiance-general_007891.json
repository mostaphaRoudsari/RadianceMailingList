{"body": "Hi George,\n\n\nThis is an intelligent and well-written question.  Thank you for taking the time to construct such a nice posting.\n\n\nSetting -aa 0 makes the calculation very sensitive to settings of -lw and -lr.  You should make sure that -lr is negative to enable Russian roulette sampling -- try \"-lr -8\" for starters.  If this doesn't fix the problem, try reducing the -lw parameter setting by powers of 10 until the discrepancy goes away or become acceptable.\n\n\nBest of luck,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  You may find my 2005 presentation on new Radiance features illustrative:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop4/cd/website/PDF/Ward_talk1.pdf\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007891.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 08, 2011 at 03:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007890", "id": "radiance-general_007891"}
