{"body": "Radiance images store radiance values. You have to convert the raw values\nwith the appropriate luminous efficacy value (179 by default). This only\nmakes sense if the image was rendered with \"-i\" as an option to rpict and\nhas not been passed through pcond.\n\n\nSolution: add rcalc to your command\n\n\npvalue -h -H -b -o image.hdr | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3*179'\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n2011/6/10 \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 <sotos.enveng at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007900.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 10, 2011 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007899", "id": "radiance-general_007900"}
