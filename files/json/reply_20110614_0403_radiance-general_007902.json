{"body": "Hi\n\n\nTo perform anti-aliasing you need to reduce your final image size (typically by a factor 3).\nHence your pfilt comand should be:\n\n\npfilt -x /3 -y /3 -e 1 -r 0.55 ./direct_sunlight.hdr > test.hdr\n\n\nRaphael\n________________________________________\nDe : Ji Zhang [hope.zh at gmail.com]\nDate d'envoi : mardi, 14. juin 2011 08:36\n\u00c0 : Radiance general discussion\nObjet : [Radiance-general] how to use pfilt to perform anti-aliasing\n\n\nDear Radiance experts,\n\n\nI use pfilt to treat a .hdr image generated by rpict command.\n\n\nHowever, the the pfilt doesn't seem to have any impact in terms of anti-aliasing of the image.\n\n\nThe pfilt command I used is:\npfilt -x 1024 -y 1024 -e 1 -r 0.55 ./direct_sunlight.hdr > test.hdr\n\n\nthe original .hdr image (saved as png file) is:\nhttp://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n633/oatcracker/Radiance/direct_sunlight.png\n\n\nthe output .hdr of the pfilt (saved as png file) is:\nhttp://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n633/oatcracker/Radiance/output_of_pfilt.png\n\n\n\n\nCan you kindly tell me if I'm using pfilt correctly to perform anti-aliasing?\n\n\nThanks!\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007902.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "June 14, 2011 at 04:03AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007901", "id": "radiance-general_007902"}
