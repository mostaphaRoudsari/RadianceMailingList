{"body": "Dear Radiance experts,\n\n\nTwo more questions about rad:\n\n\nOne of the options of the rad program is explained in the rad menu as:\n\n\n[ *-n|-N* *npr* ]\n\n\n\n\n1. Does this mean the \"-n\" and \"-N npr\" options are mutually exclusive?\n\n\n2. Does \"-N 3\" mean the task to generate an .hdr image will be split\ninto 3 parallel rendering processes by Radiance behind the scene\nregardless of the number of CPUs and number of \"cores\" within each CPU\nof the computer?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007911.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "June 16, 2011 at 01:55AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007901", "id": "radiance-general_007911"}
