{"body": "Dear Lars,\n\n\nThanks for your prompt reply!\n\n\nI've tried the \"-N npr\" option, and here's the error message i got when i\nrun \"rad -N 6 ./test.rif\" or \"rad -N 4 ./test.rif\" or \"rad -N 2 ./test.rif\":\n\n\nrpiece: no NFS lock manager on this machine\nrad: error rendering view 1\n\n\nI don't know the meaning of the error message, and I found no information by\nsearching the email list.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, It seems I can get rad up and running by using \"rad -N 1\n./test.rif\" or just \"rad ./test.rif\".\n\n\nI'm using a PC with Inter Core i7 CPU (8 cores, I guess based on what I see\non the task manager... )\n\n\nSo, can you kindly advice me on:\n1. why the \"-N 6\" cann't be accepted when I want to utilize 6 of the 8 cores\nof my CPU to speed up the rendering?\n2. dose the npr means \"number of processors/CPU\" rather than \"number of\ncores within each CPU\"?\n3. how to specify rad options to harness multi-core CPU's capability?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007913.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "June 16, 2011 at 02:51AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007912", "id": "radiance-general_007913"}
