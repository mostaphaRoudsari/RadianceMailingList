{"body": "> Hi, Lars, I'm using windows 7. Thanks!\n\n\nI do not know about the locking capabilities in Windows. Anyone out here \nhaving experience with rpiece on Windows 7?\n\n\nWhat is happening is that rad starts render processes. As these are \nsupposed to share the ambient data (ambfile) to speed up the work, there \nmust be a mechanism doing the coordination work on accessing this file. \nThis is done using file lock (basically you need to make sure that one \nprocess does not write data while another is reading, but waits for the \nread to complete).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007916.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
