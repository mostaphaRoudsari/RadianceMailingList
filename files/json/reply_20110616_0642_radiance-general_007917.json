{"body": "Dear Ji Zhang and Lars,*\n\n\n*Windows (whatever the version 7, Vista, XP) doesn't have a NFS lock\nmanager. (So rpiece will NOT work).*\n*Maybe one has been written for Cygwin, but I doubt it.\n\n\nIf you want to use Radiance on multiple core's your best option is MAC OS or\nUnix/Linux (Ubuntu seems to be user friendly).\n\n\nAnother option would be to install Interix/SUA/SFU (Windows services for\nUnix) on Windows 7 (or Vista or XP). And compile Radiance from source.\nI don't think anyone has tried to compile Radiance using SFU, so no\nguarantees here.*\n*\nI hope this helps,\n\n\nGuy*\n*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007917.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "June 16, 2011 at 06:42AM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007914", "id": "radiance-general_007917"}
