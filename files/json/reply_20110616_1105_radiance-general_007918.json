{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> If you want to use Radiance on multiple core's your best option is MAC\n> OS or Unix/Linux (Ubuntu seems to be user friendly).\n\n\nSure, that is the preferred way. However, I would consider how much \nrendering work you expect. If it justifies setting up a dedicated \nmachine - do it unix-like. If it is not that much rendering time, you \nare still free to\n\n\na) wait and have rad sequentially render images using one core\n\n\nb) split your renderings and manually start processes - as long as they \ndo not need to share data, you do not need locking\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007918.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
