{"body": "The thread is veering off topic, but I can't resist chiming in...\n\n\nI'm not sure that OSX has any true advantage over Ubuntu or maybe another modern user friendly linux distribution purely for Radiance usage. The only advantage I see to OSX over linux is that it's more popular, so you'll see more frequent pre-compiled binaries floating around - for Radiance itself and any tools that users develop. On the other hand, linux has a strong advantage in terms of lower barrier to entry - it is cheaper to buy/inherit any old desktop box and install Ubuntu on it than to get a hold of a top notch Mac machine. It is even quite possible to set up an existing Windows machine to dual-boot into Ubuntu as necessary. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\n\nWindows implementation has the lowest barrier to entry in most cases, but shortfalls such as no file locking, X11 support, friendliness for programming/scripting, etc. On the other hand some common modeling tools such as Autodesk products are Windows native - so could avoid additional machines.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007921.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "June 16, 2011 at 12:07PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007914", "id": "radiance-general_007921"}
