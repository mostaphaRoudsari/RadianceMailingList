{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nThanks for the reply.  My errors are in absolute terms.  I have a Minolta\nluminance meter and a Macbeth grey card in the middle of the scene.  I am\nalso doing comparisons of absolute luminance values produced by the FireFly\nas compared to the luminance results from my Canon camera on images captured\nat the same time of the same scene.  I have high confidence in my Canon\nresults from previous validations.  The HDR that Photosphere resolves for\nthe Firefly at first look reasonable within the scene \u00ad it has logical\nvariation in luminance values.  It is the absolute errors that I am worried\nabout. \n\n\nThanks! \n\n\n\n\nKevin Van Den Wymelenberg\nIntegrated Design Lab \u00ad Boise, Director\nCollege of Art & Architecture, Assistant Professor\nUniversity of Idaho \u00ad Boise Center\nwww.uidaho.edu/idl \n\n\nph. 208.724.9456                    fx. 208.343.0001                    306\nS. 6th Street                    Boise, ID  83702\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-June/000332.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg", "created_at": "June 17, 2011 at 02:55PM", "created_by": "Kevin_Van_Den_Wymelenberg", "parent_id": "hdri_000330", "id": "hdri_000332"}
