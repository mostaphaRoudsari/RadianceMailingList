{"body": "If your relative proportions are accurate, that means Photosphere is doing a good job of solving for the system response.  However, there's no way for it to solve for the absolute calibration.  It just uses a value that is approximate based on ISO, which it sounds like you don't know.  Select a region you've measured and use the \"Apply\" button to calibrate against your measured luminance.  Use the dialog option to save this factor for your camera and you should be good from then on.  (You'll need to be consistent about the camera make, model, and version in your added Exif header, though.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-June/000333.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 17, 2011 at 03:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000330", "id": "hdri_000333"}
