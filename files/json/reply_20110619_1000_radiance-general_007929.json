{"body": "You are correct.  There is no way to directly specify the exact output file name, which is constructed from the root name you give and the view name, separated by an underscore ('_') and followed by the \".hdr\" suffix.  If you want a different name, you either have to run the rpict command yourself or, easier, rename the file after rad is done using \"mv\" or similar.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007929.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 19, 2011 at 10:00AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007927", "id": "radiance-general_007929"}
