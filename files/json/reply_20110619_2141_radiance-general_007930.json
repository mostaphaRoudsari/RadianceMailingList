{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI am using DIVA for Rhino to do the renderings. It looks like the\nrpict view parameters used in DIVA are the following:\n-vta -vp 1275.98 31.928 229.686 -vd -17.783 -2.785 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 180\n-vv 180 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0\n\n\nDIVA outputs a pic file with a 180 degree fisheye view and I was\nhoping that I could mask all but a 60 and 120 degree cone of vision\nwithin the image so that I can calculate maximum and minimum pixel\nvalues within these smaller views. Rectangular areas for calculating\naverages would work.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nKrystyna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 17, 2011 at 3:43 PM, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007930.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Krystyna Zelenay", "created_at": "June 19, 2011 at 09:41PM", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007924", "id": "radiance-general_007930"}
