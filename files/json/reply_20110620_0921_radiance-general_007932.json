{"body": "Dear Greg, Thanks for you reply!\n\n\nActually, I was asking whether we can specify the directory where the .hdr\nimage generated by rad will be saved.\n\n\nI just found out that it can be done, and the \"root name\" for the PICTURE\nvariable of rad can include the path where the image file will be placed\nonce it's generated.\n\n\ne.g.\n\"PICTURE = /Volumes/ZJ_1TB/test/rad_image\" will save the \"rad_image_vw1.hdr\"\nfile in the following place: \"/Volumes/ZJ_1TB/test\".\n\n\nAnyway, thanks for the clarification!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007932.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "June 20, 2011 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007927", "id": "radiance-general_007932"}
