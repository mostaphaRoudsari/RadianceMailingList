You should always test\nyour commands manually before you use them in a Python \"os.system()\" call.\n\n\nNote 1: If you use the return value of the os.system() call to check if the\ncommand was successful you will get a \"0\" (=success) if the command with \"&\"\nwas started successfully, not if it actually run without errors.\n\n\nNote 2: \"os.system()\" was replaced by \"Popen()\" in the \"subprocess\" module.\n\n\nNote 3: If you use your Python script only to automate a simple sequence of\ntasks you should be fine with using rad directly in the script. For more\ncontrol over the processes and their success/failure you should use the\nunderlying programs \"oconv\", \"rpict\", \"pfilt\" etc. directly. Unfortunately\nthe project to write a nice little Python wrapper library for Radiance\ndidn't really get of the ground ...\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007935.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 20, 2011 at 10:14AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007926", "id": "radiance-general_007935"}
