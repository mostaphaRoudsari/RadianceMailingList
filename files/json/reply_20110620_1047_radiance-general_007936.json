{"body": "Dear Thomas and Robert,\n\n\nThank you very much for your prompt advice! Seems I need to bear in mind\nthat Radiance is developed in UNIX environment initially and a lot of UNIX\nconventions can be utilized.\n\n\nAs to Thomas comments on Python wrapper library for Radiance, I think my\ncolleague Dr Patrick Janssen is exploring on that direction by testing it on\na procedure modeling software platform called Houdini (www.sidefx.com).\n\n\nActually, most of the questions I post here were derived in the learning\nprocess of connecting Houdini and Radiance (as well as other building\nperformance simulation software) via the Python interface built into\nHoudini.\n\n\nSome of the work-in-progress can be found in Dr Janssen's teaching website:\nhttp://patrickjanssenstudio.blogspot.com/\n\n\n- Cheers, Ji\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 21, 2011 at 1:14 AM, Thomas Bleicher\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007936.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "June 20, 2011 at 10:47AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007926", "id": "radiance-general_007936"}
