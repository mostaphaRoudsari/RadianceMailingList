{"body": "Hi Ji!\n\n\n> Thank you very much for your prompt advice!

It is the base of \nwhat can be done on any Linux/BSD/Solaris/Mac OS system these days, and \nhas been for the last 30 years, which is due to its rather generic \nconceptual nature. Working with processes, inputs and outputs, \nredirection, filters, is all very useful here and works on all \nunix-based platforms.\n\n\n> Actually, most of the questions I post here were derived in the learning\n> process of connecting Houdini and Radiance (as well as other building\n> performance simulation software) via the Python interface built into\n> Houdini.\n>\n> Some of the work-in-progress can be found in Dr Janssen's teaching\n> website: http://patrickjanssenstudio.blogspot.com/\n\n\nCool, thank you for sharing the link. Are you also going to use \nsimulation results as input for modeling, such as design optimization? \nMaybe there will be some work shared on a coming Radiance workshop? Say \nhello to SDE folks, Shinya is references on the blog, too :-)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007937.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
