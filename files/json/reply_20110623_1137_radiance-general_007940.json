{"body": "Interesting discussion! Would love to see the Houdini2Radiance\n pipeline in the workshop, but i don't think i'll be in Liege. \nSome time ago i had a strong wish of having a Python wrapper for \nRadiance, but i could not find any, and i found the project to \noverwhelming to just start myself. Besides that i use Python \nmerely for everyday scripting with 3d, so skillfully designing \nmodules is a different cup of tea. Is there any fragment of a \nproject like that around that i might have missed?\n\n\nAksel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007940.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aksel Gross", "created_at": "June 23, 2011 at 11:37AM", "created_by": "Aksel_Gross", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007926", "id": "radiance-general_007940"}
