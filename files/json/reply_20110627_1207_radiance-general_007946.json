{"body": "It might be possible to get full Radiance going under Windows 7 \nUltimate, which has a Unix emulation environment.  However, doing this \nrequires development time and the purchase of a copy of Ultimate and \npossibly a copy of the MS Visual Studio suite as well.  To run the \nresulting package might also require users to buy Ultimate.\n\n\nSo...one more thing we might try, if we had the resources and if there \nwere enough interest.\n\n\nRandolph M.
