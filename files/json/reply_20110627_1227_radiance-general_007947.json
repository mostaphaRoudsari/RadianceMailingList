{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nGreat thinking! I like the idea already!\n\n\nBut could you give a bit more information?\n\n\n> It might be possible to get full Radiance going under Windows 7\n> Ultimate, which has a Unix emulation environment.\n\n\nAre you referring to SFU (Windows Services for Unix, or SUA or Interix, or\nhow its called now)?\nSFU has an (old) gcc compiler. (See: http://suacommunity.com/SUA.aspx)\n(other tools are in the warehouse or developer packages).\n\n\n> However, doing this\n> requires development time and the purchase of a copy of Ultimate and\n> possibly a copy of the MS Visual Studio suite as well.\n\n\nWhy would you need MSVC? As far as I know MSVC only compiles win32 (or\nwin64) code, so no Unix, no fork and no NSF.\n\n\nOh, and one more thing, if it is SFU you are referring to, then it is also\navailable for Vista, (and XP with an hack).\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007947.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "June 27, 2011 at 12:27PM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007922", "id": "radiance-general_007947"}
