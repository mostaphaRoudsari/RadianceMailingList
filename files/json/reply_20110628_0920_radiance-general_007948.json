In any event, there's a new version of \nthe SUA in Windows 7.  MS claims support for fork()/exec() and \nfcntl()/F_SETLKW.  If these claims for compatibility (and some others) \nare valid, full Radiance will operate in the Windows 7/Windows Server \n2008 SUA.

As far as I know MSVC only compiles win32 (or \n> win64) code, so no Unix, no fork and no NSF.\n\n\nMS says that MSVC can be used with the SUA, though perhaps is not \nnecessary...or perhaps it is.  It would be very hard to get gcc \nproblems fixed in that environment.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007948.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
