Anyone tried this before?\n> Did you get it to work?\n\n\nI think the answer is \"no.\"  The Radiance code doesn't work with that \ncompiler, even with optimization turned off.  I would like to chase \nthose bugs down, but I don't think I have time right now.\n\n\nSigh.  Back to the (slower) gcc.\n\n\nMeantime, here's a few more buglets the icc found:\n\n\n- In ccyrgb.c, rgb2ccy has two return statements, and only one of them \nreturns a value.\n\n\n- In tmapcolrs.c, tmMapPicture, returnErr will reference the unset tms \npointer if the arguments are bad.  I believe this can be fixed by \ninitializing tms to NULL.\n\n\n- In tmaptiff.c, tmMapTIFF, same problem.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph M.
