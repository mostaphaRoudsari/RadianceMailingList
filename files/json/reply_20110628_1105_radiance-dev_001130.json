Bik, who\napparently got \"the highest Intel award for making (..) SSE easier to\nuse through automatic vectorization\". (there's probably already a\nposting on the list on that).\nMy enquiries into locating industrial funds to look into this had been\nstopped then, mostly by Greg stating that setting up vectors takes\nlonger then gaining cycles. I don't have enough insight into the way\nRadiance spends its time and the mystics of automatic vectorizing\ncompilers to be definitive there. Industry sources stated that anything\nbelow a considerable speed-up-factor (say 2 at least) isn't worth\nlooking into.\n\n\nHowever, between 2004 and 2011, follow-on SSE generations and the\nincreased use of computing power graphics cards appeared, whose\nfunctions should at least be checked.\nIf there's someone on the list with some insights and/or experience,\nplease drop a note.\n\n\nOne of the mantras I do easily agree with is that dissecting runtime\nprofiles of different type of scenes gotta be worth the dirty work.\n\n\nIMHO, apart from speed-ups, it'll be sound if Radiance compiled on\ndifferent compilers and run.\n\n\ncheers\nPeter\n\n\n\n\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-June/001130.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "June 28, 2011 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001126", "id": "radiance-dev_001130"}
