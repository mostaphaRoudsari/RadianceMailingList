{"body": "Hi, Steph,\n\n\nNot sure if it's helpful but please refer to Axel Jacob's tutorial in page\n40 (\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/radiance_cookbook.pdf\n).\n\n\nAccording to Axel, the illuminance value (lux) of a point is calculated by\nusing the following formula:\nIlluminance = 179*(R_irradiance*.265 + G_irradiance*.67 + B_irradiance*.065)\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if a Luminance value can be converted and split back into RGB\nradiance values.\n\n\nSo, maybe the experts here can give you more clearer advices.\n\n\n- Cheers, Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007950.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "July 07, 2011 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007949", "id": "radiance-general_007950"}
