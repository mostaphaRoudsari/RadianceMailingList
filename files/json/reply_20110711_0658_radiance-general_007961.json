{"body": "I hope I'm not interrupting the sense of the discussion, but I kind of have\nthe same question: when is about the properties\nof materials (RGB plus roughness and specularity). If I want to simulate an\nexisting material in Radiance I need to\ndecompose it in the 3 primary colours.\n\n\nAs I understand Radiance uses Hemispherical Reflectance (ratio of flux\nleaving the surface to the incident flux). I have this\ndata from the site...but how to get it to RGB in the case that I dont have\nan spectrophotometer to measure. One way I know\ncould be using a grey scale chart, but then I also need to know under which\nlight source were those reflectances calculated\nin order to compare them to my luminances. The objective of all this is to\nobtain illuminance calculations.\n\n\nSorry again for the interruption...hope anybody has an answer.\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nMin.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007961.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chantal Basurto", "created_at": "July 11, 2011 at 06:58AM", "created_by": "Chantal_Basurto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007949", "id": "radiance-general_007961"}
