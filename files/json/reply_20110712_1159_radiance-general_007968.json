{"body": "Hi Giovanni,\n\n\nI think that what you need to look at is actually specular jitter and \nthreshold (-sj and -st), -ms is for something unrelated assuming I \nremember correctly.\n\n\nAnother factor that can contribute to the appearance of a \"pattern\" \n(sort of striated) in material with specular and roughness components is \nthat fact that Radiance use pseudo random sampling. One way to make this \ngo away (albeit at some expense in terms of compute time as well as \nrequiring higher image oversampling) is to use the -u switch for \nuncorrelated monte carlo sampling.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/12/2011 2:43 PM, Giovanni Betti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007968.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 12, 2011 at 11:59AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007966", "id": "radiance-general_007968"}
