{"body": "Thank you all for taking time to answer my questions...actually your reply\nis really helping me to put things into context.\n\n\n*A fast reply:*\nThe data I have is only luminance (cd/m2), from walls, ceiling and floor of\na real room. The intention is to simulate\nthat room in Radiance, and one of those walls in reality is orangish so in\nthis case color might matters as the reflectance\nof the material will affect the lighting environment in the room. The aim is\nobtaining illuminance levels in simulation\ncloser to reality (measurements I already took).\n\n\nAs far as I know, in order to describe the materials in a virtual model,\nRadiance takes 3 values which correspond to RGB. This\nis my question...how to reproduce real material properties in Radiance\n(closest to reality).\n\n\nI'll have a look to the method using the grey scale chart and using the\nMacbeth ColorChecker Chart as you mentioned.\nI highly appreciate that you pointed me in this direction...\n\n\nBut I'm pretty sure that I'll be here around with more questions in the near\nfuture.  :)\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\nBest Regards.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007971.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chantal Basurto", "created_at": "July 13, 2011 at 06:01AM", "created_by": "Chantal_Basurto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007949", "id": "radiance-general_007971"}
