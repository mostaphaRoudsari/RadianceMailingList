{"body": "Hello experts:\n\n\nIf using -m option in rtcontrib, can I calculate the contribution from a\ngeneral object that does not belong to light source, such as objects having\nplastic materials?\n\n\nMy model has two windows, and I want to calculate the contribution of each\nwindow to the illuminance at sensor points. The \"Three-Phase Daylight\nCoefficient\" method works. But for simple windows, can I directly calculate\nthe contribution using rtcontrib or others?   Any suggestion is greatly\nappreciated.\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007973.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 13, 2011 at 02:22PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_003046", "id": "radiance-general_007973"}
