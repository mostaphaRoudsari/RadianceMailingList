{"body": "Hi Julitta,\n\n\nI am very short on time right now, but under applications/utilities you \nshould find an application called X11. If you start it, you get a window \nwith a command line waiting for input. That is what folks here usually \ncall command line or shell. And this is where you input all those \ncommands that are usually referenced.\n\n\nHope this helps for the beginning. You do not need XAMP (which should \nmean OSX, Apache, MySQL and PHP) - delete it right now :-)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007986.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
