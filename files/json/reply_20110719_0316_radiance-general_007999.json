That \nassumes that it is actually in one of the directories in your path \nvariable. In your case, that seams not to be the case, as the \nwhich-command did not give any output.\n\n\nCan you verify that your Radiance-binaries (the bin-subdirectory of the \nRadiance installation) is included in your Path variable?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
