{"body": "Thanks a bunch for the replies so far. \n\n\nJack - OSX doesn't seem to have a limits.conf configuration file... \n\n\nDavid - switching the .bash_profile line in my home folder from \"ulimit -S -n 4096\" to \"ulimit -n 4096\" didn't make the change.. \n\n\nAndy - thanks for the sudo explanation - that makes sense as to why it's not making the change. I do have admin privileges, but for some reason I still can't get ulimit to change the limit over 1024. \n\n\nOddly enough, I can get ulimit to lower the maximum number of open files, something like ulimit -n 512 works fine and changes the setting. What I can't do is then increase back to 1024 - I get the 'operation not permitted' message. When I restart my machine, the limit returns to 1024. I can use ulimit and lower it to 1023, but even when I try ulimit -n 1025, I still get the message: \nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008017.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Martinez", "created_at": "July 20, 2011 at 01:14PM", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008013", "id": "radiance-general_008017"}
