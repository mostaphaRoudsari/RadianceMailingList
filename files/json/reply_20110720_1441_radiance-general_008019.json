{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\nEveryone was so busy on your second question, looks like the first one was neglected:\n\n\n> Multi-core runs question:\n> The following command uses 8 processors and successfully generates a bin of 578 .hdr images based on test.oct made of scene geometry, material descriptions and an isotropic sky:\n>  \n> vwrays -ff -vf view.vf -x 800 -y 800 | rtcontrib -n 8 -ab 3 -ad 4000 -as 1000 -dt .05 -ds .1 -dc .17 -lw 9e-19 -e MF:2 -ffc $(vwrays -d -vf view.vf -x 800 -y 800)  -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -o bin/%0d.hdr -m sky_glow  -w tmp/test.oct\n\n\nI can't be sure, but most likely you've run into the \"bin counting problem.\"  Quoting the rtcontrib man page:\n\n\n\tThe actual bin number is computed at run time based\n       on ray direction and surface intersection, as described below.  If  the\n       number of bins is known in advance, it should be specified with the -bn\n       option, and this is critical for output files containing multiple  val-\n       ues  per  record.   A  variable  or constant name may be given for this\n       parameter if it has been defined via a previous -f or -e option.  Since\n       bin numbers start from 0, the bin count is always equal to the last bin\n       plus 1.  Set the this value to 0 if  the  bin  count  is  unknown  (the\n       default).\n\n\nNot having the -bn option causes trouble in a lot of cases where there isn't always a ray striking the last bin.\n\n\nHope this fixes it!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 20, 2011 at 02:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008012", "id": "radiance-general_008019"}
