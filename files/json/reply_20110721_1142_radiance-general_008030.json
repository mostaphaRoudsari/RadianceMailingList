{"body": "Hi, Jia, Thanks for the clarification!\n\n\n\n\nWell, if this is the case, does it mean that:\n\n\nEither\n1.GenCumulativeSky requires \"direct horizontal irradiance\" as input for\ncalculation, but we can only feed in the \"direct normal radiation\" as that\nis what we can get from EnergyPlus weather file. Then, GenCumulativeSky will\n\"internally\" transform the \"direct normal radiation\" into \"direct horizontal\nirradiance\" by applying the formula: \"Direct Horizontal Irradiance = Direct\nNormal Irradiance *  Sin(Sun_Altitude)\".\n\n\nOr\n2. What is used in GenCumulativeSky's internal calculation is actually\n\"direct normal irradiance\". Then what is stated in the \"Solar Irradiation\nModeling\" document is not correct.\n\n\n\n\nSo, Jia, Can you kindly help to check if the above is correct?\n\n\nAnd Dear Darren Robinson, if you can receive this email, can you also kindly\ncomment?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008030.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "July 21, 2011 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008024", "id": "radiance-general_008030"}
