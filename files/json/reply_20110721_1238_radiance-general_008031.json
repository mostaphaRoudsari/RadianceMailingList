{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI am not familiar with this program. I just skim its code. This program use\nHorizontal Irradiance values, Not normal. In its \"cPerezSkyModel.cpp\" file,\nyou can see this:\n\n\nif (m_SolarAlt > 0)\nIbn=Ibh/sin(m_SolarAlt);\n\n\nIt converts \"direct horizontal\" (lbh) to \"direct normal\" (lbn) and then use\nlbn in other parts in this class.It is better to re-calculate \"Direct\nhorizontal irra\" which would be served as an input\n\n\nAnother option is to revise some parts of the code. Change the above code to\nthe follows and rebuild to get a new .exe file:\n\n\nif (m_SolarAlt > 0)\nIbn=Ibh;\n\n\n\n\nIn your input weather file (txt), the first column is \"global horizontal\"\nand the second column is \"direct normal\". Then you set -G option in its\ncommand.\n\n\nI have not tested the second method.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008031.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 21, 2011 at 12:38PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008024", "id": "radiance-general_008031"}
