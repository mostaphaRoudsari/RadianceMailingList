{"body": "Hi George,\n\n\nThe \"no light sources found\" error is because there is no sun in your sky\nmodel. The celestial hemisphere's sky glow is indeed just that, it's\nmodeled as a \"glow\" source in Radiance. Glows are only picked up in the\nambient calculation, so you need to have -ab set to at least 1. You have\n-ab 5, so you should be good. As the message states, it's not an error,\nmerely a warning. You're good.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/27/11 6:32 AM, \"P George Lovell\" <p.g.lovell at st-andrews.ac.uk> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008040.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 27, 2011 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008039", "id": "radiance-general_008040"}
