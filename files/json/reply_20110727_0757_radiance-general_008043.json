{"body": "By the way... is the warning not somehow obsolete and misleading in \ntimes, where a lot of tools of the Radiance toolkit rely on scenes \nincluding no light-type objects? I think I would prefer to have the \nwarning removed, as it may be more irritating then helpful these days. \nIf there was a simple way to check whether a scene contains neither \nlight nor glow object, that would be useful - but probably not that easy \nto detect.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
