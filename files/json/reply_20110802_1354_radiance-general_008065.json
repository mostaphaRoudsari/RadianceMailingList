{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\n> Wouldn't it be easier to install Radiance 3.8 or 3.9 in Win7 through\n> installing DaySim or DIVA for Rhino?\n\n\nYes, you're right ofcource, that's the easy way to install Radiance! ;-)\n\n\nBut the idea (and the credits go to Randolph actually) was to see\nhow wel Radiance would do with SUA. (Subsystem for Unix based Applications).\nSUA is advertised as being Unix on Windows, with, well everything: fork,\nbash, NFS, X11 support etc.\n\n\nAnd it works very wel, today I got rvu and falsecolor running on Win 7.\nTrad doesn't work (segfaults) and rpiece only calculates 7 out of 8 image\npaches (leaves one black spot),\nmight have done something wrong because rpiece complained about a -pm\nsetting.\n\n\nThe performance also isn't bad: 32 minutes for Mark Stock's benchmark test\non a Intel 2600K (@3.8GHz) system.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "August 02, 2011 at 01:54PM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008058", "id": "radiance-general_008065"}
