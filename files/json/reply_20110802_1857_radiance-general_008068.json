That is really wonderful news (and thank you for the credit.)  \nThat rpiece worked at all is very cool and gives me some hope that we \ncan make it work consistently.\n\n\nBased on this news I am hopeful that we will eventually be able to do a \nproper release of Radiance for Windows Ultimate, if we can find the \ntime to do the work.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nOn 2011-08-02 13:54:16 -0700, Guy Vaessen said:\n\n\n> Hi Ji,\n> \u00a0\n> > Wouldn't it be easier to install Radiance 3.8 or 3.9 in Win7 through\n> > installing DaySim or DIVA for Rhino?\n> \u00a0\n> Yes, you're right ofcource, that's the easy way to install Radiance! ;-)\n> \u00a0\n> But the idea (and the credits go to\u00a0Randolph actually) was to see\n> how wel Radiance would do with SUA.
