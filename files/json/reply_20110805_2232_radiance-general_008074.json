{"body": "Hi, all,\n\n\nBTW, there's only a \"reinhard.cal\" file in C:\\Radiance\\lib rather than the\n\"reinhart.cal\" file as mentioned in Axel's tutorial.\n\n\nAre they the same?\n\n\nThe \"reinhard.cal\" file is \"Erik Reinhard's simple global tone-operator\"\naccording to the header of the file.\n\n\nIs the \"reinhart.cal\" file as mentioned by Axel's a different .cal file that\nwas created by Christoph Reinhart in Harvard? If it is, may I know where can\nwe find this file?\n\n\n- Thanks! Ji.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008074.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "August 05, 2011 at 10:32PM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008071", "id": "radiance-general_008074"}
