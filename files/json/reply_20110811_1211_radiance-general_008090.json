{"body": "I think if you specify the time with a time zone designation like GMT, the -m parameter is ignored.\n\n\n> the gensky command is: \"gensky 1 1 9:00GMT -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m 0\" or \"gensky 1 1 9:00 -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m 0\"\n\n\nI have always assumed (but would like to confirm and open for discussion), if you give a date that is outside of the daylight savings time period (say January) but give a time of 9:00BST, would it incorrectly apply the 1 hour offset? In other words, the user or script must manually determine for the date in question, if the time should be given on the command line as 9:00GMT or 9:00 BST. \n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008090.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 11, 2011 at 12:11PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008088", "id": "radiance-general_008090"}
