{"body": "> Will Radiance work on a Unix emulator, say Exceed and Exceed 3D on Windows XP? Sorry of this question is irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\nHi Jun,\n\n\nExceed is not a Unix emulator, but a X-Server. That means it can be used \nto display GUI-windows, most probably also those by Radiance. However, \nyou still need to provide a rudimentary unix environment, unless you run \nthe Radiance binary on a remote system and use the Xserver only for the \nGui (e.g. by tunnelling the X-protocol through a X-session. That works \nfine with Radiance as any X-based program.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
