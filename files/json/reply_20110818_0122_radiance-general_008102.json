This will allow you to use rpiece (or, more conveniently,\nrpictmt which is a wrapper around rpiece) to utilise all processor\ncores for parallel rendering. I'm doing this every day because my\nmachine at work has Windows on it. It works rather nicely. This\napproach is also explained in the same document.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008102.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "August 18, 2011 at 01:22AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008098", "id": "radiance-general_008102"}
