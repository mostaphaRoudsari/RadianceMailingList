{"body": ">>* IMHO, apart from speed-ups, it'll be sound if Radiance compiled on*>>* different compilers and run.*\n\n\nGood news:\n\n\nRadiance can be compiled on: Intel C++ Compiler XE version 12 Update 5\nLinux version (released 29 of July).\n(Please make sure to download this version as the Parallel processing\nsuite contains an older version, that probably does not work).\n\n\nThe following line in the makefile Case 2:  set extras=CC=gcc has to\nbe changed into set extras=CXX=icpc\n(This invokes the Intel C++ compiler (icpc), the Intel C compiler\n(icc) doesn't work (segfaults)).\n\n\nFor compile options I used -O3 and I ran Mark Stock's benchmark with\nrpict. (I still need to try all other programs).\n\n\nThe time needed was 21m 4.674s. (System Intel 2600K @3.8GHZ, 64-bits\nLinux (Kubuntu))\n\n\nOther Compilers able to compile Radiance:\nNote: I only tried the C Compiler, maybe the C++ compilers perform even better.\n\n\nOracle Solaris Compiler Suite v12.2 with -O5 rpict time 20m 59.109s\n\n\nAMD Open64 Compiler v4.2.5.2 Generates internal compiler error with\nanything higher than -O1 (filled in a bug report for AMD to fix).\nrpict time 40m 33.7s\n\n\nThe Solaris Compiler seems to be a little bit faster, but maybe some\nextra optimizations can be set for the Intel compiler.\nAlso I have to compare these results with GCC and maybe the PGI compiler.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-August/001133.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "August 22, 2011 at 03:13PM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001126", "id": "radiance-dev_001133"}
