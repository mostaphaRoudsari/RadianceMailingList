{"body": "Hi Dharam,\n\n\nI guess you would be able to implement a reprojection for the images, \neither using Radiance's tools or any other software. You could e.g. \nstart with vwrays -vta (...), which would give you for each pixel of \nyour required -vta-projection the corresponding vectors. Using rcalc, \nyou could calculate backwards at which pixel-coordinates in a \nvth-projected image of given dimensions the pixel-value for this \ndirection is found. The problem is that there will be some interpolation \nneeded in the process. I am not sure whether this will be faster then \nre-rendering the images. Did you keep all the files for the renderings, \nespecially the ambient data? Depending on how you did the renderings, \ndoing a second run with only changed view-parameters, but existing \nambient cache data could be very quick.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008139.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
