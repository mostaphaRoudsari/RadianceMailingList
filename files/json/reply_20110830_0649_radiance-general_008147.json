{"body": "Hi dhaRam!\n\n\nIn old times, we used .pic (picture) as a file extension in Radiance. \nThis however caused some confusion, as there are a lot of differen \nformats using the same extension. So some years ago, folks started to \nname Radiance \"image\" data files .hdr (high dynamic range). This is also \nofficially registred as a mime-type now, and in general is preferred. \nHowever Radiance does not really care about the name of your files.\n\n\nSo if your vht-projected image is in file fish.pic and you want to keep \nthe old naming, just adopt the command line accordingly.\n\n\n> 'pinterp -vf fish.hdr -vth -ff fish.hdr 1 > hemi.hdr'\n\n\nwill thus become\n\n\npinterp -vf fish.pic -vth -ff fish.pic 1 > hemi.pic\n\n\nBUT: If you have a closer look at Greg's mail, you will find that you do \nsomething quite different, and I do not really know why. Why do you use \nother parameters then Greg proposed?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008147.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
