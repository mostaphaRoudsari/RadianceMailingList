{"body": "Hi dhaRam,\n\n\nYour initial e-mail said you had -vth images and needed -vta, so that's the way I wrote the pinterp command, giving the original view first, then updating it with '-vta'.  The -x and -y resolution options are needed because pinterp otherwise defaults to 512x512, and you may not want that.  The default filling option ('-fa') should work fine in your case, which is why I didn't specify anything for -f.  Using '-ff' may result in some black pixels, which you don't want to send to evalglare as it would skew your results.\n\n\nA little experimentation should resolve any outstanding issues.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008149.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 30, 2011 at 08:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008138", "id": "radiance-general_008149"}
