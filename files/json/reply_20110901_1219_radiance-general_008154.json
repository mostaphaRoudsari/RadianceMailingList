{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\n\nthe -n option for multiple-core usage as it is implemented into rtrace\nis not working for rtrace_dc. In the (still unofficial) version of\nrtrace_dc of daysim 3.1, the -n  is supported but unfortunately does not\nhave any impact on the calculation speed... :-( . I've tested that\nalready. So with the current version it doesn't make sense to use this\noption and block the other cores.\nMaybe a later version supports this option.\n\n\nChristoph: An ambient file is not necessary for -n.\n\n\nBy the way, does anybody know, if there is a limit for the -n option in\nrtrace?\nI tested it on my new 48(!!) core machine, but couldn't use more than 9\ncores, the other processes are existent  but don't use any cpu-time....\n\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 01.09.2011 21:08, schrieb Mostapha Sadeghipour:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008154.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "September 01, 2011 at 12:19PM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008151", "id": "radiance-general_008154"}
