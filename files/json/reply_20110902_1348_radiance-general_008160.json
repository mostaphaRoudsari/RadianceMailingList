{"body": "Rachelle,\n\n\nI think I'd put the question to Vectorworks support: it may be a FAQ \nfor them.  Here's a few thoughts off the top of my head, but more \nquestions than answers, I fear.\n\n\nRadiance accepts input in its own surface model format, which is \nrelatively straightforward.  Radiance also supports import from the old \nAlias|Wavefront (\"obj\") format, which unfortunately does not seem to be \nsupported by Vectorworks.  You will have to do your own material format \nconversions; the material models used by rasterizing renderers are of \nlimited value in physically-based rendering and simulation.\n\n\nTo convert geometry, you would have to go through some intermediary \nprogram, either a conversion tool, another CAD system, or a home-brew \nVectorworks script.  SketchUp Pro is just about the only CAD system \nchoice I can think of on Mac--it works, but can produce messy geometry \nand may have problems with some complex curved geometries.  If you have \nany Windows systems around, it appears that there are a number of \nconverter choices: 3D Object Converter (claims to directly support \nRadiance format), Quick3D, AccuTrans, PolyTrans, and so on.  Rhino is \nan excellent Windows CAD tool generally and relatively inexpensive.\n\n\nLet us know what you end up doing!\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\n\n\nOn 2011-09-02 12:31:28 -0700, Rachelle Lemieux said:\n\n\n> I would really like to get into using Radiance software for daylighting \n> purposes, however am unsure how to convert files to use with the \n> software.
