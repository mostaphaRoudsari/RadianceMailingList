{"body": "Hi Dharam!\n\n\n> my question is now if i go by this index :-\n> if i consider dgp it wil state \"imperceptible glare\" and\n> if i consider dgi it will state \"perceptible\"\n\n\nDid you read Jan's publications on the development of the DGP? It is not \nsurprising to get different results using different methods - if the \nresults were identical, Jan would have done the work for nothing. One of \nthe keys is whether you have a large transmissive glazing/facade (high \nvertical illuminance) or more some small windows (high ratios max/min \nluminances). But again, it is best to read it from Jan's work, he spent \nsome time on it. One more nice introduction by Jan is available here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop8/Presentations/wienhold_rad_ws_2009_evalglare_intro.pdf\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008171.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
