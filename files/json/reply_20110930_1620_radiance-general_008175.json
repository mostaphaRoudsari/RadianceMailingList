{"body": "Hi Chris, Rob and Jan,\n\n\nHopefully this option will be added in the near future. For know I would\nlike to share the solution I came up with. To have the result on time I ran\nmultiple simulations at the same time instead of using multiple CPU's for\none simulation.\n\n\nIt's true that you cannot use multiple CPU's to run DAYSIM commands, but\nthere is no reason not to run multiple DAYSIM commands on one system as far\nas you have enough RAM. So you can divide the sensors and run them at the\nsame time on one system. This simple trick saved me a huge amount of time.\n\n\nHave a good weekend,\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Sep 1, 2011 at 2:19 PM, Jan Wienold\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008175.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "September 30, 2011 at 04:20PM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008151", "id": "radiance-general_008175"}
