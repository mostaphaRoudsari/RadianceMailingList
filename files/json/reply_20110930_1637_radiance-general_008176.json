{"body": "I guess I didn't read Jan's post very carefully, or I might have responded to his question about limits to the rtrace -n option.  There are no encoded limits.  As far as performance on many cores, I've gotten linear speedups with up to 24 processes, which is as many as I'm able to test.  The -x option will kill performance if not combined with -y, since it has to flush after the given number of rays, which means clearing the queue that often.\n\n\nThe -af setting IS important to rtrace -n if you set -ab > 0 and -aa > 0 also.  This is true of all parallel processes in Radiance.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008176.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 30, 2011 at 04:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008151", "id": "radiance-general_008176"}
