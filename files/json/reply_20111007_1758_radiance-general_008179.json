{"body": "Hi David, \n\n\nThe direct normal has been zero for several other timesteps with no error, though. I did temporarily change the code to where if direct or global was zero, I reset it to one, but I'd like to pass in the actual values, if possible, ya know? Maybe I'll try (if 0.0 then 0.0000000001) like you tried, and see how the results come out. What platform are you on? I'm not seeing the \"Illegal instruction: 4\" error ever...\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008179.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 07, 2011 at 05:58PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008177", "id": "radiance-general_008179"}
