{"body": "Getting the error is a good thing, my problem is that depending on how I call gendaylit, I either get or I don't and it prints garbage. Gendaylit is a little fragile when the sun's near the horizon anyway; Axel Jacobs pointed this out in his \"learning rtcontrib\" tutorial as well. \n\n\nAndy McNeil has a good idea that he illustrated in one of his talks at the Radiance Workshop, he looks for gendaylit errors and if thrown, he uses gensky instead. I'm trying to implement something similar here, but as I said the gendaylit STDERR is behaving unreliably, it seems. Maybe it's best to test for zero values in the weather input data and just default to gensky for those timesteps, or something. \n\n\nI dunno, I have a headache. Happy weekend y'all.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008181.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 07, 2011 at 06:41PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008177", "id": "radiance-general_008181"}
