{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI can replicate your error using the -L 0.0 parameter. However, as you \nincrease the number of zeroes out to -L 0.000000000000 the results \nchange to issue the warnings reported by David.\n\n\nfile ~/Documents/ray/bin/gendaylit reports on my Mac box:\n\n\n    gendaylit: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\n\nLooking at the source version of gendaylit I have, it uses atof to \nconvert a string to double. I would expect this to be where the odd \nbehaviour is coming from with the precision of the -L parameter.\n\n\n*Terrance Mc Minn\n**Lecturer, Department of Architecture\nBuilt Environment\n*\n*Curtin**University*\n*Email |*t.mcminn at curtin.edu.au <a.joske at curtin.edu.au>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008182.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance Mc Minn", "created_at": "October 08, 2011 at 12:55AM", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008177", "id": "radiance-general_008182"}
