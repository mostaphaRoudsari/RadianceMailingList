{"body": "Hi!\n\n\n> I'm wondering how to account for the irradiance caused by UV in rtrace.\n> I know by default (visible light) this is normally implemented\n> irradiance = 0.265*R_illum + 0.67*G_illum +0.065*B_illum\n\n\nThat assumes useage of the three channels for RGB. If you decide to use\nanother wavelength range, you have two options:\n\n\n1) Use one of the three channels for that wavelength range - and then,\nuse the radiance covered by that channel, so no summing up of channels.\n\n\n2) Set all three channels to the same. E.g. use all three with equal\nvalues for your UV range. That means a \"grey\" image. Then you can use\nany channel to get results. Advantage is that in some few places in the\ncode, useage of the three channels for RGB is assumed. This might lead\nto some wrong weighting if you choose option 1), so 2) seams to be\npreferable here.\n\n\nBesides, laws of physics apply...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008196.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
