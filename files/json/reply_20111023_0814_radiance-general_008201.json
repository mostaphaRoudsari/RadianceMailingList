{"body": "Hi Lars and Chris,\n\n\nThank you all for constructive discussions.\n\n\nI should've pointed out earlier that I'm only a novice user in Radiance.\n\n\n@Lars: do you mean like this? rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.33+$2*0.33+$3*0.33)' or \nrcalc -e '$1=0.4*($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)' ? the factor of 0.4 comes \nfrom dividing the wavelength spectrum of UVR (120-400nm) to PAR \n(400-700nm)...\n\n\n@Chris: do you mean I should scale my source and material definition by 4?\n\n\nMy apology if I didn't grasp your points clearly.\n\n\nThanks once again for your time and attention.\n\n\nKind Regards,\nRobert\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008201.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robert Ong", "created_at": "October 23, 2011 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "Robert_Ong", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008195", "id": "radiance-general_008201"}
