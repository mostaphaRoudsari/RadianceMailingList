{"body": "Andy,\n\n\nThanks for your response, but still no luck. I did get the right \nversion, but I download it again just in case.\n\n\nHere is my version: v6.3.26.0 date: 10/26/2011 installed in Windows 7 \nunder virtualbox under linux.\n\n\nI did go back to the preference page, and checked the right button. But \nstill the only file that I have is the a csv file. The content of that \nfile is not xml.\n\n\nFurther observation on my installation:\n\n\n1. No Radiance component installed. In the preference page, in the \nradiance tab, there is a note that if I want to have the radiance \ncomponent, then I have to download the right install file. I cannot find \nany install file with radiance component in the website, but I suppose \nthis does not matter for the purpose of generating XML?\n\n\n2. After the calculation (F9) in the glazing system library, there is \nalways a message like this:\n\n\n\"One of the layers for Glazing System 13 does not have detailed spectral \ndata or the spectral data analysis was disabled in Preferences. This may \nresult in incorrect results for optical properties such as SHGC and \nTVIS. Custom layers with detailed spectral data can be created in Optics \nand imported into the Window Library.\"\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nEry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/27/2011 10:23 AM, Andy McNeil wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008211.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ery Djunaedy", "created_at": "October 27, 2011 at 11:38AM", "created_by": "Ery_Djunaedy", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008209", "id": "radiance-general_008211"}
