{"body": "Dear Rob,\n   Thanks for letting us know that there is an effort by the Open Studio \nTeam to read gbXML models.\n   Are there aspects of a Radiance model that cannot be expressed well \nin gbXML unless you extend it (e.g. mirrors, .cal files, bsdf's (which \nhas its own xml), etc.)?  If not, are there any ongoing efforts by the \nRadiance community to develop a complete, standardized XML language that \ncan form the basis of creating a Radiance project?\n   Thanks,\n- Dan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-October/001145.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Glaser", "created_at": "October 28, 2011 at 02:21PM", "created_by": "Dan_Glaser", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001142", "id": "radiance-dev_001145"}
