{"body": "Dear Rob, Lars, and other list subscribers,\n  My original question was if the current gbXML schema can fully \nexpresses a Radiance model or project.  To summarize from www.gbxml.org:\n\n\nThe Green Building XML (gbXML) open schema helps facilitate the transfer \nof building properties stored in 3D building information models (BIM) to \nengineering analysis tools. Today, gbXML has the industry support of \nleading 3D BIM vendors... gbXML has become the defacto industry standard \nschema.\n\n\nI think it is important that a Radiance specification can be included in \nthis standard since it will make many more models available to run in \nRadiance without having to potentially \"kludge\" data types between file \nformats.  For example, Revit a popular modeling/BIM package supports \nexporting gbXML directly.  There are a few workarounds to get a Revit \nproject into Radiance that have been discussed on these boards, but \noften the Radiance project that is created still needs augmentation to \nbe built correctly.\n  Can people with experience encoding and decoding this specific XML \n(gbXML) please speak up about their experiences about what parts of \ngbXML translate into Radiance models/projects and what parts are missing?\n  gbXML 5.0 is under review until November 4th and will be finalized \nshortly after.  I know that one of the issues that was brought up at the \nRadiance workshop this past summer was to see increased adoption of \nRadiance and I think this standard can help support this goal.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n- Dan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-October/001149.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dan Glaser", "created_at": "October 31, 2011 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "Dan_Glaser", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001142", "id": "radiance-dev_001149"}
