{"body": "Hi Palbinder,\n\n\nFunny you should ask. At NREL we have been working on exactly that, a\nCmake build/dashboard system for cross platform building of Radiance. The\nproject is nearly complete, and Greg Ward has folded in the changes\nnecessary to make it work. We plan to go live with a support page on our\nOpenStudio website (openstudio.nrel.gov) that will include links to binary\ninstallers for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as instructions on how to\nadd your own machines to the dashboard. The more people add machines to\nthe dash, the more robust the testing environment becomes, since each\nmachine can be configured to grab the HEAD release, build and run some\ntests of the binaries. At the moment the test suite is not very robust,\nbut it at least attempts to exercise the core components of Radiance\n(oconv, rtrace, rpict, rtcontrib, genskyvec, dctimestep, xform). More\ntests can be added anytime, and as I said the more diverse the member\nsystems, the better the quality of the test results.\n\n\nA side bonus of the Radiance Dashboard project is that we now have a\nQt-based version of rvu, that will run on all three major platforms -- as\nin, we will finally have a Windows rvu!\n\n\nI hope to announce this project soon. I also gave a presentation on the\nproject at the Radiance Workshop in August:\n(http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop10/presentations/day2/RG_R\nadiance-dash.pdf)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/9/11 9:55 AM, \"Pally Sandher\" <pally.sandher at iesve.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-November/001151.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 09, 2011 at 09:11AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001150", "id": "radiance-dev_001151"}
