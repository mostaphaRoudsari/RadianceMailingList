{"body": "Thanks for answers,\n\n\nAfter detailed analysis of lamellas' SKetchUp geometry, I decided to\nsimplify it a little bit - so I replaced curved parts with really small\nradius with 2 polygons.\nWhen exported number of surfaces per lamella is much smaller, and I still\nget correct reflectances and overall blind transmittance, so I think this\nsimplified lamella geometry will work.\n\n\nSince I need in building lots of blinds, so I'll surely use instances and\nxform to put it all in building.\n\n\nCU,\nMarija.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008228.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "November 11, 2011 at 01:25AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008224", "id": "radiance-general_008228"}
