{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nYes, the Windows binary distribution is not quite finalized. I am working\nwith our staff here to get all those last Perl scripts included in the\nbinary distribution. We are also in the process of getting access to the\nRadiance source tree so we can automate the updates; when that is set up,\nwe will share those links with the community. In the meantime I can send\nyou falsecolor and genskyvec tomorrow.\n\n\nThanks for your patience, we're trying to get this all wrapped here\nshortly.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 16, 2011 at 09:11PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008223", "id": "radiance-general_008236"}
