{"body": "Right; thanks for pointing that out Greg. I thought genskyvec and genklemsamp have been working for a little while, and I know falsecolor works. Didn't know about genBSDF, thanks for the heads up.\n\n\nI wonder if the same issues would happen with Ruby? Hate to reinvent the wheel but from an OpenStudio support perspective, we'd actually be eliminating one dependency (Perl) but I get that most Radiance scripters are in Python land first and foremost, probably Perl second, and Ruby third (and then you have Andrew Marsh using Lua ;) ). Something for us to think about on this end, but I'd rather spend time wrapping Ian Ashdown's Perez sky generator first\u2026\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/17/11 8:06 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nThere may be some issues with Perl scripts and Windows.
