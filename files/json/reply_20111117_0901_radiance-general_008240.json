{"body": "There is also the problem that Windows doesn't ship with Perl installed.  A windows user has to install one of the windows ports of Perl (Active Perl, Strawberry Perl, etc) or we could provide packaged executables for windows systems using par-packer (http://search.cpan.org/~rschupp/PAR-Packer-1.010/lib/pp.pm).  We've gone the par-packer route for the Radiance Perl programs needed by COMFEN and Window6 - we can't really tell those users to install a windows port of a unix utility, the user support requests would be a nightmare.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Nov 17, 2011, at 8:06 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008240.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "November 17, 2011 at 09:01AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008223", "id": "radiance-general_008240"}
