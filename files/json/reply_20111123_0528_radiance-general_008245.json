{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nI just checked to see if that login still works. It seems to be fine. \nPlease try again, I know that the server is very picky about white \nspace, so if you cut and paste the password it may not work, better to \ntry typing it directly. If this does not work please send me an email \ndirectly and I will send the script via email.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/22/2011 4:25 PM, Galen Burrell wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008245.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "November 23, 2011 at 05:28AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008244", "id": "radiance-general_008245"}
