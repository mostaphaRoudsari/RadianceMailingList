{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nBy coming backward I meant something like this:\n\n\nIf I assume > 100 lux and <2000 lux as the acceptable range. Then I\nconsider 60% of VLT for the glazing and 80% of reflectivity for ceiling\nwith a very rough calculation I need > 100 lux /(0.6*0.8) and <2000 lux\n/(0.6*0.8) which is equal to  > 208 lux and <4166 lux. I know that I\ndisregarded many effective design aspects except the VT of the glazing, and\nthis way of calculation is not that accurate but it was the first thing\ncame to my mind to make an assumption for outdoor spaces like streets.\n\n\nThe other possible way with the same concept is to put the sensors inside\nthe adjacent interior spaces and then use the available daylight metrics.\nFor an urban design study I wanted to avoid measuring light levels inside\nthe buildings as far as possible.\n\n\nThe climate is cloudy enough to make a new London and unfortunately the\nonly effective code is solar hours in 21st of December which makes no sense\nto me. I think you literally count the number of solar hours in a\npotentially always going to be an overcast day.\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\nOn Mon, Nov 28, 2011 at 4:07 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008257.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "November 28, 2011 at 02:45PM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008255", "id": "radiance-general_008257"}
