{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\n\n> For an urban design study I wanted to avoid measuring light levels inside the buildings as far as possible.\n\n\nHow about using cumulative values, say annual or maybe monthly?  You could also look at just the hours of occupancy.  Some examples here:\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:urban-solar\n\n\nThe image for London clearly shows the effect of tall buildings reducing the ground level cumulative illuminance (actually, irradiance in the legend but just x 100 to estimate klux-hrs / yr). \n\n\nBest\nJohn\n\n\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, UK\nTel: +44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk   \nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\nhttp://dmu.academia.edu/JohnMardaljevic\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008260.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "November 30, 2011 at 08:26AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008255", "id": "radiance-general_008260"}
