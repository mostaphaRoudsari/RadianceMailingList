{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nThank you for clarification and explanation. It was so informative.\n\n\nI agree that using hours of sunshine (sunlight hours) in this way totally\nmake sense however in the code I mentioned it was a metric for building\nenvelopes (e.g. two hours of sunlight hours in 21st December is needed for\nresidential buildings).\n\n\nAs you said the weakness of metrics like VSC or Daylight Factor\n(SC+ERC+IRC) is not being climate-based and orientation sensitive but maybe\nthis is the best possible way for now.\n\n\nThanks,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008263.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "November 30, 2011 at 05:27PM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008255", "id": "radiance-general_008263"}
