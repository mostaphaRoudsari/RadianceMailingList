{"body": "Hi Tim,\n\n\nThe roughness will influence any transmitted specular component as well.\n\n\nYour calculation of trans parameters is off because your Rd is not 40% using RGB of 25%, 70% and 25%.  If you want 40% reflectance, you need to adjust the RGB to (0.181,0.508,0.181).  I computed these based on the Y function in \"ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal\".\n\n\nWith these changes, I get:\n\n\nvoid trans TransTreeMat\n0\n0\n7 0.272 0.761 0.272 0 0 0.33333 0.05\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008272.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 06, 2011 at 05:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008268", "id": "radiance-general_008272"}
