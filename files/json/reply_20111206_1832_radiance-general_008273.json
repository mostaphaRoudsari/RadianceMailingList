{"body": "Hi Tim,\n\n\nShort answer is that I have not calculated the run time differences for \nthe scenarios you suggest (at least not in recent memory). However I \nhave done lots of visualizations with LOTS of trees (using instanced \ntrees).  If you have lots of trees you probably need to use instances to \nhelp manage scene memory. If on the other hand you are only trying to \naccount for a few trees then perhaps you can get away with a relatively \n\"flat\" octree formation (eg using straight geometry not instancing \nfrozen octrees).\n\n\nPossibly pulling together this thread and your questions on trans \nmaterials, leaves on trees and annual simulations, I would offer a few \nthoughts though. I would suggest that having a trans material applied on \nyour leaves could increase your simulation time pretty significantly \ndepending on your run parameters, just think of all those trans \ncalculations that are occurring as a ray is traced from one trans to \nanother to another.... I would also suggest that for an annual (hourly) \nsimulation this level of simulation detail is probably not that critical...\n\n\nOthers I am sure will offer their (greater) wisdom.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nOn 12/6/2011 6:25 PM, Tim Perry wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008273.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 06, 2011 at 06:32PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008271", "id": "radiance-general_008273"}
