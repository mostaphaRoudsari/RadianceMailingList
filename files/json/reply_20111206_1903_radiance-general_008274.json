In an annual simulation context, I think we're talking about grid calcs and not pretty pictures (rtrace, not rpict; a bunch of points, not a view) -- the latter being too expensive. So with some experimentation you could probably create some simplified geometry or even a pattern to approximate the effect of the trees with a lower overhead (in terms of modeling time as well as computation time). \n\n\nTo answer your question about a beginner's list, this radiance-general list -- in addition to the list archives -- is \"open class\", serving beginners and experts for over a decade. You will love it here. \n\n\n- Rob G. \n\n\nOn Dec 6, 2011, at 7:32 PM, Jack de Valpine wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008274.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 06, 2011 at 07:03PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008271", "id": "radiance-general_008274"}
