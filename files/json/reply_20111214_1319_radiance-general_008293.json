{"body": "The Radiance calcuations are covered in Greg's papers on Radiance, many \nof what you can find on his web site at \n<http://anyhere.com/gward/papers.html>.  A tutorial overview is given \nin the book *Rendering with Radiance* which you can buy from, well, \nme--e-mail if you are interested.\n\n\nFor the specifics of the IES light source calculations the code, I \nthink, is the best reference.  Look in the ies2rad man page, ies2rad.c, \nand source.cal.\n\n\nRandolph M.
