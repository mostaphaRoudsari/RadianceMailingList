{"body": "Dear Randolph,\n\n\nthanks for the link to your thesis. It looks like that it covers again some of the missing links for my current puzzle :)\n\n\nEnjoy your vacation and best regards\nJan\n\n\n\n\nHi Randolph and Christoph,\n\n\nthanks for your feedback.\n\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n\n\n\nI have the \"Rendering with Radiance\" book and also read a lot of\ntutorials and have a understanding of how to render with radiance, but\na lot of the important stuff is fragmented within several places.\n\n\n\n\nI was just wondering if there were a short overview (with graphics)\nwhich describes in detail what is going in detail, but it seems like I\nhave to digg deeper and sort the puzzle...?\n\n\nTry my thesis at\nhttp://dmg.be.washington.edu/xmlsiteengine/browsers/static/publication222.html\n- I covered some of the ground there.  After that, the code and this\nlist is the resource.\n\n\nI'm going on vacation, and won't be answering questions for a week or\nso, but will do so afterwards.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008302.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan-Christoph Winter", "created_at": "December 15, 2011 at 08:00PM", "created_by": "Jan-Christoph_Winter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008288", "id": "radiance-general_008302"}
