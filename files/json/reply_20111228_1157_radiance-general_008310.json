{"body": "Lars,\n\n\nThank you for the response. I thought I had tried that in another test (which I had). Just tinkering around and looking at the original data, I realized that I had at some point switched on the -u option of pvalue to list only the unique values. Once I realized that, my full command line works! I'm sure that switching from a pic extension to hdr helped as well ;)\nI also realized that I would need to divide my 1's by 179 again to get back to the desired units in my images.\n\n\nThanks for the help! Hopefully I don't make any more mistakes when I wrap this into my script to generate the data.\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008310.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "December 28, 2011 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008308", "id": "radiance-general_008310"}
