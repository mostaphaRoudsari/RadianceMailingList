{"body": "Hi Jill,\n\n\nOlder versions of oconv had a lot of problems with really crazy geometry (usually crazy geometry that didn't need to be so crazy, like a zillion polygons defining a doorknob, or lots of coincident polys). You can increase the \u2013r option in oconv which helps, but increases compilation time and octree size. Two better solutions are 1) build the cleanest models you can, and 2) use a newer version of oconv.exe. You can grab a semi-recent version here:\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started/getting-started-windows\n\n\nScroll down to the \"Radiance Binaries\" section and there's a link there.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\nOn 1/9/12 3:46 PM, \"Jill Dalglish\" <jill at jilldalglish.com<mailto:jill at jilldalglish.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHello,\n\n\nI am getting an error message from oconv \"internal - set overflow in addobject <zone02.rad00680>\" This results in a error generating the octree.\n\n\nCan anyone please tell me where to start debugging?\n\n\nI am running desktop radiance through Ecotect export on WinXP.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nJill Dalglish, LEED AP\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008317.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 09, 2012 at 02:54PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008316", "id": "radiance-general_008317"}
