{"body": "Also, make sure you haven't included your model multiple times -- I've seen this happen with overlapping, identical geometry.  Geometry that comes to a point with many polygons sharing the same vertex is the usual source of this error.  I think the limit is 510 elements sharing a vertex or an infinitesimal volume of space.  Things like Rob's doorknob example can often be represented more simply in Radiance's native surface primitives than they can using triangles if that's an option.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008318.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 09, 2012 at 03:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008316", "id": "radiance-general_008318"}
