{"body": "Hi Kevin,\n\n\n1) The weighting factors are not applied to the individual channels.  What you see is a raw histogram of the data values.\n\n\n2) Photosphere re-orders the images according to their exposure.  It makes no difference the order in which they are given to the software.\n\n\nThere is a check box you can use to automatically exclude unneeded exposures, but it sometimes throws out a few of the brightest pixel values.  If you want to be sure you lose nothing, just give Photosphere all of your exposures and it will use what it can.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-January/000342.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 19, 2012 at 07:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000341", "id": "hdri_000342"}
