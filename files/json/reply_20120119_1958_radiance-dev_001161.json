{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nBecause I use the -S option to rpict when rpiece calls it, I can't change the output resolution of the tiles -- they all have to match up exactly.\n\n\nI thought about adding a warning, but I'm muddled as to when to warn the user and when not to.  Oftentimes, a particular view demands that one or the other image side be reduced to fit the desired pixel aspect ratio (1.0 for square pixels by default).  I don't think the user wants to be warned about this standard rpict-like behavior.  You only want to know when the dimensions produced by rpiece will differ from those that would have been produced by calling rpict directly, right?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001161.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 19, 2012 at 07:58PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001160", "id": "radiance-dev_001161"}
