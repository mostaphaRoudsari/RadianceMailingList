I don't want to know when rpiece/vwray do their \nnormal job. I didn't bring this up in my original post, because the \naspect ratio adjustment of -x or -y happens all the time. Ideally, the \nwarning should output those adjusted image dimensions, not the raw -x -y \nrequest. Does that make sense?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001162.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 20, 2012 at 12:04AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001160", "id": "radiance-dev_001162"}
