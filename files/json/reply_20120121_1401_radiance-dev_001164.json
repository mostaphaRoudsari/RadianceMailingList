{"body": "This is something of a headache.  I don't think the SCONS build system is working at all anymore -- does anyone use it?  Some folks at NREL hired Kitware to replace it with a newer cmake cross-platform build system that is (mostly) ready at this stage.  Rob Guglielmetti will probably chime in with the latest status on that project.\n\n\nMeanwhile, you should feel free to use the binaries from Francesco you found to begin with.  They may not be complete in the sense that there are a few missing programs, but much of what you need to run Radiance is there.\n\n\nPlease don't spend any of your time trying to repair the SCONS system.  We really should remove it from the repository.  Can I get people's opinions on that?\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001164.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 21, 2012 at 02:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001163", "id": "radiance-dev_001164"}
