{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nSorry -- I missed the attachment in your previous method.  I see that the spacing in the sync file is as it should be, so it must be the lock manager.  You could try adding a 2-5 second wait (sleep 5) after each spawning of a new rpiece process.  This gives the system time to do its thing before the next one opens the file.\n\n\nI checked in the new version with warning.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001165.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 21, 2012 at 02:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001160", "id": "radiance-dev_001165"}
