{"body": "Although Scons 1.3.1 (the old version!) is still able to compile Radiance\n4.2a, I do think it's time for the Scons build system to be removed.\nIf you're new to Radiance I would go for some precompiled binaries to run\nRadiance as they also set the right environment variables in Windows.\n\n\nIf I remember correctly the NREL/CMAKE build system has some additional\nfeatures planned/implemented compared to the Scons/MinGW system. (rvu for\nWindows), although I haven't seen it yet.\nSo it would be nice to hear the latest status of that project.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001166.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "January 21, 2012 at 03:22PM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001163", "id": "radiance-dev_001166"}
