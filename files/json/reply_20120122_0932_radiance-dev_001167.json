{"body": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI agree with Guy and Greg, the Scons system could probably go away. \n\n\nAs for NREL's CMake effort, we are just about done. There is a Qt-based rvu that runs on Windows, and all the new three phase daylight coefficient tools compile as well. I have made a bunch of changes to the CMake files throughout the source tree, which I need to coordinate with Kitware and Greg to make them easily patched into the CVS trunk. I am also missing a few programs in the build, which I will fix up this week. Our web goddess will also add an indemnification step to our download links, as which point we can announce the new support page which will offer a variety of binary packages and installers for all three platforms (Greg, this will also obviate the need to add/change the License.txt file; less lawyers = good). We are also testing more relevant, core programs opposed to the Scons test suite. There is little test coverage, and the tests are pretty weak to boot, but it's a start. I'm hoping we can get a help page up soon that will allow others to add their systems to the dashboard, as well as offer guidance on writing your own tests for the Radiance binaries. \n\n\nI know I've been promising this for a while now, but we really are very close at this point.\n\n\nRob G.\nNREL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001167.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 22, 2012 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001163", "id": "radiance-dev_001167"}
