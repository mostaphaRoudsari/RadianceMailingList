{"body": "Thank you for quick responses Greg and Guy. It's nice to see an active community. \n\n\n\n\nI've tried using binary packages with tutorial (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/tutorial.html#Intro), but would \nlike to be able to see the scene that I've described using the \ninteractive viewer rview. This is what motivated me to compile the source code.\u00a0\n\n\nI've managed to compile and install Radiance but without qtrvu. qtrvu did not compile as I did not have QT4 libraries on my computer at the time. I am working on resolving this now.\n\n\nMy understanding from the mailing list is that qtrvu is an alternative to rview for users without Unix/X11 support. Is that correct?\n\n\n\n\nI've read in many posts that old-versions of SCons were required, but most posts were dating back from 2010 and before. It thought that since active development was still being done, that later SCons versions may have been supported. Thank you for clarification Guy. \n\n\n\n\nIn compiling Radiance 4.1a, without qtrvu, I ran into 2 problems: SCons and an Error in \"rtcontrib.c\"\n\n\n1.SCons 2.1.0 Resolution to the problem I mentioned in my original post:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Replace #cfig = ConfigParser.ConfigParser(env.Dictionary()) statement found on line 11, load_plat.py\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 with \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cfig = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()\n\n\nRemoving env.Dictionary() does not cause any adverse effects - but someone else may correct me here\n\n\n2.'ssize_t' variable name in \"rtcontrib.c\" conflicts with 'ssize_t' in mingw....include/sys/types.h\nSince 'ssize_t' is found in 3 places and only in \"rtcontrib.c\", I've changed the variable to 'sSize_t'\n\n\n\n\nThis allowed the compilation to finish without errors.\n\n\n\n\nFrom C:\\MingW\\include\\sys\\types.h\n\n\n#ifndef _SSIZE_T_\n#define _SSIZE_T_\ntypedef int _ssize_t;\n\n\n#ifndef\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _NO_OLDNAMES\ntypedef _ssize_t ssize_t;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nAND\n\n\n\n\nHere's the error:\ngcc -o src\\util\\rtcontrib.o -c -O2 -D_WIN32 -DMINGW -DNDEBUG -D_CONSOLE -D_MBCS -DHDSUF=.exe -Dfseeko=fseek -Isrc\\common src\\util\\rtcontrib.c\nsrc\\util\\rtcontrib.c:20:14: error: conflicting types for 'ssize_t'\nc:\\mingw\\bin\\../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.6.1/../../../../include/sys/types.h:118:18: note: previous declaration of 'ssize_t' was here\nsrc\\util\\rtcontrib.c: In function 'main':\nsrc\\util\\rtcontrib.c:412:3: warning: passing argument 2 of 'execv' from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]\nc:\\mingw\\bin\\../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.6.1/../../../../include/process.h:118:42: note: expected 'const char * const*' but argument is of type 'char **'\nscons: *** [src\\util\\rtcontrib.o] Error 1\nscons: building terminated because of errors.\n\n\nAfter changing ssize_t to sSize_t, here's the \"affected\" part of the output:\n\n\ngcc -o src\\util\\rtcontrib.o -c -O2 -D_WIN32 -DMINGW -DNDEBUG -D_CONSOLE -D_MBCS -DHDSUF=.exe -Dfseeko=fseek -Isrc\\common src\\util\\rtcontrib.c\nsrc\\util\\rtcontrib.c: In function 'main':\nsrc\\util\\rtcontrib.c:412:3: warning: passing argument 2 of 'execv' from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]\nc:\\mingw\\bin\\../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.6.1/../../../../include/process.h:118:42: note: expected 'const char * const*' but argument is of type 'char **'\ngcc -o src\\util\\setscan.o -c -O2 -D_WIN32 -DMINGW -DNDEBUG -D_CONSOLE -D_MBCS -DHDSUF=.exe -Dfseeko=fseek -Isrc\\common src\\util\\setscan.c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001168.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Predrag Popovic", "created_at": "January 22, 2012 at 09:58AM", "created_by": "Predrag_Popovic", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001163", "id": "radiance-dev_001168"}
