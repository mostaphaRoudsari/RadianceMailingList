{"body": "Hi Terrance,\n\n\nxform searches the RAYPATH variable for its input files.  For some reason, yours doesn't include the current directory \".\"  Therefore, it will only find \"box.rad\" if it exists in \"/usr/local/lib/ray\" and it has permission to reach the file.  If it exists but doesn't have permission, then it will only work if run in super-user mode.\n\n\nA way around the above problem is always to give the path explicitly, e.g., \"./box.rad\" instead of \"box.rad\".  Or, simply include the current directory in your RAYPATH setting first, as is standard:  RAYPATH=\".:/usr/local/lib/ray\".\n\n\nI did run a test just to see if sudo would allow \"box.rad\" to be found in the current directory despite its absence from RAYPATH and it worked just as you say.  I'm rather puzzled by this behavior, actually, so I'll have to investigate further.  In any case, the above fix is the one you want.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008330.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 27, 2012 at 09:22AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008329", "id": "radiance-general_008330"}
