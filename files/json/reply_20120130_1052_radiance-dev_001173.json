{"body": "Hi Fritz,\n\n\nThe usual strategy is to convert to Radiance format, like obj2rad.  I don't\nknow how often it's used, but the .OBJ format has a NURBS specification,\nand it should be easy enough to support it with obj2mesh.  That would have\nthe advantage of including surface normal smoothing and uv textures.\n Implementing NURBS natively in Radiance would be a major undertaking by\ncomparison.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001173.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 30, 2012 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001172", "id": "radiance-dev_001173"}
