Most curved objects \nthese days are either modeled as NURBS objects, or by some subdivision \nmethod.  And yet--unless I grossly misunderstand Radiance octrees, \nwhich is possible--octrees don't actually care about polygons at all.\n\n\nOh, well.  One more research project.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001174.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
