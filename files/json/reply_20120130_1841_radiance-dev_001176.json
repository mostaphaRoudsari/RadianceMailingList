Let me know what shapes to export.  I can also ask some \nof the media people I know if 3ds max and Maya do.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001176.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
