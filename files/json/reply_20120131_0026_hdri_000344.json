{"body": "Hi Kevin,\n\n\nfrom my understanding, the exposure correction here is done by modifying\nthe exposure, not the image data itself. pvalue -o would give you the\nraw pixel data, ignoring the exposure (and thus the correction you did).\nSo I would not use the -o switch here, because you want the exposure\ncorrection (which you caluclated from your known luminance values) to be\napplied.\n\n\nThree ways to handle uncertainty in my mail (in ascending order of wisdom):\n\n\n1) Believe in my mail.[1]\n\n\n2) Hope that Greg confirms (or rejects) these assumptions.[2]\n\n\n3) Try out by e.g. using a 10 times higher value for the exposure\ncorrection then you get from your calibration. That should lead to 10\ntimes higher values in the results, if the correction got applied,\nright? So if you get these 10 times higher values even with pvalue -o,\nmy assumption was wrong.\n\n\n;)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n[1] strongly discouraged approach\n[2] promising to be on the safe side\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-January/000344.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
