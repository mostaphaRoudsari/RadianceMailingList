You need\nto multiply times 179 to get luminance (in cd/m2). Sorry if this was\nconfusing.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000347.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 01, 2012 at 02:40AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000343", "id": "hdri_000347"}
