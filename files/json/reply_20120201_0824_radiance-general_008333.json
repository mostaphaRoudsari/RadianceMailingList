{"body": "Hi Jill,\n\n\nhave you checked the material definition that is exported by Ecotect? if\nI remember correctly Ecotect exports \"mirrors\" as \"plastic\" so you'll\nneed to manually edit the definition in the .rad file.\nAnd check that the normals are oriented the right way around.\nFinally curved mirror reflections necessarily have to be approximated by\na mesh in this approach, so it will never look absolutely right....\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008333.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "February 01, 2012 at 08:24AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008332", "id": "radiance-general_008333"}
