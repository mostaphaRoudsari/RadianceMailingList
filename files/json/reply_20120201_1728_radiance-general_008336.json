This is precisely what Jill needs. Although it  \nwon't eliminate the tesselation artifacts, it will simulate the resultant  \ncaustics more efficiently than virtual light sources.\n\n\nRADIANCE binaries with photon mapping were available on Francesco  \nAnselmo's website, but appear to have been removed from the downloads.  \nAnyone have any recent binaries Jill could try out?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"END OF LINE\" [MCP, 1982]\n\"It's just not right that so many things work when they shouldn't!\"  \n[Apologies to Steve Wozniak]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008336.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "February 01, 2012 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008332", "id": "radiance-general_008336"}
