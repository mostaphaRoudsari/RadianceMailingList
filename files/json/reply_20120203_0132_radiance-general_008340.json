{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for digging into this problem. The model I send you was just a\ntry to see how tessellated nurbs would behave when rendering in\nRadiance using HDR skies. The actual project is simulating the\nbehavior of biological cells exposed to strong mental attention. I\nhave no geometry of that at this stage, it (the nurbs) should be\ngenerated in an automated way. That's quite a task on its own, so in\nmy case the easiest way will probably be to re-hack glass.c. Since I\nuse osx I haven't used the source distribution for a while, but that\nshould not be a problem. Many thanks for your quick and detailed\nreply. I'll keep you updated,\n\n\nCheers,\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n2012/2/3 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008340.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "February 03, 2012 at 01:32AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008337", "id": "radiance-general_008340"}
