{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nThis is interesting.  I hadn't realized that the Sigma lens used something other than the equidistant projection.  I thought this was the more normal type, and our casual measurements seemed to indicate that it followed this projection.  Perhaps I wasn't as careful as I ought to have been with my observations.  The horizon on the Sigma is enough of a mess that it's difficult to gauge things accurately at the outer rim of the circular image.\n\n\nLooking at the ever-helpful Wikipedia page on the topic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens#Mapping_function>, I see that the equidistant and equisolid-angle projections are fairly similar except at the outer reaches (near +/-90\u00b0).  Of course, errors could still be large assuming the wrong projection if your only light sources is out in that part of the view.\n\n\nIn lieu of reprojecting the image with pinterp, which is as you say unsupported, it is possibly to apply a correction to the image values to account for the difference in solid angle at each pixel.  Given that the solid angle of the equisolid-angle projection is the same for each pixel, we really only need the solid angle for the equidistant projection.  This can be computed with a simple expression, which is sin(theta)/theta.\n\n\nDoes this help?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000349.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 03, 2012 at 10:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000348", "id": "hdri_000349"}
