{"body": "Hi Randoph,\n\n\nCould you be more specific?  The radius of a sphere whose *projected* area is 1.0 for any distant point is sqrt(1/pi) as Chas derived it.  This is in fact what ies2rad needs.  This is not the same as a sphere whose total surface area is 1.0, which is the value you derived.\n\n\nIs there an error in ies2rad.c, somewhere?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008342.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2012 at 04:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008341", "id": "radiance-general_008342"}
