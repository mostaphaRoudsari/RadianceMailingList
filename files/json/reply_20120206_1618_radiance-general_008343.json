When I ran a simulation \nwhich checks the luminaire model against the IES file by simulating a \ngoniophotometer the numbers lined up.  I'll take a closer look at my \nscripts and see if I can find a factor of two somewhere.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008343.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
