Does the radius even matter in that \nprocedure?  Or do I have a case of a luminaire where it doesn't matter?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008344.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
