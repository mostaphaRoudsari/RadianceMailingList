{"body": "Dear Ery,\n\n\nIf you do not have a full fisheye lens you should use a vertical illuminance measurement with the HDR image and feed the measured illuminance into evalglare. As Thomas noted, the resulting contrast portion (second part of DGP equation) might be wrong depending on what happens outside of the lenses view range. I'd be happy for Jan to add his two cents as well.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 7714, f: 617 253 6152, creinhart at mit.edu<mailto:creinhart at mit.edu>\nHome<http://architecture.mit.edu/faculty/christoph-reinhart> | DIVA<http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://daysim.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/009601.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "February 06, 2012 at 06:35PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008346", "id": "radiance-general_009601"}
