This requires a fisheye (unless you know that no light\nwould received from outside your image's field of view).\n\n\nYou could try to assemble a fisheye HDR from your images. Hugin (an open\nsource tool) is actually able to handle hdr formats and can do the\nreprojection. However, as far as I know, noone validated this so far.\nMay be woth trying it. If you do so, let us know :)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008351.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
