{"body": "Hi Ery,\n\n\nThe output of pinterp in this case shouldn't be square, but may be \"almost square\" because 132 and 112 degrees are closer to each other in a hemispherical fisheye than they are in an angular fisheye.  In fact, what you have given me here with -vtv is not a fisheye view at all, but a perspective projection.  In this case, the aspect ratio is even greater.\n\n\nUnless you go all the way to 180 degrees in each direction, you cannot compute an exact value for the illuminance.  You can come reasonably close if there aren't any really bright areas just out of view.  The cosine correction on most illuminance meters is not much better.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008368.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 12, 2012 at 08:57AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008363", "id": "radiance-general_008368"}
