{"body": "Hi Wendelin,\n\n\nWhat puzzles me is not that you get different results between your two runs, but that rtcontrib produces the _same_ result under some circumstances.  There should be at least some small variations due to random sampling in every case, unless you specify the -u- option.\n\n\nDo you mean that your runs are \"mostly similar\" with the exception of noise, or \"identical\" as you say?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008373.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 17, 2012 at 08:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008371", "id": "radiance-general_008373"}
