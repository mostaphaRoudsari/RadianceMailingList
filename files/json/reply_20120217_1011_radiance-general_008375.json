{"body": "Thanks Thomas,\n\n\nI added that flag to the makefile, and the code built, but I get \"Abort Trap\" errors when I try to use evalglare on MacOS (which is the error I used to get with the old version). Has anyone been able to get a usable build of evalglare on MacOS?\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/17/12 11:05 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at googlemail.com<mailto:tbleicher at googlemail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nRob\n\n\nThe -fnested-functions options should go into the GCC arguments. I think make has it's own way of handling \"-f\" options so it won't pass this on to the compiler.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Fri, Feb 17, 2012 at 11:34 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\npictool.c: In function \u0152read_exposure\u00b9:\npictool.c:90: error: nested functions are disabled, use -fnested-functions\nto re-enable\nmake: *** [pictool.o] Error 1\n\n\nThen I tried the following, also with no luck:\n\n\nrgugliel-14846s:evalglare rgugliel$ make evalglare -fnested-functions\nmake: nested-functions: No such file or directory\nmake: *** No rule to make target `nested-functions'.
