{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nChanging the file rt/glass.c as you described below fixed the artifact.\nAgain, thanks a lot for your help.\n\n\nBut now suppose I would not have changed rt/glass.c Your remark that a\ntexture applied to an infinitely thin layer of glass should perturb\ntransmitted rays (and in effect an applied texture will smooth the\ntriangulation) did me think of using a BRTD material instead of glass.\nMaybe it is a stupid thought, but would it be possible to model glass using\nBRTD in such way that the transmitted component remains unaffected while\nthe reflected component is smoothed by a texture?\n\n\nMy best,\n\n\nIebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008385.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iebele Abel", "created_at": "February 19, 2012 at 06:25AM", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008337", "id": "radiance-general_008385"}
