{"body": "Lars, if this is a question to me--then yes, I did consider using an\nND filter, but no, I can't use one because the lens I'm using is a\n4.5mm fisheye lens that doesn't allow the use of filters, AFAIK.\n\n\nEither way--you'd want to expose (much) longer than a full cycle which\nis only 1/100 sec. This severely limits the range of exposure times\navailable for the HDR sequence. If I remember correctly, Santiago\nTorres captured sunny skies in his PhD thesis, and he had to use two\nidentical cameras for this, one of which was fitted with an ND filter.\nAligning the two must have been a nightmare.\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 20 February 2012 11:13, Lars O.
