{"body": "Hi Axel!\n\n\n> Lars, if this is a question to me--then yes, I did consider using an\n> ND filter, but no, I can't use one because the lens I'm using is a\n> 4.5mm fisheye lens that doesn't allow the use of filters, AFAIK.\n\n\nOk that sounds scary. Probably it would be possible to get a setup with\na filter wheel behind the lens - but that would not be a small handy\ndevice to be carried around outdoors any more.\n\n\nFor capturing a LED, there is no need for a fisheye though, so here one\nor more filters might be an option. Of course one would have a very\nclose look at how \"neutral\" that density filter actually is.\n\n\n> Either way--you'd want to expose (much) longer than a full cycle which\n> is only 1/100 sec.

I mentioned Hugin before - I have not used it to get\nphotometric values from images, but it claims to handle HDR formats,\nincludes a lot of alignment functionality, and is free. Maybe worth to\ntry it? Another question is how close two \"identical\" cameras can get...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000359.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
