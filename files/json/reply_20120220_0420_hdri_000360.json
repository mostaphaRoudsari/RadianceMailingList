The veiling\nglare might be less of a problem with non-fisheye lenses. Note that\nMcCann and Rizzi use an 'ordinary' lens, not a fisheye.\n\n\n>> Either way--you'd want to expose (much) longer than a full cycle which\n>> is only 1/100 sec.

The results so far\nare not very consistent between themselves (different apertures), and\nwith what little is published on vignetting of the Sigma 4.5mm. I have\nto say that I have not explored all options yet. Using two or more\ncameras is not an option in my case--I only got one.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 20, 2012 at 04:20AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000360"}
