{"body": "To compensate for flicker you could take several shots at the same shutter speed and average between them.\nYou can go as high as 1/8000 if you do so. \nNext is to measure the low and the high values within the picture set and determine how you are set within the flicker fluctuation of that source (just to check you are covering the fluctuation nicely).\nThe overall picture average should be reasonably close the the long integration time exposure.\nThis seems a lot to write (in matlab) but it is not rocket science if you have the lamp data sheet and a camera with a lot of fps\u2026.\n\n\nUsing a ND filter is an option but is not going to get you close enough to the sort of luminance you are looking to measure.\nAdding multiple filters is going to make the lens performance worst and in the end will not work.\n\n\nAnd about lenses\u2026 you may need to consider some good one, like symmetrical lens designs for large format or range finders (look at Zeiss/Leica to start with).\nThey usually correct a lot of aberrations very well and flare is just one of the set\u2026\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 20 Feb 2012, at 13:08, Axel Jacobs wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000361.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giulio antonutto", "created_at": "February 20, 2012 at 04:43AM", "created_by": "giulio_antonutto", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000361"}
