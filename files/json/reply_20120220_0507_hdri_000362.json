{"body": "Hi all!\n\n\nIndeed, the alignment of the cameras was far from perfect, and I had to do some post-processing to correct this, which was done simply by shifting pixels with some reference point. Still it was ok for what I needed (using the hdr as light source), but I wouldn't use the same approach again.\n\n\nFlare from the sun was quite a problem, especially as I was using a filter behind the fish-eye. I'm still not sure if the filter in front would reduce it, as the less flare would be compensated by the need of a longer exposure... Still, the flare affects the lower end of the dynamic range, so it shouldn't be an issue for the measurement of the LED itself.\n\n\nA note about ND filters, I've had very bad experiences with photography filters, especially at high ND values. It really needs to be an optical filter (I ended up using a combination of filters from Edmund Optics). \n\n\nAlso, a very good reference is a thesis by Jessi Stumpfel, from USC (working with Paul Debevec) available here:\nhttp://gl.ict.usc.edu/skyprobes/\n\n\nHope this helps,\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000362.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "February 20, 2012 at 05:07AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000362"}
