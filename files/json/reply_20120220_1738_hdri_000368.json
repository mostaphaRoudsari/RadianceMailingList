{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\ngood to hear from you. May I ask you to elaborate this:\n\n\n> Flare from the sun was quite a problem, especially as I was using a filter behind the fish-eye. I'm still not sure if the filter in front would reduce it, as the less flare would be compensated by the need of a longer exposure... Still, the flare affects the lower end of the dynamic range, so it shouldn't be an issue for the measurement of the LED itself.\n\n\nHow did you attach the filter behind the fisheye lens? Did you simply\nstick it there with some glue or silicone? Or onto the sensor?\n\n\n> A note about ND filters, I've had very bad experiences with photography filters, especially at high ND values. It really needs to be an optical filter (I ended up using a combination of filters from Edmund Optics).\n\n\nDo you mean that the light attenuation was not what was written on the\nbox? Or were there other issues? I assume you calibrated even the EO\nfilter, or did you just take it at face value?\n\n\nThanks for sharing your insights.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000368.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 20, 2012 at 05:38PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000368"}
