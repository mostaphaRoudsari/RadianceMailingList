{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nAbout the filter, actually it was attached with tape to the back of the FC-E8 adapter (and in front of the camera lens). So it was in the middle of the optics. I think this may have helped. The back lens of the adapter does not protrude, so it was easy to fix it parallel to the other lenses.\n\n\nThe problems with the nd filters were mostly with colour shifting. The cheaper darker filters get everything too green (and these were the best I could get from a photography shop, not that cheap). The calibration was done with the filters in place and compensated with measurements. If I remember correctly, the stated tolerance for the transmissivity was about 5% (for an ND3, that's 1/20 000th?), but I didn't verify whether the real one was within this.\n\n\nCheers,\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000371.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "February 21, 2012 at 01:48PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000371"}
