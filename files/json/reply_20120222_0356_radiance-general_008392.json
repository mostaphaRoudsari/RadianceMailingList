{"body": "Thanks for your response Lars,\n\n\nYes, in this case I can comfortably assume that the transmission is uniform\nover the surface and will use the trans modifier. My question is, what\ntransmissivity should I use? If I assume that the void space is 15% of the\narea, how shall I define the trans modifier? Is it actually reasonable then\nto simply assume transmissivity=85%? We have done this, and the lux values\nare lower than expected. What about the transmittedSpecular value?\n\n\nAre there i.e. any empirical correlations for equivalent transmissivity as\na function of hole size and/or void area ratio?\n\n\nThanks again for the feedback!\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\nMarcus Jones,  M.Sc., LEED\u00aeAP BD+C\n*Freelance energy consultant*\n*Vienna, Austria*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008392.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marcus", "created_at": "February 22, 2012 at 03:56AM", "created_by": "Marcus", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008390", "id": "radiance-general_008392"}
