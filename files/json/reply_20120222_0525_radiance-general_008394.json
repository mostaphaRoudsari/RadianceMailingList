The trans modifier was just\nproposed to be applied to the blinds geometry. As the (metal?) blinds\nare transmissive only due to the holes, transmission would be purely\nspecular, reflection probably both diffuse and specular.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008394.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
