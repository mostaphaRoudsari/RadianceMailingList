{"body": "Hi Marcus,\n\n\nIt's really hard to tell from a single photograph, but it looks like your reflectance is probably around 50% gray with some fraction of that specular.  Here is my guess at a trans material for the slats:\n\n\nvoid trans slat_mat\n0\n0\n7 .65 .65 .65 .2 .15 .29 1\n\n\nThe 0.15 value is my guess at the roughness.  This material will have 15% specular transmission (.65*(1-.2)*.29*1), 20% specular reflectance, and 37% diffuse reflectance (.65*(1-.2)*(1-.29)).  Unfortunately, the math of the trans type is difficult to follow, which is why most folks use a spreadsheet or refer to the Lighting chapter in RwR.\n\n\nIf you arrange your slats into the correct blinds geometry, you can generate a BSDF for the system using genBSDF.  I should warn you though, there is a bug in the 4.1 release of genBSDF.  I'm waiting for Rob G. to finish his Windows package before I post a patch.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008395.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 22, 2012 at 09:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008390", "id": "radiance-general_008395"}
