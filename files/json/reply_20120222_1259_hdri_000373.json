{"body": "Hello Greg!\n\n\nI was able to compile my images of LED with ND filter with raw2hdr, but I\nneed to clarify a couple of things.\n\n\nAs the intermediate step of combining the images I have the following:\n\n\nWriting data to standard output ...\nCan't locate Image/ExifTool.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/bin/lib\n/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Library/Perl/5.12\n/Network/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level\n/Network/Library/Perl/5.12 /Library/Perl/Updates/5.12.3\n/System/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level\n/System/Library/Perl/5.12\n/System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level\n/System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12 .) at /usr/bin/exiftool line 30.\nBEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/bin/exiftool line 30.\nLoading Canon EOS 7D image from IMG_0279.CR2 ...\n\n\n1. What does it mean? Is there a problem with data input/output? I just\nwant to make sure that the data is processed properly.\n\n\n2. At first it didn't make sense why do I need hdrgen, since it uses tiff\nor jpeg as an input while I'm combining hdr from raw. But then I've noticed\nthat raw2hdr generates temporary tiff photos and then uses them in hdrgen\nfunction. But if I want to include some additional settings for hdrgen\n(like flare removal) besides the default ones I have to following error:\nraw2hdr hdrgen -f -o output6.hdr IMG_02??.CR2\nMissing -o output file specification\nHow do I write my settings?\n\n\nThank you!\nYulia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000373.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Yulia Tyukhova", "created_at": "February 22, 2012 at 12:59PM", "created_by": "Yulia_Tyukhova", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000373"}
