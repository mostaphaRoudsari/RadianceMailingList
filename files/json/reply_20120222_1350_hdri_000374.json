{"body": "Hi Yulia,\n\n\nThe error with Exiftool is my fault, I'm afraid.  I naively thought that the program was self-contained, when it is not.  You need to download and install it on your machine via the following URL:\n\n\n\thttp://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/install.html\n\n\nAs for your second question, you can use other hdrgen options, but you don't need to write \"hdrgen\" on the command line as you have done.  The raw2hdr script knows how to sort out the various options.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000374.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 22, 2012 at 01:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000374"}
