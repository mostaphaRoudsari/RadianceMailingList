{"body": "Hi Yulia,\n\n\nThere is an occasional issue with dcraw where it doesn't quite handle the highlights correctly, leaving this pink area near the brightest part of the exposure.  The only fix I've found is to set the -b option to a larger value.  You should try this with raw2hdr.  Try \"raw2hdr -b 1.3 ...\" adding your other options as usual.  If that doesn't get rid of the pink haloes, keep increasing the value until it does.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work, then maybe you need more exposures.  I'm not really sure unless I can play with your original RAW files what else it could be.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000376.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 23, 2012 at 09:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000375", "id": "hdri_000376"}
