{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nThanks for your response. I known the material file. It seemed to me that informations about colors where coded by patterns in this file and I have no pattern in my files...\nI created a really simple example in which the surface is red in Sketchup and my material file is only :\nvoid plastic outSideFacade\n0\n0\n5 0.7 0.7 0.7\n\n\nThe result is that in the rendering, the surface appear to be red and if I change the values in the material file, it is still red.\n\n\nWould you have an idea ?\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nThibault Charles\nSolamen\nthibault.charles at solamen.fr\n+33 6 78 54 27 91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLe 24 f\u00e9vr. 2012 \u00e0 18:19, Andy McNeil a \u00e9crit :\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008402.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thibault Charles", "created_at": "February 24, 2012 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Thibault_Charles", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008400", "id": "radiance-general_008402"}
