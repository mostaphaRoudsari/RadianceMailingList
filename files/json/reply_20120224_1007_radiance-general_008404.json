{"body": "Hmm...  That sounds odd.  I just tried an similar example with a red surface in sketchup, changed the materials.rad file after exporting so the surface is yellow and when re-rendered the rendering is yellow as expected.\n\n\nAre you importing your model into Daysim before you make the changes? \nIt could be that Daysim creates a copy of the model somewhere else on your computer, so when you make changes you are not changing the model that Daysim is using.\n\n\nOr, it could be that the material you are changing is not applied to the surface you are looking at.  \n\n\nCan you send me an off list email with the files in you objects folder and the materials.rad file?  I'll have a look to see what's going on.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008404.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 24, 2012 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008400", "id": "radiance-general_008404"}
