{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nI have done a few different things to achieve this over the years. The \none that come most readily to mind is to prep an alternate material file \nwith a black (0 0 0) and white (1 1 1) material assigned as needed. This \nis one reason the \"alias\" material option can be quite handy when \nassigning materials to geometry! With the correct black/white materials \nthis can be rendered out very quickly with -ab 0 and -av 1 1 1.\n\n\nI have also done something where (with scripting) you can specify a \nmaterial name that then get white and everything else gets black. It has \nbeen a while so I do not quite remember off hand, but I think that this \ncan also be setup as a big pipe in radiance and using radiance's \nfunctional language.\n\n\nThe first way is pretty easy and if you need to do lots of it then it is \npossible to script the switching of material assignments. One challenge \nthough is that if you use instances (frozen octrees) you need to \nremember to assign a material accordingly. Another challenge is thinking \nabout transparencies that might need to be captured in the process...\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008407.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "February 24, 2012 at 11:45AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008406", "id": "radiance-general_008407"}
