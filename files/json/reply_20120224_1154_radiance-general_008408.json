{"body": "Hi Iebele,\n\n\nWouldn't it be simpler to introduce an alias for the material you want and set it to \"glow\" with the desired high brightness?  Take out any other light sources, turn off ambient bounces and ambient value, and render the image.  It would be a lot faster that way.\n\n\nBarring that, you can do what you want like so:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -vf test.vp -pa 0 -x $XRES -y $YRES | rtrace -h -x $XRES -y $YRES  -ffa -om test.oct  \\\n\t| sed -e 's/^window$/1/' -e 's/^[^1].*$/0/' | pvalue -h -r -b -d -y $YRES +x $XRES > mask.hdr\n\n\nYou need to set your x and y resolution explicitly because pvalue needs them in a form other than the one vwrays -d produces.  This also assumes you have sed and none of your material names starts with the numeral '1'.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Seems Jack beat me to this....\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008408.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 24, 2012 at 11:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008406", "id": "radiance-general_008408"}
