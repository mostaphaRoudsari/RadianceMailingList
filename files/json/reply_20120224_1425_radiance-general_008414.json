{"body": "I kinda like Iebele's method approach better than using black and white materials.  Using rtrace -om you can create alpha channels using the same octree that you use for a rendering.  And you can also create many alpha images for different materials with the same model.  It just seems less work than fussing with material files.\n\n\nIebele, the main thing you're missing is pvalue to convert the data stream to image format.  I also used awk for the if statement.  Here's a complete command:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -vf test.vp -x 100 -y 100 | \\\n\trtrace `vwrays -d -vf test.vp -x 100 -y 100`  -ffa -om test.oct  | \\\n\tawk '{if($1==\"window\") print 1.0; else print 0.0;}'  | \\\n\tpvalue +x 500 -y 500 -h -da -b -r | \\\n\tra_tiff - alpha.tif\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008414.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 24, 2012 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008406", "id": "radiance-general_008414"}
