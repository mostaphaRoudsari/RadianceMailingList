{"body": "Oops! The resolution I gave to pvalue doesn't match the resolution in vwrays and rtrace.  I was testing a higher resolution so I could see detail in the image, but forgot to change it back to 100 after pasting into the email.  Here's the correct command:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -vf test.vp -x 100 -y 100 | \\\n\trtrace `vwrays -d -vf test.vp -x 100 -y 100`  -ffa -om test.oct  | \\\n\tawk '{if($1==\"window\") print 1.0; else print 0.0;}'  | \\\n\tpvalue +x 100 -y 100 -h -da -b -r | \\\n\tra_tiff - alpha.tif\n\n\nAlso, you might be able to use rcalc in place of awk.  It depends on whether rcalc can compare strings in an if statement.  I don't know enough about rcalc to know if it's possible.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008416.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 24, 2012 at 03:18PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008406", "id": "radiance-general_008416"}
