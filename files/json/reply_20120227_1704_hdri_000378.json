{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nI tend not to use the -x option for critical work, as it's mostly a time-saver as opposed to a way to improve accuracy.\n\n\nThat said, the value range I consider \"safe\" extends from 27 to 228 in the 8-bit domain.  I have found this empirically to be above the noise floor (provided the ISO setting is not too high) and below where some cameras introduce highlight roll-off.\n\n\nI cannot use a strict cut-off for image values.  Up to 0.2% of the pixels below the minimum are ignored and 0.05% of pixels above the maximum, likewise.  This avoids issues with stuck pixels, which would otherwise make the -x option useless.  This is also why it is better not to use -x for critical work, because you may lose the peak highlight in your image if it happens to be very small.\n\n\nNote also that hdrgen would never discard an input exposure off the end because it was \"in range.\"  Only the exposures shorter than first one below the safe maximum and the exposures longer than last one above the safe minimum that are considered superfluous.\n\n\nI have a Lubuntu installation running under VMWare with gcc version 4.6.1-9ubuntu3.  I could use it to recompile hdrgen if you like, but I'm not sure what machines it would run on....\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000378.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 27, 2012 at 05:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000377", "id": "hdri_000378"}
