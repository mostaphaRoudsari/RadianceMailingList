{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> I've fooled around with compiling a bit now, and I don't know that I can get the TIFF library to build for me under Lubuntu. \u00a0It will probably be easiest to compile a Linux version of hdrgen that only produces Radiance (.hdr) output. \u00a0Would this be sufficient?\n\n\nYes, it would. I have never churned out TIFFs -- quite happy with\nRGBE. Guess that means it can only read JPEGs, too?\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000381.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 28, 2012 at 08:33AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000377", "id": "hdri_000381"}
