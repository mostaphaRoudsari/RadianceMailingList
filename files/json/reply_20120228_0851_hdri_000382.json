I worked on the Photoshop CS5 ghost removal as well, and the algorithm is very similar, with the added ability to control which exposure serves as reference in CS5.  It may have worked better on this one example, but I sometimes find myself using Photoshop when Photosphere doesn't do what I want it to.\n\n\nSorry to disappoint you, Greg. The brevity of the blog format often forces me to simplify facts in a black-and-white manner, and leave out the more subtle nuances. In this case I was purposely trying to raise awareness for Photosphere, because it is rather underrated among my photographer audience.\nFrom observation it seems that Photoshop tends take the chosen hero exposure very literal, eventually dismissing useful information from the side exposures. Whereas Photosphere seems to be more adaptive in the choice of hero exposures and may pick different ones for different image areas.\n\n\nChristian Bloch\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000382.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Bloch", "created_at": "February 28, 2012 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Christian_Bloch", "parent_id": "hdri_000377", "id": "hdri_000382"}
