{"body": "Dear Christoph,\n\n\nThanks for replying so quickly.\nTwo questions about what you wrote and before I delve into studying all the necessary programming:\n\n\n\n\n-          Is DIVA-for-Rhino better than Daysim for this? On the website I read that Daysim is capable to interface with other software in order to perform, for example, thermal simulations. Is this right?\n\n\n-          Is there any radiance/python script already available to study/learn from?\n\n\nThanks, regards\nStefano\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008431.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefano Moret", "created_at": "February 28, 2012 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "Stefano_Moret", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008429", "id": "radiance-general_008431"}
