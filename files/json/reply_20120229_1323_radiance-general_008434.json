{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nSo in this case you used tools within Radiance or graphical interfaces which are running Radiance on the back?\nI've seen that Rhyno isn't free, so I would like to try with Daysim and some Python scripts to try to simulate my system. According to old posts in the mailing list this should work, am I right? Any suggestion avbout it?\n\n\nThanks, Stefano\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008434.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stefano Moret", "created_at": "February 29, 2012 at 01:23PM", "created_by": "Stefano_Moret", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008429", "id": "radiance-general_008434"}
