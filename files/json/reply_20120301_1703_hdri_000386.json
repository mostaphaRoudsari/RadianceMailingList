{"body": "Hi Yulia,\n\n\nSince your maximum values are tracking the differences in your shorter exposures, it seems to indicate that you still haven't captured the brightest point on the LED.  What are you looking at that makes you think the exposures have nothing over 200?\n\n\nThere is no harm in the newer version of hdrgen in including exposures that are too dark or too light.  More naive methods might have trouble with this, but not hdrgen or raw2hdr.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000386.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 01, 2012 at 05:03PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000385", "id": "hdri_000386"}
