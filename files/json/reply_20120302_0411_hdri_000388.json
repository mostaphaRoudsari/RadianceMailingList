{"body": "Hi Yulia and all,\n\n\nI just have one small question for understanding what you are doing. Did \nyou derive the response curve of your camera using another setup (not \nthe directly visible LED) and reuse that camera response later on your \nLED captures? Or do you take the camera response from the same set of \nimages (showing the LED in an otherwise dark room) that you are going to \nassemble into a HDR?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000388.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
