Probably applies to none but me\u2026.\nBut one thing to do is to check what is the sensitivity of your camera to the infrared.\nFor example the Leica M8 is well known to be extremely sensitive, to the point of requiring filters to cut UV/IR.\nAnd this is usually visible in the black fabrics which become purple.\nIf so use filters or expect to measure higher luminance values when IR is present.\n\n\nThis also applies to the old Nikon D100 and probably other 2005ish cameras\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000391.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giulio antonutto", "created_at": "March 02, 2012 at 11:50AM", "created_by": "giulio_antonutto", "parent_id": "hdri_000385", "id": "hdri_000391"}
