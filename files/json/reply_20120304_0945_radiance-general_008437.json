Even if you could program it to take multiple shots, it would be a challenge to align and stitch them.  You would likely have to do the stitching first and alignment later, and motion blur might be a problem as well as parallax, depending on the time between shots taken near the apex of its flight.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008437.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 04, 2012 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008436", "id": "radiance-general_008437"}
