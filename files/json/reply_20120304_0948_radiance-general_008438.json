The device is using\nsmall CCD cameras (\"mobile phone cameras\"). So the whole setup is\noptimized for speed (capturing panoramic scenes with moving objects,\nthus one-shot panoramas), not dynamic range.\n\n\nOne might translate the idea into something similar, allowing to shoot a\nfull panorama HDR image by combining cameras mounted e.g. on a tripod.\nThese either would need a very high dynamic range - or again shoot a\nsequence at varying exposure times. Typically not that much of a problem\nin daylighting (clouds are _usually_ not moving that fast). Question is\nwhether 32 mini-cameras are that much better in doing so then 3 proper\ncompact cameras with fisheye lenses, covering the same field (sphere) of\nview.\n\n\nMaybe to be discussed on the HDRI list? Cheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008438.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
