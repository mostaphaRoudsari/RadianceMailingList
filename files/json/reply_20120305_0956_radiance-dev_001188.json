{"body": "Hi Pally,\n\n\nI did put together a 4.1 release on radsite, but have not updated radiance-online as yet.  There are several reasons for this.  To name a few:\n\n\nA)  I am waiting for some compiled binaries for systems other than Mac OS X.  No one has offered any as yet, although I sent out an informal request to the usual suspects.  I may be able to produce one myself using VMWare and Lubuntu, at least for Linux.\n\n\nB)  Related to A, I have been hoping for a working Windows release from Rob G. & Co., and they've been making progress as he says.\n\n\nC)  The HEAD version on radiance-online is essentially the same as 4.1 with a few bug fixes, so that's generally preferred unless binaries are desired.  (See A.)\n\n\nD)  The folks at LBNL keep saying they want to sort out the confusion between radsite and radiance-online, at least as far as releases go, and I keep hoping for movement on that and being disappointed.  My ability with HTML is limited to minor tweaks and changes, and I don't have the time or the chops to do a major cleanup like the one needed.\n\n\nSo, those are my excuses.  I could copy what's on radsite to radiance-online and take off the links to the other 4.0 binaries, but would that really help anyone?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-March/001188.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 05, 2012 at 09:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001150", "id": "radiance-dev_001188"}
