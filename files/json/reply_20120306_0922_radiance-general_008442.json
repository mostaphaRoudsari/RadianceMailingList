{"body": "HI Lars,\n\n\nI think your comments regarding FAQ's are spot on.  I don't want to duplicate effort, so I'd like to let you continue to develop your FAQ and will replace the stub on with a redirection to your site.  It would be nice to integrate the two, at least using the same login/passwords.\n\n\nI agree that models are generally less useful than objects, but I would contend that in the research community there are desires to share and use standard models.  I have some Radiance models for DOE prototype buildings that others might like to use.  And HMG has 61 models of existing buildings that many have already asked for them to share.\n\n\nBut regardless, we can let users decide which is worth sharing.  And taking the lead from your FAQ, we could get rid of the formal categories and instead using tags.  If you want to simulate a daylight redirecting system you would probably want to see results for both a cal file and a model of the system.\n\n\nI'll end by saying -  please help!\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mar 5, 2012, at 3:56 PM, Lars O.
