{"body": "I'd also like to point out that NREL is developing the Building Component\nLibrary (BCL), initially conceived as a repository for vetted energy model\ncomponents, but there is no reason why Radiance data/models couldn't be\nadded to the schema. The idea is there will be a place to go to search for\nenergy model bits -- everything from HVAC, windows, materials, lights,\nweather files -- and these can be downloaded, or pulled directly into an\nOpenStudio model. I definitely envision us adding Radiance-ready data to\nthese database members.\n\n\nWe've got it mocked up here: https://bcl.nrel.gov/\n\n\nSo, another place to link to.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n1617 Cole Blvd MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\nT. 303.275.4319\nF. 303.630.2055\nE. robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/6/12 10:22 AM, \"Andy McNeil\" <amcneil at lbl.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008443.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 06, 2012 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008439", "id": "radiance-general_008443"}
