{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nI agree that there is a demand for sharing models. Besides what you mentioned, it is great for educational purpose and for validation. It may even reduce the downloads - if we could remove example scenes from the auxiliary files (errr are they still in there?) and have a makefile not only running oconv and rpict, but fetch model data when needed from a known URL.\n\n\nFor integrating my FAQ-start, I'd be happy to support this. Maybe the formatting would need to be sent through your CSS. Sharing accounts should be rather easy, there are lots of interfaces available in times of social networks (opened? Huuuuh big brother Radiance ;)...). I think we can discuss this off-list (with everyone included who is interested).\n\n\nFor those starting to play around now - please forgive the user-unfriendliness (you may also call it rudeness) of the site in its current stage. I did not plan to make it public yet and posted the address more as a contribution to the discussion. I will do some polishing in the coming days, until then expect it to behave as what it is - still experimental ;)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O.
