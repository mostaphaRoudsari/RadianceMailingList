{"body": "Hi Mike,\n\n\nSee page (number) 60 in chapter 3 here for a description how to derive the luminance of the sun from direct normal illuminance:\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:thesis\n\n\nIncludes a little discussion re: the inconsistency of applying a measurement taken with an acceptance angle of, say, 6 degrees to a source - the sun - that has an angle 0.5 degrees.  Note that the discussion is couched in terms of predicting illuminance.\n\n\nBest\nJohn Mardaljevic\n\n\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, UK\nTel: +44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk   \nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\nhttp://dmu.academia.edu/JohnMardaljevic\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008447.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "March 06, 2012 at 02:41PM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008444", "id": "radiance-general_008447"}
