{"body": "Hi Mike, I think John's equation may be an equivalent equation - but here\nis how I have gone about it using these two equations:\n\n\nE = L * w * cos(theta)\n\n\nwhere w is the solid angle of the sun and theta is the incidence angle on\nthe illuminance plane; 0 for direct normal illuminance.\n\n\nThen the solid angle can be determined using this:\n\n\nw = 2 * pi * (1 - cos (half angle) )\n\n\nThis uses the half angle of the solar disc cone, so roughly .25 degrees.\n\n\nCheers,\nZack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008450.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "March 06, 2012 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008444", "id": "radiance-general_008450"}
