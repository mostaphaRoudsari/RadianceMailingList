{"body": "Thanks Greg! I am getting closer... Can I bother anyone with a few more \nquestions?\n\n\n1) My first attempt after installing the Unix version of exiftool showed \nthis output near the end:\n\n\n >raw2hdr -o B1.hdr *.NEF\n.\n.\n.\nLoading NIKON D90 image from Img1319.NEF ...\nScaling with darkness 0, saturation 3840, and\nmultipliers 2.170906 1.000000 1.163172 1.000000\nAHD interpolation...\nConverting to sRGB colorspace...\nWriting data to standard output ...\n     1 image files updated\nExecuting: hdrgen -m 400 -e -a -r /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/sqr.rsp -o B1.hdr \n-c sRGB /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1310.tif /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1311.tif \n/tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1312.tif /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1313.tif \n/tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1314.tif /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1315.tif \n/tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1316.tif /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1317.tif \n/tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1318.tif /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1319.tif\nphdrimg.cpp at 564>data: /tmp/raw2hdr.vVpbvN/Img1310.tif: needs exposure \ncalibration\nhdrgenmain.cpp at 185>data: Failure generating HDR image\n\n\n2) I then dug up an old response file, and tried a few different \npermutations of the following:\n\n\n >raw2hdr hdrgen -r cama.rsp -o output.hdr *.NEF\n >raw2hdr -r cama.rsp -o output.hdr *.NEF\n >...etc..\n\n\nHowever, I got different errors with different command orderings. I am \nsure I have a syntax/command order problem, but I am also worried that \nif/when I get it right, there will be another problem... The cama.rsp \nfile I have was made from jpegs. I may have to remake this with .NEFs, \nbut I am not sure how to get a .rsp file from .NEFs. Any suggestions?\n\n\n3) Finally, I have a lot of Radiance/Photosphere/hdrgen creators and \nsoftware to credit in my work. Is there a documented list for proper \nsoftware references, or should I do my best by examining the literature?\n\n\nThanks again!\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000396.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "March 07, 2012 at 07:53PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000396"}
