{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that either the version of Exiftool you got isn't working right, or the input images are missing information.  You should send me a copy of one of your NEF input images in a private message and I'll have a look at it.\n\n\nUsing a different response function will not solve the problem.\n\n\nI have not written any papers on Photosphere or hdrgen.  You'll just have to refer to the anyhere.com website, I'm afraid.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000397.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 07, 2012 at 08:05PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000401", "id": "hdri_000397"}
