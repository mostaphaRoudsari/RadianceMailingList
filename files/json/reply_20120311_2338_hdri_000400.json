{"body": "Hi Yulia,\n\n\n1.  You need the \"-o\" option to pvalue, and the rest should work.  The \".pic\" file is the same as the \".hdr\" file produced by Photosphere, a.k.a. \"Radiance RGBE format\" in the \"Save As...\" dialog.\n\n\n2.  The standard deviation for luminance is computed in the log domain, so what it gives you is a multiplier/divisor on the value rather than an absolute deviation.  In other words, one standard deviation above is 1.1x the median, and one standard deviation below is median/1.1.\n\n\n3.  Averaging in a circular area is tricky and usually not worth the effort.  There aren't any luminance meters that are accurate enough about their circles to worry about the difference between a circle and a square.  If you must do it, it's a long and nasty-looking pcomb command.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000400.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 11, 2012 at 11:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000399", "id": "hdri_000400"}
