{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nSeems obj2rad has an initial test to determine if a polygon has specified normals.  If it does, then it breaks it into triangles.  Once it looks at the triangles, it then sees if the normals actually require interpolation or not.  If they don't, then it doesn't specify a texture, but they still get output as triangles.\n\n\nIs it a problem?  Just take off the normals if it is.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 22, 2012 at 12:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008463", "id": "radiance-general_008464"}
