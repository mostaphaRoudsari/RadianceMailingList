{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThe -o option to ra_xyze should eliminate the exposure line, so pcompos shouldn't mess up the values.  (I don't think you want to use the pcompos '-o' option, which specifies an anchor offset and isn't used correctly in your command.)\n\n\nThe pextrem command gives you the absolute brightest and darkest pixel, whose values will change with filtering as everything gets averaged with its neighbors.  Cropping the image can also affect the extrema, since they may have lived in the pixels you cropped out.  Slight changes on the order of 1% can be explained just by scaling RGBE image values, whose accuracy is no better than this.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000406.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 23, 2012 at 12:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000405", "id": "hdri_000406"}
