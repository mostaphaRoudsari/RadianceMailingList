{"body": "Hey Randolph,\n\n\nI have run into this before. Unfortunately I have had limited success in \ntracking down the issue and also have not really looked at it for some \ntime. If I recall correctly, a couple of things that I have noticed:\n\n\n  * possible problem if a piece finishes before the first set of pieces\n    are parcelled out out by rpiece - so if it 8 pieces are being\n    distributed at startup and piece 2 (for example) finishes before one\n    of pieces 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 has even been processed by rpiece or\n    while rpiece is still forking off the initial jobs.\n\n\nSorry I cannot offer more, I have spent some time in the code on this \none and it is not for the faint of heart to say the least.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008487.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 09, 2012 at 01:46PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008486", "id": "radiance-general_008487"}
