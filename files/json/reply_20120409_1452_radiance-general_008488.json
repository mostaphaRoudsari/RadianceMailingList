{"body": "If it is a startup issue as Jack suggests, you might try inserting a few seconds of delay between the spawning of each new rpiece process using \"sleep 5\" or similar.  This allows time for the sync file to be updated without contention between processes.  This is what I do in rad with the -N option.  I actually wait 10 seconds between each new rpiece process.\n\n\nThis isn't to say that I understand the source of your error, which still puzzles me.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008488.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 09, 2012 at 02:52PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008486", "id": "radiance-general_008488"}
