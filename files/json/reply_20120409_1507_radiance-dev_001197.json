{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nI only ever created stereo slide pairs using vwright, in which case, simply moving the slides closer together a small amount alleviated any discomfort.  It amounts to the same as -vs (modulo the image borders).\n\n\nI wrote vwright before introducing the notion of viewing distance (the length of the -vd vector).  I could add an option to vwright for the screen distance that would take the view distance and turn on the kind of automatic adjustment you propose.  I don't have any way to test it, unfortunately.\n\n\nDo you think the adjustment of -vh is really necessary?  Regardless of what  you do with it, the borders will not match for all objects, anyway.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001197.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 09, 2012 at 03:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001196", "id": "radiance-dev_001197"}
