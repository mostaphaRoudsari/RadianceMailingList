{"body": "Hi Greg!\n\n\nMy guess is that targeting a 3d-tv format (which is what I did) is rather different then working with slides, where adjustments can be made on display. In my example, especially objects close to the observer were hard to view with standard vwright settings, while the modified vs and vh views led to a rather clear result. I may need to try some more scenes before claiming this to be true in general. To give an idea of the changes for vh, my initial 75 degrees became 72 degrees for a simple test scene, eye distance 0.065m and distance about one meter.\n\n\nI can dig some more into this, but only after Friday. I wanted to share my work though, so that maybe others can comment or correct me.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Architect Lars O. Grobe\n\n\nOn Apr 10, 2012, at 1:07, \"Gregory J.
