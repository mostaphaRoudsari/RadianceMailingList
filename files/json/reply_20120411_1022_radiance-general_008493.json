{"body": "Hey Andy,\n\n\nThis jogs my memory a bit. Perhaps a different topic at this point not \nsure as this is more about clusters, radiance and rpiece. Another \nproblem that I encountered with using rpiece on my cluster was sometimes \nthe time tiles/pieces would get written into the image in the wrong \nplace when using stock rpiece. My solution if I remember correctly was \nto customize rpiece so that each running instance of rpiece would write \nout its pieces each to their image file. These would all then get \nassembled as a post process. I think my idea behind this was to take \nadvantage of the functionality that rpiece does offer.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008493.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "April 11, 2012 at 10:22AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008486", "id": "radiance-general_008493"}
