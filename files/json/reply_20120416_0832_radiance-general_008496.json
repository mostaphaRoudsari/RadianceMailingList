{"body": "I've gathered little more information Thursday and Friday.  \n\n\nFirst off, I am so far only using single nodes on our cluster for \nrenderings and instead taking advantage of multiple nodes to run more \nrenderings.  Each node in the Lawrencium cluster has two six-core \nXeons, and they are very capable.\n\n\nI ran a rendering on a different model in the same cluster environment, \nwhich worked perfectly.  My experience so far leads me to the following \nconclusion: whatever the problem is, it is dependent on the model and \nthe simulation parameters.  The model where it worked used mkillum; the \ntwo where it doesn't, don't.  This may--or may not--be significant.\n\n\nI think adding mkillum surfaces to the models that failed would be an \ninteresting experiment.  Maybe I can find some time to do it next week.\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nOn 2012-04-11 17:22:52 +0000, Jack de Valpine said:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008496.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
