For the moment, stick with gcc.\n\n\n> Concerning the binaries, I have a question alike: would it be better to \n> make a local install of the binaries for each node?\n\n\nDepends on the cluster.  I suspect not much, though; the program \nbinaries are going to be cached in RAM in the nodes.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph M.
