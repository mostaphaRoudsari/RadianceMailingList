{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI think that binaries should be centrally located. It is not that big a \nproblem to load over a network for this.\n\n\nLikewise I think that scene files (octrees, etc) should be centrally \nlocated. It is just easier to manage.\n\n\nI think a main problem is each process/node/core writing back image \ndata. This can really slow things down on the nfs server if image pieces \nare being written back into one image. I think that it is better to have \neach process write out its output to its own file, which can be on the \nnfs server, and then assemble the pieces as a post process. Ambient \ncache data can still be shared and written to by multiple processes \nalthough I would recommend using one process to pre-populate the cache \ninitially. And if as Andy mentions you are using something like \nrtcontrib then the shared ambient cache is a non-issue.\n\n\nAs far as compiler optimizations. While this could be nice, I think the \nreal benefit is spreading things out over the cluster... that is \nhopefully where you get more opportunity to speed things up as opposed \nto some incremental increase due to compiler optimization.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/16/2012 11:37 AM, Randolph M.
