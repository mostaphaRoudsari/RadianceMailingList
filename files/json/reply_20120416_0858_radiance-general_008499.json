{"body": "Iebele,\n\n\nYou've picked what are probably the best compile options for \nperformance. You may or may not see a difference by adding \n\"-fomit-frame-pointer\". You may also see a difference by using \nthe gcc 4.6 compilers instead of any earlier versions. 4.6 seems \nto impart a 5% advantage over even gcc 4.4.\n\n\nBut like Jack mentioned, these compiler options can, at best, \ngive you incremental performance improvements. Whenever I have \nreal work to do, I always use rpiece and a script similar to the \n\"runsmp\" that is in the bench4.tar.gz.\n\n\nIf you have the results from some of your tests, I'd like to put \nthem on the Radiance benchmark page.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Sat, 7 Apr 2012, Iebele wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008499.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "April 16, 2012 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008485", "id": "radiance-general_008499"}
