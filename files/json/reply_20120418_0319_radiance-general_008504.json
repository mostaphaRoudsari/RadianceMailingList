See the manpage of rad, where the \nEXPOSURE variable is explained as well as how to find a suitable value.\n\n\nYou can also simply keep the unfiltered images as generated by rpict. \nYou could then assemble the raw images and filter the complete, \nassembled mosaic. Tell rad to keep the unfiltered images by specifying a \nname pattern using the RAWFILE variable. Again, the details are \nexplained in the manpage of rad.\n\n\nIf you want to read numerical values from filtered images, usually the \n-o option are of help. This gives you access to the original pixel \nvalues by reversing the exposure mapping performed by e.g. pfilt. See \ne.g. the manpage of pvalue.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008504.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
