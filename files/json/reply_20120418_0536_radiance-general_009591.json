{"body": "Dear Jo\u00e3o\n\n\nI'm afraid I have never used the coupling on Windows, however, the message must not mean that Radiance is not installed correctly or that it is not \"linked\".\n\n\n\n\n-          Where do you fire up ESP-r? On Unix / Cygwin, best results with Radiance coupling are usually obtained when starting esp-r in the /cfg/ folder of the model of interest\n\n\n-          Do you get any \"chatter\" from the / a console? Possibly, Radiance and / or ESP-r gives some messages which could help\n\n\n-          There seems to be a glitch in the current development_branch which leads to missing .opt files with Radiance coupling. Possibly add such a file manually (see a similar problem some weeks ago, I sent an example .opt to the group)\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n\nVon: Jo\u00e3o Santos [mailto:joao.portugal.santos at gmail.com]\nGesendet: Mittwoch, 18.

Because I\u00b4ve tried C:/Program Files/ ,  C:/Esru/bin and also C:/Radiance\nIs the above radiance package complete?\nWhat is the best way to install Radiance in a Windows machine?\n\n\nThanks in advance\nJoao\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/009591.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "April 18, 2012 at 05:36AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008505", "id": "radiance-general_009591"}
