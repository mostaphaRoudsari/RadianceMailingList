So let the script end as\n\n\n(...)\n| total -if3 -m\n\n\nAnd remove the backslash and the last line. I am assuming that you have \nset equal values in all channels (R=G=B in all source, material \ndefinitions).\n\n\nUnfortunately, especially for small light sources of high intensity, you \nmust set a rather high sampling density N not to miss out important \nsources. The script sends out rays to random directions, other then \nRadiance's integrated direct calculation which keeps a list of sources \nwith known locations to check.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008512.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
