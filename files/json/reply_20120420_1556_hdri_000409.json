{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nYou can also substitute the -s option in the case of hdrgen (not Photosphere, though).  This sets the exposure multiplier explicitly.  You can estimate this from the known camera parameters using:\n\n\n\t\tKfactor = 87.;\n\t\tstonits = Kfactor * aperture*aperture / (exptime * asa);\n\n\nwhere aperture is in f-stops and exptime is in seconds.\n\n\nThat way, you don't need exiftool.  Usually the only information missing is the ASA, and this can usually be solved by choosing an ASA that is 1 EV higher.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-April/000409.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 20, 2012 at 03:56PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000407", "id": "hdri_000409"}
