{"body": "Hi Lars~\n\n\nI modified the script as follows, because i use just one channel out of RGB\nchannels.\n\n\nset N=10000\ncnt 10 10 10 $N | rcalc -of -e 'Dz=1-2*($4+rand(.77-.61*recno))/'$N \\\n              -e 'phi=2*PI*($4+rand(-.10+.39*recno))'/$N \\\n              -e 'rxy=sqrt(1-Dz*Dz);Dx=rxy*cos(phi);Dy=rxy*sin(phi)' \\\n              -e 'Ox=$1*.02+0.02;Oy=$2*0.02+0.02;Oz=$3*0.02+0.02' \\\n              -e '$1=Ox;$2=Oy;$3=Oz;$4=Dx;$5=Dy;$6=Dz' \\\n      | rtrace -h -ff -oov -ar 256 -as 256 -ad 512 -ab 3 scene.oct \\\n      | total -if4 -10000 -m \\\n      | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=4*PI*$4' > fluence.dat\n\n\nI checked appropriate number of rays to trace for some positions and\nchanges below 1% in results were observed between 10000 and more rays, but\nless than 10000 was not desirable. I need to check for all the positions\nconcerned.\n\n\nMany thank you~\n\n\nBest,\nMinki\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Minki!\n> I am sorry for my too late response to your kind comment.

So let the script end as\n\n\n(...)\n| total -if3 -m\n\n\nAnd remove the backslash and the last line. I am assuming that you have\nset equal values in all channels (R=G=B in all source, material\ndefinitions).\n\n\nUnfortunately, especially for small light sources of high intensity, you\nmust set a rather high sampling density N not to miss out important\nsources. The script sends out rays to random directions, other then\nRadiance's integrated direct calculation which keeps a list of sources\nwith known locations to check.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nMinki Sung, Ph.D.\n\n\nBuilding Technology Team\nKorea Institute of Construction Technology\nTEL.+82-31-9100-586\nFAX.+82-31-9100-361\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008514.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Minki Sung", "created_at": "April 21, 2012 at 11:48AM", "created_by": "Minki_Sung", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008295", "id": "radiance-general_008514"}
