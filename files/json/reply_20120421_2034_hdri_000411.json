{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nIt's just that some cameras (Nikons in particular) treat the lowest ASA setting to be an \"extended\" mode, which isn't recorded in the Exif header in the usual fashion.  If this ASA is 50, setting the ASA to 100 usually solves the problem.  If the lowest settable ASA is 100, try setting it to 200.  (The same is true for the opposite end of the sensitivity scale, but you should stay away from this for HDR captures.)\n\n\nThe ASA is generally fixed in an exposure bracketed sequence, or should be.  Some cameras offer an \"Auto ASA\" mode, but you should definitely avoid this setting for HDR.\n\n\nFor the purposes of putting the ASA back into the equation when it was not recorded, you can often use the camera itself in one of its information modes to tell you what it was actually set to when you took the exposures.\n\n\nDoes this help?\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.
