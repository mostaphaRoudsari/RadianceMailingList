{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nThese machine vision cameras have no readout and are driven from a GUI  \nvia USB / Firewire.  The GUI I'm using for this particular camera has  \nsettings for:\nGamma .01 - 2.56 (which I set to 1)\nBlue Gain 0-1023 (adjusted to get the on screen image as close to grey  \nfor the particular light source under which I'm shooting)\nRed Gain 0-1023\nBrightness 160 - 842 ( adjusted to 160 ~I think this is the same as  \nCCD sensor gain and thus what I need to correlate to ASA)\nExposure .01ms - 3mins  (I'm using this to bracket the images)\n\n\nThe lens I'm using has a manual iris for setting aperture.  I'm  \ndividing the focal length of the lens by the diameter of the aperture  \nto derive the f/stop value.\n\n\nI think I just need to experiment with setting the  brightness  value  \nto its lowest setting under a constant light source and see what kind  \nof values i get from the HDR shots using a constant ASA value in  \nHDRgen and adjusting this value until I get some agreement between  \nmeasured brightness and HDR image brightness.  I'f I'm lucky a  \nbrightness value setting of 160 will equal an ASA of 160:)\n\n\nThanks again for you help Greg.  Also, thanks to those who replied to  \nmy previous posts on color channel masking...great help!\n\n\nCheers,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-April/000412.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "April 22, 2012 at 06:59PM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "hdri_000407", "id": "hdri_000412"}
