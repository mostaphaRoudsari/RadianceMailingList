{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nYou would be better off setting the gamma to 2.2.  Hdrgen will adjust itself to whatever camera response function is present, but this is closer to the norm and makes better use of the 8-bit code values.\n\n\nRegarding the Brightness scaling, use 160 and assume this is ASA.  Your calculation for iris sounds about right.\n\n\nThe main thing is to get the proportions between exposures correct -- the absolute value will be off no matter what you do.  The absolute scaling can be corrected by a gray patch luminance measurement and the \"Calibrate\" function in Photosphere.\n\n\nAs long as you keep the inverse linear relationship to exposure time and ASA/brightness and the square relationship to aperture, you will get the relative exposure ratios correct, and this is what matters to the merge operation.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-April/000413.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 22, 2012 at 08:27PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000407", "id": "hdri_000413"}
