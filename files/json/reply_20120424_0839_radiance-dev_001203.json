{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nThanks for sharing your files.  The only problem I found was that your orientation vector was perpendicular to the plane of your BSDF.  The error I got was a fairly useless \"Illegal argument\" warning.  I just checked in a new version of src/rt/m_bsdf.c that offers a more accurate warning.\n\n\nMeanwhile, try changing the orientation vector on your test BSDF to \"0 1 0\" or \"1 0 0\" so that it is in the plane of the surface and see if you still have problems.\n\n\nThanks for your help -- always appreciated!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001203.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 24, 2012 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001202", "id": "radiance-dev_001203"}
