{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks for spotting my stupid mistake!!!\nA corrected orientation vector solves the \"illegal argument\" problems and\nthus everything\nworks fine on the OpenSuse machine.\n\n\nHowever, the error \"root tag missing\" is still thrown at the Ubuntu\nmachine. I did not have\nenough time today, but I'll try to compile the newest head\n- on the OpenSuse machine (and check if it still works)\n- on the Ubuntu machine using a newer version of gcc\ntomorrow.\n\n\nI'll get back to you when I have the results.\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\nAm 24.
