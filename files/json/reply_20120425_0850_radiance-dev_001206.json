{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI have no idea what's going wrong.  You did a test before where you forced the program to take the \"else\" clause to avoid mmap(), and ended up with a different set of errors.  Do you not get those errors when you pass the same BSDF through the 64-bit version?  This is puzzling to me.\n\n\nThe fact that mmap() is not returning the file contents in 32-bit mode is very disturbing.  This sounds like a header issue, but I have no way to debug it without downloading and installing ubuntu on a virtual machine.  You could try commenting out the madvise() calls, not that I expect it to make a difference...  \n\n\nAvoiding the mmap() call should fix the problem, so it's worth trying that again.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001206.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2012 at 08:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001202", "id": "radiance-dev_001206"}
