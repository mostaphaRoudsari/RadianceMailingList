{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthe other set of errors was only related to the wrong orientation vector\nspecified for the BSDF material.\nSo the only difference that is really there is the one related to mmap().\n\n\nI also thought about avoiding mmap() on the 32bit machine. For Cygwin this\nis done similarly in\ncommon/ezxml.h by defining EZXML_NOMMAP. Maybe that's the best solution for\nnow.\n\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 25.
