{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI'm pretty sure the guys who developed the build system for NREL didn't use the NOMMAP #define, so must be their system doesn't have whatever header issues yours is running afoul of in 32-bit mode.\n\n\nThanks for the update -- glad it's working for you now!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  A side note on ezxml is that I found a problem after the 4.1 release that caused very long XML files with DOS eol (CR-LF) to be impossibly slow to load.  This is fixed in the latest HEAD, which NREL is using.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001210.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 26, 2012 at 07:21AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001202", "id": "radiance-dev_001210"}
