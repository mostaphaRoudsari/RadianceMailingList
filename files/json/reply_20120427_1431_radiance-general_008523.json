{"body": "Hi Valeria,\nTrans is a quick and easy way to model this type of glazing.  \nYou can use this widget to generate a trans material definition by entering your transmission and reflection parameters: http://gaia.lbl.gov/people/andy/public/transwidget/\n\n\nHowever trans does not account for Fresnel effects that reduce transmission of glass at non-normal incidence angles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amptitude_Ratios_air_to_glass.JPG).  So treat trans results with some degree of caution.\n\n\nIf you want to include fresnell effects and diffusion, you might consider use a glass surface and a trans surface one in front of the other.  Or you could generate a BSDF and use the new BSDF material.\n\n\nHope this helps,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 27, 2012, at 1:34 PM, Valeria De Giuli wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008523.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 27, 2012 at 02:31PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008522", "id": "radiance-general_008523"}
