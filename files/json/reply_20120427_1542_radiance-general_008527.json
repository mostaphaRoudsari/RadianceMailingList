{"body": "It's really tough to say without knowing what they mean by direct and diffuse transmission.  From their website I understand that by \"direct\" they mean normal incidence direct-hemispherical transmission and by \"diffuse\" they mean hemispherical-hemispherical transmission.  I would suggest setting Td to 30% and know that for non-normal incidence angles you will over estimate overall transmission.\n\n\nThis product, with it's capillary tubes and diffusing papers, is a perfect example of a system that should be modeled with a BSDF.  Unfortunately your options for BSDF characterization are murky at best right now.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 27, 2012, at 2:47 PM, Valeria De Giuli wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008527.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 27, 2012 at 03:42PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008522", "id": "radiance-general_008527"}
