{"body": "Thank you all! Yes, the product I have to model is the Kapilux. I'm going through the report of Christoph and Marilyne: I think that product is very similar to the one I have to simulate. I have decided to model it following the second option (trans 16%), using the diffuse-diffuse transmittance instead of the direct normal hemispherical (30% in my case). I then put the same values for the other parameters. Do you think it is correct?\nThanks a lot,\nValeria\n\n\n\n\nIl giorno 28/apr/2012, alle ore 04:28, Greg Ward ha scritto:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008529.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Valeria De Giuli", "created_at": "April 27, 2012 at 11:44PM", "created_by": "Valeria_De_Giuli", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008522", "id": "radiance-general_008529"}
