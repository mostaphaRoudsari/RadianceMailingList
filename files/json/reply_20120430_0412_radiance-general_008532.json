{"body": "Dear Ji,\n\n\nthere is an undocumented option in evalglare (-p), which replaces the \nluminance values to the position-index values. So you can directly \ngenerate an image just with the position index with just one command line...\nYou have to use evalglare in the normal manner (-> feed in image and \nspecify output image. The content of the input image doesn't matter, \njust the header options must be correct.)\n\n\nexample: evalglare -p -c position_index.hdr  inputimage.hdr\n\n\nGood luck,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 04/29/2012 08:15 PM, Ji Zhang wrote:\n> Dear Radiance experts,\n>\n> Learning glare related analysis, I write a .cal file to define the\n> position index for every point on the sky in relation to a given view\n> vector based on the position index formula.
