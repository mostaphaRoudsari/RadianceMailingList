{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nAFAIK, the sources for those two programs were not touched in the Windows binary project. I don't fully understand the behavior of this program right now. I will check with Kitware to see if any changes were in fact made to that source in order to get it to work on Windows.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/30/12 6:35 AM, \"David Geisler-Moroder\" <david.moroder at gmail.com<mailto:david.moroder at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Greg, hi list,\n\n\nfrom time to time I am using mgf2inv with the \"-vrml\" option to export and view my models.\n\n\nThis time I wanted to do the conversion with rad2mgf and mgf2inv -vrml on Windows using the\nNREL binaries. However, the resulting files are corrupt due to bad number representations and\nnormal descriptions.\n\n\nFor example the description of a face in the VRML-file created with the Linux binaries is:\n\n\nDEF ceil_fac_001 Group {\n  Separator {\n    USE ceil_mat\n    Coordinate3 {\n      point [ -2.000000000e+00 +4.500000000e+00 +2.162119874e+00,\n              -1.500000000e+00 +4.500000000e+00 +3.000000000e+00,\n              -1.500000000e+00 +5.000000000e+00 +1.461123454e+00,\n              -2.000000000e+00 +5.000000000e+00 +6.232433278e-01 ]\n    }\n    IndexedFaceSet {\n      coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the files created with the Windows version the same face is described as:\n\n\nDEF ceil_fac_001 Group {\n  Separator {\n    USE ceil_mat\n    Coordinate3 {\n      point [ -2.000000000e+000 +4.500000000e+000 +2.162119874e+,\n              -1.500000000e+000 +4.500000000e+000 +3.000000000e+,\n              -1.500000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000 +1.461123454e+,\n              -2.000000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000 +6.232433278e- ]\n    }\n    Normal {\n      vector [ 00\n+0.000 +0.000 +0.0-1.500000000e+000 +4.500000000e+000 +3.000000000e+,\n               00\n+0.000 +0.000 +0.0-1.500000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000 +1.461123454e+,\n               00\n+0.000 +0.000 +0.0-2.000000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000 +6.232433278e-,\n               01\n+0.000 +0.000 +0.000 ]\n    }\n    IndexedFaceSet {\n      coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]\n      normalIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nObviously, two things are corrupt:\n- the z-coordinates are missing their exponents\n- the normal vector coordinates are messed up\n\n\nMoreover, for me it's unclear why normal vectors are written (needed ??) in the Windows version, while\nthey are completely missing in the Linux version.\n\n\nI believe that all this has something to do with de definition of VERTFMT in src/cv/mgf2inv.c\n#define VERTFMT        \"%+16.9e %+16.9e %+16.9e\\n%+6.3f %+6.3f %+6.3f\"\n\n\nAny ideas how to solve that for both platforms??\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001213.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 30, 2012 at 08:41AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001212", "id": "radiance-dev_001213"}
