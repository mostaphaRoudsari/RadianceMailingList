{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI found the problem, and can figure out how to fix it.  The code assumes that exponents have two digits only, which is still true on most Unix machines.  I guess they're making room for \"long double's\" (128-bit IEEE float) and don't have different code for that than the \"regular\" doubles.\n\n\nI will check in a fix later today -- thanks so much for spotting this.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001214.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 30, 2012 at 09:57AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001212", "id": "radiance-dev_001214"}
