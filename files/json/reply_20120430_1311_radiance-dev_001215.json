{"body": "Hi Greg, Rob,\n\n\nthanks a lot for the quick responses and for the fix!\n\n\nHowever, I need to wait for the new NREL-binaries to use the fixed version\n(or maybe finally step into the CMake thing to get the Windows bins\ncompiled by myself... ;-) ).\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n2012/4/30 Gregory J.
