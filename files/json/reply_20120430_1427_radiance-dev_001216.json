{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI am trying to sort out two other issues with the Windows binaries, but I can push out a new Windows installer tomorrow morning for you with this fix. We can talk offline if you want to talk about getting up and running with CMake, too.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/30/12 2:11 PM, \"David Geisler-Moroder\" <david.moroder at gmail.com<mailto:david.moroder at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Greg, Rob,\n\n\nthanks a lot for the quick responses and for the fix!\n\n\nHowever, I need to wait for the new NREL-binaries to use the fixed version (or maybe finally step into the CMake thing to get the Windows bins compiled by myself... ;-) ).\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n2012/4/30 Gregory J. Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>>\nHi David,\n\n\nI found the problem, and can figure out how to fix it.  The code assumes that exponents have two digits only, which is still true on most Unix machines.  I guess they're making room for \"long double's\" (128-bit IEEE float) and don't have different code for that than the \"regular\" doubles.\n\n\nI will check in a fix later today -- thanks so much for spotting this.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001216.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 30, 2012 at 02:27PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001212", "id": "radiance-dev_001216"}
