I just announced I on radiance-general, and was\nplanning an update on how to use the Cmake system on your own system, to\nbe posted to tis dev list. In the meantime, you can check out what we have\non offer at:\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia\nnce\n\n\nThere are still a couple of issues (typically Windows issues) cropping up\n(like the one David discovered recently) that Greg is actively fixing and\npushing into HEAD, but we are currently updating the HEAD installers every\ntwo weeks. So, for the latest-greatest Radiance, you'll want to get up to\nspeed with Cmake.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-May/001218.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 01, 2012 at 09:42AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001212", "id": "radiance-dev_001218"}
