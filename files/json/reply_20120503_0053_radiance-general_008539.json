{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nVery nice to have current Radiance version on Windows.\n\n\nI've installed binary setup file in Windows and set PATH and RAYPATH\nenvironment variables as suggested on web page.\nI have few other Radiance installations in Windows (inside Daysim for\nexample), so I've experimented with PATH and RAYPATH variable, and put path\nto new Radiance installation as first in both variables and I get next\nmessage when I try to run any program:\n\n\n*The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration\nis incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line\nsxstrace.exe tool for more detail.*\n\n\nI also tried to remove all paths related to other Radiance installations\nfrom PATH and RAYPATH varialbes, but still getting the same error message.\n\n\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008539.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marija Velickovic", "created_at": "May 03, 2012 at 12:53AM", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008534", "id": "radiance-general_008539"}
