{"body": "The 4.2.a release appears to contain debug binaries which will only work on a system with Visual Studio 2008 installed (has a dependency on MSVCR90D.DLL which is the debug version of the VC++ 9.0 runtimes). I checked both the zip archive & the NSIS installer. I can't even run them myself as I have VS 2010 not VS 2008.\n\n\nYou'll either need to build from source or wait for a release build to be made available.\n\n\n[Description: IES]<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher\nSoftware Platform Engineer\n\n\nT:\n\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8500\n\n\nF:\n\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8501\n\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\n\n\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
