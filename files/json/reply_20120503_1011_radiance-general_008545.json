Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.\n\n\nI also tried to remove all paths related to other Radiance installations from PATH and RAYPATH varialbes, but still getting the same error message.\n\n\nAny ideas how to solve this?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008545.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 03, 2012 at 10:11AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008534", "id": "radiance-general_008545"}
