{"body": "Hi Guy,\n\n\nThanks for the feedback! I'm running out the door to catch a bus, but I will review this tonight. Thanks especially to the NSIS pointer on env paths. I knew it was possible, just hadn't had time to look into it, so thanks for the pointer. The rvu bugs seem serious, I have to admit I haven't tested that extensively on Windows. And you're right, rpiece should be taken out of the Windows package for now; that's an easy fix. Making rpiece Windows-compatible, now that's a different story. ;)\n\n\n-Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 5/3/12 4:44 PM, \"Guy Vaessen\" < > wrote:\n\n\nGreat job! I really like the new rvu on Windows.\n\n\nI just tried it on Windows 7 64 bits\n\n\nA few remarks:\n\n\nIn rvu\n\n\n-selecting load view (file viewpoint.vp) contents: -vp -.5 -5 1.15 -vd 0.5 5 0 doesn't set the viewparameters (it doesn't do anything).\n\n\nAfter manually setting a view\n-selecting load view and pressing cancel 'resets' the view and rvu recalculates from a random viewpoint, doing it again (select load view and press cancel) goes back to the manually entered view before and recalculates.\n\n\n-selecting file -> Load .rif doesn't do anything.\n\n\n-selecting parameter: some values could be expained a bit more, for example te first tab ambient has in the first column value: 0 0 0 (I don't know which values are required).\n\n\nIt looks like it is possible to set the environmental path on Windows directly in the NSIS installer:\n http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Environmental_Variables:_append,_prepend,_and_remove_entries\n(The old MnGW installer offered at: http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ did also set the environment variables).\n\n\nOne question: are you sure you want to include rpiece in the Windows installer? Since for Windows at compile-time the only message possible by rpiece is the one about the missing NFS-manager.\nTo get rpiece working on Windows one would have rewrite (at least) the part about file locking since Windows does this differently from other OS.\n(It would be great to see rpiece working on Windows too!).\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-May/001226.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 03, 2012 at 03:50PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001225", "id": "radiance-dev_001226"}
