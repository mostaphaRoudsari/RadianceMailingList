You could write a little script with rcalc, python or octave.\nI guess Andy or Greg would do all in one line with sed / awk :-)\n\n\nOnce done you could have polar maps of your illuminance component, directionality of lighting in the space, etc etc.\n\n\nTo start playing with the idea you could do as Mark is suggesting, 6 illuminance values are  good as you could easily plot the vector illumiannce to visualise the directionality of lighting.\nThis is an useful metrics for museums.\n\n\nEither way, have fun!\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008556.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giulio antonutto", "created_at": "May 09, 2012 at 12:55AM", "created_by": "giulio_antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008555", "id": "radiance-general_008556"}
