{"body": "Just a quick note about the images, with vwrays you can get directions and origin of picture vectors so you can use a view file and create a grid.\nAnd then, as usual, with rtrace and a grid you can get values.\nThe power of using vwrays it is that it would allow you to sample the space around in all directions so to have a spherical projection of the illuminance contribution to your position.\nImagine now plotting all the values on a spherical surface and scaling the mesh according to the values.\nYou would get some weird looking solid which embeds directionality of light. A light signature of a space/point couple.\nBut there is a lot to fiddle around for probably just a cool visualisation.\nAh those were the times\u2026.\nIf I just had the time now :-)\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008560.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giulio antonutto", "created_at": "May 09, 2012 at 01:32PM", "created_by": "giulio_antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008557", "id": "radiance-general_008560"}
