{"body": "Hi Stefano,\n\n\nThe ambient value is used as a proxy estimate for the interreflected light, to be used for pixels when the other ambient investigation methods have been exhausted (ab, as, ad, lw, etc). It's a \"value of last resort\", if you will. So in one sense, if you drive the simulation with aggressive ambient parameters, the av setting becomes fairly irrelevant because a \"good\" av will be derived deterministically. Of course in keeping with the \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\" theme, cranking up the other ambient parameters results in long simulation times. There are some rules of thumb regarding \"good\" av settings for indoor and outdoor scenes that you can start with (consultation of the \"rad\" manual page will reveal these), but for a good image or numeric result you should be asking Radiance to do some raytracing to tease these values out for all the little corners of your space. \n\n\nAs far as using rvu for a testbed, this is an excellent way to interactively see the effects of the various parameters on appearance and render time. If you change a setting though, you need to redraw the image with the \"new\" command, or by clicking \"redraw\" on the new Qt-based rvu that comes with the NREL installers, to see the effect. Speaking of the NREL Radiance installers, we are posting updated packages tomorrow that address the missing .cal files issue that is present in the current installers. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008562.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 14, 2012 at 06:47PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008561", "id": "radiance-general_008562"}
