{"body": "Hi Stefano,\n\n\nThe short answer is that it's unnecessary as long as you run the simulation with reasonable parameters. The fact that you are getting lousy images is probably because you don't have a proper view set up for DaylightSim, and the error handling for that is lousy/non-existent, because, yes, I did write it. =8-/\n\n\nWe have also focused on numeric grids since the implementation of the 3-phase method, and it may be that something is simply broken. Can you do me a favor and repost this question on the OpenStudio forum and we can hash out the script issues over there, since this isn't really a Radiance problem?

So which would be the best way of getting a good image with a \"correct\" exposure if I want, for example, to automate the images production process with a script?\nMy question ultimately ends up referring to the Ruby script Daylightsim.rb for Openstudio exported models (which was probably written by you?) which is giving me in output very dark/bad quality .hdr images.\n\n\nThanks,\nStefano\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefano Moret\nCalifornia Lighting Technology Center<http://cltc.ucdavis.edu/>\nUniversity of California, Davis\n633 Pena Drive\nDavis, CA 95618\n\n\n530-747-3846\nsmoret at ucdavis.edu<mailto:smoret at ucdavis.edu>\n\n\nOn 14/mag/2012, at 18.47, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n\n\nHi Stefano,\n\n\nThe ambient value is used as a proxy estimate for the interreflected light, to be used for pixels when the other ambient investigation methods have been exhausted (ab, as, ad, lw, etc). It's a \"value of last resort\", if you will. So in one sense, if you drive the simulation with aggressive ambient parameters, the av setting becomes fairly irrelevant because a \"good\" av will be derived deterministically. Of course in keeping with the \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\" theme, cranking up the other ambient parameters results in long simulation times. There are some rules of thumb regarding \"good\" av settings for indoor and outdoor scenes that you can start with (consultation of the \"rad\" manual page will reveal these), but for a good image or numeric result you should be asking Radiance to do some raytracing to tease these values out for all the little corners of your space.\n\n\nAs far as using rvu for a testbed, this is an excellent way to interactively see the effects of the various parameters on appearance and render time. If you change a setting though, you need to redraw the image with the \"new\" command, or by clicking \"redraw\" on the new Qt-based rvu that comes with the NREL installers, to see the effect. Speaking of the NREL Radiance installers, we are posting updated packages tomorrow that address the missing .cal files issue that is present in the current installers.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008564.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 15, 2012 at 01:06PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008561", "id": "radiance-general_008564"}
