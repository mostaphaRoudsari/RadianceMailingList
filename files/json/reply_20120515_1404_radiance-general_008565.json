{"body": "Hi Stefano,\n\n\nIt sounds to me that you think exposure needs to be set before rendering.  It doesn't.  The image format used by Radiance contains more data than typical image formats allowing you to adjust exposure after rendering.  With rvu you can type \"e\", then enter then click on any pixel to adjust the overall image exposure to the value of that pixel. Or you can type \"e 1\" to adjust to the exposure to the image average (\" e 2 \" is twice the image average).  Or \"e -1\" to reduce exposure by one f-stop (+1 to increase).  You can adjust exposure as much as you like in rvu.\n\n\nFor a rendered hdr image you can adjust exposure after rendering with pfilt.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008565.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 15, 2012 at 02:04PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008561", "id": "radiance-general_008565"}
