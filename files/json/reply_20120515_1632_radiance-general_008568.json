{"body": "Hi Stefano,\n\n\nSorry, I thought maybe you were coming from one of the other rendering tools where you need to set exposure as a rendering parameter.  get it wrong and you wasted valuable computation time.\n\n\nThere are two options for automated post-processing in Radiance: pfilt sets the exposure to the image average and pcond mimics human visual response.  You could just run your images through one of those tools and they would select a good exposure for each image.  \n\n\nrpict -ab ... mymodel.oct > image.hdr\npfilt image.hdr > exposureadjusted_image.hdr\nor \npcond image.hdr > humanvision_image.hdr\n\n\nIf you want all your images to use the same exposure, you can use pfilt with a single pass (-1) and set exposure with \"-e\".  In this case, I'd suggest having separate render and post process scripts so you can easily change the exposure - it might require a bit of fiddling to find a single exposure that gives decent results for all images.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008568.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 15, 2012 at 04:32PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008561", "id": "radiance-general_008568"}
