{"body": "Dear Stefano, et al,\n\n\nMy rendering pipeline often contains a call to pfilt to set the exposure as\nif the picture was taken with a particular fstop and exposure. Look at this\nreference:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/filmspeed.html\n\n\nHere is the example from that site. You can see the \"1/60\" and \"4\" in the\ncall to ev. Very handy.\n\n\nSo, if you were trying to produce an image as it would appear shot at 1/60\nsec. on ASA 100 (ISO 21) film at f-4, you would apply pfilt thusly:\n\n\n\tpfilt -1 -e `ev \"2.81*1/60*21/4^2\"` raw.pic > fin.pic\n\n\n\n\nHope that helps,\nTim\n\n\nPS: here it is in action. Note I do not save the original file and direct\nstandard error to /dev/null. Both of these are probably a bad idea.\n\n\n rpict $VIEWPOINT \\\n                       -ps 1 -pt 0.15 -pj 0.6 \\\n                       -dj 0.7 -ds 0.5 -dt -0.5 -dc 0.75 -dr 1 -dp 256 \\\n                       -ss 0.3 -st 0.02 \\\n                       -ab 3  -aa 0.05 -ar 64 -ad 2048 -as 1024 \\\n                       -lr 4 -lw 0.0001 \\\n                       -x 2500 -y 2500 \\\n                       clock.oct 2> /dev/null \\\n                           | pfilt -1 -e `ev \"2.81*1/60*21/4^2\"` -x /4 -y\n/4 -r 0.6 > $filtFile\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008569.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Perry", "created_at": "May 15, 2012 at 04:40PM", "created_by": "Tim_Perry", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008561", "id": "radiance-general_008569"}
