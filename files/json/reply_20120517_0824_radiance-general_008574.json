{"body": "Well, I think the neural network needs at least 300 pixel samples to do its work, meaning that the total number of pixels divided by the -n option must be at least 300.  Even with -n 1, it can fail if you only give it an image that's a couple of hundred pixels in size.  I don't think the other converters are so constrained.  You could use ra_bmp which does tone-mapping also, or ra_t8 if you really want an 8-bit image.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008574.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 17, 2012 at 08:24AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008570", "id": "radiance-general_008574"}
