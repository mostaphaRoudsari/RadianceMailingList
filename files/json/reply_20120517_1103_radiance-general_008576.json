{"body": "You should get a usage error.  The 4.1 version of pflip needs the input file on the command line, so it can seek on it for the -v option.  While technically not necessary for the -h option by itself, this is how I wrote it figuring it was not worth the effort for the corner case of someone wanting on pflip -h to read from stdin.\n\n\nI have modified the code and uploaded a new version that works in your scenario.  I will e-mail you the C file separately.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008576.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 17, 2012 at 11:03AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008575", "id": "radiance-general_008576"}
