{"body": "Dear Greg, thank you very much!\n\n\nI've got the C file you sent. However, I have no experience in C\nprogramming. So, can you kindly advise me how should I \"compile\" or \"do\nwith\" it?\n\n\nWhat I want to do is to get a falsecolor sky radiance fisheye image and map\nit back to a virtual sky dome. See the link below:\nhttp://diva4rhino.com/forum/topics/gendaylit-in-diva-2-0-seriously-underesitmates-total-irradiation\n\n\nSince the falsecolor image I generated from falsecolor2.exe is one with\nEast and West switched, I need to crop it to get ride of the color legend\nand flip horizontally it so that East and West are correctly visualized.\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008577.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "May 17, 2012 at 12:13PM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008575", "id": "radiance-general_008577"}
