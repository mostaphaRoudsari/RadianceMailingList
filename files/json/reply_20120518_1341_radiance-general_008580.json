{"body": "Thanks, Greg and Tim!\n\n\nCan you kindly explain the \"reversing the order of operation\" approach? Do\nyou mean flipping the image first before cropping it?\n\n\nBTW, it seems that the horizontally flipped .hdr image created by pflip\ncannot be correctly displayed in PhotosphereU application on Mac system.\nWhat is shown in PhotosphereU is still the original one before flipping.\nHowever, the flipped image can be correctly displayed in Photoshop. I'm not\nsure if there's something wrong with my Mac system because the flipped .hdr\nimage can't be properly previewed either...\n\n\nPlease kindly advise!\n\n\nThe original hdr image:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/episodehopezh/files/original.hdr?attredirects=0&d=1\n\n\nThe flipped hdr image:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/episodehopezh/files/flipped.hdr?attredirects=0&d=1\n\n\n\n\n- Cheers, Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008580.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "May 18, 2012 at 01:41PM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008575", "id": "radiance-general_008580"}
