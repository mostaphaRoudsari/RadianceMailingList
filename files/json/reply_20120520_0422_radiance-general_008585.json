{"body": "I think you get two suns but one sky. Not sure which one of the two. Suspect the one listed last in the octree.\nif you want to cumulate sky contributions you need to add images of each sky together and map them back in a new scene with brightfunc and glow.\nThe process may look something like this:\n\n\nrpict -w- -x 256 -y 256 -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -ps 1 model1.oct  > yoursky1.pic\nrpict -w- -x 256 -y 256 -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -ps 1 model2.oct  > yoursky2.pic\npcomb yoursky1.pic yoursky2.pic > yoursky.pic\n\n\nand then back in a new radiance scene, like this\n\n\nvoid colorpict dist \n11 noop noop noop yoursky.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 90 \n0                     \n0                     \ndist glow skyglow     \n0                     \n0                     \n4 1 1 1 0             \nskyglow source sky    \n0                     \n0                     \n4 0 0 1 180           \n\n\nPlease check it works and debug as appropriate.\nIt has been some time I have run this\u2026 and I do not recall why rx and ry, but probably has to do with the fisheye.cal. \nNot sure.\n\n\nNowadays I would suggest using rtcontrib as it does the same and much more...\nGood luck,\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008585.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giulio antonutto", "created_at": "May 20, 2012 at 04:22AM", "created_by": "giulio_antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008584", "id": "radiance-general_008585"}
