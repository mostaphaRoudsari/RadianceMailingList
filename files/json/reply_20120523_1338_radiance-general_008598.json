{"body": "See this before, many times.\nIt seems to be related to the machine being under pressure and not able to cope with the synch.\nSo my suggestion is not to run too many things at the same time and modulate the machine workload.\nAlternatively you should look into splitting rpict with vwrays. You should be able to easily split images in tiles and render them and assemble in the end.\nThis would avoid synch issue as you would be doing the synch in the end manually.\n\n\nOne of the tricks that I have been using, unless you have -aa 0, is to render the same thing with an ambient file in many processes at the same time.\nIt seems (and it has been proven with practise) to help the rendering to come out faster.\nSo nothing difficult, you need just to launch the same rendering over each core, share the ambient file and retain just 1 image and trash the others.\nSimple and effective.\n:-)\n\n\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008598.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giulio antonutto", "created_at": "May 23, 2012 at 01:38PM", "created_by": "giulio_antonutto", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008596", "id": "radiance-general_008598"}
