{"body": "I have had this problem (tiles getting written to the wrong xy image \nlocation) as well and tried to track down the issue to little avail. I \nthink the easiest thing to do is render separate tiles and assemble as a \npost process. I think that this is also actually preferable at least \nfrom the standpoint of file locking over a network. Probably a variety \nof ways to do this.\n\n\nI have not tried Giulio's trick with the populating the ambient cache, I \nwould like to give it a try if I get a chance. Typically I have run one \nprocess to populate the ambient cache before distributing the tiles.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nSee this before, many times.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008599.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "May 23, 2012 at 01:47PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008596", "id": "radiance-general_008599"}
