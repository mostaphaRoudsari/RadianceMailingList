{"body": "Another workaround is to use vwrays and rtrace instead of rpiece, like so:\n\n\n\tset vargs=`rad -s -n -V -v $vw $rif OPTF=render.opt`\n\tvwrays -ff -x $xr -y $yr $vargs | rtrace -n $nprocs -ffc `vwrays -d -x $xr -y $yr $vargs` @render.opt $octree > render.hdr\n\n\nThe first command sets the view and puts rendering options in a file for rtrace.  The side-effect is that every pixel gets rendered, and of course you will want to run pfilt on the output in most cases.  (You can of course add it to the command with \"| pfilt -1 -x /3 -y /3 -r .6\" after rtrace.)\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008602.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 23, 2012 at 02:16PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008596", "id": "radiance-general_008602"}
