{"body": "I can verify that missing sections of images happens on both Linux and \nMAC computers when an ambient file is used though not consistantly.\n\n\nOften I have suspected/verified that the number of -N specified is \ngreater than the actual number of cores available. For example a i7 \nMacbook that a student had in my office 10 minutes ago shows only 4 \ncores hence -N 4 would seem appropriate. Some images would complete \nwhile others left black patches. All I did was to delete the offending \nhdr image and re-issue the rad command exactly to have the image rebuilt \n- much faster as the ambient file has already been populated.\n\n\nI suspect that the -N number should generally be kept to at least 1 \nbelow the max cores available.\n\n\nQuestions for the Development List :\n1) Can multi-core processing be added to trad  (-n for rvu and -N rad)? \nWhile it is possible to add a -n 4 in the trad options line for rvu, you \ncannot use a -N in the option line for rad.\n2) Can the image size resolution for single core processing be the same \nas multi-core to allow further processing with falsecolor. When rad -N \nprocessing uses rpiece the image size can be modified/rationalised. This \ndoes not happen in single core processing, hence falsecolor would fail \nwhen mixing images due to image size mismatch.\n\n\nTerrance Mc Minn\nLecturer\nSchool of Built Environment\nCurtin University of Technology\n**\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008605.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance Mc Minn", "created_at": "May 23, 2012 at 09:28PM", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008596", "id": "radiance-general_008605"}
