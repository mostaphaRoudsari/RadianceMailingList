{"body": "Randolph,\n\n\nThank you very much for sharing nice study. It's interesting results. Last\ntime, I relied on the LCD manufacturer brightness specs or nit number to\nmodel and I was not sure whether it was a correct method.\nAdditionally, in your first image, may i know how you set the brightness\nsetting in your computer? was it in maximum/100% brightness setting?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\nEddy Santosa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eddy Santosa", "created_at": "May 25, 2012 at 03:56PM", "created_by": "Eddy_Santosa", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008611", "id": "radiance-general_008612"}
