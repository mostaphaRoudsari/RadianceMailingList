(My notes are incomplete.  Woe, woe!)\n\n\nThe display is about three years old, and the fluorescent tubes in it \nare dimmer than the were when it was new.  So a new one would be \nsomewhat brighter.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008618.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
