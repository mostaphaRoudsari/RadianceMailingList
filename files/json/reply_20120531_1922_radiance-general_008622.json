{"body": "It seems like you're getting it to compile. I would recommend you place it in the same directory as all your Radiance binaries, so that evalglare will be in a search path target. Also make sure it's been set to be executable. You may need admin privileges to do both of these things. For example, if Radiance is in /usr/local/bin, and you are currently in the directory where you compiled evalglare:\n\n\nsudo cp evalglare /usr/local/bin (you will be prompted for the admin password)\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/evalglare\n\n\nGive that a whirl, and if you still have problems, maybe some more detail about what happens when you try to run evalglare will be needed. \n\n\n- Rob\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008622.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 31, 2012 at 07:22PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008621", "id": "radiance-general_008622"}
