{"body": "Coincidentally, I'm working now to improve the speed & efficiency of rtcontrib, especially for multi-processors.  If any Unix users are interested in trying it out, I've checked a working version into the HEAD.  The program is (temporarily) named rcontrib, to segregate it from its predecessor, but the options and operation should be identical.  Once it's fully tested, I plan to replace the existing rtcontrib with this new version, which has been substantially redesigned.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008642.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 11, 2012 at 11:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008637", "id": "radiance-general_008642"}
