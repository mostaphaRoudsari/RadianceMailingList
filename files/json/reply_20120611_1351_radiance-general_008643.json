{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nTo run Radiance on Windows, Robert Guglielmetti, has developed a new\npackage.\nYou can find it here:\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\nThe original announcement is here:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008534.html\nThis new package has rvu for Windows. Which is a big improvement.\nI am sure Robert can explain a lot better/more than me. Good luck!\n\n\nIn Reply to:\n>> I'm wondering how Windows users access Radiance. It's been a few years\nsince I've used the software, and as I recall previously it was done\nthrough a CygWin interface. Right now we are building geometry in\nDesignBuilder which installs Radiance on >> the machine, but I'm wanting to\nedit my rad files, materials, and create new views that DesignBuilder\ndoesn't allow.\n\n\n>> What are people on Windows machines using? What problems have been\nencountered? Any upcoming releases that I should be aware of when choosing\na software path? Including links to specific builds would also be much\nappreciated.\n\n\nBest Guy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008643.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Guy Vaessen", "created_at": "June 11, 2012 at 01:51PM", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008641", "id": "radiance-general_008643"}
