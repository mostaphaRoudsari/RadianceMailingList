{"body": "At home, I've used virtualization software (VirtualBox, VMWare, etc) to\ncreate a fully operable Linux guest to run Radiance from a Windows 7\nhost. While this may not be entirely efficient use of available\nresources (Windows is still running), it is convenient enough to run\nRadiance with access to multiple cores and the ability to recompile from\nsource as updates are made. Nice to be able to flip back and forth\nbetween Linux and Windows programs for an efficient (enough) workflow,\nwithout requiring rebooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't tested Rob's OpenStudio, but it certainly seems promising\nbased on the talks from the 2011 Radiance Workshop. Compiling in Linux\ncan be difficult if you're not entirely sure what packages/dependencies\nare needed for your build. You can also download OpenStudio precompiled\nversions of Radiance if that suits your needs better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Coulter\n\n\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n\n\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\n\n\nNew York, NY 10005\n\n\nTel: 212.334.2025\n\n\nDirect: 212.616.0254\n\n\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com\n\n\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008644.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "June 11, 2012 at 04:10PM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008641", "id": "radiance-general_008644"}
