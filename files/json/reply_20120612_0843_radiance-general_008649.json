{"body": "Hi Nasif,\n\n\nInformation for the BSDF material is at the bottom of page 12:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf\n\n\nThough I've found that the BSDF material doesn't work well for\ndaylight coefficient based annual simulations (I'm assuming dds.bash is a\ndynamic daylight simulation script).  Putting the solar radiance into\nskypatches relies on probabilistic sampling to find patches containing the\nsun, and if you don't have much direct transmission from the direction of\nthe sun, you aren't likely to find the sun.  Not finding the sun causes big\nerrors.  For now, the three-phase method is a better alternative for annual\nsimulation of BSDF materials (you can find a tutorial at the bottom of this\npage: http://www.radiance-online.org:82/learning/tutorials - if you're at\nwork, your company's firewall might block access to port 82 - the temporary\nlocation of the new radiance online).\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008649.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "June 12, 2012 at 08:43AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008646", "id": "radiance-general_008649"}
