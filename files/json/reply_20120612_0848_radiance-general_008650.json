{"body": "The Radiance offerings at NREL's OpenSutdio website are merely an attempt to provide folks with an easy path to using Radiance. Since OpenStudio now leverages Radiance, we (NREL) felt it was critical to provide a relatively simple way to get Radiance running on anyone's system. Windows support has historically been a missing tooth in the Radiance community, so this is why we embarked on this mission. Personally, the lack of Windows support forced me to love UNIX, and eventually MacOS. But we recognize that the vast majority will not have the opportunity or desire to look beyond Microsoft when they choose an operating system, and so we felt that this was necessary. Kudos to Greg Ward for supporting the effort, and again, I hope to post updated installers and HOWTOs soon. \n\n\n- Rob \n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008650.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 12, 2012 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008641", "id": "radiance-general_008650"}
