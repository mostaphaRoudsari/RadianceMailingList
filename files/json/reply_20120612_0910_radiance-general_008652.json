{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks a lot for your efforts in improving rtcontrib -- this makes a great\ntool even more valuable\n\n\nI just ran genBSDF for a specular lamella system generating a BSDF with\nfull Klems representation. To compare rcontrib to rtcontrib I just replaced\nthe\nrespective calls in the genBSDF perl script. I compared the resulting BSDFs\njust by quick simulations of diffuse-diffuse transmissions and reflections\nas well as diffuse transmissions and reflections from a CIE overcast sky, a\ndiffuse sky and a diffuse ground. Modulo MC noise the result seem to be\nperfectly the same.\n\n\nUsing 8 cores the simulation times were appoximately 185min for the\nexisting version with rtcontrib and 104 min with the new rcontrib tool!!\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012/6/11 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008652.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Geisler-Moroder", "created_at": "June 12, 2012 at 09:10AM", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008637", "id": "radiance-general_008652"}
