{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nThanks for testing this out!   It's great to get the feedback.  I've run my own (similar) tests and things look OK, but I haven't checked the data thoroughly, and I need to check corner cases, other operation modes, recovery, etc.\n\n\nI just checked in some more changes that improve efficiency when you have a lot of processes.  I tried it with 24 processes on my Mac Pro, and it went from 85% utilization to about 99% with these new changes.  I don't think I ever got better than 20% utilization with the original code on as many cores.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008654.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 12, 2012 at 10:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008637", "id": "radiance-general_008654"}
