{"body": "Lars,\n\n\nI have done several LEED compliance calculations in the past using clear\nsky with sun (+s as the gensky parameter). This allows for daylight\nredirecting devices to push light further into a space, and more\nrecently the requirement for glare control above 500fc.\n\n\nMy take is that the phrase \"clear sky\" does not mean \"clear sky without\nsun\" as might be mistaken in general radiance terms. I've always assumed\nthe sun is included. \n\n\nNone of our submitted calculations have been questioned to date, so\nassume that this is acceptable. \nHope this helps!\n\n\nCheers.\n\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\nTel: 212.334.2025\nDirect: 212.616.0254\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com \nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008659.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "June 19, 2012 at 06:16AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008656", "id": "radiance-general_008659"}
