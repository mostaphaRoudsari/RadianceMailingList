For the older CIE sky types, I am not clear on what gensky uses to predict the magnitude (zenith luminance, Lz) but from what I have seen it does not match the methodology that the IESNA lays out for predicting Lz.  With gensky alone I might get around 70,000 lux on a sunny summer day where as the IESNA guidelines would predict around 100,000lux.  This is the reason I wrote a IES_gensky.py python script, it produces the same CIE sky distribution functions (adopted by IESNA) but also uses IESNA guidelines to determine Lz based on some lookup tables.  I recall some babbling from me on this topic around when I developed this:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001074.html\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001090.html\n\n\n\n\nHi Zack,\n\n\nIt's my understanding that gensky produces sky type 1, which is the standard overcast sky, and sky type 12 for the clear sky from the 15 in the CIE table from 2003. I'm not sure which one it uses for the intermediate sky, nor do I know if it's using the 5 parameter method or something else.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008667.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 19, 2012 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008656", "id": "radiance-general_008667"}
