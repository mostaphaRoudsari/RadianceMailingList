{"body": "Juicy subject matter. It's be cool if Zacks work could get incorporated\ninto Radiance. I also agree though that the Perex model is preferred, and\nIan Askdown has written his own version of gendaylight in C++ and\nvalidated it. Only issue there is that his tool puts out data in the way\nhe wishes to use for his work. There's beed to be some effort writing a\nwrapper for the Ashdown_gensky output to be able to use his source in\nRadiance, but it's totally open source.
