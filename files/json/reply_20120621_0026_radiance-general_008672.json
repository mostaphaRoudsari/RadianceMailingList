{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\njust a note on the 15 \"new\" CIE sky types from 2003: these luminance\ndistributions can be\nused in Radiance using Philipp Greenup's ssldlum.cal that can be downloaded\nfrom\nwww.radiance-online.org/patches/ssld/SSLD algorithm with PDF.zip\n\n\nHowever, afaik these models are not commonly used (and even not really well\nknown)...\n\n\nA short note on Rob's comment: if I remember right the new CIE sky type 1\nis slightly different\nfrom the \"good old\" overcast sky. That's why the classical overcast sky\n(with the 3:1 distribution\nL(gamma)/L(zenith) = (1+2*sin(gamma))/3 ) is defined as additional 16th sky\ntype in the CIE Standard.\n\n\nBest,\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008672.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Geisler-Moroder", "created_at": "June 21, 2012 at 12:26AM", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008656", "id": "radiance-general_008672"}
