{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nWarnings can generally be ignored. Errors are a problem, because they generally cause one or more programs to fail to compile. But warnings (as you have here) are not a big deal. Is XCode refusing to make all the programs because of this warning? I'd doubt it. Regardless, XCode is overkill if all you want to do is compile the source code. The \"makeall\" script that is in the source tree works flawlessly on the mac and on Linux. It too will generate these warnings, but like I said they can be ignored. As long as you don't end up with the dreaded \"there were some errors.\" message at the end of the makeall script, you should be all set!\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 23, 2012, at 8:55 AM, Ji Zhang wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008678.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 23, 2012 at 08:20AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008677", "id": "radiance-general_008678"}
