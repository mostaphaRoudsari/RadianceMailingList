{"body": "Dear Janelle,\n\n\nit is no big deal, but I get lots of messages that you are out of hte\noffice on the Radiance list. Could you please check and see if you can\nturn-off your vacation messages for the Radiance list? I know you can do it\nin Microsoft Exchange. If you have that system and want me to send you\ndirections, please let me know.\n\n\nThis really isn't that big a deal. I know how to hit \"delete\".\n\n\nGood luck with your travels,\nTim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008682.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Perry", "created_at": "June 24, 2012 at 12:20PM", "created_by": "Tim_Perry", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008681", "id": "radiance-general_008682"}
