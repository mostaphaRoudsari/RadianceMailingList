{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nLooking at your files, the problem seems to be the usage of lboxcorr, which specifies in the comment at the beginning of source.cal requires that the impostor geometry be centered at the origin.  The xform command following genbox that someone created does not put the center at the origin.  You can correct for this by either switching the \"lboxcorr\" to the slightly less-accurate \"boxcorr\" variable, or adding a transform to your brightdata string arguments (-t 0 0 0.08).  The ies2rad program never outputs \"lboxcorr\" because of its finicky nature.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008691.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 27, 2012 at 06:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008689", "id": "radiance-general_008691"}
