{"body": "I have recently installed RADIANCE 4.1 on my mac (ver 10.7.4) and i\nwas, up until recently, merrily making my way through Axel's rtcontrib\nlesson.\n\n\n\n\n# I am getting stuck when trying to implement gendaylit . . .\n\n\n# I have what i consider to be acceptable input to gendaylit:\n\n\nkyle% gendaylit 6 24 11.5 -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m -0 -W 159 447\n\n\n# and the error message:\n\n\n# gendaylit 6 24 11.5 -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m 0 -W 159 447\nfile coeff_perez.dat cannot be opened\nlect_coeff_perez does not work\n\n\n\n\n# the direct normal value and diffuse horizontal value, along with the\nday, month,  hour, latitude, longitude, and meridian, are from the\nGatwick epw file GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw which is\nconsidered by Axel (in his tutorial) to be of sufficient quality to\nnot produce gendaylit errors, and i think i am pulling realistic\nweather values for that time, so i'm perplexed here. And i've tried a\nfew other times and values, but my guess is that it's not struggling\nto make a sky model and giving up.\n\n\nIs it a simple permission issue?\nI've tried chmod 755 and chmod 644 to the coeff_perez.dat but it\nalready had acceptable permissions assigned to it.\n\n\nis it a location issue?\nthe file is in /usr/local/ray/src/gen\n\n\nis it a PATH issue? (here is from my env)\n\n\nPATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/ray/bin\n\n\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/ray/lib\n\n\nMANPATH=/usr/share/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/X11/share/man:/opt/local/share/man:/usr/local/ray/doc/man\n\n\n\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated, as usual, it is probably\nsomething very simple. . .\n\n\n-Kyle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008695.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "kyle konis", "created_at": "June 28, 2012 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "kyle_konis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007566", "id": "radiance-general_008695"}
