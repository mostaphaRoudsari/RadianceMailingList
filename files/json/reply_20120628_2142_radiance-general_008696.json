{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nHow did you install Radiance? Reason I ask is that coeff_perez.dat usually makes its way from /usr/local/ray/src/gen into your library directory (which you are pointing to as /usr/local/ray/lib), but you mention your copy of this .dat file is still only located in the src subdirectory. Running Greg's makeall script or installing the Radiance binaries from the NREL download will place this file in the prescribed lib directory. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 28, 2012, at 10:03 PM, kyle konis wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008696.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 28, 2012 at 09:42PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007566", "id": "radiance-general_008696"}
