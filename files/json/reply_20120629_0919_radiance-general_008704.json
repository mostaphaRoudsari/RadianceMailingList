{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nYou are correct, the \"makeall library\" command was the culprit.  Before gendaylit was added, none of the auxiliary files had the *.dat suffix, so these weren't copied by this command.  I have corrected this oversight now, thanks to you.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008704.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 29, 2012 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007566", "id": "radiance-general_008704"}
