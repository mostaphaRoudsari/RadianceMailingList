{"body": "If you use the NREL Radiance installers for MacOS or Linux, they place the manpages in a \"man\" subdirectory of the radiance install location. Just add that to your MANPATH variable, and you can pull up the latest manpages from the command line. I also just discovered that groff has been ported to Windows (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/groff.htm), so I will start including the manpage subdirectory in our Windows installers as well, and you can use the groff for Windows utility to read them. I highly recommend going this route rather then printing them all out, since you'll always be up to date, and save a few sheets of paper while you're at it.  I will be rebuilding the Radiance installers here soon, because there are some new features and bug fixes that I want to get out there (as well as the manpages for Windows users). I'll post an update here when they are live.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008707.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 29, 2012 at 12:51PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008706", "id": "radiance-general_008707"}
