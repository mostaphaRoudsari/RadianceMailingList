{"body": "Dear list, following Kyle's post:\n\n\nI was trying to render an image for the view from the back of the room\nregarding the contribution from each of the 145 sky patches (Axel's\ntutorial pp. 17)\n\n\nThe 146 individual sky patches hdr sterographic images are stored in the\n\"145_patches_rcontrib\" directory.\n\n\nThen I ran the following bash shell script:\n\n\nDIMS=600\nvw=\"-x $DIMS -y $DIMS -vf ./views/back.vf\"\nvwrays -ff $vw | rcontrib -bn 146 @./rtc.opt \\\n-fo -ffc $(vwrays -d $vw) -f tregenza.cal -b tbin \\\n-o ./145_patches_rcontrib/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow \\\n-w ./testroom_whitesky.oct\n\n\nEach of the 146 sky patch hdr images was replaced by a room view rendering.\nHowever, some of the hdr images seem to have problem and can't be open with\nPhotoSphere, such as p001-008, p024-038, p054-066, p080-090, p104-113,\np123-129, p137-140, and p144\n\n\nMay I ask if this is because no contribution from these specific sky\npatches to the visible surfaces can be identified from this point of view\nat the back of the room (e.g. the sky patch is \"behind\" the vertical window\nplane judging from the change of the shadow pattern of the renderings) ?\n\n\nThanks!\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008714.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "June 30, 2012 at 09:44PM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008709", "id": "radiance-general_008714"}
