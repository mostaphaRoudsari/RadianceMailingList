{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nIn the legacy build system, Version.c is built by make using \"verscript.ed\" called by Rmakefile.  I don't know how it's supposed to be built in the cmake system.  Do you have a working copy of the \"ed\" editor on Debian?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I am leaving this morning for a week of camping, where I won't be able to get to e-mail.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-July/001237.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 02, 2012 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_000691", "id": "radiance-dev_001237"}
