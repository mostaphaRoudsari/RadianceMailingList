{"body": "Lars gave a lot of good suggestions. A couple others, while not strictly\ndirect-from-AutoCAD solutions:\n\n\n- Thomas Bleicher's su2rad plugin for SketchUP\n(http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/). This will take a SketchUP model and\nconvert to Radiance, with a GUI for assigning materials. Cameras (views)\nare also exported as valid radiance view definitions.\n\n\n- NREL's OpenStudio (http://openstudio.nrel.gov/). OpenStudio allows you\nto build a whole building energy model that can be simulated with\nEnergyPlus and Radiance together. You need to build the model in the\nOpenStudio SketchUP plugin, but you get an energy model for free in the\ndeal. \n\n\nBoth of these tools are free and open source, as well.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/2/12 7:36 AM, \"imenslama at voila.fr\" <imenslama at voila.fr> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008719.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 02, 2012 at 09:09AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008716", "id": "radiance-general_008719"}
