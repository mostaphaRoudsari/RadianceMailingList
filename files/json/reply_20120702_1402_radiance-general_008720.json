{"body": "Imene\n\n\nLars already pointed out that AutoCAD is a bit of a closed world. Luckily\nyou still can download the 3DSOUT tool for the 2007 edition:\n\n\nhttp://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&id=9481286&linkID=9240618\n\n\nI used to do exports from AutoCAD regularly and also on quite complex\nmodels. 3DSOUT was able to convert pretty much all ACAD entities to 3D\nfaces. You will have to do some optimisations on the AutoCAD model to get a\ngood workflow going, though. The most common approach is to sort elements\nwith different materials onto separate layers to assign Radiance materials\nafterwards.\n\n\nThe 3DS model needs to be converted to Radiance. There are a number of\n(free) 3D tools that can read 3DS and write OBJ. OBJ is well supported by\nRadiance. Depending on the tools you are going to use you will have to do a\nbit off testing to get the details like layering and scale factors right.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008720.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 02, 2012 at 02:02PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008716", "id": "radiance-general_008720"}
