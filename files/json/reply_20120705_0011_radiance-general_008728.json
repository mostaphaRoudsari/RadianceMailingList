Objline with x11meta is a way to get a quick\nwireframe preview of objects, mostly used for debugging. If you want to\nkeep those previews e.g. for printout or archiving, you can pipe the\noutput to psmeta instead. This will hopefully not result in other\nproblems. And as others mentioned, for shaded previews, you can use rvu\n- which is using the raytracing code and allows to use all those\nparameters you may set in your final renderings.\n\n\nThe problem is not caused by ssh, as you are working locally.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008728.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
