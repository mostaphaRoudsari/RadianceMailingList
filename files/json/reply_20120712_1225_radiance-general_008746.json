{"body": "Hi Nassif,\nData in the BSDF isn't specific to a date or time, so yes it is possible to\ndo an annual simulation with the xml file from window.\n\n\nThere are two official options and one un-official option:\n\n\n1 - As Rob mentioned, you can use OpenStudio which does a lot of this for\nyou.\n\n\n2 - you can loop through hours of the weather data file. Following is a\nbash/awk example (add your weather data file at the end and include -a -o\nand -m in the gensky and gendaylit command):\ncount=-8\nwhile read line ; do\ncount=$((count+1))\nif [ count -gt 0 ] ; then\ndaytime=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $2,$3,$4-0.5}'`\nalt=`gensky $daytime  | awk '{if(NR==3) print $6}'\nif [ alt -gt 2 ]; then\ndir=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $14}'`\ndif=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $15}'`\ngendaylit $daytime -W $dir $dif | genskyvec | dctimestep V.vmx T.xml D.dmx\n>> output_$count.txt\nfi\nfi\ndone < myweather.epw\n\n\n3 - Unofficial - you can use our annual utility (dctimestepcpu) that takes\na sky matrix file (list of annual sky vectors) and multiplies a whole year\nin one go.  Let me know if you want to go this route, I can send you the\ncode for you to compile on your system.  This isn't a straight forward\ncompile process though, it may require some tweaking on your end.\nhttp://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/sites/simulationresearch.lbl.gov/files/2011-ibpsa-radiance.pdf\n\n\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008746.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 12, 2012 at 12:25PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008736", "id": "radiance-general_008746"}
