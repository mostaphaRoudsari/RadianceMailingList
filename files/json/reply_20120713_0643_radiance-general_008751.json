The direction of the\nanisotrophy is defined by the vector in the 2nd line (0 0 1). The\nurough and vrough values (0.04 and 0.09) define the roughness\nperpendicular to the roughness vector.\nSee 'plastc2' on p7 and 'metal2' on p8 of the Reference manual.\n\n\n> If i want to test this material in colour picker for radiance\n> given in this site : http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/colour_picker/index.shtml\n> where can I write the arguments of the first line ?\n\n\nThe Jaloxa colour picker only supports 'plastic' and 'metal'. Sorry.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008751.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 13, 2012 at 06:43AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008750", "id": "radiance-general_008751"}
