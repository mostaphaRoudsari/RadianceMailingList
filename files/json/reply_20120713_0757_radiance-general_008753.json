{"body": "Hi,\nconcerning values for specularity and roughness from measured scattering \ndata, you might find\n  http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/demodata/bme/ useful.\nIt gives numbers of both for some materials. They depend on incident \ndirection for most materials, but that's actually a problem of the model \nrather of the materials and their data.\n\n\nbest regards\nPeter\n\n\n    Hi,\n    Do you khow any websites that gives many examples of materials defined by their roughness and specularity fractions and RGB reflectance (examples carpet, mdf, aluminium, marble....) ? how can we choose the RGB colors in radiance when we have multicolor mat\u00e9rial like carpet?\n    thank you\n    im\u00e8ne SLAMA\n    National School of architecture of Tunis\n    ________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\npab advanced technologies Ltd, http://www.pab.eu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008753.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "created_at": "July 13, 2012 at 07:57AM", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008729", "id": "radiance-general_008753"}
