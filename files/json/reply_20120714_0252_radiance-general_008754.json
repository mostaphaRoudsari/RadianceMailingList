They depend on incident direction for most materials, but that's actually a problem of the model rather of the materials and their data.\n\n\nbest regards\nPeter\n\n\n\u00a0  Hi,\n\u00a0  Do you khow any websites that gives many examples of materials defined by their roughness and specularity fractions and RGB reflectance (examples carpet, mdf, aluminium, marble....) ? how can we choose the RGB colors in radiance when we have multicolor mat\u00e9rial like carpet?\n\u00a0  thank you\n\u00a0  im\u00e8ne SLAMA\n\u00a0  National School of architecture of Tunis\n\u00a0  ________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n-- pab advanced technologies Ltd, http://www.pab.eu\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008754.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "slama im\u00e8ne", "created_at": "July 14, 2012 at 02:52AM", "created_by": "slama_im\u00e8ne", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008729", "id": "radiance-general_008754"}
