{"body": "Hi Christoph,\n\n\nJust fyi, I expressed interest in the Radiance interest group and somehow  got promoted to group leader for the kick-off event on Wednesday. The format seems pretty open ended at the moment. I was thinking of spending a few minutes introducing Radiance and perhaps dynamic simulation and advanced materials. From there the guidance seems to be to discussion and identification of issues and topics for future meetings. This being said if there is someone who would be interested in doing a brief demo of Diva this could be good. Or if there are other local Radiance users with possible topics please let me know.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE DROID\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008756.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "July 15, 2012 at 01:13PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008755", "id": "radiance-general_008756"}
