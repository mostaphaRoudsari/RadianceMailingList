I\nalso added in the old 'ltview' (luminaire viewer) functionality that I\nwrote many years ago, which was simply a modified version of objview. It's\nsitting on a far back burner and just needs some more testing. The hope is\nit can be added to the Radiance source tree and built into the NREL\ninstallers, but failing that we'll just offer it as a download on the\nOpenStudio website when it's done. If anyone wants to beat on it, I can\nsend you a copy offline for now.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008775.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 17, 2012 at 01:12PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008771", "id": "radiance-general_008775"}
