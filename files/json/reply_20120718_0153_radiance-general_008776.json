You're probably wondering now \n> how this view file was created in the first place.\n> \n> If you run\n> $ rvu scene.oct\n> the interactive Radiance scene viewer rvu is launched with your scene in \n> it. BTW: If you are reading some VERY old documentation which is still \n> out there on the Internet, the command would be 'rview', not 'rvu'. You \n> can now use the command prompt at the bottom of the rvu window to move \n> the camera around. A list of the most useful rvu commands is in the \n> table on p18 of the Tutorial. Apart from 'aim', which is always handy, \n> the commands I use most often are:\n> \n> - when inside a room: 'rotate'\n> - when looking from the outside: 'pivot'\n> \n> The tricky bit is always to get the view point right. If you are inside \n> a room, a good starting point is to identify a good view point (think \n> tripod and camera) by looking at your plan and elevations/sections \n> which, of course, you have at least as scribble on a bit of paper.\n> \n> For external views, a good start is to first run\n> $ objview scene.mat scene.rad etc\n> \n> objview takes the material and scene files, adds a few light sources, \n> compiles an octree, and then calls rvu. Now use 'pivot' (and the other \n> rvu commands to move around the model. Once you have a good view, save \n> it like this from the rvu prompt:\n> : view views/nice.vf\n> : q\n> \n> You can now run rvu to look at the scene under your proper light \n> sources, rather than the ones objview puts in:\n> $ rvu -vf views/nice.vf scene.oct\n> \n> Or, you can run\n> $ rvu scene.oct\n> and\n> : last views/nice.vf\n> \n> Hope this helps\n> \n> Regards\n> \n> Axel\n> \n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n> \n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nCuisine, salon, chambre enfant\u2026 Les promos pour changer votre mobilier sont sur Voila.fr http://shopping.voila.fr/vitrine/meubles\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008776.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Imen Slama", "created_at": "July 18, 2012 at 01:53AM", "created_by": "Imen_Slama", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008771", "id": "radiance-general_008776"}
