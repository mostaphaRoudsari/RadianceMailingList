{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI can't test it for you, but I suspect the line:\n\n\n\t} elsif (/\\sskyfunc\\s*$/) {\n\n\nis the problem.  Try removing the final '\\s*' to make it:\n\n\n\t} elsif (/\\sskyfunc$/) {\n\n\nand see if that works.  It works on Unix, so if it solves the problem, I should check it in.  I don't know why it would be an issue, but I can't see what else could be failing.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008779.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 18, 2012 at 01:28PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008778", "id": "radiance-general_008779"}
