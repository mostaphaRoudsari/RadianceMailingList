{"body": "Hi Im\u00e8ne,\n\n\nI would propose to have a look at Axel's unix tutorial for Radiance \nusers. You can append directories to the PATH (or RAYPATH) variable \nusing colons, in bash, the syntax would be:\n\n\nexport RAYPATH=$RAYPATH:newsubdir:anothersubdir:currentdir\n\n\nWhat happens is that the variable RAYPATH (left hand) is set to the \nstring on the right hand. That string is consisting of the current \ncontent of RAYPATH (that is why you place the $ at its beginning) plus \nthe remaining line. The colon is used as a separator for directories.\n\n\nThe syntax is the same as for other environment variables. The most \npopular example would be the PATH variable, which is the search \ndirectory for executable (program) files.\n\n\nEnvironment variables are kept while you keep a session, e.g. a terminal \nwindow, open. If you want the changes to be permament, you can use your \nshell's configuration file. For bash, that would be e.g. .bashrc (a \nhidden file in your home directory). I tend to set the RAYPATH at the \nbeginning of a simple script, which than calls rad. There are many \noptions, again Axel's tutorial is probably a good starting point.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008785.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
