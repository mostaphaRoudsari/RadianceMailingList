{"body": "Hi Imene\n\n\nThe RAYPATH environment variable tells the Radiance binaries where to\nsearch for files if they can't be found in the current directory. In your\ncase with the command\n\n\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad\n\n\nRadiance expects the file \"chair.rad\" in the current directory, that is the\ndirectory where you issue the \"oconv\" command. Since you have the chair.rad\nand table.rad files in a subdirectory called \"objects\" you should use the\nfollowing line to place your scene elements:\n\n\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 objects/chair.rad\n\n\nTry this first before you start to fiddle with the RAYPATH variable.\n\n\nBTW: A common way to organize your scene files is to keep all your geometry\nin a \"objects\" directory (and optionally a \"skies\" directory for sky files\nand so on). Then you create a single file \"scene.rad\" that only references\nthe files in the \"objects\" directory via \"!xform\" commands:\n\n\n!xform materials.rad\n!xform skies/sunny_sky.rad\n\n\n!xform objects/room.rad\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 objects/chair.rad\n!xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 objects/table.rad\n\n\n\n\nThen you only need the command\n\n\noconv scene.rad > scene.oct\n\n\nto create the octree file. If you want a differente scene you just copy the\nscene.rad file and add or remove whichever geometry you want to change.\n\n\nRegards\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008786.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 19, 2012 at 06:26AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008782", "id": "radiance-general_008786"}
