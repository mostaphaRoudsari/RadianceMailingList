{"body": "Hi Giulio,\n\n\nthanks!\n\n\nBoth solutions are a question of calculation time... but I use the \nsecond way now to be on the safe side (calculation of image) - even it \ntakes me much longer...For the evaluation I use evalglare, is pretty \nsimple to use for such cases.\n\n\nFor reflections I already did it in that way and I used a modified \nversion of evalglare (will put it online soon) to calculate the angle \nbetween different glare sources (in that case between reflection and \nsun), too. The only disadvantage is the long calculation time of several \ndays (1 image (ab0)+evaluation takes 6 sec -> 2.5 days on a single core \nfor one point..and I have 33 points and two geometries...).\n\n\nJan\n\n\nOn 07/24/2012 10:05 PM, giulio antonutto wrote:\n> Alternatively there is another option.\n> derive illuminance from a standard image.\n> so:\n> render what a calculation point sees in view -h mode\n> then write a script to process the luminance data and the angular location alongside the solid angle of a single pixel.\n> the total contribution, the sum, would be the total illuminance, regardless of any subdivision etc.\n> but it takes 1 image for each point and you may need to investigate the resolution required to capture all sources (if small)\u2026\n> we have done this before (Andy,remember?) and it works quite well.\n> In fact the method can be extended to calculate reflections and caustics...\n> Good luck with the judge!\n> G\n>\n>\n>\n> On 24 Jul 2012, at 20:50, Jan Wienold wrote:\n>\n>> Hi Giulio, hi all,\n>>\n>> unfortunately it doesn't work out safely.
