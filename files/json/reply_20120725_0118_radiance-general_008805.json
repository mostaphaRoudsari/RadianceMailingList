{"body": "Hi Andy, hi list-subscribers,\n\n\nI just came across this recent message about the usability of the bsdf\nmaterial type with patch-based models of the sky including direct sun\nand complex fenestration. To avoid misunderstandings, I will try a short\nsummary for others to comment on available options for annual\nsimulations with complex glazing:\n\n\n\n\n1) classic radiance tools (rpict, rtrace), complemented by mkillum to\nrelax ambient setting.\n\n\nAdvantages: low noise, validated.\n\n\nDisadvantages: very slow for annual simulations, no support when\nnon-planar specular reflective surfaces are involved.\n\n\n\n\n2) rtcontrib and patch-based model.\n\n\nAdvantages: faster for annual simulations.\n\n\nDisadvantages: noise, nice images require high (slow) -ad and cannot be\noptimized using mkillum, limitations about specular non-planar\nreflectors apply.\n\n\n\n\n3) rtcontrib and patch-based model, bsdf.\n\n\nAdvantages: support for non-planar reflectors, should be slightly faster\nthen 2) as the fenestration system does not have to be traces internally\n- did anyone compare?\n\n\nDisadvantages: still high -ad settings required leading to extended\nrendering times and still no way to get mkillum in, tends to\nunderestimate direct sun (according Andy's message).\n\n\n\n\n4) three-phase-method.\n\n\nAdvantages: very fast, can also be used with non-planar specular\nreflectors as bsdf data is supported.\n\n\nDisadvantages: requires quite a lot of set-up work, e.g. subdivisions to\nreflect external obstructions. Patches visible in the results,\nfenestration geometry is not visible.\n\n\n\n\n5) pmap.\n\n\nAdvantages: can be used with non-planar reflectors and multi-peak\ntransmission.\n\n\nDisadvantages: unknown status (any news?), not integrated with rtcontrib\n(contributions would need to be rendered manually).\n\n\n\n\nSo if I need a way to generate images with visible fenestration\ngeometry, the only reliable option would be 2), which requires very\nhight settings for -ad and thud will still be rather time-consuming, if\nnoise is to be controlled.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nOn Tue, 2012-06-12 at 08:43 -0700, Andrew McNeil wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008805.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
