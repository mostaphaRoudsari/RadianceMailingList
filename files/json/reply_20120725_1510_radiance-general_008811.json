{"body": "Dear Greg,\n   Thank you for letting us know about the -c option.  I am going to try \nit with rtcontrib (sensors) and wanted to ask for advice on how to setup \nthe points for averaging.  For example, if I choose 4 for -c, do I send \nin the same point 4 times or is there a heuristic for perturbing or \nregularly spacing these points for improving results?\n   Thanks for creating this feature!\n\n\n- Dan\n\n\nOn 7/25/2012 10:44 AM, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008811.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel C.
