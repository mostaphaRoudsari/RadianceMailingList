{"body": "Howdy Thomas\u2026\n\n\nOn 7/26/12 7:18 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at googlemail.com<mailto:tbleicher at googlemail.com>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHave you tried to print out the lines that are actually processed by genskyvec when it is running? The \"validation\" in the above code is very basic and will also fail if genskyvec does not receive any input at all.\n\n\nYup. Genskyvec.pl is indeed not getting anything when the full command chain is called. For example, this (Ruby) code:\n\n\ntempIO = IO.popen(\"gendaylit -ang #{tsSolarAlt} #{tsSolarAzi} -L #{tsDirectNormIllum} #{tsDiffuseHorIllum}\")\nillumTemp = tempIO.readlines.to_s\ntempIO.close\nputs \"illumTemp: #{illumTemp}\"\n\n\n\u2026at runtime, prints the gendaylit output. But this code:\n\n\ntempIO = IO.popen(\"gendaylit -ang #{tsSolarAlt} #{tsSolarAzi} -L #{tsDirectNormIllum} #{tsDiffuseHorIllum} | genskyvec#{perlExtension} -m 1 | dctimestep ./output/dc/#{space_name}/maps/#{space_name}_map.dmx | rcalc -e #{vLambda}\")\nillumTemp = tempIO.readlines.to_s\ntempIO.close\nputs \"illumTemp: #{illumTemp}\"\n\n\n\u2026at runtime, prints nothing. I had exactly the same thought of modifying genskyvec.pl to accept a file as input but I'd like to avoid the extra file I/O. I hope to have time to look at this some more today. Thanks for the input!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008817.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 26, 2012 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008808", "id": "radiance-general_008817"}
