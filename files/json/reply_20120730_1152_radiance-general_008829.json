{"body": "Hi Greg!\n\n\n> At least in my experiments, the rendering times always improved with\n> increased settings of -c for the same total number of primary rays.\n> Are you using the new rcontrib implementation or the older rtcontrib\n> (based on rtrace)?

What I observed was a really\nsignificant slow-down on a very detailed scene. I used very low settings\nfor -ad in this test (-ad 16) and few ambient bounces (-ab 3).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008829.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
