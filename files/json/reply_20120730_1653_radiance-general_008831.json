{"body": "Hi Nassif,\nIt would be helpful to have more information about your scene and BSDF (and\nwhat is dds.bash??)\n\n\nI can think of two possible causes of your error:\n\n\n1 - One of the problems with the Window BSDF data is that they have low\nresolution.  The averaging of flux over a BSDF patch causes the direct\nsunlight to smear.  The resulting sun patch is bigger and less bright.\n This is illustrated in figures 12 & 13 of this paper:\nhttp://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/4414.pdf\n\n\n2 - Using the BSDF material in a daylight coefficient simulation can under\nestimate illuminance from direct sun.  If your BSDF is for clear glass,\nthen it should be possible to improve it by setting ss to > 1 (like maybe 8\nor 10).  I think this works with rtcontrib...\n\n\nYou might also consider generating a high resolution tensor tree BSDF using\ngenBSDF.  It'll definitely help with problem 1, and would help with problem\n2 if your BSDF is clear glass.\n\n\nRegardless though, I'd suggest 3-phase method for anual simulations using\nBSDFs.  It is much better for non-specular glazing.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008831.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 30, 2012 at 04:53PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008757", "id": "radiance-general_008831"}
