{"body": "Or, if you already know the glass transmission you want to model, you can calculate transmissivity for the material definition from the total visible transmission (Tn in this formula):\n>From http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Materials\n  transmissivity = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn\n\n\nSo, if you want a glass of 90% transmission, replacing Tn with 0.9 gives transmissivity of 0.9801, so your radiance material would look like\n\n\nvoid glass glass_90percent_transmission\n0 0 3\t0.9801 0.9801 0.9801\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-August/008850.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 14, 2012 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008848", "id": "radiance-general_008850"}
