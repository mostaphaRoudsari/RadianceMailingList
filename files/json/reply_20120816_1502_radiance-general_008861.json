{"body": "Our sincere apologies for this!!  Something went wrong with the mailman server when we added the new lists Rob mentioned, and a bunch of us got hundreds of duplicate e-mails in our inboxes.  Daniel Fuller seems to have resolved the issue, although I'm still not sure what happened.\n\n\nFor the future, it's a good idea for people to refrain from posting to the list if something goes wrong, since it only adds to the noise.  It's best to write to me personally if you spot a problem.\n\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-August/008861.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 16, 2012 at 03:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008860", "id": "radiance-general_008861"}
