{"body": "Hi Javed,\n\n\nThanks for the interest! We have some somewhat dated video tutorials here:\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfz0ULTK8eQ&feature=plcp\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeeLN-KU6-c&feature=plcp\n\n\nThese show you how to use the ModelToRad.rb and DaylightSim.rb scripts to convert an OpenStudio model to Radiance format, and to run annual climate based daylight simulations. There are several other scripts as well, to create lighting schedules based on the Radiance daylighting data and occupancy schedules, etc. All of the scripts are documented here:\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance/openstudio%E2%80%99s-radiance-functionality-documentation\n\n\nThe link above is probably the best place to start, actually; it's more current than the info in the videos. Do you have a specific project or problem you wish to analyze? I'd be happy to give more detailed advice if you can share what you're trying to do.\n\n\nBy the way, you can also grab a current installer for Radiance here:\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\nNREL Commercial Buildings\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-August/000019.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 21, 2012 at 08:02AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000018", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000019"}
