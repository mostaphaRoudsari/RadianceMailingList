{"body": "Hi Peony,\n\n\nThe likely problem is that your smart phone is too smart!  Most phone cameras play tricks with the response curve, white balance, and other capture characteristics that undermine any attempt to get a consistent HDR result.  No phone cameras I know allow you a true \"manual mode\" that disables such behavior, so they aren't really suited to HDR capture.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-August/000419.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 23, 2012 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000418", "id": "hdri_000419"}
