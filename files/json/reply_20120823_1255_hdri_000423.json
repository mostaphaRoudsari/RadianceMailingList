If the scene  does not have large and smooth gradients, Photosphere cannot create a camera response curve. This could happen with any camera. A different scene that has the gradients would provide a camera response curve. However, the issues Greg pointed out are major problems with phone cameras. Even if you are able to generate the camera response curve with another scene, due to the inconsistencies Greg pointed out, it is unlikely to get accurate, reliable HDR images.\n\n\nMehlika\n\n\nOn Fri, 24 Aug 2012, Peony Au wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-August/000423.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mehlika Inanici", "created_at": "August 23, 2012 at 12:55PM", "created_by": "Mehlika_Inanici", "parent_id": "hdri_000418", "id": "hdri_000423"}
