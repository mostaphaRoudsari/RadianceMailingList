{"body": "Hi Peony,\n\n\nif you upload your sequence to\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/roll-your-own.shtml\nI'll have a look over the weekend. However, as Greg pointed out--don't \nhold your breath. You might have to use a proper camera if you're \ninterested in HDRs that are 'as accurate as possible'.
