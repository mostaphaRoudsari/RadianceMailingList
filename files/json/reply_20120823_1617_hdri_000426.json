{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI think you are asking me, as I'm the only one with access to the full source code outside of Dolby...  And no, I haven't compiled it under Ubuntu.  I haven't compiled under any recent version of Linux in fact.  I don't know how cross-compatible binaries are.  It's a pain due to all the external library dependencies (OpenEXR and TIFF mostly), but I could try recompiling it on the Lubuntu image I have under VMWare.  Can anyone tell me how likely that is to work as an executable?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-August/000426.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 23, 2012 at 04:17PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000424", "id": "hdri_000426"}
