{"body": "Chaps,\n\n\nI've recently had the pleasure of rebuilding my 64bit Fedora system from \nscratch due to a failing hard disk. Got hdrgen working, too.\n\n\nhdrgen is a 32bit application, so simply doing a\n# apt-get install libtiff\non a 64 bit Debian-based system will only pull the 64bit Tiff library. \nSo make sure you have all the 32bit deps on your 64bit system. The two \nco-exist quite happily.\n\n\nThe only bit of 'hacking' I had to do was to soft-link libtiff.so.4 \n(what comes with Fedora) to libtiff.so.3 (which is what hdrgen is linked \nagainst).\n\n\nChris, if you can expand on 'no joy', I might be able to give you a few \npointers.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nOn 08/24/2012 12:17 AM, Gregory J.
