{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nAfter a discussion with my supervisor, there are a few things I would like \nto clarify and hopefully get some help on.\n\n\nThrough the built-in app on my Smartphone, I can get seven photographs \nranging from EV - 3 to + 3 and I can manually adjust the white balance in \nthe photographs.\n\n\nI have also captured 3 photographs using a app called HDR camera, but for \nsome reason it was producing 4 photographs on my phone hence the photographs \nproviding the same EV when I uploaded to Axel's website, so I apologise for \nthat. I have emailed the developers and am waiting for an reply for them \nregarding this.\n\n\nI've been capturing the images in an artificial sky in a lighting laboratory \navailable at the university and have used a luminance meter to calibrate the \nimages.\n\n\nAnd my goal for this thesis is to develop a programmable data acquisition \nsystem that is not expensive like a DSLR camera with a fisheye lens, but \ninstead a less expensive method using an Android Smartphone plus a US$50 \nfisheye lens.\n\n\nHowever, though all the process described above, a camera response curve \ncannot be create and the error message (Cannot solve for response function) \nappears.\nIs there anything else, apart from switching to a DSLR camera, I can do to \ncreate a camera response curve?\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n\nKind regards,\nPeony\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-August/000434.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Peony Au", "created_at": "August 27, 2012 at 03:32AM", "created_by": "Peony_Au", "parent_id": "hdri_000418", "id": "hdri_000434"}
