{"body": "Hi Ery,\n\n\nLooks like you installed Ruby *after* installing OpenStudio, so the OS\ninstaller didn't install the Ruby stuff. I think if you just reinstall\nOpenStudio you will be all set. BTW, version 0.8.3 is current, and 0.8.4\nwill have Radiance integrated into the GUI!).\n\n\nI'll look into the Boost version dependency for you.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 8/27/12 10:42 AM, \"Ery Djunaedy\" <ery.mailinglist at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-August/000029.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 27, 2012 at 12:58PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000028", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000029"}
