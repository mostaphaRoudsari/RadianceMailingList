{"body": "Thank you Robert. I\u00b4ve installed the latest version of OpenStudio (0.8.3) and the DaylightSim Ruby \nscript seems working well. The simulation with --dcts option ends without the prevoius Windows \n\"Gendaylit error\" but when I open the annual daylight illuminance profile (.ill) to check \nsimulation results there are only the direct normal illuminance and the diffuse horizontal \nilluminance values. No results about daylight sensor illuminance and point illuminance.\nDo you think could be a problem with the illuminance map modeled in SketchUp or again with \nGendaylit?\nLooking forward to hear from you!\n\n\nSilvia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, 24 Aug 2012 08:53:31 -0600\n  \"Guglielmetti, Robert\" <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-August/000030.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "CAMMARANO SILVIA", "created_at": "August 28, 2012 at 07:01AM", "created_by": "CAMMARANO_SILVIA", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000021", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000030"}
