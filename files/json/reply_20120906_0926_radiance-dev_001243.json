{"body": "> 3 - falsecolor , genBSDF, genklemsamp, genskyvec & objview don't exist in the CMake build source. I assume this is due to them being Perl & Ruby scripts in the NREL binaries archive (falsecolor appears to have C source code available?)\n\n\nfalsecolor , genBSDF, genklemsamp, genskyvec are all Perl scripts. At\npresent, they require a Perl interpreter to be installed. It is\npossible to compile them into exe files using PAR::Packer. I've\nsuccessfully done this with falsecolor, but this is not part of the\nbuild system yet (not in Classic and not in NREL). I believe it's one\nof Rob's nice-but-not-essential items on his to-do list.\n\n\nobjview for Windows is a Ruby script. This should probably be\nre-written in Perl to avoid unnecessary folking of the source tree and\nextra deps for non-OpenStudio users.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001243.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "September 06, 2012 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001242", "id": "radiance-dev_001243"}
