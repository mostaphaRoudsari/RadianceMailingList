The thing is I see that rcontrib is not linked on that page. What is the mechanism for updating that page and the linked pages? We'd only want to link to something that's always up to date. Alternatively, does anyone have any ideas or workflows for automatically generating pdfs of manpages on Windows? I'd much rather just include pdf versions on the Windows installers (or as Pally mentioned, maybe there's a way to build a Windows help file from them? I know nothing about Windows help files).\n\n\nJust thinking out loud.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001247.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 07, 2012 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001242", "id": "radiance-dev_001247"}
