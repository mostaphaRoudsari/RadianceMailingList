{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nthe same happened to me yesterday. Must be about the mailing list\nconfig, when I choose to reply only to the sender (not to the list) in\nmy mail client, the mail still gets send out to all. Not sure how to\nsolve that.\n\n\nStill, I think your question about the presentation format is of\n(almost) general interest for list subscribers, as quite a lot may be in\nCopenhagen on Wednesday.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-September/008875.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
