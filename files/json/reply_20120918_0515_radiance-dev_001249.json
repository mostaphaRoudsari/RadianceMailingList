{"body": "Hi Katrin,\n\n\nRadiance compiles without problems on Fedora, which is very similar to\nCentOS/RHEL. Just make sure you have the necessary prerequisites\ninstalled. From memory, these are:\n\n\n- tcl\n- tk\n- libX11-devel\n- gcc\n- gcc-c++\n- make\n\n\nYou don't need to adjust any of the files.\n\n\nIf the compilation fails, please post the lines around the first error\nmessage from the output of makeall. Error lines are marked by a\nleading '*' sign (or two?) to make them easier to spot.\n\n\nTry with the default options first. If this goes smoothly, you can\nchange OPT=-O2 to OPT=-O3 in the rmake settings. This should make the\ncode a little faster.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 18 September 2012 10:34, Katrin Muellner <muellner at transsolar.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001249.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "September 18, 2012 at 05:15AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001248", "id": "radiance-dev_001249"}
