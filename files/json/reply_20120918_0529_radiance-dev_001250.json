{"body": "Hi Katrin,\n\n\nDepending on your CentOS configuration you will probably need to install \nadditional packages in order to compile radiance from source. I have not \nused CentOS which is based on Red Hat I believe for quite some time. I \nknow that for Ubuntu, I need to install the following packages for a \nclean compile:\n\n\n*\n\n\n     1. csh - needed by radiance\n     2. emacs - this is my preference for a text editor\n     3. libX11-dev - for X11 related elements\n     4. g++\n     5. tk\n\n\n*\nBased on what you tell us, my guess is that you need to install \nsomething called glibc-devel. To do this you will need to use a package \nmanager, something like \"rpm\" or \"yum.\" Note if the machine running \nCentOS 5.5 is not \"yours\" to do with as you please (eg break) it would \nmake good sense to seek assistance from a sys admin if available.\n\n\nAs an alternative to compiling from source, it might be easier to try \nusing pre-compiled binaries that people have made available. For example:\n\n\n    http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/linux\n    https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001250.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 18, 2012 at 05:29AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001248", "id": "radiance-dev_001250"}
