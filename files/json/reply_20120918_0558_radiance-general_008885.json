{"body": "Hi Aksel!\n\n\nThe most important is to check that RAYPATH includes all needed directories. And that these actually contain the libraries you'd expect there. Type\n\n\necho \"$RAYPATH\"\n\n\nand then find whether at least rayinit.cal is in one of the returned directories.\n\n\nAbout x11meta, I am not sure how well it works in general. There seam to be several pitfalls with the meta-utilities.\n\n\nHm, and thanks for reminding me that I started setting up a FAQ-system and somehow did not really complete the job so far ;)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-September/008885.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
