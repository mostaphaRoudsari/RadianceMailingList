{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nCheers, thanks for the quick answer!\n\n\n> The most important is to check that RAYPATH includes all needed directories. And that these actually contain the libraries you'd expect there. Type\n> \n> echo \"$RAYPATH\"\n> \n> and then find whether at least rayinit.cal is in one of the returned directories.\n\n\nThe folder which the echo hands back is existing, and filled with stuff, amongst the rayinit.cal. \n\n\n> About x11meta, I am not sure how well it works in general. There seam to be several pitfalls with the meta-utilities.\n\n\nAh, i see. If there are known pitfalls i give the metautilites a break for now. \n\n\nI would love to use falsecolor with the helvet.fnt though, any idea on that one?\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot,\nAksel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-September/008886.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aksel Gro\u00df", "created_at": "September 18, 2012 at 06:09AM", "created_by": "Aksel_Gro\u00df", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008884", "id": "radiance-general_008886"}
