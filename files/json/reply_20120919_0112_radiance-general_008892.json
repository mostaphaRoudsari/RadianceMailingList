{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nI found the problem with my paths. It was my error, i reentered all paths as stated on the site. Works now like a charm!\n\n\nThe problem though came because i first installed the version from NREL http://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\nThere it says:\n\"On MacOS or Linux, add these lines to your .profile or .bashrc \u2014assuming you are using the bash shell (this is most commonly the default)\u2014 files, respectively:\n\n\nPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH\nExport PATH RAYPATH\"\n\n\nThose where the paths i entered before, and those didn't do it. Most likely because appending to a non-existing RAYPATH won't do a thing?\n\n\nAksel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-September/008892.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aksel Gro\u00df", "created_at": "September 19, 2012 at 01:12AM", "created_by": "Aksel_Gro\u00df", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008884", "id": "radiance-general_008892"}
