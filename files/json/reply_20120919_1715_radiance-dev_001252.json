{"body": "Andy and Greg did some tests and confirmed this bug has been fixed.\n\n\nThe oddity I found with the test described below is not related to the\nbug.  The oddity is simply due to spreading of the distribution during\nsampling. This is to be expected with the Klems representation.  The\nlesson I've learned from this is that you are better off rebuilding\nthe geometry from scratch rather than using a BSDF with-in a run of\ngenBSDF. The lack of granularity in the Klems BSDF causes increasing\nnoise when you iterate through successive Klems BSDF representations.\n\n\nGood night and good luck.\nTim\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Sep 19, 2012 at 12:05 PM, Tim Perry <tim.v2.0 at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001252.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Perry", "created_at": "September 19, 2012 at 05:15PM", "created_by": "Tim_Perry", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001251", "id": "radiance-dev_001252"}
