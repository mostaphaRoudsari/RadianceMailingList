{"body": "Hi Katrin,\n\n\n> Thanks a lot for your great response and sorry for the late answer.

There are \nalways some bugs that get fixed, and new functionality that gets added.\n\n\nIf you intend to use rtcontrib, you might even want to consider living \nat the cutting edge with the nightly HEAD releases. I've never had \nproblems with instability etc.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001253.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "September 19, 2012 at 11:46PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001248", "id": "radiance-dev_001253"}
