Chris Humann, if you're listening,\nI also now have universal libtiff.a and zlib.a libraries so I will be able\nto offer you a universal installer that'll run on OS X 10.5.\n\n\nSorry for all the incompatibilities and inconsistencies, I'm still\nlearning, here. Hopefully, the NREL offerings will only improve over time,\nboth in quality and frequency.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-September/001254.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 20, 2012 at 09:20AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001248", "id": "radiance-dev_001254"}
