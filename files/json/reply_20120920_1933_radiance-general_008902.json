{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\t\tI use an Ocean Optics USB 2000+ spectrometer. It incredibly samples\nevery 1/3 of a nanometer. I particularly appreciate the SpectraSuite\nsoftware needed to drive it. Very useful to determine CCT etc. You can use\nMGF tools to convert its text data into a Radiance format. I also\npurchased a reference lamp module to keep it calibrated. Used it today in\nfact, to sample a 97+ CRI LED.\n\n\nHere are a few lines from a lamp file..\n.\n.\n419.34\t1.51324047E-6\n419.71\t1.52070443E-6\n420.08\t1.58661166E-6\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nRob Shakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 9/20/12 7:10 PM, \"Randolph Fritz\" <rfritz at lbl.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-September/008902.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Robert A.
