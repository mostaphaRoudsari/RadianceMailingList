{"body": "Hi Leyla,\n\n\nAssuming this function describes the fall-off as a function of eccentricity (distance from image center), and the edge of the image is the edge of your circle corresponding to x==1 in your formula, you could try:\n\n\n\tpcomb -e 'sq(x):x*x;r=sqrt(sq(2/xres*x-1)+sq(2/yres*y-1))' \\\n\t\t-e 'sf=-1.28E-12*r^4 + 3.43E-09*r^3 - 3.38E-06*r^2 +1.45E-03*r + 7.70E-01'  \\\n\t\t-e 'ro=sf*ri(1);go=sf*gi(1);bo=sf*bi(1)' input.hdr > corrected.hdr\n\n\nI think I must be misunderstanding your function, though, because it plots as a (nearly) straight line that increases from 0.7700 at x==0 to 0.7714 at x==1.  This doesn't seem a likely vignetting correction, as it should go down rather than up, and by a more significant amount.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-September/000438.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 22, 2012 at 08:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000437", "id": "hdri_000438"}
