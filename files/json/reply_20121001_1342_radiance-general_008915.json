{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI'm not sure I understand your question, but normally, genBSDF sets all the rcontrib options for you.  The current defaults are \"-ab 5 -ad 700 -lw 3e-6\".  If you have specific ray sampling options you want to use in addition or as overrides, you can use the genBSDF -r option, e.g.:\n\n\n\tgenBSDF -r \"other rendering options\" ...\n\n\nBe sure to use quotes, so genBSDF gets it as one argument.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008915.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 01, 2012 at 01:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008914", "id": "radiance-general_008915"}
