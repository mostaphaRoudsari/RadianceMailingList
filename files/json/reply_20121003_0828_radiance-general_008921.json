{"body": "Hi Amalie,\n\n\nDeviations from point to point are to be expected. Radiance uses stochastic sampling, which will result in different \"answers\" from one run to the next. Further, I assume you are using a CIE standard overcast sky for your DF calculations? THat is not \"symmetrical\" either. That sky increases in radiance as you increase the altitude from the horizon to the zenith. It might help to have more details about your model and your results to help diagnose this.\n\n\nRegarding your UDI question, using the latest version of OpenStudio (v0.9.0), you could perform a DGP-based UDI analysis like you are trying to do. OpenStudio now reports out DA, cDA, and UDI for each space's illuminance map to a .csv file. There is also a glare sensor object now that reports DGP(simplified). You could write a Ruby script that takes the UDI and DGP values and for each timestep makes an evaluation about the UDI, using the DGP value as the trigger for the high end of UDI, instead of 2000 lux.\n\n\nThe glare sensor also can have one or multiple \"glare views\", as well; the max, min and mean are always reported in the .csv file, allowing you to evaluate DGP for a range of views, a la Jacubiec and Reinhart's \"adaptive zone\" idea.  Let me know if you want help writing a script that does what you want. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008921.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 03, 2012 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008919", "id": "radiance-general_008921"}
