{"body": "Hi Amalie,\n\n\nIncreasing the number of samples should get you closer to the symmetry you\nexpect. The best way to do this is by increasing -ad.  You should also try\nreducing ambient interpolation by increasing -ar and/or decreasing -aa.\n\n\nIt is common for beginner (and intermediate, and expert) users to focus on\nthe -ab parameter, but I find adjusting other ambient parameters is\ntypically more effective.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 3, 2012 at 8:28 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008922.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 03, 2012 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008919", "id": "radiance-general_008922"}
