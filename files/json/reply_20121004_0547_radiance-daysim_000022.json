{"body": "Bayanda,\n\n\nThe IES Daylight Metrics Committee has a document currently before the IESNA Board of Directors that provides some recommendations for Spatial Daylight Autonomy, which is essentially identical to the metric you have listed.  It uses 300 lux and is based on research studies by Lisa Heschong of The Heschong Mahone Group.  The two levels of coverage recommended are 55% coverage for acceptable and 75% coverage for a preferred level, with the time interval for the DA analysis fixed at 8AM - 6PM for all buildings.  Lisa may be able to provide you with the proposed document.\n\n\nRick Mistrick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2012-October/000022.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Mistrick", "created_at": "October 04, 2012 at 05:47AM", "created_by": "Richard_Mistrick", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000021", "id": "radiance-daysim_000022"}
