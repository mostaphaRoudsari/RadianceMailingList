{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nThanks for reposting this to the dedicated OpenStudio-Radiance list. Yep, looks like you found a couple more path/character issues with the three-phase pat of the DaylightSim.rb script. We'll get a cross-platform solution in there for the next iteration release. Thanks for finding these and reporting them!\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/3/12 4:44 PM, \"Jia Hu\" <hujia06 at gmail.com<mailto:hujia06 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi all:\n\n\nI made a preliminary run using OpenStudio V 0.9 DaylightSim.rb in Window 7.\n\n\nThe #{outPath} in DaylightSim.rb uses forward slash which is OK for\nmost commands, but I find the following code shows incorrect syntax\nbecause of using forward slash in outPath and \"type\" (i.e.,\ncatCommand) command..\n\n\nsystem(\"#{catCommand} #{outPath}/materials/materials_vmx.rad\n#{outPath}/scene/glazing/#{space_name}_glaz_#{aziVector}.rad >\nwindow_temp.rad\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother question about the DaylightSim.rb.
