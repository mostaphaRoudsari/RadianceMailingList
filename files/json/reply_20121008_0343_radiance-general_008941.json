It \nexplains most. Especially look for the supported / unsupported \nprimitives. Than, vary the number of photon in the distribution pass \n(try up to 2,000,000 photons) and the bandwith in the photon gather \npass. Basically, pmap is not too different from using Radiance, you just \ncreate the photon maps with mkpmap first and use them instead of the \nambient calculation in rpcit / rtrace. Don't forget to manually delete \nthe photon maps, they are not overwritten by mkpmap (adding a --force / \n-f option for overwriting would be a useful add-on...).\n\n\nI showed some examples at a presentation two years ago:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2010-freiburg/PDF/PmapAppsPresentation-20100922.pdf\n\n\nThere are several presentations on the pmap around for the recent \nworkshops, all available at radiance-online.org.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008941.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
