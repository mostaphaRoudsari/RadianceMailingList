{"body": "Hi Pally,\n\n\nIt seems tat you found an original bug in findglare.  Frankly, I don't know why this hasn't caused problems before, because it is clearly an error that has been there from the beginning.  Maybe compilers and systems have gotten better at array bounds checking?  Anyway, I am attaching the corrected source file from ray/src/util/, which I'm hoping will fix the problem under Windows as well.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001256.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 10, 2012 at 02:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001255", "id": "radiance-dev_001256"}
