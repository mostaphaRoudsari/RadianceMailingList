{"body": "Hi Javed,\n\n\nWe do not calculate daylight factors currently. We believe that the DF is an antiquated metric and favor the \"dynamic\" and climate-based daylight metrics that are out there (and emerging). To add DF to the report would require an additional integration at each timestep for the overcast sky, which is required for the DF evaluation. So for now we elect to not calculate it.

Is it possible to generate/visualize Daylight Factor in Result viewer?\n\n\nGreat work!\n\n\nOn Fri, Oct 12, 2012 at 3:18 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\nHi folks,\n\n\nJust a quick note to let you know we have posted a couple of short videos\nshowing off the new Radiance \"one click\" functionality that was recently\nadded to OpenStudio (as of v0.9.0).
