{"body": "Hi Jia,\n\n\nas far as I know, Window is using a rather simple radiosity method, \nwhich makes the calculation of the BSDF quick. The method is not really \nsuitable to maintain sharp transmissive or reflective peaks, but that is \nnot a concern for most energy simulation. For daylighting however, you \nusually need the high angular resolution that the path-tracing algorithm \nof genBSDF provides.\n\n\nWriting a tool that traces through a model and derives the BSDF from the \ntransmission / reflection at varied incident directions is not that \nhard, however, that would certainly not be more efficient and useful \nthen what genBSDF does. And - the big advantage of genBSDF is its \nvariable resolution BSDF, which allows you to maintain much more detail \nin the distribution. If you wanted to write your own \"genBSDF\", \nimplementing the data reduction would probably be the most difficult step.\n\n\nBy the way, seams not to be much Openstudio-specific but more a Radiance \ntopic.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-October/000043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
