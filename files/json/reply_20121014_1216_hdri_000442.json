{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nSome years ago I also ordered such a garden ornament from the US for this purpose. Found it to be too geometrically imperfect. Not spherical enough and, resulting in wobbly environment maps. I now use a 2 inch polished ball bearing ball I got from a hardware store. \n\n\nBut, the number one method for high quality environment maps is to use the fish eye lens and stich a full sphere from multiple viewing directions. \n\n\nI have always used HDRShop for this but now they don't offer version 1.0 for free anymore :-(\n\n\nwww.hdrshop.com\n\n\nBest\nClaus\n\n\n\n\nClaus B.
