{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nSolving your problem is easy and not so easy.\n\n\nThere will be some overlap between this response and my response To your other post, but for completeness...\n\n\nThe easiest solution would be to re-map your hemispherical sky image to angular mapping that Debevec always prefers. I, myself, prefer the lat-long mapping, so I have written my own mapping .cal file. Writing such a .Cal is easy but you have to know what you are doing and there can be some debugging (trial and error) involved. \n\n\nIn order to remap you sky view to an angular mapping it would be simple and easy to use the HDRshop progam (www.hdrshop.com), but there is no longer a free 1.0 version. Versions for academia are not too expensive though. \n\n\nBest\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaus B.
