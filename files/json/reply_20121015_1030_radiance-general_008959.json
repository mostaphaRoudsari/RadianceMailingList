{"body": "Hello Claus,\n\n\nThanks for the response, both on the HDRI list and here. I've never\ngot into custom .cal files, but looks like the place to start to get\nexactly what i want.\n\n\nI quickly read through some of the HDRshop tutorials on: http://www.hdrshop.com/\n\n\nThere are many interesting and useful tools (including scripting) ....\nAnd perhaps the \"Panoramic Image Conversion\" tool is what you are\nreferring to?\n\n\n....At the conceptual level, the step i am confused with is\nidentifying the appropriate virtual object in Radiance to map my HDR\nenvironment to.\n\n\nPaul uses an inward-pointing box, as in:\n\n\n###############################################################\n# specify a large inward-pointing box to be mapped with the HDR environment\n\n\n!genbox env_glow boxenv 500 500 500 -i | xform -t -250 -18 -250\n###############################################################\n\n\nAll surfaces of the box contribute light.\n\n\nBecause i only have captured light data from the horizon up, and dont\ncare (at this stage) about the group plane, it would seem that i\nshould start with a box that encompasses a hemisphere that is\npositioned on the xy plane.\n\n\nAssuming this step is correct, i would then aim to map the non-zero\npixels in my hemispherical image to the surfaces of that box\n(effectively stretching the circle into a rectangle).\n\n\nAlternatively, i could also try to map to a hemisphere, but then there\nis the issue of what to do with the \"black\" pixels which make up the\ncorners of the HDR image.\n\n\nbest,\n\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Oct 14, 2012 at 12:23 PM, Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen\n<cbm at create.aau.dk> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008959.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "kyle konis", "created_at": "October 15, 2012 at 10:30AM", "created_by": "kyle_konis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008955", "id": "radiance-general_008959"}
