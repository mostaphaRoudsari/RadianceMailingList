{"body": "Claus, thanks for the detailed explanation.\n\n\nRE: > Your sky images naturally only cover a hemisphere. If done\ncorrectly in HDRshop your env maps when remapped to angular mapping\nwould result in everything BELOW the horizon, below the xy-plane,\nwould return black.\n\n\nI found sample sky probes with this mapping on\nhttp://projects.ict.usc.edu/graphics/skyprobes/\n\n\nWhen i initially looked at these images, i had assumed they were\nacquired using a chrome sphere (with the ground portion cropped)\nrather than a fisheye lens, due to their \"half-sphere\" appearance.\n\n\nI'll give these a try using Paul's .cal file and method. Assuming that\nworks, i will try to transform my hemispherical sky images to match\nthis angular mapping using HDRshop.\n\n\nThanks for taking a break from vacation to push this along!\n\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Oct 15, 2012 at 12:40 PM, Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen\n<cbm at create.aau.dk> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008962.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "kyle konis", "created_at": "October 15, 2012 at 01:18PM", "created_by": "kyle_konis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008955", "id": "radiance-general_008962"}
