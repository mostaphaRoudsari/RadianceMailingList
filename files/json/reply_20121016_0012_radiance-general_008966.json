{"body": "Hi,\n\n\njust one idea for those trying to reproject light probes. Hugin has support for HDR, and can derive lens parameters from stitching partially overlapping images. As any real lens differs from a perfect projection model, this may be helpful to map from photographs to a \"perfect\" fisheye projection.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008966.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
