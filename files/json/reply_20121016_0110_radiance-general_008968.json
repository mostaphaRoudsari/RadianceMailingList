{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nusually radiation data in weather files is the sum for one hour and not \nthe current irradiation for a given time-stamp.\n\n\nThat means e.g. hour no. 8 is the hour between 7:00 and 8:00, the value \nis usually the total sum in Wh between 7 and 8..\n\n\nDaysim is using the sun position of the middle of the time step, in \nthat case would be 7:30.\n\n\nBe careful about sunset and sunrise!\n\n\nIn case the sunrise would be at 7:40 you run into trouble regarding sun \nposition, in that case you might use the middle between sunrise and next \ntime step (in that case 7:50). This is also implemented into Daysim.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nAm 16.10.2012 09:26, schrieb Lars O.
