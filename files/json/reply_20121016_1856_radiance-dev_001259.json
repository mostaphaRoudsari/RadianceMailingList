{"body": "Hi Tim,\n\n\nI cannot test this right now, however I do know that it is possible for \ngendaylit to fail in select conditions. If I recall correctly, one is if \nthe direct normal radiance is zero (not the case here). There are other \ncases where it fails more dramatically, which is what you are facing I \nbelieve. In this case I think that the thing to do is re-use a previous \nvalue from the data set (eg the previous hour).\n\n\nUnfortunately, what you really need to do is actually \"test\" if \ngendaylit is going to produce valid output prior to actually getting the \noutput. This can be done by evaluating the result of:\n\n\n    gendaylit $myArgs > /dev/null  2>&1\n\n\n    which in your case would be\n\n\n    gendaylit 7 19 14.500 -W 924 65 -a 34.3 -o 116.17 -m 120 > /dev/null\n    2>&1\n\n\nAssuming your are processing a complete weather file then you need to \ntest every time step that is not definitively at night, so that you can \ncatch any time steps that case an error for gendaylit and then do \nsomething in those places.\n\n\nAxel Jacobs goes into this in some more detail in his most excellent \ntutorial on rtcontrib:\n\n\n    http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001259.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 16, 2012 at 06:56PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001258", "id": "radiance-dev_001259"}
