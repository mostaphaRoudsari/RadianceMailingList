{"body": "A couple of quick things to try:\n\n\n\n\n 1.  Download the latest version of the Radiance installer (I can tell you're using an older version because you don't have the documentation installed)\n 2.  For your PATH, you should add '$PATH' and '.' to that entry. The former makes sure to add any predefined PATH elements to your additions, the latter includes the current working directory in your path.\n\n\nTry those, and then let me know if you still have problems. If you do, can you post details about the specific errors you're seeing?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nRob\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/13/12 3:15 PM, \"KXZ7007 ......\" <kx7007 at yahoo.com<mailto:kx7007 at yahoo.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi all\nI did try to run radiance in openstudio 9.
