{"body": "Thank you, everyone, for the information. It sounds like gendaylit\njust can't handle some of the sky params and I need to enhance my\nscripts a bit. I imagine I'll be following Rob's lead. Or perhaps I'll\njust use his scripts.\n\n\nIn that short run, what if I just adjust the diffuse value up from 65\nto 65.07. Then I get a valid sky. The change is only 0.1%. Should I\nreduce the direct to compensate? Or just not worry about it?\n\n\nThanks,\nTim\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 17, 2012 at 7:41 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert\n<Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001262.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Perry", "created_at": "October 17, 2012 at 11:18AM", "created_by": "Tim_Perry", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001258", "id": "radiance-dev_001262"}
