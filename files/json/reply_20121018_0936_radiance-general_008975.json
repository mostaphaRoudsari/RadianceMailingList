Radiance is running on my machine: I checked my scene before and had no issue with using oconv on my scenes and then using rvu to check out the octree. But once I set set up my .rif file and run \"rad summer.rif\" I get the following error:\n\n\noconv mod3.rad summer_sky.rad > summer.oct\noconv: system - cannot open scene file \"mod3.rad\": No such file or directory\nrad: error generating octree\nsummer.oct removed\n\n\nIf I change the filename in my .rif for mod3.rad I get a different error (\"no such file\") so it should be pointing to the right file. Any suggestions? I'm running radiance on a Windows7 machine. I'm pretty sure I downloaded the files from NREL's openstudio site. Any suggestions? I've attached my files - they're pretty simple.\n\n\nThanks,\nAlex Krickx\n\n\n\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nI N T E G R A L\n\n\n                          GROUP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247\n\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>\nwww.integralgroup.com<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n\n\n_______________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008975.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 18, 2012 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008974", "id": "radiance-general_008975"}
