{"body": "You can try Rob's suggestion, but I checked the code, and there is no search going on by oconv for input files.  Therefore, I suspect something is wrong with your file permissions.  If you can \"cat\" the file using \"cat mod3.rad\" in the same directory, then try running oconv by hand to see if that works -- just copy and paste what rad produces before the error.\n\n\nThis won't solve your problem, but it may help to figure out what's going wrong.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008977.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 18, 2012 at 09:51AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008974", "id": "radiance-general_008977"}
