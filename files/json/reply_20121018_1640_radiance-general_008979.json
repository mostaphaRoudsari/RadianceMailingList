{"body": "Thanks to Greg and Rob,\n\n\nTurns out it was a Windows OS issue (surprise surprise). Just to share what\nI learned with the list - Windows can have certain permissions issues that\nprevent Radiance from running correctly. We also found a weird Registry\nvalue (yikes!) that was the main culprit.\n\n\nAdding a \".\" to my path also may have solved my problem - in any case I'm\nkeeping it in there for good measure. Now to do some scene rendering...\n\n\nCheers,\nAlex Krickx\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n*Alex Krickx, LEED AP*\nProject Engineer**\n\n\n*________________________________*****\n\n\nI N T E G R A L****\n\n\n*                         ** **GROUP*****\n\n\n** **\n\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247****\n\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com\nwww.integralgroup.com****\n\n\n** **\n\n\n*DEEP GREEN Engineering.*\n\n\n*_______________________________*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008979.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alex Krickx", "created_at": "October 18, 2012 at 04:40PM", "created_by": "Alex_Krickx", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008974", "id": "radiance-general_008979"}
