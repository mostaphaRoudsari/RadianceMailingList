{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nThis has been discussed before in an earlier thread -- some months ago, I guess.  You don't get a speed-up from parallel processing if you fail to set the -af option to share indirect values.  This is because you force each process to recompute the same values redundantly.  Add a -af option and see what happens.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008982.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 19, 2012 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008981", "id": "radiance-general_008982"}
