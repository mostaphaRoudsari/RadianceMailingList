{"body": "Thank you very much, Greg!\n\n\nFollowing your advice, the simulation time is reduced from 9 min to just 3\nmin !\n\n\nThe bash script is:\ncat ./sensor.txt | rtrace -I -h -w -oov -u- -aa 0.1 -ab 6 -ad 1024 -ar 256\n-as 512 -af ./ambient_file.amb -n 8 ./Octree_files_.oct > ./Results.txt\n(I'm very eager to test it on our HPC later ! )\n\n\nI think this can be one of the FAQs of Radiance.\n\n\nThank you again! And have a nice weekend!\n\n\n-Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008983.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "October 19, 2012 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008981", "id": "radiance-general_008983"}
