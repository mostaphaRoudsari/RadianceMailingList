{"body": "Hi Denny,\n\n\nYeah there really isn't any documentation on the NREL site on how to actually use the CMake build system in the Radiance source tree, yet. Pally at IESve wrote up a great summary of her experience using CMake and posted it here a couple/few months ago. \n\n\nSounds like you have CMake on your system. The quick bullet list of steps I do is as follows:\n\n\n1. create build directory in ray/\n2. cd ray/build\n3. cmake ..\n4. ccmake .\n4a. In the ccmake \"gui\", type 'c' to configure, fix any errors found\n4b. Type 'g' to generate themakefiles; ccmake will then exit\n5. make\nif all goes well, then:\n6. sudo make install\n\n\nLemme know if that helps. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001267.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 23, 2012 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001266", "id": "radiance-dev_001267"}
