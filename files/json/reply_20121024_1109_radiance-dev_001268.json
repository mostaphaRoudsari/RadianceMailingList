{"body": "Hey Robert,\nthank you for your reply. It actually did help a bit.\n\n\nI still found several issues when compiling/installing, I couldn't get solved \nyet.\n\n\n1. Install Paths\nI can't use an interactive build process, so the ccmake option does not work \nin this case.\nInstead, I tried to pass parameters to the cmake call to adjust install \ndirectories etc.\ne.g.\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"/usr/\"\n\n\nThe result is: with make install, everything ends up under \"/usr/\" (instead of \n/usr/local/), even man, lib etc. and not where it should be. I tried passing \nthose with parameters as well, but they've got ignored by cmake.\n\n\n2. radiance_support\nwhen running make, it tries to download the rad4R1supp package. I'd prefer to \njust provide the already downloaded archive, which does not seemed to be well \nsupported by the cmake/make system.\nHowever, I placed the archive under the manually created directory \nbuild/Downloads/Download/radiance_support/ .\n\n\nThe problem here seems to be, that the make script seems to accept it (no \ndownload), but nothing from that gets actually build/installed.\n\n\nIf all goes well, I should get some rpm's with the open-build-service in the \nend. You can follow the progress on\n\n\nhttps://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=radiance&project=home%3Alumnis\n\n\nHowever, there are quite a few things left to get there.\n\n\nThe cmake setup needs some improvements, at the moment a number of \"hacks\" are \nneeded to get the current state, which could be fixed in the cmake setup, \nmainly the path/install issues.\n\n\nAny comments/help would be appreciated.\n\n\nDenny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm Dienstag, 23.
