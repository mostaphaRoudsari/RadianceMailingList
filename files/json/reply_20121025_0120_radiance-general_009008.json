{"body": "Hi Ji!\n\n\nThe functions S(n) and T(n) are available in pcomb. To make an image \"solid_angles.hdr\" with pixel values (r=g=b) being equal to the solid angle of the pixel in sr, you would do the following:\n\n\ncat image.hdr |  pcomb -e 'omega=S(1); ro=omega; go=omega; bo=omega' -o - > solid_angles.hdr\n\n\nSo S(n) gives, for each pixel of the n'th input image, its solid angle. To take a look, use falsecolor -m 1 -s .000008 -ip solidangle.hdr | ximage - good way to think about projections...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/009008.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
