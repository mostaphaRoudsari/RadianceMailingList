{"body": "Dear all,\nI'm still not sure, whether the build process does what it supposed to do.\n\n\nWhat exactly is the difference in when enabling \"BUILD_SHARED_LIBS\" for the \nbuild process. I tried the two options with different (problematic) results:\n\n\n[1] When using the normal call\n/>cmake ..\nIt seems, that all binaries/programs got build and installed to \n/usr/local/bin/\nFollowing issues:\n[1-i1] Some librarie-files also end up under bin/, where they shouldn't be, eg. \n- plugins/imageformats/libqgif.so\", libqico.so, etc.\n- libradiance.a and other *.a files\n- objview.rb\n- qt.conf\netc. \n[1-i2] there is an error about the \"/usr/local/bin/wish4.0\" . I know wish is \nused for tk, but why is in radiance. Shouldn't be tk rather be installed on \nthe system, that shipping tk with radiance?\n\n\n[2] When I used\n/>cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=\"ON\" ..\n\n\nfollowing issues are generated:\n[2-i1] almost no progams are build due to linking errors as follows:\nLinking C executable ../../bin/rcalc\n../common/librtrad.so: undefined reference to `progrname`\n../common/librtrad.so: undefined reference to `vv`\n:\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\n\nThis output you find for almost all modules/pograms, the only one that got \nbuild seems cnt.\n\n\n\n\nPlease advise.\n\n\nDenny\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm Dienstag, 23.
