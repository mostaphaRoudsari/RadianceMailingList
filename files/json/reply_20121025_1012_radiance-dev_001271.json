{"body": "Hi Denny,\n\n\nI want to know more about why you're using cmake.  The cmake build system\nwas added by NREL as part of their quest to provide windows installers.  If\nyou're using cmake because you want to try it out and work out all the\nkinks, then carry on.\n\n\nIf your goal is to install a working HEAD version of Radiance on a linux\nos, then you are probably better served using the makeall script. The\nmakeall script is the most reliable build option for unix type operating\nsystems (since that is what the Greg uses).  Also, makeall.sh is updated by\nGreg when he adds new programs - cmake updates take longer because NREL\nneeds to do them, and pass them back to Greg.  Someday cmake might be the\npreferred build platform for Radiance, but for now if you're using Linux,\nyou're better off with makeall.sh.  You can follow these instructions\n(written for compiling on mac). Ignore the first step - installing xcode.\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1#Compiling\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001271.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 25, 2012 at 10:12AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001266", "id": "radiance-dev_001271"}
