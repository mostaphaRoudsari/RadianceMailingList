{"body": "I totally agree with Andy, the makeall script is still drop-dead simple for Mac and Linux users. That said, the CMake system adds functionality, mainly the Windows bit, but I see others (Denny included) are trying to use it to generate RPMs and other things. I think this is FANTASTIC, and I want to encourage this use of the system. Thanks for trying it out, and thank for reporting your issues and fixes. I will try my best to get these implemented in a widely compatible way, but it may have to wait until I get my support contract with Kitware renewed. =8-)\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/25/12 11:12 AM, \"Andrew McNeil\" <amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:amcneil at lbl.gov>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Denny,\n\n\nI want to know more about why you're using cmake.  The cmake build system was added by NREL as part of their quest to provide windows installers.  If you're using cmake because you want to try it out and work out all the kinks, then carry on.\n\n\nIf your goal is to install a working HEAD version of Radiance on a linux os, then you are probably better served using the makeall script. The makeall script is the most reliable build option for unix type operating systems (since that is what the Greg uses).  Also, makeall.sh is updated by Greg when he adds new programs - cmake updates take longer because NREL needs to do them, and pass them back to Greg.  Someday cmake might be the preferred build platform for Radiance, but for now if you're using Linux, you're better off with makeall.sh.  You can follow these instructions (written for compiling on mac). Ignore the first step - installing xcode.\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1#Compiling\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 25, 2012 at 8:44 AM, Denny <lumnis at googlemail.com<mailto:lumnis at googlemail.com>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\nwhen compiling with static libraries, I get a dependency error when the program gets packaged for rpm:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile:\n\n\nsrc/util/trad.wsh:\n\n\ncontains\n\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/wish4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand therefor a dependency is automatically generated for it, which is not allowed/possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (if wish is still needed):\n\n\nReplace the line with\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/wish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich will create a dependency a tk package meets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm Dienstag, 23.
