{"body": "Hi Andy,\nI seen the video before. That is a great demo. However, it's also confusing to \nhave several options to build available not knowing it which state they are.\n\n\nWhy I gave cmake a go is quite simple:\nIn order to create rpm's automatically on a build system, you need to have an \nnon-interactive build process.\nThe interactive makeall script doesn't help here as it requires user \ninteraction. It would require patching to disable it, what you need to rework \neverytime things changed in the script.\n\n\nWould there be a config file or similar together with a non-interactive mode, I \ncould use that. As it is now, it's quite hard to work around it. I was hoping \ncmake/scons would help here - as it wasn't my first attempt to package \nradiance.\n\n\nDenny\n\n\n\n\nAm Donnerstag, 25.

The cmake build system was \nadded by NREL as part of their quest to provide windows installers.  If you're \nusing cmake because you want to try it out and work out all the kinks, then \ncarry on.   \n\n\n\n\nIf your goal is to install a working HEAD version of Radiance on a linux os, \nthen you are probably better served using the makeall script. The makeall \nscript is the most reliable build option for unix type operating systems \n(since that is what the Greg uses).  Also, makeall.sh is updated by Greg when \nhe adds new programs - cmake updates take longer because NREL needs to do \nthem, and pass them back to Greg.  Someday cmake might be the preferred build \nplatform for Radiance, but for now if you're using Linux, you're better off \nwith makeall.sh.  You can follow these instructions (written for compiling on \nmac). Ignore the first step - installing xcode. \nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-\nosx-1#Compiling\n\n\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001273.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Denny Beyer", "created_at": "October 25, 2012 at 01:03PM", "created_by": "Denny_Beyer", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001266", "id": "radiance-dev_001273"}
