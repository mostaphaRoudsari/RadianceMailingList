{"body": "The current cmake build files don't work on my Mac because I have \nmultiple versions of the X11 include and library files on the system.  \nCmake unpredictably picks files from different versions and fails to \nbuild Radiance.  On a machine with a clean install and nothing extra, \nthe cmake build files will probably work.  On a machine with the wrong \nhistory they produce unpredictable results.\n\n\nI have no idea what behaviors the cmake build files will produce across \na broad range of other Unix systems.  :-(\n\n\nI do have an attempt at a solution to the \"random X11 pieces on Mac\" \nproblem, but it is not complete and not thorougly tested.  I never got \nthe libtiff part going on my system.  Rob, if you'd like the X11 \npatches for your distribution, you can have them, but they will have to \nbe tested.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001280.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
