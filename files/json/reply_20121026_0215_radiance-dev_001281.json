{"body": "Randolph, \nthanks for pointing Bernds work out. I've seen the debian/ubuntu packaging and \ncontacted Bernd before I posted to the dev list.\nSo far, I didn't get a reply from Bernd. However, Bernd had to do quite a few \nworkarounds with the makeall install procedure and because that has been quite \nsome time ago, I thought I give the new cmake a chance, as that looked more \npromising.\n\n\nRegarding the cmake scripts - trying them for some time now, I had the same \nimpression. \n\n\nDenny\n\n\nAm Donnerstag, 25.
