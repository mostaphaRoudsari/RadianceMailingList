{"body": "Hi Martin (your English is just fine),\n\n\n1. I'm fairly certain we have some German/Austrian OpenStudio users...\n2. Ruby 1.8.7 works just fine with OpenStudio -- in fact, yours is the same setup as I have (OSX10.8 + Ruby 1.8.7) \n3. The install doc you are working off of is outdated (see #4).\n4. The Perl install directive is only for people running OpenStudio on Windows; OSX and Linux users most likely already have Perl installed (as well as Ruby). \n\n\nWhat version of OpenStudio are you trying to install? I highly recommend installing the latest iteration version, which is 0.9.3. That installer can be downloaded from the Developers tab on the OpenStudio website:\n\n\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov/developers\n\n\nDirect link to Mac installer:\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov/accept/file/1162\n\n\nOnce you have that version installed, let us know how you make out. If you still have problems, please post some specifics about the nature of the problem. \n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-October/000050.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 30, 2012 at 08:07AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000050"}
