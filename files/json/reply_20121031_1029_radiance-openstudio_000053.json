{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nthank you very much for your instructions. I just did the complete installation (EnergyPlus 7.1, Sketchup 8, Radiance 4.2.a and Openstudio 0.9.3).\n\n\nI then followed very closely your tutorial about OpenStudio New Features - Radiance Integration. But the run failed (see https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/Pic2.png).\n\n\nJust in case, I have uploaded also my example file (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/office2.zip).\n\n\nIn Sketchup, when closing the preference window there is a warning about the path to EnergyPlus(https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/Pic1.png). But the tools seem to be recognized (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/Pic3.png).\n\n\nAny idea what is going wrong?\n\n\nThanks and best regards\n\n\nMartin Klingler\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOriginal Message\n\n\nprocessed by CONSOLIDATE\n\n\nSubject:\n\n\nRE: [Radiance-openstudio] OpenStudio on OSX 10.8\n\n\nSent:\n\n\nDienstag, 30.
