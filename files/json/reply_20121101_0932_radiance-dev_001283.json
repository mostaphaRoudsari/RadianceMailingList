{"body": "Hi Pally,\n\n\nI don't know who or what is setting your rendering parameters, but they are not something I would recommend.  The \"rad\" program is a good way to get sane rendering options if you don't like the defaults.  Setting -dt .25 -dc .35 is causing the strange contours around your light sources as well as numerous other inaccuracies.  You are telling Radiance that you are fine with 25% error in the direct calculation, meaning everything else is worse.\n\n\nThe ghosts you are seeing are due most likely to a glazing surface that extends over your wall surface(s).  I can't tell you for sure because the zip file you uploaded doesn't contain a complete model -- there are many referenced files that are missing.\n\n\nWhat system are you using to assemble all this?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-November/001283.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 01, 2012 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001282", "id": "radiance-dev_001283"}
