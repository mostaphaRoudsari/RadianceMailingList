{"body": "Dear Shailan,\n\n\nit will be difficult to help you with this:\n\n\n1) We do not really know the problem. What means different results - are \nwe talking about 1000%, 10%, 0.1%?\n\n\n2) We do not know the scene (model) and simulation paramaters. Do you \nuse a mirror (secondary light source), is direct sun considered, are you \nmodeling the sun (if it is existing in the model) by a small light \nsource or as contribution to Tregenza patches...? You attached some \n.eco-files, which probably can be opened in Ecotec, but as a Radiance \nuser I cannot even open those.\n\n\nSo my advice: Give a really clear description of the problem, and \nprovide us with information to reproduce it. E.g. a Radiance scene \ndescription together with the parameters you are using.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009018.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
