{"body": "Hi Shailan,\n\n\nyou did not make the model available, so this is all guess-work. By the \nway, as Greg mentioned, we do not attach files on this email list, \ninstead use some web- or ftp-space and embed a link into your mail, please.\n\n\nWhat you had sent were the parameters used processing the model using \nRadiance tools (collected in rif-files for rad, the control program for \nscene processing). The only interesting difference I found in there was \nthe scene extent. While I cannot find out whether my assumption is true \nor not, as I do not have access to the model, a different scene extent \n(geometry) could point us to a difference in the model geometry. I have \nno idea how the two rif-files were created, but if the software doing so \ndid a good job, then one model starts at x=1 while the other starts at \nx=2. Not exactly identical models.\n\n\nMaybe you find a way to put your model onto a ftp or website so that \nothers can have a look at it. Aside, you could use objline or objview or \nany kind of scene previewer, rotate a bit, and check that there are no \nobstructions in front of one model's facade or any unwanted differences. \nYou can also use getbbox on both radfiles - the bounding box for two \nidentical geometries should be the same...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009021.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
