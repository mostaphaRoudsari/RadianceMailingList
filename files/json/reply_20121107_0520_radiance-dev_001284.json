{"body": "Hi Greg, hi list,\n\n\na short follow-up on the NOMMAP-issue I had in April.\n\n\nWhen re-compiling a HEAD version currently I forgot to add the NOMMAP\ncompile flag. Again, I ended up with the same error that I had in April,\nbut not always...\nTo cut a long story short, I could trace back the problem to something that\nprobably has nothing to do with RADIANCE and 32 or 64 bit. I'm running\nRADIANCE on Ubuntu in a VirtualBox on a Win7 host system. Whenever the\nXML-file to load is in a shared folder (via a VirtualBox guest addition)\nand physically stored on the network directory, the error occurs. However,\ncopying the same file to a local directory in Ubuntu and using this one\neverything works fine.\n\n\nI have no idea why this EZXML MMAP doesn't work on shared folders or if\nthis has something to do with the formatting (NTFS vs. EXT4)??\n\n\nAnyway, as a work-around specifying the NOMMAP compile flag or just working\non the local disk works...\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n2012/4/26 Gregory J.
