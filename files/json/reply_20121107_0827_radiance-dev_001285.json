{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nThat's an interesting find -- excellent sleuth work!  It makes sense that a networked drive working through a Win7 virtual machine layer might run into troubles.  I'm not sure what Unix does when mapping network drives in general, so it doesn't surprise me that having a Windows layer in there would mess things up.\n\n\nPoking around with google leads me to articles saying that memory-mapping of networked files should be OK, even under Windows.  So, it may be a problem with the implementation of VirtualBox.  I didn't look for that issue, specifically.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-November/001285.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 07, 2012 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001202", "id": "radiance-dev_001285"}
