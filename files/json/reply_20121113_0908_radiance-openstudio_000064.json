{"body": "OK, that's a good thing. How many spaces and illuminance maps do you have\nin the model? Currently the program computes each map serially, i.e. one\nat a time, so you'll have to wait for it to finish all the maps before\nit's fully done. After that, it will do a dimming analysis and create a\nlighting load schedule for EnergyPlus, which is then automatically run as\nwell. It can take some time on a large model with lots of spaces. But it\ndoes sound like things are working for you. When it's all done you should\nsee a \"finished\" message and hopefully zero errors (there are usually\nwarnings even on successful runs), and then you can open the eplusout.sql\nfile in ResultsViewer to review the daylighting.\n\n\nKeep us posted!\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nP.S. We are rewriting the daylighting script to compute all the points in\nthe model at one time, rather than space-by-space; this speeds up the\ncalculation times on large models significantly, and should be available\nin the next iteration release which is due out early next week.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/13/12 9:55 AM, \"Khalid\" <khalid.ud at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 13, 2012 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000064"}
