{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nThere are no silly questions. OpenStudio is an evolving piece of beta-stage software, and both the code and the documentation are not always obvious (or functional!).\n\n\nYou are right, the DaylightSim.rb script is doing most of the work, and yes, it is still available to command prompt-savvy people. At the moment, we are re-writing that script to calculate all the model's simulation points at once, rather than one space at a time. This is now working for the \"single phase\" method that the app uses, but not 100% for the three phase method, which is what you want. I hope to have that all working by the end of this week, which means it should make its way into the next iteration release (0.9.5) which will come out next week. So stay tuned!\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/12 10:24 AM, \"Martin Klingler\" <martin.klingler at gmx.at<mailto:martin.klingler at gmx.at>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHi list,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaybe this is a silli question, but I did not find an answer for myself:\n\n\nIs the radiance functionality based on the ruby script DaylightSim.rb (as described in \"OpenStudio\u00b4s Radiance Functionality - Documentation\" dated 08/07/2012) still available in 0.9.4? I mean available at the command line?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf yes, could anybody point me in the right direction? I would like to change the bsdf-data for the windows and run a further simulation. Is this possible from within OpenStudio?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much for any hint.\n\n\nMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000073.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 14, 2012 at 09:59AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000072", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000073"}
