{"body": "Hi Khalid,\n\n\nThanks for all this extra detail!  OK, first of all, editing the weather\nfile to do shorter run periods is not recommended. As you saw, this has no\neffect on the Radiance piece (this is because OpenStudio pulls the weather\ninfo from an EnergyPlus pre-process run, which is for an annual\nrunperiod). Support for shorter runperiods is being put into the app\ncurrently, but I'm not sure when that will be released. Editing the\nweather file like you did also caused the \"..... Last severe\nerror=ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Compact=\"THERMAL ZONE 1 LIGHTS\nSCHEDULE\" has missing days in its schedule pointers\" error.\n\n\nThe illuminance map data is goofy; are you looking at data from\nradout.sql, or eplusout.sql?\n\n\nIt appears that your simulation is running OK; on a slower system (and\nespecially on Windows) a two hour run time for an annual sim is not\nunusual. I'd try re-running the sim with the full weather file, let it run\nits course, and re-review the data. You can also send me your model and\nweather file and I can make sure everything looks good.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/13/12 9:32 PM, \"Khalid\" <khalid.ud at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000074.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 14, 2012 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000074"}
