{"body": "Thanks Khalid,\n\n\nThe results that you have shared seem ok, I'll run your model here later\ntonight to confirm. As far as ground reflectance, the default is 20% (this\nis applied for any rays intersecting the sphere below the horizon).\n\n\nHowever, good modeling practice dictates that you model local ground\nfeatures and obstructions, so that local shadow effects are captured. You\ncan do this in OpenStudio using \"site shading surfaces\". You first create\na site shading surface group, then draw your local ground planes inside of\nthat group. You can change the reflectance of those objects by adding\nmaterials to the library that are of the reflectance you want, and\nassigning them to the objects' constructions.\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/12 7:58 AM, \"Khalid\" <khalid.ud at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000076.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 14, 2012 at 03:12PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000076"}
