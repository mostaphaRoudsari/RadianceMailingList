{"body": "Hi Khalid,\n\n\nWell one thing's for sure, we need to speed up our code on Windows\nmachines! I just ran your model and did the full annual simulation in 8\nminutes. I have a grad student here at NREL using OpenStudio for a\ngreenhouse project and his OpenStudio model takes 2 hours to run on his\nsystem, and that one ran in 10 minutes on my laptop. I suspect that all\nthe multithreading work that Greg has implemented is super awesome, and\nthat's why Linux and MacOS machines are running all the Radiance stuff a\nlot faster than on Windows. We implemented multithreading on Windows using\nthe Ruby Threads class, but we either implemented that badly or it simply\ndoesn't work as well as the stuff that's built into Radiance (that does\nnot work on Windows).\n\n\nI digress, but I thank you for exposing these things. Anyway, the data all\nseems to make sense to me, are you familiar with the ResultsViewer\napplication for viewing your results? I know you posted some screen shots,\nbut are you able to zoom in on time periods and make plots? Let me know!\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/12 8:22 AM, \"Khalid\" <khalid.ud at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000078.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 14, 2012 at 03:36PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000078"}
