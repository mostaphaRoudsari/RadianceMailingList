{"body": "Thanks Rob, for the information.\nRegarding the Daylight Factor, the following discussion was in a paper I\nread several years ago;\n\t\"the average daylight factor .. is a useful design aid which is also\nsimple to use. Since the daylight distribution and intensity inside the\nbuilding will vary with time, whichever sky distribution is used as a basis\nfor design, then it would seem that great precision in this is\nunnecessary..............  I have strong reservations over the provision of\ndetailed and complex daylight prediction system. What is required, in my\nopinion, is a relatively simple system that architects must be encouraged to\nuse and to combine this with the provision of daylight controls to adjust\nthe daylight conditions when necessary. Electronic control of the electric\nlighting \tshould then  integrate the electric lighting with the\ndaylighting for an energy-efficient design.\" (David Loe, in the discussion\nin reference (1)).\nAs an architect I believe the daylight factor is more than a metric, and I\ndo think that its use in different climatic conditions could be improved.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n1- Kittler 1994 Kittler R.
