{"body": "Hi Shailan!\n\n\n> hello, do you know what causes the my radiance analysis show illumination higher than 50 lux when I simulate a night time,although in the analysis process it is written that warning no light source found?\n\n\nDid you define any sources? The warning is just about sources of type \"light\". Do you have sources of type \"glow\" in your scene? If you have no sources, what would you analyze?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009048.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
