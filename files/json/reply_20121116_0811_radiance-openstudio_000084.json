{"body": "Hi Khalid,\n\n\nActually, if you check the \"Use Radiance...\" box in OpenStudio, then\nRadiance will be used for all the daylighting calculations. That's why\nit's important to review the \"radout.sql\" file for the daylighting data,\nwhen Radiance is used.\n\n\nThe sky condition is derived automatically from the weather file. This is\nthe beauty of what John Mardaljevec calls \"climate based daylight\nmodeling\", or CBDM. The sky condition for each timestep is based on the\nPerez all-weather sky model, which simply takes direct normal and diffuse\nhorizontal flux (irradiance or illuminance) as input. It is the ratio of\nthose two values that dictates the sky condition.\n\n\nDaylight factors are computed from overcast sky daylight availability\nonly. This misses a lot of prevalent sky conditions, and as such is a\npretty useless metric for many climates. Hence, the move to CBDM which we\nhave embraced in OpenStudio (as have Christoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec,\nand Kera Lagios with DIVA, Rick Mistrick with the new DAYSIM, et al.).\n\n\nAre we having fun yet, Khalid? =8-)\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/15/12 10:53 PM, \"Khalid\" <khalid.ud at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000084.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 16, 2012 at 08:11AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000084"}
