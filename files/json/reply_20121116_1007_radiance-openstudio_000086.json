{"body": "Hi Khalid,\n\n\nYou are right, metric was a poor choice of words regarding the DF. I also\nagree that tools should allow architects to quickly estimate the impacts\nof their designs, and that controls are crucial to any daylighting system\ndelivering a cost-effective solution. But lighting controls cannot be\nsimulated with a DF analysis because the performance of such systems is\nhighly dependent on actual daylight distributions within a space. This is\nthe main driver for us in integrating Radiance with OpenStudio (and, in\nturn, EnergyPlus). \n\n\nIt is our hope that eventually OpenStudio will make it relatively painless\nto do a much more thorough daylighting analysis than EnergyPlus is capable\nof on its own. \n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/16/12 2:42 AM, \"Khalid\" <khalid.ud at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000086.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 16, 2012 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000086"}
