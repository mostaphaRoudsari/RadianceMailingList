{"body": "It could depend on your measurement point and the rest of the model. Does raising to a higher ab value for both models increase calculation time too much? Maybe you could increase to 5 or more bounces for both models and relax other parameters but maintain reliable results. If you repeat the simulation multiple times or increase calculation parameters and get results within a reasonable margin of error, then you're probably as accurate as possible for the model inputs.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009053.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "November 19, 2012 at 06:16AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009052", "id": "radiance-general_009053"}
