{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nRadiance (the software) does indeed work in radiometric values at its core, and the 179*(blah blah blah) is a valid conversion to illuminance. If you have very saturated colors in your model, I suppose they could throw off the calculation, but I think it'd take a lot to affect the accuracy. That said, this is why I do all of my modeling in greyscale, and use the \"white\" light source color for all electric lights.\n\n\nThere are a bunch of posts in the archives about this topic, and doing a higher resolution spectral rendering, and the validity of the 179 multiplier (which is somewhat arbitrary, but as long as you use that same multiplier going in each direction, you should be good to go.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/28/12 12:26 PM, \"Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain\" <gmolina1 at uc.cl<mailto:gmolina1 at uc.cl>> wrote:\n\n\nHello Radiancers,\n\n\nI am a new Radiance user/developer, and I am working on the calculation of Solar Heat Gain through complex fenestration systems. I started learning Radiance some time ago, and just an hour ago, a pretty obvious doubt came to my mind:\n\n\nIf RADIANCE uses the RGB optical properties (that is, visible spectrum, I suppose); how comes that it calculates the Radiance instead of Illuminance? If the materials change the spectrum of the radiation in every bounce, how is it possible to just use the classic \"179*(0,265*R+0,67*G+0,065*B)\" to compute the illuminance?\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Molina\n\n\nPS: Sorry to bother with rookie questions, but I am the only person in my University using RADIANCE.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009068.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 28, 2012 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009067", "id": "radiance-general_009068"}
