{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nWhen the software is left to its own devices, it is considering beyond the visible range. You can get radiance and irradiance, and this is the default output. Radiance (the software) is often used for estimating solar resource for PV; applying V-lambda is always a second step that is available, in order to weight the radiometric values to photometric values (luminance or illuminance). I don't do much with radiometric values, but we would like to do more of that in OpenStudio. \n\n\nPerhaps some others can weigh on with their experience looking beyond visual range. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009071.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 28, 2012 at 08:54PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009067", "id": "radiance-general_009071"}
