{"body": "Dear list,\n\n\nI'd like to ask if the Radiance way to calculate sky exposure as explained\nbelow can be further optimized.\n\n\nThis method is quite accurate, but it is just not fast enough for us (0.2\nsecond per sensor).\n\n\nIt seems the Radiance programs used in this approach, such as rpict, pcomb,\npvalue, etc. are not applicable to harvest the power of parallel\nprocessing, such as what the \"-n\" option does for rtrace.\n\n\nMaybe I'm just too greedy, but is there a way to further enhance the\nefficiency of the individual Radiance command in this method?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009074.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "November 30, 2012 at 02:50AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008984", "id": "radiance-general_009074"}
