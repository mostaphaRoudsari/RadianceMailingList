{"body": "I am a big fan of Python myself, and wrote a few simple scripts for me to use with radiance. I am no programmer, so can encourage and support any designer to take a look at the Python language, it's quite fun!\n\n\nBtw, would be interested: are there professional Radiance modules for Python out there already? I once googled for them but without success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAksel Gro\u00df\naksel at gobo.io\n\n\n\n\nAm 03.12.2012 um 12:57 schrieb info info <info at pythonpoweredbuilding.com>:\n\n\n> Dear simulation community,\n> \n> The Python programming language is well known as a powerful tool in automation, scripting, and high performance scientific computing.
