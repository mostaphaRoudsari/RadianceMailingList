{"body": "Hi Aksel,\n\n\nThere is indeed interest in the Radiance community (I'm speaking as a\nvoyeur, not a Radiance expert), see i.e.;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/python-radiance\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pyrat/\nEtc.\n\n\nI would love to have a Radiance script as a demo of how flexible Python is,\nmaybe there is some smallish task that we can tackle?\n\n\nWhen I use Radiance, I see the input files, and all I can think of is; this\nshould be XML... Maybe there is interest in a 2-way parser?\n\n\nAs far as a more complete \"wrapper\" project is concerned, we would be happy\nto also support in any way.\n\n\n-Marcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "info info", "created_at": "December 03, 2012 at 06:10AM", "created_by": "info_info", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009083", "id": "radiance-general_009085"}
