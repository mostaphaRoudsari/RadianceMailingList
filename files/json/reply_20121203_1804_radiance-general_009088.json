{"body": "Hi Rob\n\n\nBased on my experience with Radiance scripting in\nPython|Ruby|Bash|Lua|whatever I'd say that it really doesn't matter much\nwhich language you use as long as your application has a good command line\ninterface:\n\n\n1) small single-purpose apps are better than one big app to rule them all\n2) process options should be exposed via command line arguments\n3) good error reporting and some form of progress reporting for long\nrunning processes\n\n\nI think the scripting community would be better served if you implement a\ngood command line interface to your binaries and Ruby scripts than by just\nanother language wrapper.\n\n\nMy 2 CI cent,\n\n\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 3, 2012 at 11:32 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "December 03, 2012 at 06:04PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009083", "id": "radiance-general_009088"}
