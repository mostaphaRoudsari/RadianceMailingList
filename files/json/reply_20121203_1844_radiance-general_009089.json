{"body": "Hey Thomas,\n\n\nI totally agree, and that's why I have tried very hard to maintain such an interface to the OpenStudio/Radiance stuff. While Application/GUI integration is a priority, all of the Radiance stuff starts out as a Ruby script prototype, and I build in command line switches to all of the functionality. As someone who learned Radiance from the command line, I totally respect the UNIX toolbox model, and feel like our tools need to play nice in that arena. If anything, I've learned that most of my stuff is to large and monolithic, and I'd like to break down or refactor a lot of what I've written to be more modular like Radiance. But as it is, everything we've implemented in Ruby has full command line functionality (and help), and I expect we'll keep that interface an option for the foreseeable future. \n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009089.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 03, 2012 at 06:44PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009083", "id": "radiance-general_009089"}
