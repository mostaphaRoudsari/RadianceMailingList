{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nFor installing I did \"sudo ./makeall install\" and \"sudo ./makeall library\".\nFor the dctimestep use I did:\n\n\n*dctimestep Matrices/V.vmx\nMatrices/Tforward.xml Matrices/D.dmx Matrices/S.skv > results/3phase.txt*\n*\n*\nI, of course, had a directory called Matrices where all my files were\nstored. The *Tforward.xml* was generating using genBSDF on a simple clear\nwindow, and the Daylight and View matrix were computed folowing the Andy\nMcNeil tutorial.\n\n\nI tend to think it is a problem in the configuration of Ubuntu? I mean, the\npermissions or something. But I do not know how to fix it.\n\n\n2012/12/4 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009092.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "December 04, 2012 at 03:36AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009090", "id": "radiance-general_009092"}
