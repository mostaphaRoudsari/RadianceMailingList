{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nYou should never get a segmentation fault in Radiance, whatever you do.  At this point, we should take the discussion off-list to work out what is going wrong with your compile and/or operation on Ubuntu.  I will send another e-mail shortly.  Do not reply to this one.\n\n\nWe will post a summary of what we find to the list when the issue is resolved.  There may be some delays as I am presently on vacation.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009102.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 04, 2012 at 10:53AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009090", "id": "radiance-general_009102"}
