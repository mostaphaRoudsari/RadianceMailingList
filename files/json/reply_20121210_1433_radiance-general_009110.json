{"body": "Hi Rob, Kevin & Radiance folks,\n\n\nthe latest 3K lux limit I found on John's site:\n\n\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=academic:climate-based-daylight-modelling\n\n\nIn this paper, the 2500lx was mentioned:\n\n\nhttp://www.thedaylightsite.com/filebank/Tools and Metrics - JM2.pdf (yes, the spaces are included in the URL)\n\n\nThe 2000lx has been used most as far as I am aware. I can understand that the upper limit is not hard (as Kevin said, it can be argued that such a limit does not make sense at all, which is still kind of an open discussion). Still I find it tricky to reference a UDI metric with all these definitions. I tend to use John's climate-based-daylighting.com as a (moving) reference, which would lead me to \"latest revision of UDI-e is >3000lx.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009110.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
