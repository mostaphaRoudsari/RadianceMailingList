I assume we can use Xcode to compile it as an executable program for the Mac system. But I don't know how to do it ...\n\n\nCurrently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal and SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2 files in Mac system with other Radiance program. It's just a little bit inconvenient...\n\n\nAdvices are greatly appreciated!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009117.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 12, 2012 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009116", "id": "radiance-general_009117"}
