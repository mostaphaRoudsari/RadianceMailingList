The command expects a specifically-formatted weather file which I do not have on hand, so I couldn't test it aside from calling the command with no input and getting the help, but that did work. The only thing to remember is to set the permissions to make it executable on your system (e.g. \"chmod 775 gencumulativesky\").\n\n\nP.S.\nChristoph also mentions gencumulativesky in his (excellent) daylighting chapter in this fairly awesome book:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Building-Performance-Simulation-Design-Operation/dp/0415474140\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/12/12 10:35 AM, \"Ji Zhang\" <hope.zh at gmail.com<mailto:hope.zh at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi, Rob, many thanks for your reply!\n\n\nThe source code of GenCumulativeSky can be found at: (including a short guide prepared by Darren)\nhttps://documents.epfl.ch/groups/u/ur/urbansimulation/www/GenCumSky/GenCumSky.zip\n\n\n... the download link is mentioned in one of the chapters in the book edited by Darren:\nRobinson, Darren (Ed.). (2011). Computer modelling for sustainable urban design : physical principles, methods and applications. London ; Washington, DC: Earthscan.\n\n\nIt seems Prof Christoph Reinhart in MIT has revised the program and added some new options, and the updated version is included in the latest DIVA installation package, see the discussion at:\nhttp://diva4rhino.com/forum/topics/gencumulativesky-exe-problem\n\n\nWould appreciate if you can share the detailed procedures of the compilation (for a C/C++ programming rookie)!\n\n\nThanks!\n- Ji\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2012 at 12:59 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\nYou don't even need to use the Xcode IDE, you can call the compiler (g++) directly if there's a makefile.

I assume we can use Xcode to compile it as an executable program for the Mac system. But I don't know how to do it ...\n\n\nCurrently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal and SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2 files in Mac system with other Radiance program. It's just a little bit inconvenient...\n\n\nAdvices are greatly appreciated!\n\n\n- Ji\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009120.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 12, 2012 at 10:15AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009116", "id": "radiance-general_009120"}
