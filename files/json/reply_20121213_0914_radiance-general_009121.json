{"body": "It is probable that you have multiple errors.  Your rays are probably not even striking the surface with your plastic material, since the rangl.cal file you are using defines a function rather than a variable for \"rang\", which should produce an error if it is ever called.\n\n\nDo you even have a surface defined in your scene?
