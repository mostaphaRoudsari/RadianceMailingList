{"body": "Hi, Rob and the list, a small follow-up question:\n\n\nI was testing GenCumulativeSky.exe to get the* annual \"global horizontal\nradiation\"* for *a single unobstructed upward sensor*.\n\n\nThe results is* *always *SMALLER or LOWER *than the *SUM of the \"global\nhorizontal radiation\" column in the epw file*. (For London.epw, up to 2.7%\nlower; for Paris.epw, up to 1.73% lower, for Singapore.epw, up to 1.5%\nlower ...)\n\n\nMay I ask:\n1) Is the difference in this kind of magnitude acceptable?\n2) is the difference related to the parameters for rtrace (I assume not, as\nthe sensor is unobstructed and the scene is empty...)?\n\n\nThanks!\n-Ji\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2012 at 2:15 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009123.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "December 13, 2012 at 08:08PM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009116", "id": "radiance-general_009123"}
