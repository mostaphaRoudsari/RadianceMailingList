{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nI was testing GenCumulativeSky.exe to get the* annual \"global horizontal\nradiation\"* for *a single unobstructed upward sensor*.\n\n\nThe results is* *always *SMALLER or LOWER *than the *SUM of the \"global\nhorizontal radiation\" column in the epw file*. (For London.epw, up to 2.7%\nlower; for Paris.epw, up to 1.73% lower, for Singapore.epw, up to 1.5%\nlower ...)\n\n\nMay I ask:\n1) Is the difference in this kind of magnitude acceptable?\n2) is the difference related to the parameters for rtrace (I assume not, as\nthe sensor is unobstructed and the scene is empty...)?\n\n\nI'd say those results are acceptable.  You are always going to get small differences depending on the how the skies are normalised and the cumulative map generated.  I'm not familiar with GenCumulativeSky, but my own cumulative sky approach usually gets me within 1 or 2% of the column total from the climate file.  Anything in that range I wouldn't worry about.\n\n\nBest\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/staff/profile/367.html<http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/>\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\n\n\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com<http://climate-based-daylighting.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009126.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "December 16, 2012 at 01:54AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009116", "id": "radiance-general_009126"}
