{"body": "Thank you very much, John and Thomas!\n\n\nI've found John's paper, and will read it later.\n\n\nAs far as I know, GenCumulativeSky also has two ways to create cumulative\nsky: the smeared sun approach (+s1 option) and the binned sun approach (+s2\noption), which might be similar to John's method #1 and #2 respectively\n(see its options below, the -r, -p, and -E option were added by the\nDIVA/DAYSIM team, I guess).\n\n\n\n\n###################################\nUsage: GenCumulativeSky [-d] [+s1|+s2] [-a latitude] [-o longitude] [-l]\n[-m standard meridian] [-h hour shift] [-G|-B|-E] <climate file>\n(Note: longitude +ve East of Greenwich)\n\n\n        -d      Ignore diffuse irradiance\n        +s1     Use \"smeared sun\" approach (default)\n        +s2     Use \"binned sun\" approach\n        -l      Output luminance instead of radiance\n        -r      Output radiance/179000 (ensures that units in the Radiance\nImage Viewer are in kWhm-2)\n        -p      Output radiance/1000 (ensures that units in the Radiance\nRGB data file  are in kWhm-2)\n        -G      File format is col1=global irradiance (W/m2), col2=diffuse\nirradiance (W/m2)\n        -B      File format is col1=direct horizontal irradiance (W/m2),\ncol2=diffuse irradiance (W/m2)\n        -E      File format is an energyplus weather file (*.epw) The\ngprogram uses the global irradiance (W/m2) and diffuse irradiance (W/m2)\ndata columns.\n                In combination with '-E' the considered time interval can\nbe specified:\n                -time <start time of day> <end time of day>\n                -date mm_start dd_start mm_end dd_end (if start-date after\nend-date then the winter interval is considered)\n####################################\n\n\n- Cheers, Ji\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 17, 2012 at 1:32 AM, John Mardaljevic <J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009130.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "December 18, 2012 at 12:05AM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009116", "id": "radiance-general_009130"}
