{"body": "Hi Peony,\n\n\nI guess no one ever responded to this...  I can really only repeat my response from August, which is that getting calibrated output from phone cameras is not possible at this stage, and may never be.  Their application is too different, and repeatability is not one of the design requirements for these modules.  They alter sensitivity, color response, and probably tone response without making any record of the original data.  I really think it is a waste of your time.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-December/000445.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 24, 2012 at 08:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000418", "id": "hdri_000445"}
