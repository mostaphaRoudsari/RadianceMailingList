{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\n179 is the efficacy of white (equal energy) light over the visible\nspectrum.\n\n\nDaylight is composed of a broader spectrum, so the efficacy (visible light\nper watt of energy) is lower.  Usually around 90 for the sun and 110 for\nthe sky, but changes based on various factors.\n\n\n179 is used in Radiance as a convention since we are simulating visible\nlight.  So when you're defining you sky using gensky with weather data you\nneed to either use the measured illuminance values and divide by 179 to get\nradiometric units for the visible spectrum, or use the measured radiance\nvalues (for solar spectrum), multiply by an approximate efficacy, then\ndivide 179 to get radiometric units for the visible spectrum only.\n\n\nIf you use gendaylit all the conversions are done for you.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009137.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "January 02, 2013 at 11:23AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009135", "id": "radiance-general_009137"}
