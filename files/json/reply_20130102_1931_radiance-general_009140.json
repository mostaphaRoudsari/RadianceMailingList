{"body": "I see, thank you very much, Andy!\n\n\nSo, can we put it as:\nThe *\"global horizontal radiation\" *in the epw file is a total solar\nradiation value* NOT yet *integrated over the visible spectral range\n(380-780 nm) (from gendaylit man page), so we can't simply multiply it by\n179 to get the illuminance value. We need to \"break\" the *\"global\nhorizontal radiation\" *into its RGB components and then use\n(R*0.265+G*0.670+B*0.065)*179 to convert it into a illuminance value.\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009140.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "January 02, 2013 at 07:31PM", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009135", "id": "radiance-general_009140"}
