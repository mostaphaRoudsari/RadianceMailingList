{"body": "Hi Ji Zhang!\n\n\n> So, can we put it as:\n> The *\"global horizontal radiation\" *in the epw file is a total solar \n> radiation value*NOT yet *integrated over the visible spectral range \n> (380-780 nm) (from gendaylit man page), so we can't simply multiply it \n> by 179 to get the illuminance value.

It usually really does not matter for you. You can use it as a \nconstant as long as you are interested in photometric quantities, as in \nsuch case, you input and your output will be in lumens, not watt. So \nfeed in by dividing by 179, read out by multiplying with the same. \nThat\u00b4s it. This is completely unrelated to the \"real\" luminous efficacy \nof lamps, skies, stars (aka the sun...), which is not that easy to \npredict. So, whenever possible, I'd use the photometric units for input \nwhen I need photometric results. This means you are working with \nwell-defined conversions.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009144.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
