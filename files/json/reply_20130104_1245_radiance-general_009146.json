{"body": "Dear all.\nI just wanted to announce the availability of a new release of a set of  \nscripts for the 3D content creation suite Blender - called LiVi - that  \nacts as a pre/post-processor for Radiance. Version 2 includes animatable  \nmaterials and geometry, dynamic daylight simulation capability and  \nartificial lights via IES files.\nDetails and download at  \nhttp://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi\nVersion 0.2 should be fairly 'stable' but bug reports, questions and  \nfeature requests are most welcome. I can be contacted directly at  \nR.Southall_at_brighton_dot_ac_dot_uk.\nRegards\nRyan\n\n\n\n\nDr Ryan Southall\nSchool of Art, Design & Media,\nUniversity of Brighton\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ryan Southall", "created_at": "January 04, 2013 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "Ryan_Southall", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009147", "id": "radiance-general_009146"}
