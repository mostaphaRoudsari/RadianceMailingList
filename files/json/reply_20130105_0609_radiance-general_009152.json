{"body": "Hi Philippe\n\n\nAccording to this document (\nhttp://brlcad.org/w/images/6/66/Converting_Geometry.pdf) BRD-CAD has a\nconverter to Wavefront OBJ format which is well supported in Radiance. From\nOBJ you then use the Radiance tools obj2rad or obj2mesh to convert the\ngeometry into a Radiance native format. You have to experiment with these\ntools to find a modeling and exporting workflow that suits your needs.\n\n\nBRD-CAD also includes sample source code for non-CSG exporters (ie. face\nbased geometry like it's used in Radiance). It should not be too difficult\nto write a native Radiance exporter based on this - if you know C, of\ncourse.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009152.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 05, 2013 at 06:09AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009139", "id": "radiance-general_009152"}
