{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nthanks for your feedback.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the BRL-CAD converter you mention is not included in the MacOSX version of BRL-CAD 7.22 and you can only export the databases to ASCII (tcl language format) in that application.\n\n\nAs a result, I am going to switch modelers: either Blender or Rhino.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nPhilippe\n\n\n\n\nLe 5 janv. 2013 \u00e0 15:09, Thomas Bleicher a \u00e9crit :\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009153.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Philippe de Rochambeau", "created_at": "January 05, 2013 at 06:38AM", "created_by": "Philippe_de_Rochambeau", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009139", "id": "radiance-general_009153"}
