{"body": "Hi again\n\n\nRadiance is probably not the best tool to start rendering or to explore\nray-tracing theory. It has since the beginnings a lot of optimisations to\nbe physically accurate but still reasonable fast. Because physical lighting\nand daylighting applications were the main purpose other features like\nshaders or caustics or particles are not well supported or not there at all.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Greg Ward has been supporting Radiance for a lifetime\nand has provided very detailed documentation and comments via this mailing\nlist (or those that came before). There is also a very good documentation\non the concepts and algorithms used in Radiance included in the \"Rendering\nfor Radiance\" book. I don't know of any other renderer that has something\nlike that.\n\n\nSo, in terms of studying and understanding raytracing you can do worse than\nRadiance. If you just want to create nice pictures you are probably better\nof with other renderers.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009155.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 05, 2013 at 07:08AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009154", "id": "radiance-general_009155"}
