{"body": "Dear Phillipe,\n\n\nPBRT, the software and the book, are a great way of learning how raytracers work and are relatively straightforward to modify (I'm a fairly experienced but self-taught C and C++ programmer and I could manage to add some features relevant to vision science, which is what I do for a living). Luxrender is a fork of PBRT (both are open source, as is RADIANCE) but luxrender has some more advanced features (especially in terms of volume properties). If you start with PBRT then it is a relatively painless move to luxrender (which integrates really well with a variety of modelling systems). I started with RADIANCE though, but mainly as a user rather than a programmer.\n\n\nI still wish RADIANCE had a sophisticated volume system but I guess it is too far away from its primary purpose - there are a lot of people in vision science who use RADIANCE who'd use it! \n\n\ncheers,\n\n\nBob Kentridge\nDept.of Psychology, University of Durham, UK\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009158.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "KENTRIDGE R.W.", "created_at": "January 05, 2013 at 12:22PM", "created_by": "KENTRIDGE_R.W.", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009154", "id": "radiance-general_009158"}
