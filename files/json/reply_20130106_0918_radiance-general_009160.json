{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\naccording to the BRL-CAD Converting_Geometry documentation PDF, the g-wave command lets you convert MGED object to .obj files. However, I could not find that command either in he BRL-CAD MGED 7.22 for MacOSX menus, nor in the Command Window help (\"help g-view\" return \"no help found for g-view\").\n\n\nI should indeed have asked about it in the mailing list, but gave up on BRL-CAD as a modeler a few days ago when I encountered the \"free\" Rhino for MacOSX.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nPhilippe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLe 6 janv. 2013 \u00e0 16:14, \"Lars O.
