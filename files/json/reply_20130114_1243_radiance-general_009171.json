After that, I tried using the HEAD release from some days ago, on Linux, and same deal \"Segmentation fault (core dumpted)\".\n\n\nThe same sky, without the O option does not return an error, but whenever I put O1, O2 or O0, it throws back a segmentation fault.\n\n\nIs this a known issue? what can I do to avoid it?\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\nGerman Molina\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009171.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 14, 2013 at 12:43PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009163", "id": "radiance-general_009171"}
