{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI think the higher resolution BSDF definitions, using the tensor tree\nrepresentation, will be important for accurate glare analysis.  In Andy and\nGreg's presentation here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW3_Multires_BSDF.pdf\n\n\n\n\non page 15 it compares a Klems BSDF with a 2X and 4X version, resulting in\nthe glare index dropping from 9% to 2%.  They show the Klems resolution is\nfine for predicting annual quantities of light.  But we should be careful,\nor really just use the tensor tree versions, when using them for glare\nanalysis.  The 145 Klems patches just spread the lumens too much,\nparticularly for systems that may have a more focused or directional optic\nwith sharp cut-offs.\n\n\nRegards,\nZack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009172.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "January 14, 2013 at 12:59PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009166", "id": "radiance-general_009172"}
