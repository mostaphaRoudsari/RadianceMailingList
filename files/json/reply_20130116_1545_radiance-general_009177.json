{"body": "Chris\n\n\nNot directly responding to your question but here is an alternative\napproche:\n\n\nInstead of assigning different reflective colors to the facades you are\ninterested in you could just separate each facade direction into a\ndedicated octree and run a simulation with white light. Renderings should\nbe fast if you restrict yourself to a single mirror reflection and no\nambient contribution.\n\n\nYou can then add up all the images for a single time step to get the\ncombined direct reflection. If you want to highlight a particular part you\ncan add/mix the individual pictures with a color in the post-process.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009177.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 16, 2013 at 03:45PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009173", "id": "radiance-general_009177"}
