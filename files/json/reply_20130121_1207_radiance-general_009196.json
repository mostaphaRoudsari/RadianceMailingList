{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nYou should not be seeing straight through the surface.  I did a test using your parameters, and could not see through such a trans material.\n\n\nAre you sure that what you are seeing is not the shadows cast by the beams?  Have you double-checked your geometry to make sure all the materials are correctly assigned and the surfaces where you expect them?  What happens when you substitute an opaque material for the trans?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009196.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 21, 2013 at 12:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009195", "id": "radiance-general_009196"}
