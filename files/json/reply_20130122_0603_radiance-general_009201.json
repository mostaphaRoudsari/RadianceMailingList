{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nHope I am getting how this works right...\n\n\nThe question regarding the Trans material previously posted by Per was\nbasically posted on my behalf and therefore I will take the liberty to just\nbuild upon that thread.\n\n\nWith respect to the difference between generating illuminance and luminance\npictures you of course have a very valid point. However, I am simulating a\nmodel with three layers of Trans material and I would expect that your view\nfrom inside and outwards even when considering illuminance levels would be\ndiffused (being filtered through three layers) ? Maybe I am missing\nsomething?\nWhat happens in between layers of Trans material (inter-reflections\netc.) and what are the internal surface properties?\n\n\nThank you for all you help so far!\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n*Martin*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009201.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Vraa Nielsen", "created_at": "January 22, 2013 at 06:03AM", "created_by": "Martin_Vraa_Nielsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009195", "id": "radiance-general_009201"}
