{"body": "Hi Martin!\n\n\nFirst, it would help to know whether you experience this with luminance maps, too.\n\n\nFor illluminance/irradiance any transmissive surface is tricky, as the observer may expect different results.\n\n\nWhat -ab setting do you use? -ab <3 would only let the specular transmission trough your multilayer diffuser, if I am not completely wrong... And that should make it appear like a dark (+ reflection) clear glass? I never tried this kind of stacking.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009202.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
