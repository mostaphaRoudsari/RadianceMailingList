{"body": "Hi Martine!\n\n\n> You were right that it appears to be \"perfectly\" diffused when considering luminance. However, just for future references, isn't it possible to evaluate the illuminance incident on a surface with trans or glass material applied?\n\n\nYou can do so by piping \"sensor locations/directions\" into rtrace and use the -I+ switch. That way, you calculate irradiance at that location without having a visible surface in place. You can get one value for a given location by e.g. piping one location / direction vector, e.g. echo \"0 0 0 0 0 1\" | rtrace -I+ (all other parameters...). Or you can generate a grid of such values, eventuelly forming an \"irradiance image\", by using vwrays to generate the locations / directions for you. This is much more flexible then rpict -i, which always depends on a surface in your scene. Have a quick look at Axel Jacob's tutorial to see some examples.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009221.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
