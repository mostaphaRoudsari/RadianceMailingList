{"body": "Hi George,\n\n\nThis seems a very interesting project! Does this include also trying to simulate the high dynamic range found in real life?\n\n\nFor your problem I guess that the options -vs and -vl might help you.\nFrom the rpict manpage:\n\n\n-vs \nSet the view shift to val. This is the amount the actual image will be shifted to the right of the specified view. This is option is useful for generating skewed perspectives or rendering an image a piece at a time. A value of 1 means that the rendered image starts just to the right of the normal view. A value of \u22121 would be to the left. Larger or fractional values are permitted as well.\n\n\n-vl \nSet the view lift to val. This is the amount the actual image will be lifted up from the specified view, similar to the \u2212vs option.\n\n\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009224.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "January 29, 2013 at 01:59AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009223", "id": "radiance-general_009224"}
