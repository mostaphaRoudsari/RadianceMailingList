{"body": "The HEAD should compile smoothly on the Mac, since that's what I'm using.  There were a number of bugs fixed in genBSDF and related procedures since the official 4.1 release, and you really should be using the HEAD for that.  Also, the -n option works much better in the latest code using the new rcontrib, although I expect you still won't see much of a boost for simple geometries.\n\n\nIf you use the Klems matrix to represent a BSDF, it won't resemble the output of Optics due to the spreading of the direct component in the former.  You might do a little better with a tensor tree representation, but a BSDF data file will never live up to a material model when it comes to sharp peaks.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009232.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 30, 2013 at 02:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009229", "id": "radiance-general_009232"}
