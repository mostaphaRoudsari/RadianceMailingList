{"body": "Hi Jeff,\n\n\nThe NOAA calculator takes degrees east longitude, whereas gensky expects degrees WEST longitude.  (Same for the standard meridian.)\n\n\nTry it; you'll find much better agreement.  (I get within half a degree for Cape Town using your parameters.)\n\n\nIt's confusing all the different standards, isn't it?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009235.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 30, 2013 at 03:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009233", "id": "radiance-general_009235"}
