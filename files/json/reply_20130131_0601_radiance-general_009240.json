{"body": "Hi Julien,\n\n\nUsing  the default option (-O 0 ) gendaylit \"transfers\" the solar \nradiation into visible radiation, using a luminance efficacy model.\nTherefore the \"sky irradiation\" (=equals visible irradiation) differs \nalso from situation to situation. The luminance efficacy of the sun is \nmuch lower than for the sky and this is taken into account by the model.\n\n\nSo for your case\n\n\ngendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -G 500 200\n\n\nyou get\n425 W/m\u00b2 visible radiation\n\n\nif you use\n\n\ngendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -O 1 -G 500 200\nyou get\n695 W/m\u00b2 solar radiation  which is +- the input radiation of \n500+200=700W/m\u00b2\n\n\nSo the results are as expected.\n\n\nThe included luiminance efficacy model works properly within gendaylit - \nat least a recently internal performed validation study on measured data \nshowed this.\n\n\nBy the way, my colleague will announce later today a major update of \ngendaylit, which have some significant improvements included.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 01/31/2013 11:56 AM, Julien Boutillier wrote:\n> Hi everyone,\n>\n> I 'm using gendaylit function to generate sky with visible spectrum only.
