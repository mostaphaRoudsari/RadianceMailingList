{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThe physics of this situation is unusual, and the Radiance source code does apply a correction for the \"solid angle ratio\" caused by lensing at the surface.  However, Radiance doesn't track source directions properly inside a dielectric or through a refracting object -- it naively sends rays in a straight line towards the source, missing it in cases where significant refraction occurs.  This is why a straight ambient calculation works but the direct calculation does not.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009247.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 31, 2013 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009246", "id": "radiance-general_009247"}
