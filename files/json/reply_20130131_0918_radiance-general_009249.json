{"body": "I should have said specifically that the source calculation doesn't work if the light bends and stays bent.  In a more typical situation where the dielectric is in two parallel planar surfaces, the ray straightens out again and everything works just fine.  Radiance started out only having the dielectric material -- glass and trans types were added much later.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009249.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 31, 2013 at 09:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009246", "id": "radiance-general_009249"}
