{"body": "Hi Julien!\n\n\n> I don't forget to apply the skyfunc to a glow modifier. Here  is 2 files which describe my sky. Did I make something wrong? \n\n\nSeams to be ok in there.\n\n\n> I use rtrace to calculate the irradiance in a point high in the sky (100meter). -ab parameter is equal to 0, I don't need interreflexion for this case (...)\n\n\nCould you please try with -ab 1? Your glow is effective only in the indirect calculation. rtrace calculates irradiance on a virtual diffuse surface, so the glow is hit over at least one bounce.\n\n\nI have to admit that I tend to forget the exact behavior of rtrace here and cannot test it. The -I may internally increase -ab, but I would not expect it.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009258.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
