{"body": "Hi Lars, \n\n\nThanks for this explanation.\n\n\nI tried again to put -ab 0 and effectively I only have sun contribution. I don't know what I have done last time (I thought I had tried this case already).\n\n\nWith 500 W/m2 for direct irradiance and 200 W/m2 for diffus irradiance I obtain 280 W/m2 with -ab 0 and 425 W/m2 with -ab 1 or higher.\n\n\nWith 0 W/m2 for direct irradiance and 200 W/m2 for diffus irradiance I obtain 0 W/m2 with -ab 0 and 136 W/m2 with -ab 1 or higher.\n\n\nI am not sure to understand why the diffus contribution is not the same (425-280 = 145 W/m2 not equal to 136 W/m2). I  saw Perez parameters are not the same, so I think the created sky is a bit different, and this is why\u2026?\n\n\nCheers, \n\n\nJulien\n\n\nLe 4 f\u00e9vr. 2013 \u00e0 21:49, Lars O.
