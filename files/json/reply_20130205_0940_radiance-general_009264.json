{"body": "Hi Julien,\n\n\nas Jan explained before, the inputs of gendaylit can be \"visual irradiance\" (which is probably achieved by dividing illuminance by Radiance internal luminous efficacy 179), irradiance (which is W/m2 as measured by a pyranometer without any weighing), or illuminance. You select according to your data using the -O option. If you use -O 0, gendaylit assumes that you have a typical data set as recorded by a pyranometer, which includes e.g. infrared. It will assume a luminous efficacy for sun and sky, and reduce the irradiance accordingly.\n\n\nIf you want to verify your method first, start simple. E.g. go with a simple model, where you assume that photo metric measurements were available. Create a basic sky with 1000lx beam (normal) direct illuminance and 1000lx diffuse horizontal. Use this with rtrace -I+ -ab 0, and you should get 1000/179 * cos(pi-sun altitude) W/m2. Render with -ab 1, and you should get this direct horizontal irradiance + 1000/179 W/m2.\n\n\nThe next step is to look into whether you have measured photo metric readings, or whether you need to use radio metric readings. In this case, you can let gendaylit reduce these using its luminous efficacy models.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nDipl.-Ing. Lars O.
