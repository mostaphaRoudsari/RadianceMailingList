You select according to your data using the -O option. If you use -O 0, gendaylit assumes that you have a typical data set as recorded by a pyranometer, which includes e.g. infrared. It will assume a luminous efficacy for sun and sky, and reduce the irradiance accordingly.\n>\n> If you want to verify your method first, start simple. E.g. go with a simple model, where you assume that photo metric measurements were available. Create a basic sky with 1000lx beam (normal) direct illuminance and 1000lx diffuse horizontal. Use this with rtrace -I+ -ab 0, and you should get 1000/179 * cos(pi-sun altitude) W/m2. Render with -ab 1, and you should get this direct horizontal irradiance + 1000/179 W/m2.\n>\n> The next step is to look into whether you have measured photo metric readings, or whether you need to use radio metric readings. In this case, you can let gendaylit reduce these using its luminous efficacy models.\n>\n> Cheers, Lars.\n>\n> Dipl.-Ing. Lars O.

That means that whatever sky distribution you generated, it will not be considered in your calculation. If you really got the same results for your sky with -ab 0 and -ab 1, that means that you did not have any diffuse sky component in your scene. Maybe the input was out of the valid range of the Perez sky, and only the sun (which is modeled as light, not glow), was written to the sky description.\n>>>\n>>> Try it out yourself - create a scene with a 180 degrees source, modified by a glow definition of RGB 1, 1, 1. This should lead to an irradiance of RGB pi. With -ab 0, you will get zero irradiance, with -ab 1 and anything higher you get the expected 3.1416....
