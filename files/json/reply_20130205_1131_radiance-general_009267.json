{"body": "Hi Jan!\n> just to avoid some confusion about input and/or output:\nThank you for the clearification, I was writing my latest message from \nwhat I remembered on a phone...\n\n\nSo far, whenever possible, I have avoided the whole conversion and its \nimplied assumptions by using illuminance for input and -O 0, which \nallows me to stay with the conversion by a luminous factor of 179 lm / W \nas I use it everywhere else in Radiance. The weather data I use has a \ncolumn with photometric units, and as I am interested in luminance and \nilluminance as the result of my simulations, I try to avoid introducing \nany additional conversion. One should however be aware that fields in \nweather data may actually be derived from models of luminous efficacy, \ntoo, as not every station measures both irradiance and illuminance...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009267.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
