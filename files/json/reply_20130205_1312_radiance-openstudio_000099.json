{"body": "Hi Khalid,\n\n\nThese errors are usually the result of an error when the Perez sky is being generated. You may have seen quite a bit about the new Evalglare v2.0, which solves many of these issues. We will be updating the OpenStudio scripts to leverage this new version as well as some other exciting additions to he main Radiance distribution, but it's just going to take some time. There are a lot of exciting new things in Radiance, and we're trying to implement them now because they potentially solve a lot of issues we're having and promise some performance improvements, particularly on Windows systems. We just have to find time to squeeze it all in around other promised deliverables.\n\n\nThanks for your patience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS: RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2013-February/000099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 05, 2013 at 01:12PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000017", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000099"}
