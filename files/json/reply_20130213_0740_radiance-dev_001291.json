{"body": "Greg I'd completely forgotten about this issue & was reminded by a colleague recently as he was seeing this issue intermittently.\nHe's provided me an archive which I've uploaded to http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/radiance_issues/ghost_luminaire2.zip\nIt should contain - Monday.rad, Monday_mod.rad Luminaire Files - DULCET1203WW.* Parameter file - Monday.rdp (with -dt = 0.025 and -dc = 0.95) View file - Monday.rdv Octree file - image5.oct Pic file - image5.pic (with ghost luminaire)\n\n\nWe're running on Windows 7 x64. The radiance code I used to build from source is a few months old (mid-September IIRC) as I haven't had time to re-download & re-run Cmake etc. if there's been any updates since then.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher \nSoftware Platform Engineer \nT: +44 (0) 141 945 8500\nF: +44 (0) 141 945 8501\nhttp://www.iesve.com \n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>** \nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
