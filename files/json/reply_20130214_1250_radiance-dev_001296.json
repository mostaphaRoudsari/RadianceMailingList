{"body": "(I posted earlier from my personal address, but I don't think I'm actually\nsubscribed from that one. Apologies if this ends up showing up 2x...)\n\n\nHi Pally, \n\n\nI can help here. The origin trunk (i.e. \"master\") on that Kitware git repo\ndoes not refresh the way you might think. Kitware has a \u201a\u00c4\u00facombined\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nbranch that actually has the latest HEAD (updated nightly, I believe at\nmidnight EST). To add this, issue:\n\n\n\"git checkout -t origin/combined\"\n\n\n\"git branch\" will tell where you are, and what you've got checked out:\n\n\nhooper:radiance rpg$ git branch\n combined\n* master\nhooper:radiance rpg$\n\n\nYou can switch between branches with the 'checkout' command:\n\n\nhooper:radiance rpg$ git checkout combined\nSwitched to branch 'combined'\nhooper:radiance rpg$ git branch\n* combined\n master\nhooper:radiance rpg$\n\n\nI work off this combined branch for building current packages (speaking of\nwhich a fresh set of them should go live on the NREL site today). I know\nthis is confusing, but this is a vestige from when Kitware was doing all\nthe heavy lifting getting the CMake build system implemented across the\nsource tree, and making frequent changes.\n\n\nAnyhow, the takeaway here is if you wish to use the Kitware git repo for\nyour latest HEAD source, use the combined branch for now!\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nP.S.\nI know this is a bit confusing. We will hopefully set up our own (NREL)\ngit mirror that I'll be able to refresh whenever I need to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/14/13 4:10 AM, \"Pally Sandher\" <pally.sandher at iesve.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-February/001296.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 14, 2013 at 12:50PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001282", "id": "radiance-dev_001296"}
