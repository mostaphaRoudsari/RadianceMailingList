{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nconsidering that the specular transmission is that light that does not\ntouch any surface, the analytical solution would be the exact one (am I\nright?). Also, HERE<http://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics/Bidirectional%20Properties%20of%20Slat%20Shading.pdf>,\nthose results were compared agains TracePro, and the results of the forward\nray-tracing gave, basically, the same results as the model I am using.\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n2013/2/16 Lars O.
