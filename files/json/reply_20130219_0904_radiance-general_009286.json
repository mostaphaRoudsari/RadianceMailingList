{"body": "Hi folks,\n\n\nJust a quick note to let you all know that the Radiance installers have been updated, and are available for download at the NREL OpenStudio site. These packages include the brand new 'gendaymtx' utility that greatly speeds up the annual calculation when using the daylight coefficient tools in Radiance.\n\n\nWe hope to add gendaymtx into the OpenStudio tool chain and workflow in the coming weeks, but in the meantime, I'm sure Greg would appreciate any feedback from users willing to try it out on their own, especially those Windows users out there. There's a man page explaining its use, and it's pretty straightforward.\n\n\nGrab yours here:\n\n\nhttp://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\nOk, bye.\n\n\n-Rob Gee\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS: RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009286.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 19, 2013 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008572", "id": "radiance-general_009286"}
