{"body": "Yes, gendaymtx is in the HEAD version, and dctimestep has been updated as well to handle its output.  It does not use GPU (or even CPU) acceleration, but it's still very fast compared to running one step at a time.  (My test runs took a couple of minutes for a typical 8760-step weather tape.)  It will even produce a series of images, though that takes longer due to the i/o requirements.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009289.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 19, 2013 at 11:34AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008572", "id": "radiance-general_009289"}
