{"body": "Leyla,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be a better way, but I generally will open a single image into\nmy Photoshop to create my mask. Create an image with the fisheye portion\nyou want to keep black and the part you want masked out white. Save this\nas a .tiff file in your working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Radiance, you will first need to convert the tiff into an hdr. This\nis done by the following command: ra_tiff -r filename.tiff mask.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo mask out your captured hdr using pcomb, this should work: pcomb\ncaptured.hdr -s -1000 mask.hdr > output.hdr (or pipe to another\nprocess).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"-s -1000\" portion of the pcomb command should be sufficient, but if\nyou have some remaining pixels in the masked area, try a different\nscaling factor (-10000, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Coulter\n\n\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n\n\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\n\n\nNew York, NY 10005\n\n\nTel: 212.334.2025\n\n\nDirect: 212.616.0254\n\n\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com \n\n\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-February/000451.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "February 19, 2013 at 11:39AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "hdri_000449", "id": "hdri_000451"}
