{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThank you very much.\nYes, after analyzing my results I also think that I have a problem with the\nskylight but I can not understand where...\n\n\nI have already think to use the Radiance. Daysim is not good for me because\nI also want to simulate artificial light. I read somewhere that I can\ninsert my model in use Autodesk Ecotect Analysis software and the export it\nand simulate with the Radiance. Is this right?\n\n\nHowever I am not sure if it is free?\nWhere can I download it?\n\n\nBest regards,\nCatarina\n\n\n2013/2/22 Lars O.
