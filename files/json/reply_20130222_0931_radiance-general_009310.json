{"body": "Hi German,\nThe GPU code didn't provide any acceleration over CPU code  for a single\nannual run,  It only helps for dozens or more parametric annual runs (many\nBSDF's many view matrices, many climates ...)  and even then it was only\nmarginally better.\n\n\nThe bulk of the acceleration in the dctimestep?pu code comes from loading\nthe data once and multiplying everything once. The old way of doing\ndctimestep for a single time step and looping requires the V, T &\nD matrices to be loaded and multiplied for each time step - clearly this\nisn't efficient for an annual run since the matrices don't change.\n\n\nThe updated version of dctimestep performs as well as the dctimestep?pu, is\nmore robust than dctimestep?pu (no segfaults when matrix dimensions don't\nmatch) and can handle rendered view matrices.\n\n\nYes, you gan give dctimestep a rendered view matrix and have hourly annual\nrenderings after about 2 hours.\n\n\nHope that helps,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009310.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 22, 2013 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008572", "id": "radiance-general_009310"}
