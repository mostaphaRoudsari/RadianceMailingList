{"body": "Hi\n\n\nI don't know these files but according to their names it seems that you should reorder the file names in your oconv command so that all materials definitions (apparently contained in the VDT.mat file) appear before the geometry files.\n\n\nThis means that you should simply change:\noconv VDToff.rad VDT.mat VDTscreen_off.rad > test.oct\ninto:\noconv VDT.mat VDToff.rad VDTscreen_off.rad > test.oct\n\n\nHope this will help you\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009314.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "February 25, 2013 at 05:43AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009313", "id": "radiance-general_009314"}
