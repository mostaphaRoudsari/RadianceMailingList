{"body": "Thanks all for the advise & help!\n\n\nUnderstand now that pcond -h is mainly for visual purpose. Hence, does \nthat also meant the exposure settings should not be adjusted (for \ncomparison of clear and darker glass)? \n\n\nI am currently using the Desktop Radiance via Ecotect plug-in. Is there a \nrecommendation to which free tool available I can use that still allow me \nto do glare analysis for an Ecotect model with better accuracy? \n\n\nHave downloaded \"radiance-4.2.a-win32.exe\" but not too sure where to \nstart... What is the application difference with the Ecotect desktop \nradiance plug-in I am using now. Am I supposed to generate an image via \nEcotect and use command prompt to run the analysis or there is another \ntool I would need to download?\n\n\nCheers,\nAnn\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not the email's intended recipient, kindly inform the sender \nand delete it. \nThe email may contain confidential information which should not be \nretained, nor disclosed to another individual.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009330.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sim Swee Ling Annie", "created_at": "February 27, 2013 at 10:39PM", "created_by": "Sim_Swee_Ling_Annie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009321", "id": "radiance-general_009330"}
