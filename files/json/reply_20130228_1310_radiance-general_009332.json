{"body": "Hi John, a quick comment on this study.  While I agree it is not written up\nvery clearly, I do believe LEED intended a \"clear sky\" to be an IESNA\ndefined clear sky that would have a solar disc included and would use the\nIES standardized formulas for deriving the diffuse (via a zenith luminance)\nand direct illuminances.  LEED v4.0 (yet to be released) has this new\nsDA/ASE thing, have you had a chance to give that a spin?  The challenge\nseems to be in simulating blind control.\n\n\nCheers,\nZack\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 27, 2013 at 2:18 AM, John Mardaljevic <J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009332.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "February 28, 2013 at 01:10PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009317", "id": "radiance-general_009332"}
