{"body": "Hey Rob,\n\n\nSo, as expected, Perez returns roughly the same illuminance fed to it.  I\nused the clearest noon I could find around equinox, with a 9.76:1 (dir\nnor/diff) ratio (3-19 at 12pm in the Boulder TMY2 file).  I get 8360fc\nwhere the global illum is listed as 8259fc, which I'd say is equivalent.\n Looking at the percent difference between the resulting Perez sky and\nIESNA recommendation is interesting.  The perez sky has the north horizon\nroughly 1.2x brighter, the south horizon about .9X as bright, and the\ncircumsolar reqion about ~1.3x brighter.  The ratio image is here:\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/14937994/perezdivSPOT_fls.png  (this is the perez\nsky divided by the IESNA sky for a sunny equinox at noon in Boulder, CO)\n\n\nCheers,\nZack\n\n\nOn Thu, Feb 28, 2013 at 3:13 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009335.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "February 28, 2013 at 04:07PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009317", "id": "radiance-general_009335"}
