{"body": "Hello Yulia,\n\n\nThis command reads a Radiance-formatted HDR image into Matlab:\n\n\nImg = hdrread('Image.hdr');\n\n\nThe following 3 commands perform 2D fast Fourier filtering on the Red, \nGreen, and Blue image planes, respectively.\n\n\nFRed = fft2(Img(:,:,1));\nFGreen = fft2(Img(:,:,2));\nFBlue = fft2(Img(:,:,3));\n\n\nI'm not sure what you are planing to do, but you can also do the work \nwith luminance values by first preparing the image using Radiance \ncommands. For example, from the command line:\n\n\n >> pvalue -o -b RGBImage.hdr > Luminance.dat\n >> pvalue -o -b -r Luminance.dat > RedundantGrayscaleImage.hdr\n\n\nThen in Matlab, strip off two redundant image planes, and you are left \nwith luminance.\n\n\nA second, perhaps easier way to get luminance values is to rewrite this \nfamous equation in Matlab:\n\n\nluminance = 179 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B)\n\n\nModified for Matlab, this should do the trick:\n\n\nLuminance = 179 .* (0.265.*Img(:,:,1) + 0.670.*Img(:,:,2) + \n0.065.*Img(:,:,3));\n\n\nNo matter what you are doing, be sure all matrices remain high \nresolution (i.e., 'double precision' and not 'uint8'), or you will get \n8-bit aliasing, clipping, Matlab errors, and all kinds of problems.\n\n\nIn Chapter 4 of my dissertation, there are some image processing \ntechniques using Matlab and Photoshop, including Fourier filtering with \nMatlab. It might be worth a look:\n\n\nEvaluating Object Visibility with Simulated Visual Impairment Using Real \nand Rendered Scenes. URL: http://purl.umn.edu/144216\n\n\nOne more thought: there are also ways to read the header information \ninto Matlab, if necessary. A bit of that is covered in my code snippets \nof Chapter 4.\n\n\nHave fun!\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-February/000458.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "February 28, 2013 at 05:20PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "hdri_000457", "id": "hdri_000458"}
