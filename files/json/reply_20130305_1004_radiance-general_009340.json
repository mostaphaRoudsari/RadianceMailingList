{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nIndeed, my daylight coefficient file was missing the header (my rtcontrib line still had a '-h-' in it from the script I copied it from).\n\n\nIt runs smoothly (and quickly!) now.\n\n\nThanks,\nGalen\n\n\n> Hi Galen,\n> \n> Thanks for trying this out.  I assume the '|' symbol in your e-mail is just a stray character, otherwise you would get an error trying to execute this.\n> \n> I hadn't tested this mode before with a simple daylight coefficient matrix, but it seems to work OK.  Are you sure your \"daylightcoeffs.dc\" file has an appropriate header to it?  > The dctimestep command expects the file to start something like:\n> \n> #?RADIANCE\n> Test matrix\n> FORMAT=ascii\n> \n> 0.954473516\t0.443845774\t0.2058499\n> 0.64873052\t0.152509289\t0.862083965\n> ...\n> \n> Binary files will have \"FORMAT=float\" or suchlike, instead.  On the other hand, the sky vector or matrix file is not expected to have a header.  A bit peculiar, I know, but this is how things worked out.  Your gendaymtx has the appropriate number of lines, 876*146 plus 146 blank lines separating each sky patch row.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> -Greg\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009340.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Galen Burrell", "created_at": "March 05, 2013 at 10:04AM", "created_by": "Galen_Burrell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009338", "id": "radiance-general_009340"}
