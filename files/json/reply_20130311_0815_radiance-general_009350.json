{"body": "If all these surfaces are mirrors, then you cannot see anything.... unless:\n- there is a non-mirror reflecting object somewhere in your scene that is supoposed to be lit by the multiple-reflecting light path; since it will reflect light in many directions you should see it!\nor\n- your point of view is located somewhere on the multiple-reflecting light path and your view direction points towards it. Then you should directly see the light source appearing as an image on the last mirror.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n________________________________\nDe : Shamim Javed [javeds2006 at gmail.com]\nDate d'envoi : lundi 11 mars 2013 15:56\n\u00c0 : Radiance general discussion\nObjet : Re: [Radiance-general] Light Shelf Reflections\n\n\nI am hoping to see multiple reflections of the light beam reflected off the light shelf top surface in both the floor and the ceiling (all of which are mirror surfaces).\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 11, 2013 at 10:40 AM, Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com<mailto:jedev at visarc.com>> wrote:\nHi Shamim,\n\n\nWhat changes are you expecting to see?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com<http://www.visarc.com>\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n\n\nOn 3/11/2013 10:03 AM, Shamim Javed wrote:\nI am using Radiance via Ecotect.
