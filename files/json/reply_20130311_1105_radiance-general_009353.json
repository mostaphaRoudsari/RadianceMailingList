{"body": "Hi Tim,\n\n\nHaze is the percentage of transmitted light which deviates from the\nincident direction.  So you could interpret the haze to mean that 50% of\nthe transmitted light is diffused.\n\n\nAs a first approximation I would use trans with the following transmission\nproperties:\nTs = 0.455\nTd = 0.455\n\n\nThough with a haze of 50% assuming that the scattered light is lambertian\nis a bit of a stretch.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009353.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 11, 2013 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009351", "id": "radiance-general_009353"}
