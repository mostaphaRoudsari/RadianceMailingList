{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nI am not quite sure how the new gendaylit -O option, which changes the incorporated spectrum, is supposed to interact with RGB colors in a Radiance scene.  You would have to redefine your materials to incorporate a different set of wavelengths and define what those are to really be consistent about it.  Doing everything in single-channel mode introduces another type of inaccuracy, one that is potentially greater than the difference between total flux and visible flux.  You really have to know what you're doing.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009359.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 11, 2013 at 08:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009356", "id": "radiance-general_009359"}
