{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nI think I will elaborate what I am trying to do first using the \"gendaylit\n| genskyvec\", and see if it works, then I may ask these kind of things.\n\n\nMy idea was, indeed, to emulate a single-channel mode, as I did when I used\ngenBSDF for solar transmission. Of course, the materials wil have to be\nadapted: I was planning to use spectrally averaged solar properties (grey\nworld), and I have no intention of obtaining lighting information out of\nthese calculatons.\n\n\nAs you might guess, I am not quite sure I know what I am doing, haha, but\nmy understanding is that it should work, right? My idea is to validate all\nthese, though.\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n2013/3/11 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "March 12, 2013 at 06:35AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009356", "id": "radiance-general_009360"}
