{"body": "Are you expecting to see them in your rendering?  This will not be the case\nin the way that you set up your model.  The light will not be visible on a\nperfect mirror because all light is reflected in the mirror direction -\nnone to the view point.  And all your walls are perfectly absorbing so you\nwon't see any light patterns on those either.  Your view will only show\nreflection of the perfectly black walls.  The multiple reflections should\nshow up in your illuminance calcs though.\n\n\nI suggest changing the walls to gray and changing the time of day to 11:45.\n Then you should see reflection patterns along the west wall of your model.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009374.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 12, 2013 at 05:34PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009344", "id": "radiance-general_009374"}
