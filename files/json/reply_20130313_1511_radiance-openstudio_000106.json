{"body": "Hi Sandy,\n\n\nGood to see you're trying out the OpenStudio Radiance stuff! Yes that error is due to a problem gendaylit had during a timestep(s). This is generally caused by a sun close to the horizon. The latest version of gendaylit offers a more robust failure mode that we plan to integrate into OpenStudio, but at the moment our solution is the one you see. Hopefully it's not happening too frequently; if it is I'd be happy to take a look at your model and weather file to make sure there isn't something else going on. Just send me the files as an email attachment, and don't post to the list because attachments will be rejected. Thanks!\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent with Good (www.good.com)\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2013-March/000106.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 13, 2013 at 03:11PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000105", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000106"}
