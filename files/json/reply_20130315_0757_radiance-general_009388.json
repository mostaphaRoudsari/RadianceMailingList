{"body": "You will need at least one ambient bounce to calculate the contribution of an ambient \"glow\" source. Zero ambient bounces means only direct sources like \"light\" would be traced.\n\n\nAlso, I'm not sure, but the rpict manual says the -i option actually estimates the irradiance using the radiance value and the lambertian reflectance. I've never delved into the code, so I'm not sure how accurate that description is. After testing -ab 1, you might also try assigning a very small reflectance to your black surface.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009388.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 07:57AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009384", "id": "radiance-general_009388"}
