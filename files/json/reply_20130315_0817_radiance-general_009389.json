{"body": "Andy,\n\n\nPictures from my model:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xz5glrx34o4cucz/LS%20Ref_Model%20Pic_14mar.pdf\nThey do validate your simulation results.\n\n\nI tried to replicate your simulation image (using Radiance via Ecotect) but\nwithout success so far.  I used the Radiance Control Panel in Ecotect\nto insert the values you had used for your simulation but continue to get\nmy previous picture. How long did your image take to generate?\n\n\nShamim.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009389.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shamim Javed", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 08:17AM", "created_by": "Shamim_Javed", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009344", "id": "radiance-general_009389"}
