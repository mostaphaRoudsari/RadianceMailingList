{"body": "Hi Christopher\n\n\nActually i am computing per pixel visibility ( or say each point visibility of the surface) in the up direction. I suppose if we set ambiance bounce more than zero, then it will have inter-reflection effect. and to avoid interreflection contribution i have done surface material perfectly black and bounces zero.\n\n\nYes we do need light source, for that i am using glow ( self\u00a0luminous\u00a0surface \u00a0) and a unity hemispherical light source for a point.\n\n\nand logically i suppose -completely visible point is shaded as unity, and zero will be treated as occluded. so value of rgb determines the visibility factor.\n\n\n-i option produces \u00a0irradiance map.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nso basically i render the scene\u00a0\nrpict \u00a0-x resx, -y resy -i -ab 0 -vf camera.vp \u00a0scene.oct > scene.hdr\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009390.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brajesh Lal", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 08:43AM", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009384", "id": "radiance-general_009390"}
