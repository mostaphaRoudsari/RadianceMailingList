{"body": ">I learned this morning that the halo is coming from the array of ceiling\n>lights and not the spotlight.\n\n\nThat was pretty clear to me, in looking at the rendering. The multiple\nedges evident particularly from the bottom of the frame are the giveaway.\nYou are using Radiance light objects, and these always give these\nexceedingly (unbelievably) sharp edges to the pools of light that they\ncast. Radiance lights based on a photometry file tend to have softer\nedges, even those based on directional lamps.\n\n\nJack's trick worked because even tho you have -aa at zero, you have -ab 2\nwhich will still cause the ambient calculation to be run; the increased\n-ar has the effect of softening the halo, I think. -aa 0 simply turns off\ninterpolation, not the ambient calculation altogether.\n\n\nI think. \n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009392.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 09:03AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009379", "id": "radiance-general_009392"}
