{"body": "That doesn't sit well with me. I do want the ambient calculation, but \"-aa \n0\" is supposed to turn caching off---or run a fresh new hemisphere \nsampling for every image pixel (assuming -ps 1). So why would it \ninterpolate from some brighter ambient point in the dark area *under the \nframe* instead of probing outward for the incident light? Ambient \nresolution should have no part of that.\n\n\nM\n\n\nOn Fri, 15 Mar 2013, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009395.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 09:46AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009379", "id": "radiance-general_009395"}
