This is because glow was intended to model\nthe sky, a very large area source.  It is much more efficient and accurate\nto sample the sky using the stochastic ambient calculation compared of the\ndeterministic direct calculation.\n\n\nWith -ab 0 you get no light in your image from the glow (unless you can see\nthe glow geometry in your view).  Setting -ab 1 when using a glow source is\nequivalent to a direct only calculation (ie without any\ninter-eflection effects).\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009396.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 09:53AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009384", "id": "radiance-general_009396"}
