{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nI suspect you are seeing specular samples from low angles on your black frame.  If the frame has a roughness below 0.001 or so and non-zero specularity, the Fresnel coefficient will cause the specularity to go to nearly 1 as you approach grazing.  This is correct behavior, but in regions near the inside edge, this will cause stray, bright sample values in your ambient calculation.  The only way to fix it is to set roughness above 0.002 or set specularity to zero on your surface.\n\n\nI haven't downloaded your model to confirm the material parameters, so I'm really just guessing.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009398.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009384", "id": "radiance-general_009398"}
