{"body": "It looks like the changes you make to -dr and -lr are not being passed to\nRadiance.\nI recommend running radiance yourself from the dos prompt.  You many need\nto install Radiance first (I'm not sure if ecotect's version of Radiance is\nset up to be used from the command line).  Best bet is to use the NREL\ninstaller (\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n)\n\n\nAfter you install Radiance, start the dos shell and change directory to the\nlocation of the model files.
