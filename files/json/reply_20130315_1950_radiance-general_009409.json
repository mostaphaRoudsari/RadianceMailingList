{"body": "Dear Colleagues,\n\n\nMy sincere thanks to Andy and everyone else who have tried to help me in\nthe last few days with my light shelf reflection problem.  Finally I have\nsome results which are more convincing:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bt46eywmsykphv4/mirror_graywall2.pdf\n\n\nThe directionality (surface normal) of the the ceiling mirror surface seem\nto be one of the major things that was throwing me off.  My next step is to\nimport the values of these multiple reflections on to a simulation grid so\nthat I can plot them as a graph.\n\n\nYour support meant much to me.\nShamim.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009409.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shamim Javed", "created_at": "March 15, 2013 at 07:50PM", "created_by": "Shamim_Javed", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009344", "id": "radiance-general_009409"}
