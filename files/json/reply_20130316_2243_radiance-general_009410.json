{"body": "Andy,\n\n\nHow could you tell by just looking at the numbers that my ceiling surface\nnormal was facing up?\n\n\nI am trying to import the results of the radiance simulation (with bands of\nlight hitting the floor) on to an analysis grid to finally generate an\nillumination graph that would have progressive 'bumps' reflecting these\nlight bands.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/owvm7gqtamicdou/analysis%20grid.pdf\nAny suggestions on an effective way of doing this would be much appreciated.\n\n\nMy radiance image has a distinct raddish tint unlike yours which came out\nwith much more natural colors.  Any thoughts how I may improve this?\n\n\nShamim.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009410.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shamim Javed", "created_at": "March 16, 2013 at 10:43PM", "created_by": "Shamim_Javed", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009344", "id": "radiance-general_009410"}
