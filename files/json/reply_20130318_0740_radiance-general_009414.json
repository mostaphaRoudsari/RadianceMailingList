{"body": "Shamim.\n\n\nYou can export the analysis from Ecotect (it becomes a list of xyz coordinates with normal direction vector of that sensor). You can then use rtrace to calculate your illuminance values. You will need to create two grid files, one with normal vectors pointing up (0 0 1) for light arriving from the ceiling and a grid with normals pointing down (0 0 -1) for light bouncing off the floor.\n\n\nUsing the \"Final Render\" option in the Radiance Analysis/Export panel of Ecotect allows you to assign a grid (\"Generate Point Data\" check box). If you are using radiance from the command line rather than the Ecotect interface, the best way I've found to save a grid file is to set the output to \"Daysim header\" and uncheck \"Auto-run Daysim\". The analysis grid will be in the specified folder, saved as a .pts file.\n\n\nI suggest looking through this tutorial for step by step guidance. http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf\n\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009414.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "March 18, 2013 at 07:40AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009344", "id": "radiance-general_009414"}
