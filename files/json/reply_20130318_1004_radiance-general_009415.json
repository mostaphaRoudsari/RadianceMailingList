{"body": "Hi Shamim,\nI think others have addressed most of your questions. So I'll just help you\nwith the appearance of your image.  There are two things to consider.\n\n\n1)  Some of your \"gray\" materials are actually quite red.  From your\nmaterials file:\n\n\nvoid plastic Wall_gray\n0\n0\n5 *0.867 0.384 0.122 *  0.00000 0.00000\n\n\nvoid plastic Floor_Dark_Gray\n0\n0\n5 *0.388 0.137 0.027*   0.00000 0.00000\n\n\nThe first three numbers following the 5 (on the fourth line) are the red,\ngreen and blue reflectance value.  Both of these \"gray\" materials have\nhigher red reflectance so they are actually red.  To get rid of the red you\nshould balance the RGB reflectances.\n\n\n\n\n2) you are creating an illuminance rendering instead of the typical\nluminance rendering.  An illuminance rendering is a rendering of the\nilluminance at each point in the model and is really only useful for\nanalysis.  A luminance rendering resembles what one would see in real life.\n This is why you don't get the infinity box effect that I had in my\nrendering and that you get in your scale model.  But the illuminance\nrendering is a handy way to understand the reflections on a mirror surface\nwithout making your head spin.\n\n\nTo generate an illuminance rendering, the -i option is included in the\nrpict command (your rpict currently uses the -i option).\nTo generate a luminance rendering remove the -i option.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009415.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 18, 2013 at 10:04AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009344", "id": "radiance-general_009415"}
