{"body": "Hi Ogata,\n\n\nThis tutorial was made in the early days of the 3-phase method.  There have\nbeen many bug fixes, including one where angles were mis-interpreted twice,\nso the result for symmetric CFS was okay.\n\n\n1 - Fixing the bug mentioned above affects the numbering of the view matrix\nrenderings.  So your figure 13 is correct.\n\n\n2 - in figure 18, the venetian0 and venetian 45 labeling is swapped.  The\nresult isn't affected.\n\n\n3 - this is strange, especially with part of the window showing up black.\n\n\nDid you make sure to change to the W6 Standard basis in window (Figure 14\nin the tutorial)?\n\n\n\n\nI'm working on updating the tutorial to fix these issues and to incorporate\nnewer capabilities.  Hopefully I have a new version this week.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009416.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 18, 2013 at 04:52PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009296", "id": "radiance-general_009416"}
