{"body": "Hi Ery,\n\n\nit might be worth looking at the gendaylit source. There should be some models implemented for estimation of the luminous efficacy, and thus conversion between radiometric and photometric units. Still, it is certainly a good idea to measure irradiance instead of illuminance if this is what you need.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009424.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
