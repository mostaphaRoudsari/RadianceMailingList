{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\nIt appears that whenever you enter \"-s*\" you break the argument vector parsing. The scale option is expected as:\n-s [some number]\nor:\n-s [a(uto)]\n\n\nIn other words, falsecolor is looking for a \"-s\", followed by a space, followed by either an integer (or the letter \"a\" to indicate autoscaling).\n\n\nWhen you enter \u2013spec (or \u2013sun, or \u2013shit, or \u2013supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, for that matter),  you confuse the argument vector parser because it's expecting a space after the \u2013s. So instead of being caught by the \"bad option\" case, \"-spec\" causes an error, and whatever option follows \"\u2013spec\" is presented as the culprit, but only because it's the next option in the argument vector. I agree, it's a misleading error.\n\n\nIn some more other words, I know what  the cause is, but not the cure. Axel (Andy? Greg?), can you help? We need some Perl and Regex assistance here.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/21/13 3:16 PM, \"Michael Martinez\" <michael at coolshadow.com<mailto:michael at coolshadow.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Folks,\n\n\nI installed the latest HEAD yesterday, and learned in a round about way how -spec has been replaced with -pal spec (or hot or pm3d...)\n\n\nWhen I errantly used -spec the error message indicated my mistake was in the -l or -log options.
