{"body": "Chaps,\n\n\nRob is correct about the -s trap of the argument parser in falsecolor.pl\n\n\nThis is fixable, and I'd be happy to do this. To my excuse, however, I \nmust say that the arg parser in any of the csh scripts in Radiance, and \nprobably in many of the Perl scripts, too, is not terribly \nsophisticated. It does its job, but not all possible errors are caught.\n\n\nThe arg parser in Radiance's Perl scripts is free-form, rather than \nrelying on a module. This is both a deliberate design decision, but also \nborn out of necessity: The Perl parsers are all based on GNU syntax, \nwhich Radiance doesn't follow. We looked into this, but it turned out \nthat modifying existing 'bullet proof' modules to deal with all the \nquirks of Radiance command line args is simply a pain in the neck.\n\n\nExisting Perl parsers are good with -s or --short-option style things. \nWhen you throw -a+ vs -a- at them, they just give up. Making this work \nproperly is a helluva job.\n\n\nSo should -spec be treated as -pal spec (probably not), or should it \nthrow up a more meaningful error message e.g. 'deprecated'?\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n > It appears that whenever you enter \"-s*\" you break the argument \nvector parsing.
