{"body": "Michael,\n\n\ncould you give this a try and let me know if it works for you. I'm not \nsaying 'read the man page', because I'm not sure how this is (or is \ngoing to be) done on Windows. All right?\n\n\nI have taken the liberty to add a new '-pal eco' which I promised to \nsubmit almost a year ago.\n\n\nThere is also a new -cp (posterise) option that has been in HEAD for a \nwhile. Just needs mentioning on the man page.\n\n\n@Greg,\nplease give us your opinion on the current implementation. I'm touching \nup the man page now. It needs the -cp option, and also the sponsor of \nthe -pal eco option. Will report back....\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-March/001308.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 22, 2013 at 03:17PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001303", "id": "radiance-dev_001308"}
