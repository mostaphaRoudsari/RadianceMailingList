When I talked Greg into this new -pal option (which \nis a lot more flexible), we weren't too worried about compatibility. \nYou've just reminded us that old habits die hard. Now, if only there was \na way of killing off this dreaded Desktop Radiance....\n\n\n>> There is also a new -cp (posterise) option that has been in HEAD for a\n>> while.

F+P are mentioned as \nsponsors now, and there is a -palettes example. Please edit as required.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nPS: Since Easter is approaching, I thought I might as well tell you \nabout this on-topic Easter egg in Radiance:\n\n\nfalsecolor -ip my_image.hdr -s Axel | ximage\n\n\nYezzzzz!
