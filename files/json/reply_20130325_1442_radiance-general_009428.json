{"body": "Hi Ery,\n\n\nTinkering with the Boise TMY3 data I was a little surprised to see how some of the efficacy values turned out.  For those unfamiliar, the Boise TMY3 climate file (much like many of the others from the Energy+ website) contains both illuminance and irradiance data for these quantities:\n\n\n- Global horizontal (Gh)\n- Diffuse horizontal (Dh)\n- Direct normal (Dn)\n\n\nSometimes illuminance data is derived from irradiance measurements, though nowadays it is more likely to be measured separately.  Which it is could be identified in the climate file (I haven't checked).\n\n\nThe following table shows how the mean luminous efficacy (within 5klux bands of global horizontal illuminance) varies for: the global horizontal; the diffuse horizontal; and, the direct normal quantities:\n\n\n\tgh_lo           gh_hi\t     Eff_gh          Eff_dh          Eff_dn\n\n\n      5000.00      10000.0      106.145      135.606      60.1583\n      10000.0      15000.0      106.610      147.202      73.0784\n      15000.0      20000.0      107.339      258.167      81.6775\n      20000.0      25000.0      108.312      140.848      88.2379\n      25000.0      30000.0      107.261      156.417      92.4818\n      30000.0      35000.0      106.713      184.455      94.1426\n      35000.0      40000.0      106.456      197.996      96.1488\n      40000.0      45000.0      106.142      213.014      97.9623\n      45000.0      50000.0      105.894      177.705      99.2376\n      50000.0      55000.0      105.992      173.584      100.170\n      55000.0      60000.0      105.812      179.285      100.867\n      60000.0      65000.0      106.057      300.989      101.701\n      65000.0      70000.0      105.593      129.234      101.205\n      70000.0      75000.0      105.347      145.367      101.420\n      75000.0      80000.0      105.333      193.799      101.418\n      80000.0      85000.0      105.044      135.980      101.445\n      85000.0      90000.0      104.697      134.219      100.965\n      90000.0      95000.0      103.924      123.413      100.588\n\n\nThe global efficacy value (Eff_gh), as you noted, is between 100 and 100 lm/W -- I'd expect global vertical to be very similar to global horizontal, at least for sun illuminated orientations.  Direct normal efficacy across the ranges is also pretty much how I expected it to vary.  However, diffuse horizontal efficacy seems to flap-around quite a bit -- four maxima, two of them quite conspicuous.  I wouldn't have been too surprised to see general trends, but this was unexpected.  Can't say that I've noticed or given much thought to it before, but I am a little intrigued by those high values, i.e. > 200 lm/W.\n\n\nBest\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/staff/profile/367.html\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009428.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "March 25, 2013 at 02:42PM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009418", "id": "radiance-general_009428"}
