{"body": "Hi Ehsan,\n\n\nyou are not the first one having problems starting with the cal-file \nsyntax. So let me try.\n> I am doing rad Tutorial, there we used blue_band as a modifier for \n> wall_mat. I checked the primitive for blue_band and it looks like below:\n>\n> void colorfunc blue_band\n> 4 if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1)) if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1)) 1 .\n> 0\n> 0\n\n\n\"if (a,b,c)\" in Radiance is a function returning \"b\" if a>0 and \"c\" if a<=0.\n\n\nThe minimal colorfunc line expects values for R, G, B and a cal-file. In \nthe given case, the values for R and G are calculated by the given \nformulae, the value for B is fixed to 1 and the cal-file is not needed \nand set to the current path \".\"\n\n\nThe expression \"if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1))\" is interpreted as:\nif (Pz-1.2,.....) : as the if-function decides according to the \ncondition >0 or not, this leads to the evaluation wether Pz is greater \nthen 1.2. If this is the case, the return value (the value for the \nR-channel) is 1. If Pz <= 1.2, thus Pz-1.2 becoming 0 or less, the \nreturn value (R-channel) will be set to the result of the expression \n\"if(Pz-1,0,1)\". This follows the same rules, setting the return value \n(R-channel) to 0 if Pz is larger then 1, and to 1 if smaller or equal 1. \nIf you combine these two expression, you will get R=1 if Pz=<1 or \nPz>1.2, else R=0. As Pz is the z-coordinate of the point where you \ncalculate the pixel color, this results in a line centered at height 1.1 \nof 0.2 width.\n\n\nHope this helps to understand the remains of the line...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009429.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
