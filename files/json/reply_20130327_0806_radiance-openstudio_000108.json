{"body": "Hi Khalid,\n\n\nNope, size of the illuminance map should not affect the reported energy savings. The savings in the latest OpenStudio versions are based on the illuminance at the daylighting control point, and of course the setpoint.\n\n\nWhat version of OpenStudio are you using? I am happy to look at your model and your test process so we can see what's going on there. I'm on vacation this week but have access to email, just sporadically. Let me know how I can help!\n\n\nRob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNREL Commercial Buildings Research Group\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2013-March/000108.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 27, 2013 at 08:06AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000107", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000108"}
