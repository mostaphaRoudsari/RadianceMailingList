{"body": "Thanks Rob, \n\n\nI think I\u2019m not opening the right results files \u2026 the first result will come from this location: \u2026 /AppData/Local/Temp/qt_temp.gg4416/radout \n\n\n\u2026 I did run several models by using Openstudio 10.3  \u2026 but for some reasons, the folder: \u201c0-Ruby\u201d disappear from  the \u2018Run\u2019 folder \u2026. \n\n\nI do not knew why when opening the results from the result viewer in openstudio .. I did not get the results directly from the same folder of the model.\n\n\nOne more question Rob, is it possible now to run Radiance for a selected period of the year, or not yet.  \u2026..Thanks\n\n\nKhalid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2013-March/000109.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Khalid", "created_at": "March 27, 2013 at 01:39PM", "created_by": "Khalid", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000107", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000109"}
