{"body": "Rob and others\nThe very high numbers (>300) are not physically plausible (at least on this\nplanet with its atmosphere and sun). You can get numbers in the 200l/w\nrange if you filter sunlight through spectrally selective glass.  If I had\nto guess, without doing any homework, its an artifact of the derivation as\nfollows: I assume diffuse radiation is calculated by processing measured\nglobal irradiance and measured or assumed beam, and that diffuse\nilluminance is calculated by processing measured global illuminance and\nmeasured or assumed beam, so you are comparing two \"small\" numbers, each\nthe result of subtraction of two much larger numbers, so that relatively\nsmall errors in the original calcs are magnified by that derivation.  If\nsomeone has time to dig into the source data you could verify or expose\nanother source.  Of course it could be direct measurement and just a batch\nof poorly measured/calibrated/reported  data.\n\n\nSteve\n\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n\nStephen Selkowitz\n\n\nBuilding Technology and Urban Systems Department             (510) 486-5064\n\n\nBldg.90-3111\n       fax (510) 486-4089\n\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nSESelkowitz at lbl.gov\n\n\nBerkeley, CA 94720\nhttp://buildings.lbl.gov/ <http://BTECH.lbl.gov/>\n\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 27, 2013 at 8:51 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009434.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stephen Selkowitz", "created_at": "March 28, 2013 at 12:13AM", "created_by": "Stephen_Selkowitz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009418", "id": "radiance-general_009434"}
