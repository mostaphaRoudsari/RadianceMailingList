{"body": "Carolin,\n\n\nAh, I see it now. The NREL Radiance installers are for OSX versions 10.7 \nand 10.8. The \"Illegal instruction\" error means that the compiled binaries \nuse instructions that became available only in OSX 10.7.\n\n\nYour options seem to be: Upgrade to 10.7, or install and build Radiance \nmanually. Check out this page for instructions:\n\n\nhttp://radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1\n\n\nSorry about the incompatibility. We're here to help with the manual \ninstallation.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn Thu, 28 Mar 2013, Carolin Seib wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009440.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "March 28, 2013 at 08:08AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009435", "id": "radiance-general_009440"}
