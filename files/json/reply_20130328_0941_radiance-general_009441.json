{"body": "If you add a parameter to both rtrace commands such as \"-af simulation1.amb\" it will save an ambient cache in your current working directory and make the second command run faster. You will want to be sure that your ambient calculation parameters are the same for both, in your case it looks like you're taking the rtrace defaults for both. If you revise your model or calculation parameters, you will also want to manually delete the ambient cache before you run again, because you will either see strange results or an error message if you inadvertently try to use the old cache for a new calculation.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "March 28, 2013 at 09:41AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009436", "id": "radiance-general_009441"}
