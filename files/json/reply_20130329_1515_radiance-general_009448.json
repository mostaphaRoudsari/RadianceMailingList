{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nThe view defaults for genklemsamp are the same as the rendering programs, except that it assumes a parallel view (-vtl).  The view up vector will be +Z unless you specify otherwise.  So long as it isn't parallel to your view direction, as in the case of a horizontal skylight, you don't need to specify it.\n\n\nYou will need to specify the interior normal direction using the kbin() function defined in klems_int.cal for your \"view matrix\" calculation.  Just make sure these agree with what you give to genklemsamp.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009448.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 29, 2013 at 03:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009447", "id": "radiance-general_009448"}
