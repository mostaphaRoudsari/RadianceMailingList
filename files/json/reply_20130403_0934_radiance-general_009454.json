{"body": "Hi German,\n\n\nTo orient the coordinates for genklemsamp, the view up vector\nis essentially projected onto the plane normal to the view direction (or\nBSDF surface normal).  So if you have sloped skylights you can use the +Z\nvector for view up, and the BSDF will be oriented so that the +Y direction\nis uphill on the skylight.\n\n\nHowever if your skylight is horizontal, than +Z is parallel to the view\ndirection (or BSDF surface normal) so as you suggest you need to provide a\nnon-vertical view up vector.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009454.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 03, 2013 at 09:34AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009447", "id": "radiance-general_009454"}
