{"body": "All I was going to say was that adding another high level language to the\nRadiance dependency list was probably not something you'd be interested\nin, Greg. OTOH, since gensky ain't goin' noplace (and technically Python\nstill wouldn't be a dependency since the use of IES_gensky would remain\noptional), I personally don't see the issue in adding IES_gensky.py (and\nthe .cal file it needs) to the Radiance trunk. It could just be there for\npeople who want to use it, and since it's even named differently from\ngensky its use would be less confusing than the objview/objview.rb\ndichotomy we currently have, which is operating system based. Zack would\nsimply owe you a manpage for it, and we could add IES_gensky to our\ninstall/library routines. We could also consider adding Mark Stocks's\ngenutahsky to the mix, but since that's written in C it's potentially more\nof a support burden than the Python script.(?)\n\n\nI was gonna stay out of this conversation, but since you asked Greg, the\nthread is now two cents richer. =)\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/5/13 11:28 AM, \"Gregory J.
