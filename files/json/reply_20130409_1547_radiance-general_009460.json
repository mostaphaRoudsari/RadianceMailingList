{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nLooks like no one got back to you on this.  Perhaps your question isn't completely clear, because I'm not sure of the answer, either.\n\n\nYour fc_fp2.cal file seems to be tailored for a particular arrangement of objects.  In general, you can add a transform to your colorpict string arguments to account for simple surface movements.  Did you try:\n\n\nvoid colorpict fc_val_fp2\n9 red green blue images/vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr fc_fp2.cal fc_u fc_v -rz 7.3\n0\n0\n\n\nIf that doesn't do the right thing, you can try \"-rz -7.3\" instead.  Alternatively, you can eliminate fc_fp2.cal entirely with:\n\n\nvoid colorpict fc_val_fp2\n15 red green blue images/vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr . Px Py -s 20.1 -t -167 -248 0 -rz 7.3\n0\n0\n\n\nAgain, I am guessing a bit here as your situation isn't entirely clear to me.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009460.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 09, 2013 at 03:47PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009459", "id": "radiance-general_009460"}
