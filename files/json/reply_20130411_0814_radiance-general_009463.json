{"body": "Hi Mike,\n\n\nAnyhere runs on a low-budget server that occasionally experiences problem.  In this case, something more serious is going on and I just wrote to the administrator (/ business owner) to find out what.  Hopefully, we'll have it sorted out in a day or two.  Meanwhile, I will e-mail you a copy of Photosphere.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  This probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, so I'll cross-post my reply there.  Any follow-up should happen on HDRI.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009463.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 11, 2013 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009461", "id": "radiance-general_009463"}
