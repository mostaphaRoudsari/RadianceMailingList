{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nI just tried installing this on Ubuntu and got a couple errors.  First it\ncomplained of not having a \"BSDFViewer\" directory.  Was this supposed to be\nin this .tar file?  So, I copied this same directory that was in a\n\"BSDFViewer1.2_ubuntu\" package I got from you and it runs until I get\nerrors like this for each file in BSDFViewer directory:\n\n\n/usr/bin/ld: i386 architecture of input file 'xxxxx.o' is incompatible with\ni386:x86-64 output\n\n\nIt also complains about not finding a \"libBSDF.so\" file.\n\n\nAm I missing some updated files or something else?\n\n\nThanks!\nZack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "April 11, 2013 at 03:21PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009182", "id": "radiance-general_009464"}
