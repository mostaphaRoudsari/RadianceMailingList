{"body": "Dear Andrew,\n\n\nI missed the first versions and the links are no longer available. I\ndownloaded the last version you provided ( 1.3a_ubuntu.zip) and it seems\nsome source files from the common radiance source folder are missing for\nsuccesfull compilation :\ncone.c    cone.h    face.c    face.h    free_os.c  image.c  instance.c\ninstance.h  loadvars.c    mesh.c    mesh.h    modobject.c  otypes.c\notypes.h  readmesh.c  readobj.c    readoct.c  sceneio.c  tmapluv.c\ntmaptiff.c  tmaptiff.h\n(i copied them from the radiance-HEAD source available on\nradiance-online.org)\n\n\nThen there is a java issue\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/include/jni.h:45:20: fatal error: jni_md.h: No\nsuch file or directory\nthis error comes from the fact that the file is located in the\ninclude/linux rep. (\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-hdfs-dev/201205.mbox/%3C117050669.38033.1336464885155.JavaMail.tomcat@hel.zones.apache.org%3E\n)\n\n\nAnd now it works!!\n\n\nThanks! You just provided me with a great tool that will be quite usefull.\nIt would be even more if i can directly load a bsdf.xml file from the\ncomand line (or by an other way). Ist that possible??\n\n\nI see this ubuntu version includes tensor trees. That is great! I have been\nreading a bit about tensor trees and would like to use them to create bsdf\nfrom the simulation of complex fenestration systems. I looked at the code\nin the genbsdf routine that creates the tensor tree but i am realy not\nfamiliar with perl... then i found the bsdf_t files in the common dir of\nradiance. Is there any specific documentation about this, or an example i\ncould start from to create and store tensor tree bsdfs?? Idealy i would\nlike to create a C++ object to do that... Any help or advice would be\ngreatly apriciated.\n\n\nKind Regards.\n\n\nAndre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 12, 2013 at 1:26 AM, <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009467.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andre Kostro", "created_at": "April 12, 2013 at 02:07AM", "created_by": "Andre_Kostro", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009182", "id": "radiance-general_009467"}
