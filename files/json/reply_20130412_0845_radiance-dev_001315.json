{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nWhile the Exif header is a nice place to access such data and isn't that difficult to read, it's a real pain to write out.  The only tool I know of that does so robustly is exiftool, which is free and well-documented.  You can build a script around it such that you use the \"ra_ppm | cjpeg\" followed by a call to exiftool to insert the desired tags into the output.  It works quite well.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-April/001315.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 12, 2013 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001314", "id": "radiance-dev_001315"}
