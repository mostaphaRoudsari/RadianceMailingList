{"body": "Hi Andre,\nThanks for sending a report.  I'm gald you were able to get it to work.  It\nshouldn't need those other things to build libBSDF.so, so I'll see if I can\nremove the dependencies.\n\n\nWhat did you do to fix the jni_md.h location problem?  Did you copy it into\nthe correct place?\n\n\nThe WINDOW team want's to use this software (or a cleaned up versin of it)\nto display BSDFs from WINDOW, so it will have the ability to load a file\npassed as a command line argument eventually.\n\n\nThe best public documentation is available here (starting at slide 18):\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW3_Multires_BSDF.pdf\nbut that's not much to go on.\n\n\nI can also offer a few images of the tensor tree angle bsdf basis to help\nunderstand how the shirly-chiu mapping works with the hilbert curve:\nhttp://gaia.lbl.gov/people/andy/public/tensortree/\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009470.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 12, 2013 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009182", "id": "radiance-general_009470"}
