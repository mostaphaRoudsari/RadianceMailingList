{"body": "Hello again!\n\n\nBy doing some parametric analysis I got my answer. Actually my so called\nphotocell was facing the window, and since I had no sky distribution (only\nsun defined in my sky file), thats why in the model there was no sky\nenvironment (just like in outer Space). Hence the recieved irradiance at\nthat location was Zero. I think I am right now.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaibhav Jain\nwww.vaibhavjain.co\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009486.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "April 21, 2013 at 03:47AM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009485", "id": "radiance-general_009486"}
