{"body": "Thanks Lars. Actually my illuminance sensor (I already used -I switch),\nwas spatially located on a wall, with its direction towards a window Xorg\nYorg Zorg 0 -1 0. But out of this window there was no sky glow or source\ndefined (neither ground); only Sun source was defined. Thats why, the\nsensor was not able to trace any ray coming from that direction (0 -1 0)\nusing rtrace, because there was no sky. But finally I understood that and\nthe issue is now resolved. Also this proved to me that there is some\nreverse ray tracing going on. :)\n\n\nThis was my command: echo '3 4 1.5 0 -1 0' | rtrace -w -as 512 -ar 512 -aa\n0.15 -ab 2 -i+ -h sunnyScene.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\nVaib\n\n\nPS: If you are interested to see the geometry, and sky, I have reported\nthat in my university assignment.
