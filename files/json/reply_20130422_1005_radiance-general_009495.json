{"body": "Hi Giovanni,\n\n\nYour question is difficult to answer.  You have not said whether you want to show what a \"white balanced\" image would look like, in which case you are better off doing nothing.  If you want to show what the image would have looked like had you used your 6500K white balance on a scene with 3000K illumination, then the answer may be computable.  The way I would do it is in the following stages:\n\n\n1) Convert to a sharpened RGB color space using:\n\n\n\t$ ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333 .3333 orig.hdr > sharp.hdr\n\n\n2) Compute the (x,y) chromaticities for your two color spaces using src/cal/cal/blackbody.cal and convert to Sharpened RGB space and get the ratios between RGB at 3000K to RGB at 6500K:\n\n\n\t$ icalc blackbody.cal xyz_rgb.cal\n\tCIE_pri(i) = CIE_Sharp(i)\n\tx65=cct_x(6500); y65=cct_y(6500)\n\tx30=cct_x(3000); y30=cct_y(3000)\n\tR(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/R(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)\n\t$1=1.6033242\n\tG(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/G(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)\n\t$2=1.10306009\n\tB(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/B(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)\n\t$3=0.439966014\n\n\n3) Apply these RGB ratios to the Sharpened version of the image and convert back to standard RGB:\n\n\n\tpfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 sharp.hdr | ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr\n\n\nIf your result looks horribly orange, then you know you've succeeded.  That's just what happens when you shoot indoors with a daylight whit balance!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  You could of course combine steps #1 and #3 if you like really long command lines:\n\n\n\tra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333 .3333 orig.hdr | pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 | ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr\n\n\nP.P.S.  The reason for converting to a sharpened RGB color space is that this does a better job simulating adaptation in your eye.  You could skip this step and get similar results using the standard RGB color space.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009495.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 22, 2013 at 10:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009489", "id": "radiance-general_009495"}
