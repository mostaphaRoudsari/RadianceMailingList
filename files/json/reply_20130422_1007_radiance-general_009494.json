{"body": "Vaib,\n\n\nThere is an important difference between the -i (lower case i) and -I\n(capital i) in rtrace.   When -i is given, rtrace will trace a ray in the\ndirection given, and then will calculate the hemispherical irradiance at\nthe point where the ray intersects with geometry (ignoring some material\ntypes).  With the -I command it calculates the hemispherical irradiance at\nthe point you specify using the direction vector as a a normal for the\nimaginary surface on which irradiance is calculated.\n\n\nUsers typically want -I, except for specialized cases.  You should make\nsure that  -i is correct for your case.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 22, 2013 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009485", "id": "radiance-general_009494"}
