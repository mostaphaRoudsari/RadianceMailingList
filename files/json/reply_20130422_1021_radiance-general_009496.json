{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, I'm expecting orange results! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is to merge different images (with different light sources)\ntogether. \n\n\nEach light source will have a different colour temperature; as our eye\ncan't adjust simultaneously to all of them, my assumption is (crude, I\nadmit!) that it will adjust to the main light source/colour temperature,\nwhile the other will look coloured (just as a lightbulb looks orange in\ndaylight).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for sharing this, I'll get into understanding the code now (and\ntranslating for windows)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiovanni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009496.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "April 22, 2013 at 10:21AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009489", "id": "radiance-general_009496"}
