(And very cool, in my opinion!)\n\n\nI have been looking for a low-cost platform to do HDR image generation (in\nthe field) with the program HDRGEN, the command-line HDR image builder.\n\n\nhttp://www.anyhere.com/\n\n\nAny idea how long it would take the Pi to composite 7 .JPG images (say\nabout 1000px by 1000px in dimension) into an HDR image?.\n\n\n(Then i would do a bit of analysis with Radiance and send some commands to\ncontrol physical devices)\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009497.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kyle Konis", "created_at": "April 22, 2013 at 02:49PM", "created_by": "Kyle_Konis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009482", "id": "radiance-general_009497"}
