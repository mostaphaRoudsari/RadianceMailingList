{"body": "Thank you Andy and Lora for correcting me and pointing this out. Since it\nwas my first project I was under an impression that + sign after -i makes\nit equivalent to -I. Ignorance can be dangerous in simulation.. :)\nWonderful group and spirit. Next semester I have to work much with Radiance\nbecause it will be used in my masters thesis.
