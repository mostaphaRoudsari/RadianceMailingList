{"body": "Hi Giovanni!\n\n\nIn this case you may white-balance the combined contributions of the colored sources. pcomb would do that job quite easily. The procedure is similar to the daylight coefficient approach based on rcontrib. You render one image for each light source (using rtrace, rpict or rcontrib) first with normalized radiance for each source (say RGB 100,100,100). Than you use pcomb to \"scale\" the images according to the desired source output, and finally add the images for each source.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009500.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
