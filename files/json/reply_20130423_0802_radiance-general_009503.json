{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, you cantered the point of what I am trying to do. Render different light sources separately potentially change their intensity and colour temperature and compose them together to get a combined result.\n\n\nThe tricky bit is to calculate the right coefficients to change CCT of the light source, which Greg explained with a method of an elegance I wouldn\u2019t have reached on my own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009503.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "April 23, 2013 at 08:02AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009489", "id": "radiance-general_009503"}
