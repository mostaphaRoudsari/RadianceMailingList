{"body": "Hi Avinash,\n\n\nJust a followup: I was able to install and run evalglare on the .hdr \ncreated from last night's .nef files (Method 1). I then performed the \nfollowing two operations:\n\n\npfilt -1 -x /4 -y /4 test01.hdr>test01s.hdr\nevalglare -c test01g.hdr test01s.hdr\n\n\nEverything seemed to work (i.e., I got a grayscale output image with a \ngreen 'glare' mask). I suspect that since the header information (I was \ncalling it 'metadata' before) was already in the image, there was no \nneed to add -vtv, or declare -vv -vh. Here is what I found in my \ntest01s.hdr header:\n\n\n#?RADIANCE\nCAMERA= NIKON D90 version dcraw v9.12\nhdrgen created HDR image from '_DSC3776.tif' '_DSC3775.tif' \n'_DSC3774.tif' '_DSC3773.tif' '_DSC3772.tif'\nEXPOSURE=3.280407e+00\nVIEW= -vtv -vh 37.200130 -vv 25.245402\nCAPDATE= 2013:04:23 23:46:20\nPRIMARIES= 0.6400 0.3300 0.3000 0.6000 0.1500 0.0600 0.3127 0.3290\nFORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe\npfilt -1 -x /4 -y /4\n\n\nI hope this helps...\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-April/000463.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "April 24, 2013 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "hdri_000461", "id": "hdri_000463"}
