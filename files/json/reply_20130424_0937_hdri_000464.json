{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI think Adobe Photoshop must have messed up with the header files while creating the HDR. I was about to try the methods you sent in your earlier email but seems there is a shorter route by using hdrgen or photosphere to create the HDR file. I am a novice in this area and your help is really appreciated.\n\n\nThanks again for all your help.\n\n\nRegards,\nAvinash\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-April/000464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Avinash Gautam", "created_at": "April 24, 2013 at 09:37AM", "created_by": "Avinash_Gautam", "parent_id": "hdri_000461", "id": "hdri_000464"}
