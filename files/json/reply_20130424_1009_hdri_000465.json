{"body": "Yes, Photoshop strips the header from Radiance (HDR) images, including the view parameters.  You can always add them back in afterwards using the Radiance \"vinfo\" command (on Unix anyway).  You'll still have the problem that Photoshop doesn't do any kind of absolute calibration on HDR images, so if evalglare needs absolute quantities, it won't have them.  Adding the correct exposure requires having an in-scene luminance measurement for calibration.\n\n\nThis is why it's generally better to use hdrgen or Photosphere for HDR creation in photometric applications, although a calibration measurement will improve your accuracy even more.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-April/000465.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 24, 2013 at 10:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000461", "id": "hdri_000465"}
