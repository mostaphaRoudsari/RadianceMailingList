{"body": "Greg confirmed my foggy memory about Photoshop and hdr headers. Just a \ncouple quick thoughts I wanted to share... If you have extra time and \nenergy, consider trying Greg's raw2hdr script \n(http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-February/000363.html). \nHowever, there's really no problem with using jpegs and \nhdrgen/photosphere. I have personally found that with creating and using \na good calibration method and file (see this: \nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/calibrate.shtml), and being consistent with \nthe whitebalance setting, the jpeg method produces extremely accurate \nluminance images (r^2 > .996). As Greg just mentioned, a photometer to \ndial in the range would further improve the 1:1 hdr to real photometric \nvalues. Finally, I will cautiously note that in one experiment, I found \nthat jpegs were more accurate than nefs (perhaps due to random \nfluctuations in estimating the calibration response curve), but I \nhaven't repeated that experiment. For both image types (jpg and nef), \nthe covariances between image sample and photometer were still extreme \n(r^2 ~ .99).\n\n\nHappy imaging!\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-April/000466.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "April 24, 2013 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "hdri_000461", "id": "hdri_000466"}
