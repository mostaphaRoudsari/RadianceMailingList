{"body": "Hi,\n\n\na very short follow-up on this topic:\nR=G=B in Radiance does not have an approximate color temperature of 6500K.\nR=G=B corresponds to an equi-energy spectrum over the visible part which\nhas a correlated color temperature of approx. 5456K.\n\n\nBest,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/4/22 Giovanni Betti <gbetti at fosterandpartners.com>\n\n\n> Dear List,****\n>\n> ** **\n>\n> I have a problem that I hope the radiance community can help me understand.\n> ****\n>\n> ** **\n>\n> Assume you have simulated a scene with artificial light and you have set\n> the colour of the light to true white (R=G=B; approximate colour\n> temperature 6500k).****\n>\n> I assume it should be possible in postprocessing to alter the colour\n> temperature of the light source and of the scene (assuming that\u2019s the only\n> light source) using some pcomb expression (different coefficients for the\n> RGB coordinates). ****\n>\n> Does anybody have any pointer to the math required to calculate the\n> coefficient to change the light source from, say, 6500K to 3000K?****\n>\n> ** **\n>\n> Thanks in advance,****\n>\n> ** **\n>\n> Giovanni****\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n>\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
