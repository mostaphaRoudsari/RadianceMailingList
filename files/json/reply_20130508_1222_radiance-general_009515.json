{"body": "Great idea. We had planned to use the test cases in CIE 171:2006 for validating the Radiance implementation in OpenStudio, but this effort had to get scaled down in the interest of time. I like the idea of hosting a site (similar to Mark Stock's benchmark site (http://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench.html)) where individuals could report their own results. I would like to throw NREL's hat into the ring for hosting such a thing, with the caveat that Greg brings up about copyright issues over CIE 171. Maybe some folks closer to CIE (John M?) could weigh in on this. We could of course just post the results, and anyone wishing to either perform the validations or to understand the meaning behind the results would have to get their hands on the document. That doesn't seem like too much of a burden to software developers or to scholars of lighting simulation, after all. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-May/009515.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 08, 2013 at 12:22PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009514", "id": "radiance-general_009515"}
