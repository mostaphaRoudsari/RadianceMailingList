{"body": "Hi,\r\n\n\ncat is a Unix program, so it should be available under OSX and Linux, but not under Windows. Wikipedia says the command \u00a1\u00b0type\u00a1\u00b1 is an equivalent, but I haven\u00a1\u00aft tried it.\r\n\n\nAbout genprism, I think the argument before the vector should be -l (lower case \u00a1\u00aeL\u00a1\u00af) not -1 (the number one), I\u00a1\u00afm not sure which one you\u00a1\u00afve used, but may be worth checking.\r\n\n\nHope this helps.\r\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-May/009517.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "May 08, 2013 at 06:24PM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009516", "id": "radiance-general_009517"}
