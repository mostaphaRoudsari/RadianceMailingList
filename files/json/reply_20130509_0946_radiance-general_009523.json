{"body": "Hi Rob & Greg,\n\n\nActually I can get 'type' to work at the command line - outside the scene txt file - (I had the slashes the wrong way first).  I just can't seem to 'call' it when creating the oct file if it is a line in the scene txt file like the 'cat' program is shown from page 80 of the book \"!cat lib/table_1.rad\".  \n\n\nMy understanding from the 'cat' command in the tutorial is that it will append those files to the end of the octree - making my scene file less cumbersome.  (Please correct if I am not understanding that correctly!).   \n\n\nIf I replace the cat line above with \"type lib/table_1.rad\" and do oconv I get the error \"can't find executable for type\".  However if I go to command line & use \"type .\\lib\\table_1.rad >> scene1.all\" it will append the table_1 file to the end of scene1.all.\n\n\nWhich is fine with me since I'm incredibly happy when something works!! But I'm guessing having that simple line in the scene file, which makes the scene file smaller will come in very handy when I'm doing more complex projects.\n\n\nI wasn't able to get the 'program' command to work at either the command line or from within the txt file.\n\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nSandy Houck\u00a0\u00a0 LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-May/009523.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sandy Houck", "created_at": "May 09, 2013 at 09:46AM", "created_by": "Sandy_Houck", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009516", "id": "radiance-general_009523"}
