{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nI did a validation against the test cases in chapter 5 (test cases with\nanalytical references) of CIE 171:2006 about 2 years ago for an internal\nevaluation. The report that contains the results is all in german, however,\nthe numbers are \"international\" :-). So together with the results from\nchapter 4 (experimental test cases; I presented parts of them at the\nworkshop in 2008, the overall chapter 4 results are in my thesis) I should\nhave results for all test cases in the CIE report.\nThere should be some more proposals for test cases in chapter 6 of CIE 171,\nhowever, if I remember right they are somewhat unclear and not properly\nspecified.\n\n\nGreg, I will send you the report off-list, and if necessary can also take\nsome time to translate it...\n\n\nBest,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/5/9 Ji Zhang <hope.zh at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-May/009524.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Geisler-Moroder", "created_at": "May 10, 2013 at 12:15AM", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009514", "id": "radiance-general_009524"}
