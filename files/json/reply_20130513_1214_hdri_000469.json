{"body": "Hi Michael,\n > I'm trying to use hdrgen with a response curve created by photosphere.\n> For the image, I have calibration points measured with a luminance\n> meter, and when I make the hdr with photosphere, I get an accurate\n> luminance measurement, but hdrgen gives me a value that's consistently\n> ~10% higher. This is surprising as (I think) I'm using the same response\n> curve for each process.\n>\n> Here's my hdrgen command:\n> hdrgen -o ../01.hdr -r canon_5D.rsp -q 100 -f -g *.JPG\n>\n> Here's what I put into canon_5D.rsp:\n> 7.135383e-03 -3.556814e-02 2.441168e+00 -5.786777e+00 4.462320e+00\n> 4.543790e-03  3.363440e-02 1.917460e+00 -4.660105e+00 3.792747e+00\n> 3.956902e-03  3.244581e-02 1.827308e+00 -4.505138e+00 3.729707e+00\n\n\nThe first number in each line in an RSP file is the order of the \npolynome. Since it is missing in the RSP above (the one you hand-crafted \nfrom the Photosphere response), hdrgen deems it invalid and overwrites \nit with a new one. Try pre-pending a '6 ' to all three lines. hdrgen \nshould than be happy and use the RSP that you supplied, rather than \ngenerate one from scratch.\n\n\n> Here's canon_5D.rsp after hdrgen is run:\n> 3 1.49643 -0.979 0.486712 -0.00413976\n> 3 1.44009 -0.884479 0.448854 -0.00446749\n> 3 1.46366 -0.875187 0.414554 -0.00303108\n>\n> And here's the response curve from Photosphere:\n> \"Canon\"|\"Canon EOS 5D Mark\n> II\"|\"v.0\"|{7.135383e-03,-3.556814e-02,2.441168e+00,-5.786777e+00,4.462320e+00}|{4.543790e-03,3.363440e-02,1.917460e+00,-4.660105e+00,3.792747e+00}|{3.956902e-03,3.244581e-02,1.827308e+00,-4.505138e+00,3.729707e+00}\n>\n> Am I missing any hdrgen options, or perhaps making an error in my .rsp\n> file?
