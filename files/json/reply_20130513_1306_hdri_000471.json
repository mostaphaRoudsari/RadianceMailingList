{"body": "Hmm - pre-appending with a 6 didn't do the trick. \n\n\nIt seems like hdrgen really wants a 3rd order polynomial (no matter what I put into the .rsp, hdrgen overwrites it as such), and I'm not too sure how to translate the 5 values for the R, G, and B channels generated by Photosphere. \n\n\nAs another data point, the other camera curves in my Photosphere preferences file have a variety of values, either 4, 5 or 6 for each channel, depending on the camera. \n\n\nAs a work around, I can apply a multiplier to the .rsp that hdrgen makes, and that gets me pretty close. But I'd also love to know if there's a more direct way to translate the Photosphere data into hdrgen friendly data. \n\n\nThanks all - \n\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 13, 2013, at 12:14 PM, Axel Jacobs wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-May/000471.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Martinez", "created_at": "May 13, 2013 at 01:06PM", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez", "parent_id": "hdri_000468", "id": "hdri_000471"}
