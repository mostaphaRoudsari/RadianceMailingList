{"body": "Right, so we are on the right track--hdrgen no longer rejects the RSP.\n\n\nNext question is: how good is the RSP? Try plotting it. If it is smooth \nand monotonic, without any kinks in it, it's a good one. Otherwise, try \ngenerating it from a different sequence. The 5D is used a lot on WebHDR:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/cameras/Canon__Canon_EOS_5D.shtml\nHow does your RSP compare with the averaged one? Note that there is no \nquality control, and even 'wonky' ones make it into the average.\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 05/13/2013 09:21 PM, Michael Martinez wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-May/000473.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 13, 2013 at 01:31PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000468", "id": "hdri_000473"}
