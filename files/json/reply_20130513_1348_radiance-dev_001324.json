{"body": "Ok, I tried what you told me...\n\n\nAdded the mkSchedule program... which is exactly a copy of dctimestep (just\nchanged the name).\n\n\nPROGS = findglare glarendx rpiece rad ranimate ranimove vwright getinfo \\\nvwrays xglaresrc rsensor dctimestep *mkSchedule* rttree_reduce\n\n\n*mkSchedule: mkSchedule.o*\n$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o *mkSchedule* *mkSchedule*.o -lrtrad $(MLIB)\n\n\n*mkSchedule*.o: ../common/standard.h \\\n../common/rtmisc.h ../common/rtio.h \\\n../common/rtmath.h ../common/mat4.h ../common/fvect.h \\\n../common/rterror.h ../common/platform.h ../common/paths.h \\\n../common/color.h ../common/bsdf.h ../common/bsdf_m.h ../common/resolu.h\n\n\nI compiled it, and it ended in \"there were some errors\". Both dctimestep\nand mkSchedule have the same errors, but I cannot find my compiled\nmkSchedule anywhere... it seems to disappear, and I cannont call it. Any\nideas for that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother question for you guys. My idea is to call a Lua function from\ninside the code. So, I have tried simple things (without the Radiance\nlibraries), and I have to compile writing:\n\n\ngcc -llua  -o mkSchedule mkSchedule.c\n\n\nAnd adding some libraries adding:\n\n\n#include \"/usr/local/include/lua.h\"\n#include \"/usr/local/include/luaconf.h\"\n#include \"/usr/local/include/lualib.h\"\n#include \"/usr/local/include/lauxlib.h\"\n\n\nWill these things work on the procedure you told me? Do I have to make some\nother changes? I think I have to add all those \"included\" libraries in\nthe mkSchedule.o:\nblah blah blah? Where do I add the -llua I have been using?\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/5/13 Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-May/001324.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "May 13, 2013 at 01:48PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001319", "id": "radiance-dev_001324"}
