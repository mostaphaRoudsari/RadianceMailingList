{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nI am not entirely sure that I remember this correctly, but I once looked at these\ncamera curves in photosphere for the purpose of plotting them. I seem to recall\nthat the coefficients are reversed relative to how you might expect them.\n\n\nIt may be worth trying to reverse the order of the coefficients, so for the first of\nthe three lines this would be:\n\n\n4 4.462320e+00 -5.786777e+00 2.441168e+00 -3.556814e-02 7.135383e-03\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nCheers,\nErik\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 13, 2013, at 10:31 PM, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-May/000478.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Erik Reinhard", "created_at": "May 13, 2013 at 02:24PM", "created_by": "Erik_Reinhard", "parent_id": "hdri_000468", "id": "hdri_000478"}
