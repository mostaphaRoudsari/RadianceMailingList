{"body": "Sorry to bring this topic back to life... but I am working with this kind\nof stuff, but as usual, I prefer to make some sketches of the algorithms\nfirst on Scilab or Matlab.\n\n\nAnyways, my question is: I know how to load the BSDF matrix without much\ntrouble. However, I do not understand how the matrix written in the xml\nfile is converted in a Color Matrix.\nAre they just grey matrices? is there any easy calculation?\n\n\nIf it is complicated just let me know, and I will make some trivial tests\non the algorithm before going into C.\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/4/22 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-May/001327.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "May 13, 2013 at 02:25PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001317", "id": "radiance-dev_001327"}
