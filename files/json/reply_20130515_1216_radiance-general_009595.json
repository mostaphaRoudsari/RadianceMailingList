{"body": "Hi-\n\n\nI am giving a presentation about \"what radiance is\" to a non-technical\naudience in a few days from now, and it came to my attention while making\nthe presentation...I don't know how Radiance is supported!\n\n\nDoes anyone have a standard sound byte about how Radiance is maintained and\nfunded?  Is it via donation only, or through NREL or other?\n\n\nThanks.  I hope I haven't opened up a huge can of worms.  But I am curious\nfor my own professional reasons as well.\n\n\nThanks,\nChien\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-May/009595.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chien Si Harriman", "created_at": "May 15, 2013 at 12:16PM", "created_by": "Chien_Si_Harriman", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_009595"}
