{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nThis is a nice idea, and certainly convenient if you're starting from an EPW file (which I understand is common).  There are translators from EPW to WEA, and it's our intention to release one of these as part of the standard package this summer.\n\n\nWe do have this issue of multiple versions of the Perez sky simulation running around, and keeping those consistent and bug-free.  Jan Wienold's group refit Jean-Jacques Delaunay's original gendaylit code with Wendelin Sprenger, updating it and fixing numerous bugs in a major code cleanup.  In ignorance of these developments, I took Ian Ashdown's implementation of the Perez sky model and created gendaymtx.  Ideally, these two programs would be based on a common library that implements the Perez sky.  Now, we have two different implementations we've had to compare to make sure the results are the same.  I expect there are some corner cases where limits are tested a little differently, producing different outputs.\n\n\nI don't think either LBNL or ISE have time to unify these two programs at the moment.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009537.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 05, 2013 at 09:24AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009536", "id": "radiance-general_009537"}
