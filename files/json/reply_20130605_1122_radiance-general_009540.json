{"body": "Hi Mike,\n\n\nthis looks strange - indeed! The first glare source has an error in the \nx-y location (nan). There was on older version of evalglare (1.00-1.02), \nwhich had some problems when one pixel of a glare source was located \ndirectly at the border. but this is fixed for the current version.\nWhat version of evalglare (type evalglare -v) are you using and what \nfish-eye type is used for the image?\nCan you send me such an hdr (not to the group, directly to my email \nadress jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de).\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009540.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "June 05, 2013 at 11:22AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009538", "id": "radiance-general_009540"}
