{"body": "Hi Greg and All,\n\n\nIn brief follow-up to this, I want to sanity check myself. For the 3 \nphase method:\n\n\n  * vmx - for rcontrib klems_int.cal needs the normal from the glazing\n    surface pointing to the interior, eg <0,1,0> for a south facing window\n  * dmx - for genklemsamp the view direction is the normal direction\n    pointing outside, the opposite of what is used for vmx, eg <0,-1,0>\n    for a south facing window\n\n\nLastly, as long as a glazing surface is not facing straight up, that is \na skylight parallel to the ground plane, then then an up direction of \n<0,0,1> can be used.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009541.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "June 05, 2013 at 12:50PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009447", "id": "radiance-general_009541"}
