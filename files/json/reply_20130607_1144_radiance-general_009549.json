{"body": "Hi Jack,\n\n\nI think the easiest method would be to extract the hours you want to accumulate from your WEA file, send them through gendaymtx and dctimestep like so:\n\n\n\tgendaymtx -of subyear.wea > subyear1.smx\n\tdctimestep -if -n 720 -o win1w_%03d.hdr winterior1w.vmx blinds30.xml westelev.dmx subyear1.smx\n\tpcomb win1w_*.hdr > win1w_sum.hdr\n\trm win1w_*.hdr\n\n\nThis will generate 720 images corresponding to a month's worth of hourly inputs from window #1 on the west elevation.  The above steps (except the first) will have to be repeated for your different windows.  If you do a year at a time, you'll have to sum all these images together in batches, since pcomb only handles up to 1024 images at a time (so long as you don't run into system limits first).\n\n\nI hope this addresses your question.  To be honest, I've never done anything like this and I'm not entirely sure I got it right.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009549.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 07, 2013 at 11:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009545", "id": "radiance-general_009549"}
