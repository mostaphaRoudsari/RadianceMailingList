{"body": "Actually, I just realized that you could shortcut this quite a bit by summing together your time steps out of gendaymtx.  You should be able to run:\n\n\ngendaymtx -od jan.wea | total -id3 -720 > jan.sky\ndctimestep  winterior1w.vmx blinds30.xml westelev.dmx jan.sky > win1w_jan.hdr\n\n\nAgain, you'll need to run dctimestep for each of your windows and sum the results, but it should be a whole lot quicker this way.  If you want to sum up a whole year, just change the -720 option on total to -8160 (or whatever).\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009550.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 07, 2013 at 11:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009545", "id": "radiance-general_009550"}
