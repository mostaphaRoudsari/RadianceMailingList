{"body": "Oh, yeah, and the number used in total needs to match the number of days in the month, so I kind of blew it assuming January has 30 days in my example!  (Should have been \"total -id3 -744\".)  This works because gendaymtx outputs time steps as columns in the matrix (inside sort). The final output will contain 3 ASCII triplets for each patch, so you don't need to change anything for different -m options to gendaymtx.  You just need to make sure your matrix dimensions are expecting the right number of patches.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009552.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 07, 2013 at 04:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009545", "id": "radiance-general_009552"}
