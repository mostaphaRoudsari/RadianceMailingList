{"body": "Hi Nassif,\n\n\nRadiance includes a script called \"vinfo\" that allows you to edit the information header of an image.  I'm not sure what view parameters evalglare needs from the header, but at minimum, you should include the -vh and -vv parameters in a \"VIEW= -vtv -vh [deg] -vh [deg]\" specification.  Photosphere sometimes adds such a line if it can figure out the camera lens settings from the Exif header.\n\n\nNo need to upgrade your Mac OS version if you're having issues with evalglare.  I don't think that has anything to do with it.  More likely, you don't have the latest version of it.  Maybe Jan can chime in with some advice.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009561.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 20, 2013 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009555", "id": "radiance-general_009561"}
