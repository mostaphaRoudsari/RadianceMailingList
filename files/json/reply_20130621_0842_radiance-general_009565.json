{"body": "Thanks for the answers Lars!\n\n\nI am thinking on \"one-zone\" simple scenes, without furniture. I was\nchecking out Lightsolve\n<http://www.phil-seaton.com/#/lightsolve>algorithms, and for them,\nthis approach seem to be working well. I am\nthinking on something similar, but not the same.\n\n\nAlso, a friend of mine did some work on lighting simulations, and claimed\nthat Radiosity was actually much faster than Radiance for those\ncalculations.\n\n\nAnyway, lets see what others can say about this... I was aware of the\nhybrid-stochastic-deterministic capabilities of Radiance, but I am not sure\nwhat that exactly means, so I cannot say if this would be faster or not.\n\n\nTHANKS!\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n2013/6/21 Lars O.
