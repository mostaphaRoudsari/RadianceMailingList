{"body": "As I've noted when asked this question in the past, radiosity is faster for simple spaces with many interior reflections.  Complex spaces quickly become expensive to compute, and the meshing of them can be a nightmare.\n\n\nIf you need to compute the illumination of an empty box, then anything is going to be fast.  If it's really, really important for you to compute empty boxes in a second or two, then radiosity is the way to go.  If you can wait 30 seconds, Radiance works, too.\n\n\nIf you have a complex building to render with trees and sky, have fun doing it with radiosity!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009566.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 21, 2013 at 09:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009554", "id": "radiance-general_009566"}
