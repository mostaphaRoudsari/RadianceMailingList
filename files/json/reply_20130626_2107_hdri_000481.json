{"body": "Hi Brent,\n\n\nFirst off, how do you use your illuminance meter to calibrate your Photosphere image?  Since Photosphere needs a *luminance* value to calibrate from, you'll need to convert from illuminance to luminance.  For this to work, you need a diffuse, gray surface of known reflectance, such as an 18% gray card.  Measuring the illuminance at the gray card (and in the same orientation as the gray card), you can then compute luminance from:\n\n\n\tLuminance = Illuminance * 0.18 / 3.1416\n\n\nThis of course assumes that the illumination doesn't change between the time you measure it and the time you capture the scene.\n\n\nOnce you are doing this correctly, you can apply a scaling factor equal to the average ratio in the image from Photosphere and the identical scene capture from canoncap.  In fact, you don't really need Photosphere at that point.  You just need the ratio of your actual luminance to that reported by canoncap.\n\n\nOnce you have this ratio, you can use the pcomb program to adjust the exposure like so:\n\n\n\tpcomb -o -s [ratio] input.hdr > output.hdr\n\n\nThere are other, quicker and more clever ways to do it using getinfo and sed, but the above is the simplest.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-June/000481.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 26, 2013 at 09:07PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000480", "id": "hdri_000481"}
