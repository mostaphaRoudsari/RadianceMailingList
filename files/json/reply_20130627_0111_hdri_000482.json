{"body": "Hi Brent,\n\n\nHDR glare analysis is VERY sensitiv to the accuracy with which the\nhighlights in a scene are captured. You MUST make sure the dynamic\nrange of your sequence is sufficient. WebHDRtools come with a program\ncalled jpgheatmap, which is a Perl script. When you run it against\nyour sequence, you should not have any red dots on the heatmap. Blue\nones are all right.\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/hdr/webhdrtools/index.shtml\nYou can try it on-line:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/roll-your-own.shtml\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nOn 27 June 2013 05:07, Gregory J.
