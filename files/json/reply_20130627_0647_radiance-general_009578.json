{"body": "Good morning.\n\n\nsome years ago I built a very practical helidon where the lamps supporting\narch is vertical and translates along the ceiling,\nbut the table can be shifted.\n\n\nThe arch is 3.0 m diameter, made of aluminum profiles, mounted within a\nrigid U upside down. The translation happens by cables and fixed and\nmovable wheels (I used thin plastic pulleys and clothe lines). It moves\nsuch that when the table is on the horizontal, the line connectiong the 6AM\nposition (as high as the table) to the center of the table is in an angle\nof 23\u00b025' to the rotation axis.\n\n\nA special switch with 13 positions and off was installed.\nI made several drawings and concluded that such a geometry may reproduce\nsolar angles with enough precision, even at high latitudes.\n\n\nI built it inside a dark room because that time (12 years ago) we needed\ncontrast for our film cameras.\n\n\nEverything costed me less than US$ 500.\n\n\nA picture is attached. I cannot find plans any more.\n\n\nAlo\u00edsio Leoni Schmid\nUFPR - Curitiba - Brazil\nvisit: http://www.elecs2013.ufpr.br\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/6/27 Christoph Reinhart <tito_ at mit.edu>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009578.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alo\u00edsio Schmid", "created_at": "June 27, 2013 at 06:47AM", "created_by": "Alo\u00edsio_Schmid", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009576", "id": "radiance-general_009578"}
