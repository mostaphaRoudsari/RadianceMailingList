{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nI changed InstallRules\\CMakeLists.txt to wrap the Qt lib calls in double quotes and sent to Greg, so that change will filter up to HEAD at some point. Also know that a more direct fix for this is to explicitly point to the qmake executable in cmake, with the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable. I use this myself, because my Qt install is a little funky and is not exposed at the system level. Lemmeknow if you want more info on this. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-June/001351.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 27, 2013 at 01:35PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001348", "id": "radiance-dev_001351"}
