There is no \"time\"\ncommand in the native Windows environment, and I don't yet know how to use\nsimilar commands in the Windows Power Shell.  Looking hopeful, though of\ncourse I have not yet seen the output.\n\n\nMark Stock, if you're reading, would you like my cross-platform changes to\nthe .rad files?  Windows, of course, does not have a \"cat\" command, which\nmeans that \"!cat\" has to be replaced with \"!xform\".\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-June/001353.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
