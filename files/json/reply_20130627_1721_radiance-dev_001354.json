{"body": "Side note on the use of \"!cat\"  I often see things like this:\n\n\n!cat input1.rad input2.rad | xform -ry 20\n\n\nWhich is completely silly.  Why not just use:\n\n\n!xform -ry 20 input1.rad input2.rad\n\n\nEven if you are going to a program that expects input on stdin, you can redirect it instead:\n\n\n!fussy_program < input | second_program etc...\n\n\nI've seen almost no one use cat for a reason in a Radiance file.  (No offense Mark, as I haven't even looked at yours!)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-June/001354.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 27, 2013 at 05:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001352", "id": "radiance-dev_001354"}
