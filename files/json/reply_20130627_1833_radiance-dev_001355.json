{"body": "I am pleased to be able to say that, in fact, I ran a successful simulation.\n My hasty hack compilations of libtiff 3.9.7 (the last version 3 libtiff)\nand zlib 1.2.8 also worked, which was nice to see.\n\n\nPerformance, well, not so good.  It took 4219.9 wall clock seconds on a\nfairly capable Xeon, which is 1.5-2x slower than I expect based on the\nbenchmark table.  I suspect some tweaking of compilation options would\nconsiderably improve the performance, even with the relatively blah\nMicrosoft VC10 compiler.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-June/001355.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
