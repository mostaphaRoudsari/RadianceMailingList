{"body": "I am silly. This vestigial code is still in OpenStudio, for \"Radiance Classic\" calcs with a continuous sky:\n\n\ncatCommand = \"cat\"\nif /mswin/.match(RUBY_PLATFORM) or /mingw/.match(RUBY_PLATFORM)\n catCommand = \"type\"\nend\n\n\nsystem(\"#{catCommand} ./numeric/#{space_name}.map | rtrace #{rtrace_args} \u2026\")\n\n\nIn this case, this really seemed to be the most direct way in. In any event, !type would be the true one-for-one replacement for !cat when porting Mark's scene to windoze. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 27, 2013, at 6:21 PM, Gregory J.
