{"body": "I have benchmarked Relux with the Radiance (or 'Raytracer', as they call \nit now) engine under Windows. This was done with Process Monitor, which \nis free download from the M$ site:\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx\n\n\nIt's not quite the same as the UNIX 'time' command, but saves you \nsitting there with the old stop watch.\n\n\nWhat you do is you launch PM and set up a filter for 'rpict', and/or \nanything else you wish to benchmark. Now run the benchmark. PM will \ncapture the start and end time of this process. You can export the \nresult to a text file. You still need to work out the runtime:\nruntime = end - start.\n\n\nIt's not terribly elegant, but does work.\n\n\nPM tends to be a little temperamental. I never got it to work on certain \nmachines. It also might crash unexpectedly.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-June/001362.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 29, 2013 at 08:47AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001352", "id": "radiance-dev_001362"}
