{"body": "PhD Studentship: Applicability of climate-based daylight modelling - research into practice\n\n\nLoughborough University -School of Civil and Building Engineering\n\n\nhttp://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV427/phd-studentship/\n\n\nThe position\n\n\n\n\nApplications are invited for a PhD Studentship starting in October 2013 to undertake research in climate-based daylight modelling and its application to solve traditional, novel and emerging problems in the daylighting design of buildings at all scales from individual spaces to urban settings. The work will be supervised by Prof. John Mardaljevic (Loughborough University) and Dr. Francesco Anselmo (Arup, London).\n\n\nTo be of practical use in industry, the disparate strands of CBDM research need to be synthesised to create a robust and authoritative modelling framework - one that has well defined stages, methodologies, quality assurance procedures, etc. CBDM has been applied to a wide range of real-world projects, e.g., daylighting for museums. But it is still an unknown methodology for most practitioners.\n\n\nCBDM is constantly evolving, so one of the challenges will be to capture this 'moving target' and give shape and coherence to the future development of CBDM. In addition to working closely with industry, the project is aligned with the aims of two International Commission for Illumination (CIE) Technical Committees on CBDM and Daylighting. Thus the project will have significant impact on the future use and development of CBDM in both research and practice.\n\n\nThe candidate will work in close collaboration with Arup, and be expected to undertake visits/internships at Arup offices in London lasting a minimum of approximately three months over the duration of the project.\n\n\n\n\nFunding and eligibility\n\n\n\n\nThe studentship is open to graduates from numerate disciplines who are interested in daylight simulation. The minimum entry qualification is a 2.1 Honours degree or equivalent. A lower qualification is acceptable if supplemented with an appropriate postgraduate (MSc) qualification and relevant experience.\n\n\nThe studentship, funded by an EPSRC CASE award, is for 3.5 years and covers fees and a tax-exempt stipend of \u00a313,726 (with additional top-up of approximately \u00a31,000 per year) for the 2013/2014 academic year with cost of living adjustments in years 2 and 3. Tuition fees will be paid at the UK/EU rate.\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\n\n\nApplications can be made on-line at:\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/apply/\n\n\nApplicants are encouraged to make contact with the supervisor to discuss their interest in the subject area.\n\n\nFor an informal discussion on the subject area, please contact the supervisor Prof. John Mardaljevic on +44 1509 222630 or j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk> and Dr. Francesco Anselmo byemailfrancesco.anselmo at arup.com<mailto:emailfrancesco.anselmo at arup.com>.\n\n\nFor enquiries about the application process, please contact Ms Helen Newbold, h.newbold at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:h.newbold at lboro.ac.uk>.\n\n\nClosing date for applications: Applications will be accepted until 20th August 2013, or until the post is filled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/staff/profile/367.html\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009614.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "July 08, 2013 at 03:10PM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009586", "id": "radiance-general_009614"}
