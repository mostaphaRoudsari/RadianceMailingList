{"body": "Hi Rob, hi all,\n\n\nI just tried the latest version of the NREL Windows binaries and got an\nerror that\nalready came up a year ago (that's why I'm responding to this thread).\nAgain it\nsays something about problems with a side-by-side configuration. The last\ntime it\nwas due to a debug-build instead of a release version - maybe it's the same\nissue\nagain??\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012/5/3 Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-July/001366.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Geisler-Moroder", "created_at": "July 09, 2013 at 10:46AM", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001222", "id": "radiance-dev_001366"}
