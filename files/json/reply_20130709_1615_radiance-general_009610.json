{"body": "Chien,\nI see that this post is over a month old, apparently it was trapped in the\nmailing list jail.\n\n\nRadiance is developed primarily by Greg Ward, via a part-time contract with\nLBNL.   In good years LBNL receives meager funding for Radiance from the US\nDepartment of Energy and/or California Energy Commission.  In bad years\nGreg has provided support without recieving anything in return.  There have\nalso been some people that have paid Greg directly to develop new features.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe we should add a full list those who have provided funds at\nradiance-online.org.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, May 15, 2013 at 12:16 PM, Chien Si Harriman <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 09, 2013 at 04:15PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000244", "id": "radiance-general_009610"}
