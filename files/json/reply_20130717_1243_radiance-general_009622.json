{"body": "I am not sure if the 3phase method is the best in this case, since the\naccepted basis (145 Klems' division) is not very good for specular\nfenestration systems (such as glazings).\n\n\nMaybe a possible solution would be to make separate DC analysis for the\ndifferent fenestration groups (i.e. make all glazings black, except the one\nto be analyzed) and somehow scale them by transmissivity...?? I mean:\n\n\nFor each glazing group:\n     - Make every other glazing black, and this glazing with 100%\ntransmittance\n     - Calculate DC.\nend\n\n\nthen, the lighting levels would be\n\n\nLux= a1*DC1+a2*DC2+a3*DC3...\n\n\nDoes this make any sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/7/15 Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009622.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "July 17, 2013 at 12:43PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009617", "id": "radiance-general_009622"}
