{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nRadzilla as it is publicly available has not seen much updates for years now, so I would not really build up new projects on it. The pmap development is going on, Jan had presented the 4.x-pmap extension on the workshop in Copenhagen. It is not available at the moment, so we have to wait until he can make any new announcements, but I would for sure prefer waiting for the new pmap to be polished and released instead of tweaking the old code.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009624.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
