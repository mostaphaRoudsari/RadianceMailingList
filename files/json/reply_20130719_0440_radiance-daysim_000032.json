{"body": "Hi Silvia,\n\n\nDaysim should use the Perez-sky luminous efficacy model in order to  \ndetermine that, which will change based on the hourly data in the weather  \nfile.\n\n\nIn general, Daysim's 50W/m2 is measured as a direct normal irradiance, so  \nit assumes the sensor is always oriented towards the sun. In this case,  \nthe control threshold will not relate directly to horizontal workplane  \nilluminance.\n\n\nIf you are interested in controlling shading systems based on a specific  \nilluminance threshold, the automated thermal control method in Daysim can  \nachieve that. For more information see the following link,  \nhttp://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-shading-control-modes\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 17 Jul 2013 09:39:51 -0400, Cammarano Silvia  \n<silvia.cammarano at polito.it> wrote:\n\n\n> Hi all,\n>\n> I was wondering which could be the best way to convert the direct solar\n> irradiance value of 50W/m2 on the workplane (used as a criteria to\n> automatically pull down the blinds in Daysim) to an illuminance value.
