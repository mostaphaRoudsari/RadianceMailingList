{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nThank you so much for your informative email.\n\n\nI hope the material provider has already the measurements done so I can use\ntheir measurements for the study. I'm not sure though.\n\n\nI have used .xml files generated by Window for a study before however in\nthat case the surfaces were planar so I generated the file for the glazing\nconstruction and applied it to a single surface. In this case though I have\nnon-planar surfaces with a different pattern on top of each one which makes\nit a different case.\n\n\nAlso thank you for the link to the paper. I looked at it when you sent it\nout first and I found it really useful. It is a really comprehensive\nreview. Thank you so much for sharing.\n\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009631.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "July 20, 2013 at 11:24AM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009630", "id": "radiance-general_009631"}
