Picking the proper\nmaterials for fancy glazing and translucent shading has alway been a\nbit of a black art. Your comparison shows very clearly what the\ndifferent materials can and cannot do. I was particularly struck by\nthe fact that BSDF is currently not particularly well suited for\nmodelling the view out that one gets with  translucent materials for\nwhich trans is not quite good enough. I have not done much work with\nBSDFs, but always lived under the impression that a measured BSDF is\nthe ultimate in accuracy for both light transmission (daylighting) and\nview out (shading).\n\n\nThanks for making this paper available\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009632.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 22, 2013 at 02:08AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009619", "id": "radiance-general_009632"}
