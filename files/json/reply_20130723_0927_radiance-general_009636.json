{"body": "Hi Don,\nTwo things:\n1 - You should use the same material for the sky and ground so that the\nground reflected component is included in patch 0. I typically use a single\n360 degree source to encompass by sky and ground.\n2 - Your zip file didn't include test_Model1.opt, used by the rcontrib\ncommand, but make sure that -ab is 2 or greater to\nget inter-reflected contribution from the sky on a ceiling illuminance\nsensor (if -ab isn't sepcified in the opt file rcontrib defaults to -ab 1).\n\n\nLet me know if these two changes don't give better results and I'll\ninvestigate further.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 23, 2013 at 09:27AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009635", "id": "radiance-general_009636"}
