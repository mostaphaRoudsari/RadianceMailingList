{"body": "If I understand your question correctly, I guess I would do the rest on a\nspreadsheet or on a script.\n\n\nFor a spreadsheet, I would do:\n\n\nrlam 'Results of venetian blind' 'Results of tinted' 'results of untinted'\n> Results.txt\n\n\nrlam '!dctimestep -n 8760 results/photocells_windowglow_W.vmx\nxml/venetain80.xml results/windows.dmx Milwaukee.smx' '!dctimestep -n 8760\nresults/photocells_windowglow_C.vmx xml/tinted.xml results/clerestories.dmx\nMilwaukee.smx' '!dctimestep -n 8760 results/photocells_windowglow_C.vmx\nxml/untinted.xml results/clerestories.dmx Milwaukee.smx' >\nresults/Results.txt\n\n\nAnd, you should get, for each timestep, the parameter you are using for\ncontrolling the tint on your clerestories, and add that as an extra column.\n\n\nThen, on excel it is possible to do:\n\n\n|             A             |            B           |              C\n     |                D            |          E           |\n|  Venetian Results  |  Tinted Results  |  Untinted Results  |  Control\nParameter  |  Final Results  |\n\n\nand put a formula to final result saying that, if(Control > theshold;\nVenetian+Tinted;Venetian+Untinted).\n\n\nHope it helps... I am working on something to do this kind of things on a\nsingle program, but it is not ready yet.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n2013/7/23 Leyla Sanati <leylasanati at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009638.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "July 23, 2013 at 01:01PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009637", "id": "radiance-general_009638"}
