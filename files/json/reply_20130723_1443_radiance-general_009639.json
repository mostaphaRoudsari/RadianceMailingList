{"body": "Hi Don,\n\n\n> Two things:\n> 1 - You should use the same material for the sky and ground so that the\n> ground reflected component is included in patch 0.

Put this in your white_sky.sky:\nvoid glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4  1 1 1  0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4  0 0 1  360\n\n\n> 2 - Your zip file didn't include test_Model1.opt, used by the rcontrib\n> command, but make sure that -ab is 2 or greater to\n> get inter-reflected contribution from the sky on a ceiling illuminance\n> sensor (if -ab isn't sepcified in the opt file rcontrib defaults to -ab 1).\n\n\n@Andy\nThe file names are all messed up by Windows. It's test_Model2.opt that \nyou're looking for. -ab is actually set to 5.\n\n\n@Don,\nyou're overwriting rcontrib's default for -lr:\n$ rcontrib -defaults\n...\n-lr -10     # limit reflection (Russian roulette)\n...\n\n\nYour setting it to -lr 8\nNote the difference between positive and negative integers. I have to \nadmit that this is one of the more obscure options that I don't tend to \ntemper with. See man rpict. I ran your model with the -lr 8 removed from \nthe opt file. Completely different outcome.\n\n\nAlso, your -ad is not very high. Unless you nudge it up a lot, there is \nno point in using 4 Reinhart subdivisions of the Tregenza patches. An \n-ad of 4096 is decent for a normal rtrace daylight simulation. For \nrcontrib, it should be much higher.\n\n\nI don't know how you post-process the irradiance vector, since this \nscript(?) is not included in the Zip file. However, you're calling \nrcontrib with the -V+ option. This gives you the *absolute* contribution \nfrom the sky patches, ie the irradiance at the sensor points.\n\n\nOne tends to use -V- here to get the daylight coefficients, ie the \n*relative* contribution from the sky patches. Once they have been \ncalculated, the DC are multiplied with the sky vector to get actual \nirradiance values.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009639.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 23, 2013 at 02:43PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009635", "id": "radiance-general_009639"}
