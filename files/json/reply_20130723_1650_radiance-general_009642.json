{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\n> rcontrib.bat says '@TEST_M~1.OPT'  and this references 'test_Model2.opt' ?\n>   The caps and ~ aside, I don't know how a 1 becomes a 2.

Weird, I agree.\n\n\nUPPER/lower case is pretty arbitrary under Windows, although you can't \ncreate 'test.txt' if 'Test.TXT' or 'TEST.txt' already exist.\n\n\nWhat do you make of the -lr option? This is a little too obscure for me...\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009642.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 23, 2013 at 04:50PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009635", "id": "radiance-general_009642"}
