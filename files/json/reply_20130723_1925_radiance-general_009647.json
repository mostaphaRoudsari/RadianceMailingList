{"body": "Oh, oops!  Guess that is the way it works, not the other way around.  If you output into a single file as you were doing, the first 8760*3 values are the first sensor, the next 8760*3 are the next sensor, and so on.  A simple sed script should work for separating them, and you can automate generating the sed script using rcalc.  If you have 20 sensor, you would use:\n\n\n% cnt 20 | rcalc -e 'a=8761*$1+2;b=8761*($1+1)' -o '${a},${b}w sensor${recno}.txt' > sedscr.txt\n% [dctimestep command] | tr \\\\t \\\\n | sed -n -f sedscr.txt\n\n\nFor more or fewer sensors, just change the '20' in the first line.  I haven't tried this, but it should work -- assuming you have tr and sed, that is...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009647.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 23, 2013 at 07:25PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009637", "id": "radiance-general_009647"}
