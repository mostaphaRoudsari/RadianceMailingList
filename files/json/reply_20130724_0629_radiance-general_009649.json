{"body": "Hi Greg, Leyla,\n\n\n> Oh, oops!  Guess that is the way it works, not the other way around.  If you output into a single file as you were doing, the first 8760*3 values are the first sensor, the next 8760*3 are the next sensor, and so on.  A simple sed script should work for separating them, and you can automate generating the sed script using rcalc.  If you have 20 sensor, you would use:\n>\n> % cnt 20 | rcalc -e 'a=8761*$1+2;b=8761*($1+1)' -o '${a},${b}w sensor${recno}.txt' > sedscr.txt\n> % [dctimestep command] | tr \\\\t \\\\n | sed -n -f sedscr.txt\n\n\nI've just tried this out. The rcalc bit only works when a,b are up to\nsix digits long, which is 114 sensor points. rcalc goes into\nexponential notation beyond this.\nIf you have more than 114 sensors, use this awk replacement instead:\n\n\ncnt 115 | awk '{a=8761*$1+2; b=8761*($1+1); print a\",\"b\"w\nsensor\"NR\".txt\"}' > sedscr.txt\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009649.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "July 24, 2013 at 06:29AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009637", "id": "radiance-general_009649"}
