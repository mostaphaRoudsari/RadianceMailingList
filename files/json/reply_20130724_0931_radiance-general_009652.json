{"body": "I don't have a sample project you can run, but I can offer some advice:\n\n\nA standard daylight coefficient run with a trans material (or BSDF) is\nfinicky because the the sky is sampled stochastically without regard to the\nposition of the sun.  If your sampling density is low or you use a high\nresolution sky descretization scheme you might not fully sample the sky,\nmissing patches.  If the sun happens to be in a missed patch your result\nwill under estimate the illuminance.\n\n\nI'd recommend using high -ad parameter, low -lw parameter and use the\ntregenza sky (not reinhart).  Or better yet, use the 3-phase method.\n\n\nI'd recommend running a few static sky conditions with rtrace to compare\nwith your DDS results.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009652.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 24, 2013 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009648", "id": "radiance-general_009652"}
