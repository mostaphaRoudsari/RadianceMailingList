{"body": "Hey,\n\n\nDo we know who is presenting? I am probably not going to be able to stay\nthe second day of the conference (I'll be there the 12th and 13th), so\ncould you schedule me for the 13th to present?\n\n\nAlstan told me that he received a free admission to the last Radiance\nconference when he gave a pre-workshop session. Since the workshop is free\nthis year, will the 4/5 of us presenting on the 12th get any compensation,\nlike the dinner?\n\n\nThanks,\nKera\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jul 24, 2013 at 5:29 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009656.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kera Lagios", "created_at": "July 24, 2013 at 03:31PM", "created_by": "Kera_Lagios", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009655", "id": "radiance-general_009656"}
