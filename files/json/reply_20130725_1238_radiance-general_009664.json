{"body": "So the problem with the code was $ENV{'TMP'} returns a HASH and Windows\ncouldn't create the temp folder. I assigned \"c:\\temp\" as the temporary\nfolder so the code creates the temp folder however it cannot execute the\nxform command later.\n\n\nsystem \"xform -m void @ARGV | oconv - > $td/surf.oct\";\n\n\nI tested it on Windows7 and Windows8 and I assume it is a permission issue\nsince if I type the same command in the command line, it just works fine\nand creates surf.oct in the folder (attached!).\n\n\nI think if I can find a way to run the commands in an elevated mode from\nthe Perl script, and modify all (system \"do something\") lines, then the\nscript should work just fine in Windows.\n\n\nMostapha\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 25, 2013 at 1:35 PM, Mostapha Sadeghipour <sadeghipour at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009664.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "July 25, 2013 at 12:38PM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009658", "id": "radiance-general_009664"}
