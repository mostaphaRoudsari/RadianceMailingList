{"body": "Dear JH,\n\n\nat the moment, every feedback for errors of gendaylit is especially \nappreciated. \nWe are currently adding some new features to gendaylit especially to avoid \nerrors for surise/sunset. All new features of gendaylit will be presented \nalso during the radiance workshop and we hope to have the new release 2.2 \nready before the RADIANCE workshop takes place. \nHowever, the error you have mentioned might be a different one. We are \njust working on some bugs of the -L option. Are you using this option? \nPlease specify the precise command that leads to the error, including the \nprecise error message and your version of gendaylit (just type gendaylit \nin your terminal). \n\n\nWendelin\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________\nMag.rer.nat.
