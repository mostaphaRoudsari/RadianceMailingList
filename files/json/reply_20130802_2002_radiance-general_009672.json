{"body": "Hi Leyla,\n\n\nActually it's slightly different, according to the gendaymtx man page:\n\n\n\"Gendaymtx  takes a weather tape as input and produces a matrix of sky patch values using the Perez all-weather\n       model.  The weather tape is assumed to be in the simple ASCII format understood by DAYSIM,  which  contains  a\n       short  header  with  the  site parameters followed by the month, day, standard time, direct normal and diffuse\n       horizontal irradiance values, one time step per line.\"\n\n\nBTW, we are working on getting a version of epw2wea into the Radiance source tree so that future Radiance installers will include this utility in a regular Radiance install. I kinda thought that with gendaymtx being part of Radiance now, a utility to convert standard EnergyPlus weather files into the Daysim format was pretty much a dependency now, and luckily Christoph Reinhart agrees. NREL has a version of epw2wea that is compiling on all platforms and we hope to get it integrated into the Radiance source soon. \n\n\nAlso, we are currently testing our integration of gendaymtx into OpenStudio; we are now seeing annual climate based daylight simulation execution times in a matter of minutes (single phase)! We hope to have this capability integrated into the release in time for the Radiance Workshop. Stay tuned...\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Aug 2, 2013, at 1:45 PM, Leyla Sanati <leylasanati at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009672.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 02, 2013 at 08:02PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009671", "id": "radiance-general_009672"}
