{"body": "Dear List, I am not sure this is directly applied to Radiance, but for\nlighting it definitively is.\n\n\nI was checking out some stuff, and started wondering why are we not using\nthe Lighting information\u2026 I am reading\nTHIS<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdatainformation.pdf>,\nand it says \"Illuminance (Global Horizontal, Direct Normal, Diffuse\nHorizontal, Zenith Luminance).\n\n\nMy question is: Is there any reason for not using the Direct Normal and the\nDiffuse Horizontal information for making calculations instead of using the\nPerez Model?\n\n\nI understand that the Daylight Coefficients would not directly apply since\nthe luminance distribution would be unknown\u2026 Is it too bad to consider the\ndirect illuminance as it is, and assume the diffuse illuminance as\nisotropic (i.e. assume the diffuse daylight entering through my window is\nthe same as the horizontal) ???\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Molina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009679.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "August 05, 2013 at 05:05PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009678", "id": "radiance-general_009679"}
