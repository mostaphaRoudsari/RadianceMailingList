{"body": "Hi Dolf,\n\n\nIf your hdr image is created using rpict with the -i option than you can\nuse pvalue to extract the pixel irradiance values.\npvalue -da -h -H basic.hdr > basic_RGB.txt\n\n\nIf you just want to apply masks you can use pcomb with if statements like\nthis:\npcomb -e 'ro=if(ri(2),ri(1),0);go=if(gi(2),gi(1),0);bo=if(bi(2),bi(1),0)'\nbasic.hdr mask1.hdr > basic_mask1.hdr\n\n\nIf your hdr images were not generated using rpict -i you could use vwrays\nand rtrace to generate the illuminance data files for your image:\nvwrays -x 500 -y 500 -vf view.vf | rtrace -i -ab 3 scene.oct > output.txt\n\n\nHope this helps,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009683.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "August 06, 2013 at 11:00AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009682", "id": "radiance-general_009683"}
