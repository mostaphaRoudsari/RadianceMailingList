{"body": "Hi Dolf,\n\n\nis it that you want to trace rays for image pixels dependent on their \npixel value? So something like \"if (pixel_red >=.5) then rtrace \npixel_origin pixel_direction\"? For that, you can use rcalc, which \nunderstands float triples (aka pixels values) as input, and can output \neither valid origin/direction vectors or nul-vectors depending on the input.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009684.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
