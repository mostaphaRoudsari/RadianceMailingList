{"body": "I'm not an expert on the pcond code, but it's probably applying different tone mapping depending on what it interprets as lux levels in the scene. If you give it a scene from gendaylit -O 2, pcond doesn't know that the pixel value RGB triplets have already been scaled to luminance, and thinks it's a brighter scene, and applies a brighter tone map. If you gave it a scene illuminated to only 10 lux of electric light, it would probably give you a different tone mapping even if the contrast ratios were identical.\n\n\nCan anyone else corroborate my guess?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009686.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 07, 2013 at 02:04PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009675", "id": "radiance-general_009686"}
