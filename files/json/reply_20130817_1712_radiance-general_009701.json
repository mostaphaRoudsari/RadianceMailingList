{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nI was interested in Ladan Ghobad's presentation on the third day of the\nRadiance Workshop (Thesis, NC State) but could not attend the session\nbecause of conflicts.  That particular session's slides have not been\nuploaded on the radiance site.  Any way to access them?\n\n\nRegards.\nShamim.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009701.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Shamim Javed", "created_at": "August 17, 2013 at 05:12PM", "created_by": "Shamim_Javed", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009693", "id": "radiance-general_009701"}
