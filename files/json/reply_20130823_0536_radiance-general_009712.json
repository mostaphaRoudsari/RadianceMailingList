{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\nyou can use xform for most cases, but a very generic approach is to use !echo \"$myVariable\". You just have to export the variable before calling a Radiance command parsing the file. All lines starting with ! are expanded when the scene is parsed, so this is a generic method to include any text (which can be parameters for materials, geometries, complete Radiance scene objects).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009712.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
