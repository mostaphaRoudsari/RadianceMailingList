{"body": ">> e) Greg, could you elaborate why we have two gendaylit now? You mentioned\nthis in your talk. The version in HEAD seems to be the Fraunhofer one. Where\nis the one based on Ian Ashdown's implementation? I'm a little confused...\n>>\n> There still is only one gendaylit, and it is the Fraunhofer code. The\nother thing we have is Ian Ashdown's Perez sky implementation that Greg used\nin the new gendaymtx program to generate (usually) annual sky matrices based\non the Perez model.\n>\nRob is correct. I rewrote gendaylit.c in accordance with our internal\nsoftware engineering standards and released it as H32_gendaylit on\nwww.helios32.com. It is fully compatible with gendaylit.c, but with fewer\ncommand-line options because it was developed for use with TMY3 files. For\nRadiance users, the Fraunhofer version is appropriate.\n\n\nIan Ashdown, P.
