{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\nYou may have hit the lower limit of what pfilt considers \"non-black.\"  Your light source values are so low that when multiplied by a small solid angle and surface reflectance, the average could be too small for pfilt to notice.  If you use the \"-1\" option to pfilt, I don't think you will get this error.\n\n\nAlso, I would like to point you to the 2002 paper I wrote with Elena on tristimulus color approximations, in case you haven't seen it:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/index.html\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009731.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 28, 2013 at 09:47AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009729", "id": "radiance-general_009731"}
