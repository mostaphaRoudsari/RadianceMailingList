{"body": "Hi Leyla,\n\n\nI was thinking someone else might answer this one, as a lot of folks have worked on similar things, but here goes...\n\n\nFiguring out Radiance \"trans\" parameters is a classic challenge, and there are a few spreadsheets out there to make this a bit easier.  The basic reference is section 5.2.6 from \"Rendering with Radiance,\" attached below for your convenience.  (Responders please delete attachment in your replies.)\n\n\nPlugging in your parameters of:\n\n\nTs = .04\nTd = .67 - .04 = .63\nRd = .18\nRs = 0 (guessing no clear reflections)\n\n\nThese yield:\n\n\nA7 = Ts/(Td+Ts) = .04/(.63+.04) = .0597\n\n\nA6 = (Td+Ts)/(Rd+Td+Ts) = (.63+.04)/(.18+.63+.04) = .7882\n\n\nA5 = 0 (adjust if you want to scatter your transmitted rays a bit)\n\n\nA4 = Rs = 0\n\n\nA1 = A2 = A3 = .18/((1-0)*(1-A6) = .18/(1-.7882) = .85 (assumes uncolored material)\n\n\nSo, there's your material:\n\n\n\tvoid trans frosted_glass\n\t0\n\t0\n\t7 0.85 0.85 0.85 0 0 0.7882 0.0597\n\n\nRegarding thickness, so long as the distance between slats is 16 cm or greater, you needn't worry about it.  If they are closer together, you may want to use the xform -a option to create your own array of slats.  It's actually pretty simple -- genblinds isn't doing that much for you with flat slats, anyway.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\n.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009738.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 30, 2013 at 03:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009735", "id": "radiance-general_009738"}
