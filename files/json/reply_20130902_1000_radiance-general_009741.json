{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nFunny you should be trying to simulate this -- my wife (who is an artist herself) was just down in L.A. and Turrell has what must be a very similar exhibit there, as she sent me a nearly identical photo of it.\n\n\nMy first guess would be the same as yours, which would be to crank the -ad parameter much higher.  You may not need to increase the -as all that much.  Finding the bright spots is the difficult part, since it is so near the horizon as seen from points on the adjacent walls.  (Cosine-weighted sampling means that the horizon gets fewer samples than the zenith.)\n\n\nTo avoid any contributions from the source box, make the surrounding out of a special material and name it with an -ae option.\n\n\nFailing that, I would go full Monte Carlo and see if that works:\n\n\n\t-aa 0 -ad 1024 -as 128 -lw .0002 -ab 2\n\n\nYour scene breaks one of the basic assumptions in the Radiance indirect calculation, which says that indirect lighting is fairly well-distributed in the space.  Here, you have a patch acting as a light source.\n\n\nOnce I implement the irradiance Hessian described in the recent Siggraph Asia paper by Schwarzhaupt et al., the situation might improve:\n\n\n\thttp://zurich.disneyresearch.com/~wjarosz/publications/schwarzhaupt12practical.html\n\n\nBest of luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009741.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 02, 2013 at 10:00AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009740", "id": "radiance-general_009741"}
