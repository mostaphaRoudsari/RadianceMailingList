{"body": "Greg, interested parties,\n\n\nLooking back at the hole in the wall (made with antimatter) I noticed\nthat even putting the \"light bulb room\" wall material and the\nantimatter material in the ambient exclude list, there was still\nambient light pouring from the little room into the main viewing room.\nThat's what was causing the errant ambient spots. Possibly because\nantimatter messes up the ambient exclude logic?\n\n\nAs soon as I changed the color of the little \"light bulb room\" to pure\nblack, the situation improved:\n\n\nOld: http://markjstock.org/transfer/img06.png\nNew: http://markjstock.org/transfer/img11.png\n\n\nAmbient parameters might actually be too high. But the rendering looks\nnice! Turrell must have used a very black little room for his light\nsource!\n\n\nFiles: http://markjstock.org/transfer/afrum1.tar\n\n\nImprovements/comments welcome. More Turrell pieces are in the works,\nas I figure them out.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn 9/2/13, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009743.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "September 03, 2013 at 07:00PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009740", "id": "radiance-general_009743"}
