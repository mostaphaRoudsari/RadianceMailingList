{"body": "Very strange, I'll grant you.  If you turn off super-sampling (-as 0) or increase -ad to 3000, the artifact mostly disappears.  My suspicion is that the method by which the ambient calc estimates errors to decide where to send its super-samples has some regularities due to the hemispherical subdivision I use.  Near the inside corners, the visible hemisphere is split into two regions, one of which is much brighter than the other.  Moving a small amount left or right causes a large number of divisions to cross over the threshold, which shifts the super-samples and therefore the bias in the calculation.\n\n\nThis bug falls under the category of general shortcomings of the strategies used in ambient sampling, which I hope to largely replace with the Hessian calculation I mentioned in an earlier post.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-September/001377.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 03, 2013 at 08:24PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001376", "id": "radiance-dev_001377"}
