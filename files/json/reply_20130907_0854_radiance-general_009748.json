{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your prompt reply.\nI am doing my simulations on my mac, and I have the latest version of\nRadiance.\nIf you may remember from my presentation, I modeled a room with four\nopenings on the south wall: two clerestories, and two windows.\nSimilar to my 3-phase simulation, I am trying to generate separate BSDFs\nfor windows and clerestories, as they have different and dynamic shading\nsystems. The room is positioned 3 meters above the ground (on second floor).\nFor the windows, I generated venetian blinds using genblind. I used -a\noption in xform to duplicate the venetian blinds. Then I used xform to\nposition the South wall, the windows and venetian blinds on xy plane with\nthe interior wall facing up at z=0.  In genBSDF script, I set -dim command\nto cover the two windows and the wall between them. Since I am new to\ngenBSDF, I am not sure what is causing the error. Does the clerestory\nopenings on the south wall need to be filled when creating the window BSDFs?\n\n\n\n\n#objects/venetain80.rad\nvoid plastic blindslat\n0\n0\n5 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.1 0\n\n\n!genblinds blindslat blinds .02 2 1 83 80 +r .2 | xform -rz -90 -t 5.0 3.95\n3.8 -a 2 -t 4 0 0\n\n\n$ xform -rz 180 -rx -90 objects/glazing_W.rad objects/venetian80.rad\nmaterials/room.mat objects/Swall.rad > bsdf/windows-v80-1.rad\n\n\n$ xform -t 12 -3 -4  bsdf/windows-v80-1.rad > bsdf/windows-v80.rad\n\n\n$ genBSDF +f +b -geom meter -dim 1 7 0.8 1.8 -.2 0 -t4 5\nbsdf/windows-v80.rad > bsdf/windows-v80_t45.xml\n\n\nPlease let me know if you need to look at any of my files.\n\n\nThanks,\nLeyla\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009748.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leyla Sanati", "created_at": "September 07, 2013 at 08:54AM", "created_by": "Leyla_Sanati", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009745", "id": "radiance-general_009748"}
