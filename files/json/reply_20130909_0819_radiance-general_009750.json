{"body": "Hi Islam,\n\n\nYou have not really provided enough information to even offer suggestions as to possible causes.  The Radiance file you attached doesn't even contain your BSDF material.  It is a single-material object made of a smokey dielectric.\n\n\nAt the very least, you should include the error that you got and the context in which you got it.  Otherwise, no one can help you.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009750.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 09, 2013 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009747", "id": "radiance-general_009750"}
