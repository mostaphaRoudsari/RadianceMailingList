{"body": "Hi Islam,\n\n\nThe error you see is an artifact of the wxFalsecolor program trying to  \nopen a failed simulation file.\n\n\nFor DIVA-specific help it makes sense to move this discussion to the  \nhttp://diva4rhino.com/ support forums. But in this case, you can figure  \nout the explicit error by editing the  \nC:\\DIVA\\Temp\\RhinoFileName\\Filename_img.bat file to include a PAUSE at the  \nlast line. Then just run the batch file, and you should see the error  \nmessage direct from Radiance. With that in hand, we can probably help more.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 09 Sep 2013 11:19:12 -0400, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>  \nwrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009751.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "September 10, 2013 at 05:21AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009747", "id": "radiance-general_009751"}
