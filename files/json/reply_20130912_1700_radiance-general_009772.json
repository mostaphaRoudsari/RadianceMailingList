{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nI tried it, and I don't get an error.  What -O setting are you using when compiling Radiance?  Anything above -O2 has been known to generate incorrect code with gcc.  Even -O2 sometimes causes runtime errors.\n\n\nIf you recompile and get an error using -O1, try without -O, just using -g, and run it in the debugger.  This is the only way to find out where it is going wrong.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009772.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 12, 2013 at 05:00PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009769", "id": "radiance-general_009772"}
