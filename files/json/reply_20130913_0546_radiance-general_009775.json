{"body": "Hi German,\n\n\nWhen you run makeall install, after you are asked for the location for \nthe location of the executables, you will get something like the following:\n> Current rmake command is:\n> #!/bin/sh\n> exec make \"SPECIAL=\" \\\n>     \"OPT=-O2\" \\\n>     \"MACH=-Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib \n> -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO\" \\\n>     ARCH=IBMPC \"COMPAT=erf.o\" \\\n>     INSTDIR=/Rlib/bin \\\n>     LIBDIR=/Rlib/lib \\\n>     ESUFFIX= \\\n>     CC=gcc \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n> Do you want to change it?\nIf you type \"Y,\" this will be opened up in an editor (vi is default \nunless you specify otherwise when you first run makeall). The \"OPT=\" \nline is the one that you should edit according to Greg's suggestions. So \nI think that you could first try:\n\n\n    \"OPT=-01\"\n\n\n    and then if that does not help, you could try:\n\n\n    \"OPT=\"\n\n\n    This will turn of optimizations.\n\n\nI think that -g gives debugging output. I think that you could do the \nfollowing to compile with this:\n\n\n    change\n\n\n    CC=gcc \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\n\n    to\n\n\n    CC=gcc -g \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009775.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 13, 2013 at 05:46AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009769", "id": "radiance-general_009775"}
