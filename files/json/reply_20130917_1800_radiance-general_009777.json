{"body": "Hi Leyla,\n\n\nAll you can really do is play with the -c option and the rendering parameters.  You probably don't want to change -c in this case, but you can make the rendering go faster by altering the default options, which are:\n\n\n\t\"-w -ab 5 -ad 700 -lw 3e-6\"\n\n\nYou can try running:\n\n\n\tgenBSDF -n 12 +f +b -geom meter -t4 5 -r \"-ab 3 -ad 500 -lw 1e-5\"  \\\n\t\treveal_glazing.rad venetian80.rad LChazed.rad > bsdf/v80_hazed_t45.xml\n\n\nAlso, I noticed that your blind slat material has 10% specularity, which probably isn't realistic unless it has a metallic coating.  I would expect the specularity to be 0.05 or less.  You are also better off specifying a non-zero roughness value unless the slats are really mirror-smooth.  \n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009777.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 17, 2013 at 06:00PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009776", "id": "radiance-general_009777"}
