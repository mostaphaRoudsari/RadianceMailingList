{"body": "Hi Christopher,\n\n\nYes, that gets tagged-on by another part of the wrapper (spaghetti code).

Luckily I've only ever used a [1 1 1] sky, thanks for fixing my future-bug.\n\n\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009782.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Paul Lovell", "created_at": "September 18, 2013 at 07:40AM", "created_by": "Paul_Lovell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009780", "id": "radiance-general_009782"}
