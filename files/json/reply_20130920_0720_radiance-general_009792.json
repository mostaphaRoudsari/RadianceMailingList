{"body": "Thank you Reinier,\n\n\nThat was really helpful. I have a large database of northern european \nwoodland reflectance spectra (Parkkinnen et al, an IEEE paper), though \nunfortunately it's not labelled, so perhaps not that useful. Luckily I \nhave a spectroradiometer so can go out and measure some target plants. \nIn my example I made up my reflectances but the transmission data was \nfrom a maple leaf \n(http://www.apogeeinstruments.co.uk/content/transmissiongraph_large.jpg).\n\n\nThanks for the link to the book, it looks very useful! I think if I'd \nread more when I started using radiance four years ago,  I wouldn't be \nstuck re-writing my Matlab wrapper now. All my previous Radiance models \nhave been for simple visual stimuli for experiments so they have all \nbeen grey plastics. Now I need to re-tool for leaves I have to unwrap a \nlot of spaghetti-code!\n\n\nBut yes, the project is really fun, here's a summary of some early work \n<https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxkhw64wd3gkd7w/Lovell_et_al_IECASAB_Poster_A4_FINAL.pptx>.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 20/09/2013 12:28, Reinier Zeldenrust wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009792.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "P George Lovell", "created_at": "September 20, 2013 at 07:20AM", "created_by": "P_George_Lovell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009789", "id": "radiance-general_009792"}
