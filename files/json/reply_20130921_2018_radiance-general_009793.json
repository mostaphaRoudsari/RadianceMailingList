{"body": "Jan and Lars,\n\n\nThank you very much for your quick response. I guess I haven't got the executable (or I don't know where they are). I tried to use evalglare and got \"command not found\".\n\n\nI checked usr/local/bin (I also checked usr/local/ray, with the same result), the folder \"evalglare\" is there. Inside the \"evalglare\" folder, I found following files:\n\n\ncommon                  evalglare.c             gl.h                    pictool.h\ndocumentation_v1.0x.pdf evalglare.dSYM          makefile                pictool.o\nevalglare               geometry                pictool.c               platform.h\n\n\nSorry I don't know how to install the binary. Since the evalglare is already there, I did not copy it as Lars suggested.\n\n\nAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nHongyi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009793.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hongyi Cai", "created_at": "September 21, 2013 at 08:18PM", "created_by": "Hongyi_Cai", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009787", "id": "radiance-general_009793"}
