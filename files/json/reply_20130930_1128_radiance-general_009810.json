{"body": "One scenario I can think of would be using the 3- or 5-phase method to look at a window with clear glazing and a shade, and wanting to select the appropriate BSDF based on whether the shade is up or down (at runtime). But you're right Greg, of course; given the difficulty of even a high resolution BSDF to represent purely specular transmittance or reflectance, the best way to handle these situations is to do simply calculate the view matrix with the whole model - including the glazing, modeled as glass or trans or whatever  -- and then do another round where you do the VMX to the glass and the DMX to the sky, and just have the one BSDF for the CFS. With gendaymtx, the generation of the matrices is so fast now it makes more sense to just do them both (for this scenario) and then at runtime just select the appropriate result.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009810.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "September 30, 2013 at 11:28AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009745", "id": "radiance-general_009810"}
