{"body": "Bruno,\nIt seems that there is a problem with your command line. It's tough to tell\nexactly without seeing it, but my guess is that you've done something like\nthis:\n\n\n-faa klems_int.cal\n\n\n\n\nbut it should be two seperate options like this:\n\n\n-faa  -f klems_int.cal\n\n\n\n\nIf this isn't the problem pleas send the full command and we'll have a\nbetter chance at troubleshooting.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 1, 2013 at 7:07 AM, Bruno Bueno\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009817.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 01, 2013 at 10:22AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009815", "id": "radiance-general_009817"}
