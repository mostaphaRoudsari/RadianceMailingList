{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\n\nThis sounds like a bug in gendaymtx.  Some versions of the standard library print out \"-1.#J\" for NaN (Not a Number), which can result from a divide-by-zero or similar illegal math operation.  If you send me your weather file in a separate message (not to the mailing list), I will see if I can reproduce the problem.  There may be a corner case or two that gendaymtx still doesn't deal with gracefully.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009821.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2013 at 08:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009820", "id": "radiance-general_009821"}
