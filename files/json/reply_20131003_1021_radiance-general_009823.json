{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you for checking. My bad! I use my own written epw2wea convertor so\nthe user don't need to download epw2wea file separately. That was a bug\nindeed. Sorry about that.\n\n\nOne more question about conversion of the results of gendaymtx. Where can I\nfind  solid angle subtended for each patch of Reinhart sky? I already have\nthe values for Tregenza sky as (0.0435, 0.0416, 0.0474, 0.0407, 0.0429,\n0.0445, 0.0455, 0.0344) for the 8 rows. Is it fine to use the same numbers\nfor every two rows?\n\n\nThanks again,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009823.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "October 03, 2013 at 10:21AM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009820", "id": "radiance-general_009823"}
