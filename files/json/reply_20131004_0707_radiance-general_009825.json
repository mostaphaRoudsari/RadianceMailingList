{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI know it may not be the normal use of gendaymtx but I'm not using it to\nrun 5Phase or 3Phase method.\n\n\nWhat I'm looking for is the values for each sky patch itself (e.g. 577\nnumbers for each time step for Reinhart sky). The numbers are already\ngenerated from gendaymtx and I just want to multiply them with stradian\nangles to have the values in w/m2.\n\n\nI assume it should be 15 numbers for 14 rows + zenith patch.\n\n\nCheers,\nMostapha\n\n\nPS: I wish I knew how to write a line like this on Windows then I could run\nit for reinhart.cal I assume. :-\\\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009825.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "October 04, 2013 at 07:07AM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009820", "id": "radiance-general_009825"}
