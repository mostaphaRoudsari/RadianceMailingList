{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\n\nIf you run the command I gave you at the end of my e-mail, minus the \"uniq\" function that takes out the repeated values, you will get 145 solid angles for the 145 patches, starting as I said from the ZENITH patch.  You just need to find the klems_ang.cal file, which comes in the ray/src/cal/cal directory with the distribution.\n\n\nThe Reinhart sky source generator is called reinsrc.cal, and you can use it like this:\n\n\n\tcnt 2305 | rcalc -e MF:4 -f reinsrc.cal -e 'Rbin=recno;$1=Romega' > rh_sang.txt\n\n\nYou will 2305 values, get one solid angle for each patch.  If you change the MF setting, you will need to use a different number in cnt according to (using an example subdivision of 2):\n\n\n\trcalc -n -e MF:2 -f reinhart.cal -e '$1=Nrbins'\n\n\nThe output of gendaymtx has 145 rows of 8760 values each for a full year, which may be less convenient for you.  You may swap rows and columns using the new rcollate command if you have it in your installation:\n\n\n\tgendaymtx year.wea | rcollate -i > transpose.txt\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009826.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 04, 2013 at 08:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009820", "id": "radiance-general_009826"}
