Indeed, after that correction I was able to create the\n*dmx*for the south window orientation.\n\n\nI take the opportunity to ask a simple question regarding *dctimestep*:\n\n\nwhen I tried to use it for annual calculations with -n 8760 I get a msg:\n\n\nUsage:dctimestep DCspec [ skyvec ]\ndctimestep Vspec Tbsdf.xml Dmat.dat [ skyvec ]\n\n\nI sounds to me that is not accepting the -n, so I guess that there might be\na new version that it takes it.\n\n\nWe have the 4.1 version released Nov 2011 installed in the server.\nI wonder if the source file of that 'dctimestep new version' its available\nsomewhere the web to download?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nChantal.\n\n\n\n\n2013/9/25 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009833.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "minchaca", "created_at": "October 11, 2013 at 02:37AM", "created_by": "minchaca", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009802", "id": "radiance-general_009833"}
