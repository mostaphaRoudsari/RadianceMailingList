{"body": "Hi David,\n> Thus my question: is it possible to explicitly set the exposure used \n> in the tonemapping process with any tool in Radiance?\nI'd say combine pfilt with ra_tiff, so that you set a fixed exposure \nwith pfilt -e X and keep that untouched in the later conversion using \nra_tiff -e 0. Would that work as expected?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-October/000493.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
