{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI am a little unclear on what you want to accomplish but here are a few \nthoughts.\n\n\n 1. time series animation with constant exposure on successive frames -\n    use pfilt -1 -e [constant exposure setting] for each frame\n 2. time series animation with tone mapping function on successive\n    frames - use pcond and phisto, phisto will compute a histogram\n    across a series of frames pcond can then use the results from phisto\n    to tone map the frames according to selected tone mapping operator,\n    there is a an example in the man page for pcond\n\n\nI think that maybe where I am confused by your description is that since \nRadiance output is already HDR, setting exposure is really a post \nprocess. I think that what you are looking for is the second option that \nI describe above.\n\n\nNot sure if this answers your questions, but perhaps gives you some \nthings to look into.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009838.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "October 22, 2013 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009837", "id": "radiance-general_009838"}
