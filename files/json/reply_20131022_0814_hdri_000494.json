{"body": "Hi Jack, hi Lars,\n\n\nthanks a lot for the quick response!\nJack, your second hint exactly did what I was looking for. I tried to use\npcond first, but didn't think of the possibility to use a histogram...\n\n\nSorry, if my description was somehow cryptic, but you exactly found what I\nwanted...\n\n\nJust for information: the pfilt exposure corrections do not help in my case\nbecause the tone-mapping that is done in the HDR2LDR conversion (with\nhdr2jpeg / ra_tiff or similar) does the tone mapping for each single frame\nindependent from the other images. (But maybe I just got something terribly\nwrong here...!?)\n\n\nThanks!\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/10/22 Jack de Valpine <jedev at visarc.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-October/000494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Geisler-Moroder", "created_at": "October 22, 2013 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder", "parent_id": "hdri_000492", "id": "hdri_000494"}
