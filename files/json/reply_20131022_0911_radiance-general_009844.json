{"body": "I don't use hdr2jpeg myself, and it isn't distributed with Radiance.  Depending on which version you have, it applies either a Reinhard TMO or a variant of the histogram adjustment operator in pcond, but there's no way to tell it to use a specific curve as you can with the pcond -I option Jack mentioned.  The latter technique with phisto is what I generally use if I want a sequence exposed the same.  And, you can go on using the same histogram for future frames so long as they don't change too much from the range of past frames.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009844.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 22, 2013 at 09:11AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009837", "id": "radiance-general_009844"}
