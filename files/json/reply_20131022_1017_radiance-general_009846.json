{"body": "Indeed.  The usual way of getting a label into an image is using pcompos, which strips the image of exposure information that pcond needs to do its job.  Since the output of pcond in most cases has lost its useful luminance information, it works well to apply the label at that point and/or convert to some non-HDR image type via ra_whatever.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-October/009846.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 22, 2013 at 10:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009837", "id": "radiance-general_009846"}
