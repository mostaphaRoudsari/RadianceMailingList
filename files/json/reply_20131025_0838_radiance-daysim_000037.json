{"body": "Hi Sylvia,\n\n\ncan you determine, what the \"bottleneck\" is? is it the illuminance \ncalcualtion at the beginning or the image calculation?\nI guess you made also normal illumianance calculations first - how long \ndid they take?\nIf the illuminance calc is the bottleneck, then the ambient parameters \nreduce the time. but you are already at a low limit, especially \nregarding ad and as.\nIn general it is more important to have a high ad than having a very low \naa. So I would say you could incread aa to 0.2. But I usually calculate \nad with 8192 or double... - this increases the time then again.\nThe ambient parameters effect only the illuminace calculation in the \nfirst step - the calculation of the images is using ab 0 and cannot be \nchanged by the user.\n\n\nI guess you are using windows which is in general a problem, since it is \nnot possible right now to use more than one cpu at the same time. I have \na linux version running here and usually distribute jobs to 10-40 cores...\n\n\nbest regards\njan\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/25/2013 01:36 PM, Cammarano Silvia wrote:\n> Hi Jan,\n> thank you very much for your reply.\n> Yes, I used a .vf file format with two calculation points (two lines).\n> The calculation at the end works but it's very slow.
