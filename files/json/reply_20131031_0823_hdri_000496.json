{"body": "Hi Giovanni,\n\n\nPreserving all of the data from a camera RAW file is a tricky business.  The Adobe RAW converter has a lot of options to play with and allows you to go straight into a 16-bit/channel file, which has the potential to keep everything.  You still have to make choices as to how to clamp the highlights as the three channels will clip at different levels and this depends on the camera sensor, environment and white balance settings.\n\n\nThe ultimate control comes from the program dcraw by Dave Coffin:\n\n\n\thttp://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/\n\n\nI have written the attached C-shell script that uses dcraw and another excellent freeware package called exiftool to preserve 16-bit data and camera information while converting to a linear 16-bit/channel output.  This will be recognized by Photosphere but may display incorrectly in other programs due to an assumed gamma.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-October/000496.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2013 at 08:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000495", "id": "hdri_000496"}
