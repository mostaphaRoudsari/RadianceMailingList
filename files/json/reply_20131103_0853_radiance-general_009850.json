{"body": "Hi Andy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help with all my questions. I found the solution to\nthe last one... (Not really worth mentioning!!)\n\n\n :))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding my previous 1st. Question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried to create a *glazing_bsdf.rad* file using one of the cfs.xml files\nthat we have in the lab. I\u2019ve got the message:\n\n\n\u201cUnsupported IncidentDataStructure for BSDF\u201d, I assume this means that this\nis not a \u2018tensor tree high resolution BSDF\u201d.\n\n\nThis might be a silly question but: if there is a way to resample the\ntensor tree BSDF into a Klems basis BSDF, is there any way\n\n\nto do the other way around? Or...perhaps this 'error message' means\nsomething else..?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thank you in advance for your help again!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChantal.\n\n\n\n\n2013/11/1 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009850.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "minchaca", "created_at": "November 03, 2013 at 08:53AM", "created_by": "minchaca", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009847", "id": "radiance-general_009850"}
