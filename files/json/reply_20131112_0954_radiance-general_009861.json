{"body": "Hi Olivier,\n\n\nThe simplest method is to use rtrace.  You can separate your polygons by name with:\n\n\n\tvwrays [resolution & view options] | rtrace -h -osv scene.oct | sort > surfaces.txt\n\n\nYou should get a selection of radiance values for each surface based on the selected view.  If you want orthonormal values for _every_ polygon, not just those visible from one perspective, more sophisticated methods are needed.  You would have to read in the scene file and generate a custom view for each polygon.  It can be done, but it might require some scripting/programming to accomplish it.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  If you want irradiance/illuminance values rather than radiance/luminance, use the rtrace -i option.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009861.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 12, 2013 at 09:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009857", "id": "radiance-general_009861"}
