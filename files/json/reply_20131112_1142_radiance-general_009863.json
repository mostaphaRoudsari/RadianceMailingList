{"body": "Hi folks - one more question about falsecolor hacks. \n\n\nany chance one could make -e in falsecolor return not the extrema pixels, but the extrema pixels averaged by their immediate neighbors (8 surrounding pixels), or possibly an even larger radius or neighboring pixels? in other words, i'd like to highlight the maximum value on a set of images, but instead of a single point, a larger 'extrema zone' on the image. \n\n\nThanks for any ideas... \n\n\nMM\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009863.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Michael Martinez", "created_at": "November 12, 2013 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009797", "id": "radiance-general_009863"}
