{"body": "Yes, it's possible.  You just need to hack falsecolor.\n\n\nIs that the answer you're looking for?\n\n\nMore detailed:  Use pfilt to box-filter the image, then run pextrem on the output.  Upscale the positions it gives you and reinsert them in the appropriate place in the code.\n\n\nAn option to do this could be added if it's of general interest.  Axel Jacobs is the maintainer of falsecolor.pl these days.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009864.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 12, 2013 at 12:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009797", "id": "radiance-general_009864"}
