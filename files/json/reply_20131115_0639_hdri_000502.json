{"body": "Assuming you mean vertical illuminance at the camera sensor plane, and further assuming the fisheye image captured a reasonable amount of the scene's dynamic range and is a true hemispherical image, then one can simply integrate the cosine-weighted incoming flux to derive illuminance. Evalglare does this for you as part of its own internal calculations for DGP.\n\n\n-Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNREL Commercial Buildings Research Group\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-November/000502.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 15, 2013 at 06:39AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "hdri_000501", "id": "hdri_000502"}
