{"body": "Yes. It makes sense.\nNow, may I a question about the direct sun coefficient matrix. I have a\nmodel with windows facing south, west and north and varying shading devices\nfor each orientation.\nShould I create a separate direct sun coefficient matrix for each window\norientation, or would it be correct if I create an all-black model\ncontaining all of the shading devices and pass it to rcontrib. Something\nlike this:\n\n\nxform -m black room.rad objects/ground.rad | oconv materials/room.mat -\nobjects/glazing.rad objects/shading_south.rad objects/shading_west.rad\n\n\nobjects/glazing_bsdf_south.rad objects/glazing_bsdf_west.rad\nobjects/glazing_bsdf_north.rad\n\n\nskies/suns.rad > octs/model_suns.oct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*rcontrib < data/photocells.pts -I -ab 1 -ad 65536 -lw 1.52e-5 -dc 1 -dt 0\n-dj 0 -st 1 -ss 0 -faf -e MF:6 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m solar\nocts/model_suns.oct > matrices/directsun.dsmxThank you,Leyla*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009870.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Leyla Sanati", "created_at": "November 15, 2013 at 01:11PM", "created_by": "Leyla_Sanati", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009853", "id": "radiance-general_009870"}
