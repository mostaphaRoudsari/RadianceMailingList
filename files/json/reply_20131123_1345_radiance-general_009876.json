{"body": "Hi Bruno,\n\n\nThe underprediction is expected for fenestration systems with any concentrated through component, as the Klems matrix representation will spread out any transmission to the resolution of its patch sizes, which is around 15 degrees or so (square).  In other words, the direct component will be spread out by the resolution of the Klems BTDF.  I don't know whether or not EnergyPlus is using the Klems BTDF, and if it does, it might use it differently so there isn't this spreading of irradiation, but that's a trade-off between different types of errors.  Radiance spreads the light based on BTDF angular accuracy, but the integrated value (and therefore the subsequent interreflections) will carry the correct amount of energy.  A different energy sampling approach might dump the energy into a smaller area with higher concentration, just not get it in the right place.  It's difficult to say which approach is better.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009876.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 23, 2013 at 01:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009874", "id": "radiance-general_009876"}
