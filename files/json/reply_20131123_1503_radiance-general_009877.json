{"body": "I think I can add something else that S. Vidanovic told me:\n\n\n\"Well, main limitation is that integration is not really done patch by\npatch (at least not for solar part)...  If you for example take a look at\nequation 280 you will notice that integration is averaged over sky and\nground elements.  In solar calculations, I do not care from which part of\nthe sky radiation is coming, I simply do averaging over entire sky and just\napply that into equations.  I have no idea how much error that will\nintroduce into calculations.  One important note is that I do care what is\ncurrent sun position and therefore I do know what is incoming patch at\ngiven time, and will know really precisely to calculate absorbed solar\nradiation on interior sides.\"\n\n\nmeaning that only the beam radation is passed thorugh the BSDF, and the\nrest is averaged.\nAlso, EnergyPlus should add the absorbed and reemited radiation...? are you\nconsidering that?\n\n\nI am not sure about what EnergyPlus does about the Basis issue that Greg\nmentioned...\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n2013/11/23 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009877.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "November 23, 2013 at 03:03PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009874", "id": "radiance-general_009877"}
