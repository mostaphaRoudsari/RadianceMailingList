{"body": "Hi Thibault,\n\n\nIt seems like no one responded to this.  First, you might want to read through Peter Apian-Bennewitz's recent review of the various Radiance types, which he has posted at:\n\n\n\thttp://www.pab.eu/docs/Review_of_simulating_four_classes_of_window_materials_for_daylighting_with_non-standard_BSDF_using_simulation_program_Radiance.pdf\n\n\nPeter does an excellent job of explaining the different types, what they do, and when they are useful -- something that has been missing from the documentation and literature for decades, now.\n\n\nWhat I think you will learn as it applies to your case is that without an interreflection calculation, the transdata and transfunc types will not give you a solar patch on the interior of your test space no matter what your material parameters.  The BSTDfunc type would, however.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009882.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 25, 2013 at 09:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009869", "id": "radiance-general_009882"}
