{"body": "Hi Nithya,\n\n\n>From the findglare man page:\n\n\nFindglare  normally identifies glare sources as directions that are brighter than 7 times the average luminance level.  It\n       is possible to override this determination by giving an explicit luminance threshold with the -t option.  It usually works\n       best to use the 'l' command within ximage(1) to decide what this value should be.  Alternatively, one can use the 't' com-\n       mand within rvu(1).  The idea is to pick a threshold that is well above the average level  but  smaller  than  the  source\n       areas.\n\n\nThere are a lot of caveats when using findglare, so be sure to read the whole thing:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/findglare.1.html\n\n\n\n\nEvalglare was the product of Jan Wienold's dissertation, which can be considered the prime source for info on how evalglare does its thing. Here's a good paper on actually using evalglare:\n\n\nhttp://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0944_951.pdf\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-November/000504.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 26, 2013 at 10:13AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "hdri_000503", "id": "hdri_000504"}
