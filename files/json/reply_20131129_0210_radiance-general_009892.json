{"body": "Thanks Greg and German for your comments. As I mentioned in my email, I'm considering only a simple double-pane window, without any concentrating system.\n\n\nFinally, the problem was not the 3pm but the shading effect of the \nreveal, which we included in the 3pm but not in EnergyPlus. The \nthickness of the wall was 0.35 m, the glass was located at 0.05 m from \ninside and there were three windows on a south-facing facade. With this \nconfiguration, the solar transmission decreased up to 30% due to shading \neffects from the reveal for high incidence angles.\n\n\nWe've compared the solar transmission from the 3pm with classic \nRadiance, and they match well.\n\n\nCheers,\nBruno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 1\nDate: Sat, 23 Nov 2013 13:45:52 -0800\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009892.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Bruno Bueno", "created_at": "November 29, 2013 at 02:10AM", "created_by": "Bruno_Bueno", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009874", "id": "radiance-general_009892"}
