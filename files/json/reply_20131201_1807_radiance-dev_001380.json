{"body": "Hi Axel, et al.,\n\n\nobjview.rb works fine on my Mac, I tested this on Linux and Win too (since Win compatibility was the whole point). It's expecting a .rad file which references a .dat file (products of the ies2rad program). Maybe we could work offline to find the source of your error? Otherwise...\n\n\nThe purpose of ltview was to show both the luminaire (or fitting, for you U.K. people) and the distribution. It worked for me, and I thought it might be useful for others. You can see the shape of the luminous aperture polygon, the size, the orientation, and the general distribution. You could also ping surfaces in the box for radiance or irradiance, learning a little more about the distribution and the scaling. Since ltview was a copy of objview, it seemed to make sense to shove it all into one place when I wrote the Ruby port. While no one was happy to have another dependency, it WAS nice to have objview available to Windows users. If your Perl port(s) works, we should probably drop the Ruby port, since objview/ltview is the only reason for installing Ruby if you merely want to use the Radiance binaries (using OpenStudio is a different matter). \n\n\nI wouldn't call it iesview though, since what we're looking at is a Radiance light description -- which may or may not be derived from an ies file. =8-)\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn Dec 1, 2013, at 3:06 PM, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-December/001380.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 01, 2013 at 06:07PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001379", "id": "radiance-dev_001380"}
