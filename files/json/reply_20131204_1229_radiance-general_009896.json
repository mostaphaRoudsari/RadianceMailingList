{"body": "The glass material assumes an uncoated dielectric material, thus its reflectance and transmittance as a function of incident angle are precisely determined by physics from the normal transmissivity (which you specify) and the index of refraction (which you can also give but defaults to 1.52).\n\n\nIf you want finer control over reflectance separate from transmittance, you should use the \"trans\" material type, although accounting for the angular dependence is more difficult with this type.  Try the \"glaze\" script if you have a multi-pane system you wish to model.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009896.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 04, 2013 at 12:29PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009894", "id": "radiance-general_009896"}
