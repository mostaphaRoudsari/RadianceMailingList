{"body": "I don't think photon mapping will handle this, either.  It's really outside the scope of an architectural rendering package.  Subsurface scattering needs to be implemented at a fundamental materials level, and involves gathering contributions from nearby a hit point in a geometry-aware fashion.  Not to say that it couldn't be done, but there's no real motivation to add it to Radiance.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009905.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 11, 2013 at 09:15AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009903", "id": "radiance-general_009905"}
