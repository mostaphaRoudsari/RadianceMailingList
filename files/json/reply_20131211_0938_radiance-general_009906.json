{"body": "Thank you Greg,\nIt is really useful to work with slightly translucent materials like marble.\nI was wondering if it could be modeled via an XML file as the BSDF is. It would be an additional dimension to the tensor tree representation and an additional material parameter (maybe 1 per dimension actually) to quantify the diffusion of light.\nAny thought ?\nCheers,\nThibault\n\n\nPS: Is this photon map module included in the latest Radiance release ? If not, what is the best way to approach caustics ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> a \u00e9crit : -----\nA : Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nDe : Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\nDate : 11/12/2013 17:17\nObjet : Re: [Radiance-general] Subsurface scattering in Radiance\n\n\nI don't think photon mapping will handle this, either. \u00a0It's really outside the scope of an architectural rendering package. \u00a0Subsurface scattering needs to be implemented at a fundamental materials level, and involves gathering contributions from nearby a hit point in a geometry-aware fashion. \u00a0Not to say that it couldn't be done, but there's no real motivation to add it to Radiance.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009906.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thibault Charles", "created_at": "December 11, 2013 at 09:38AM", "created_by": "Thibault_Charles", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009903", "id": "radiance-general_009906"}
