{"body": "Thank you Dr.Greg. I also suspected that since Pcompos deals with images\n(and not Radiance objects) therefore it will only take pixel\ncoordinates (and not world coordinates) as input arguments. Your idea of\nrecording pixel coordinates through ('t' or middle mouse button) will\nabsolutely work but ideally I was looking for a fully automated process.\n\n\nStill I think there could be one solution, if I write an algorithm to\nconvert the (x,y) world coordinates of the sensors into (x,y) pixel\ncoordinates by taking into account the actual room size and pixel counts of\nthe image. If I give -vv and -vh options equal to the room size in parallel\ncamera, and the resolution of the image produced is known than I think\nsomehow this can be done. This is just a thought process yet. I hope this\ncould happen. I will be glad to know your views on it. Excuse me if I\nconfused. Thank you again!\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaibhav Jain\nwww.vaibhavjain.co\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009909.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "December 11, 2013 at 10:37AM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009901", "id": "radiance-general_009909"}
