{"body": "Hi Vaib,\n\n\nYou could certainly base a Perl script on some variant of the command sequence I suggested, or develop your own.  For parallel views, it's not difficult to compute the world coordinates from picture position, but the other view types are more challenging.\n\n\nI should have also mentioned what people more typically do is generate two images, an \"irradiance\" image and a regular one, then use falsecolor to combine the two into a contour plot with legend.  This isn't quite what you asked for, but contains essentially the same information.  I.e.:\n\n\n\t$ rpict [rendering options] -vf myview.vf -x [xres] -y [yres] scene.oct > myrender.hdr\n\t$ rpict [rendering options] -vf myview.vf -x [xres] -y [yres] -i+ scene.oct > myirradiance.hdr\n\t$ falsecolor -i myirradiance.hdr -p myrender.hdr -cl -s auto -l Lux > mycontour.hdr\n\n\nGive it a try.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009910.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 11, 2013 at 11:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009901", "id": "radiance-general_009910"}
