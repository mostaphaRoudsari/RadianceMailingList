If a user grabs any of the NREL packages, or builds Radiance from source using the makeall script or standard tools, they will have a copy of epw2wea(.exe) in their Radiance build. \n\n\nI considered it a bonus that this util was now available to all users, and that it was deployed as a c program and not another script. On the other hand, your additions make epw2wea even more useful and I think it makes sense to replace epw2wea.c with epw2wea.pl. My free opinion. Worth every penny. \n\n\nShould we go this route, we'd need an update for the skeletal manpage. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-December/001387.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 16, 2013 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001386", "id": "radiance-dev_001387"}
