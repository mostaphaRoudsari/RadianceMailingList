{"body": "Hi Brian,\n\n\nGood research!  The materials do not translate very well, so you'll just have to do the best you can with those.  If your object(s) have mapped textures, you may be better off using obj2mesh instead of obj2rad, since a Radiance triangle mesh supports mapped textures.  You'll still need to translate the texture image file(s), however.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009916.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 21, 2013 at 08:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009915", "id": "radiance-general_009916"}
