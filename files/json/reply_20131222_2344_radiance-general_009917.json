{"body": "Hello Brian,\n\n\nA quick check of http://www.fileformat.info/format/material provides \nsome information on the file format which could be used as a guide.\n\n\nUsing your {mtl} file:\nnewmtl appearance0\nKa 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125\nKd 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125\nKs 0.119 0.119 0.119\nNs 119.04\nd 1\nillum 2\n\n\nTo list all materials in the mtl file listing all line containing the \nnewmtl string:\n     grep newmtl {mtl}\n\n\n     In your case the first materials name is appearance0\n     According to http://www.fileformat.info/format/material:\n         The Ka statement specifies the ambient reflectivity using RGB \nvalues.\n\n\n\"r g b\" are the values for the red, green, and blue components of the \ncolor. The g and b arguments are optional. If only r is specified, then \ng, and b are assumed to be equal to r. The r g b values are normally in \nthe range of 0.0 to 1.0. Values outside this range increase or decrease \nthe reflectivity accordingly.\n\n\n         The Kd statement specifies the diffuse reflectivity using RGB \nvalues.\n         The Ks statement specifies the specular reflectivity using RGB \nvalues.\n\n\nTherefore a simple material definition for your appearance0 might be:\nvoid plastic appearance0\n0\n0\n5 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125 .1 .1\n\n\nThe last two parameters (.1 and .1) are the specularity and roughness. \nSpecularity fractions greater than 0.1 and roughness values greater than \n0.2 are not very realistic.\n\n\n\n\n*Terrance McMinn\n***\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009917.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance McMinn", "created_at": "December 22, 2013 at 11:44PM", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009915", "id": "radiance-general_009917"}
