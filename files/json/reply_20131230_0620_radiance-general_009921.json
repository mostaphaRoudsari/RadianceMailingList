{"body": "Hi Ji,\n\n\nIf you keep working through Axel's tutorial, you will see that the \ndistribution for a given sky condition is applied as a separate step \nusing output from gensky or gendaylit piped into genskyvec. Rtcontrib is \nbeing used to calculate the skypatches for a unit/uniform distribution. \nThese unit results are then multiplied by the output from the genskyvec \ncommand. So the actual output/distribution for a given sun/sky is not \npart of the rtcontrib calculation.\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009921.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 30, 2013 at 06:20AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009920", "id": "radiance-general_009921"}
