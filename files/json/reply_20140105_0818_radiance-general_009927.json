{"body": "Hi Vaib,\n\n\n> I just wish to confirm about the Site Standard Meridian (-m) argument\n> for genrsky.

Exceptions to this are the countries marked on this map\nhttp://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/images/time_zones.jpg\nwith a star.\n\n\nCountries that have a TZ of GMT +/- X.5 hrs or -(X*15) + 7.5 deg include:\n- India\n- a bit of Australia\n- Iran\n(there are more...)\n\n\nFinally, there is Nepal which is at GMT +5:45 hrs or -5.75*15 = -86.25 \ndeg in Radiance notation.\n\n\nIn other words: the 'round to integer' part of your equation is correct \nin most, but not all, cases.  You might end up with a floating point \nnumber if your project is located in exotic places.\n\n\nFYI: This integer bug existed in epw2wea which just recently made it \ninto Radiance HEAD. It was fixed just before Christmas.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009927.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "January 05, 2014 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009926", "id": "radiance-general_009927"}
