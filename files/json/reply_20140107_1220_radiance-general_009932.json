{"body": "Hi Alejandro,\n\n\nthe topic of light pipes appears from time to time, and unfortunately\nthe simple answer is that Radiance (and any backwards-tracer) is not\nreally suiteable for the task, if\n\n\n1) you consider sunny days (you probably want to do so)\n\n\n2) you do not have a diffusor placed on the top aperture of the pipe.\n\n\nThere are still some promising approaches to solve the problem. One is\nusing descrete patch models of the sky, such as the Tregenza scheme,\nwith the direct sun contribution being distributed over larger patches.\nThis implies distributing the sun radiance over a larger part of the\nsky, which smoothes out sharp peaks in the transmission - which may not\nbe crucial in many cases.\n\n\nThe other option is using a forward extension to Radiance, such as the\nphoton map. This requires a modified version of Radiance, but gives you\na tool which has been developed with exactly applications such as light\npipes in mind.\n\n\nFinally, you may even try to generate the BSDF of a light pipe using\ngenBSDF and apply this to a surface representing the bottom aperture.\n\n\nThe latter two options keep the resolution of the incident radiance,\nespecially the \"sharpness\" from the sun, intact.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009932.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
