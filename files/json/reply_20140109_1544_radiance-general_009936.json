{"body": "Hi Sierd,\n\n\nif all you need to model is a clear glass pane, do not use BRTDfunc but glass. That is an optimized modifier modeling transmission and reflection for thin glass panes surrounded by air (which is a function of the direction a ray is passing through).\n\n\nBRTDfunc is meant to describe transmission and reflection using the mathematical description language of Radiance (see the cal-files coming in the library). It does not make sense to use it without any mathematical model.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\n09.01.2014 tarihinde 18:10 saatinde, \"Sierd Tilma\" <tilma.sierd at gmail.com> \u015funlar\u0131 yazd\u0131:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009936.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
