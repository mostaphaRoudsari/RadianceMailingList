{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nThanks for your responding my question. I have used the glass function but I\ncan only chance the transmission of this pane and not the reflection. In my\nproject is the reflection of this pane very important and I was thinking the\nBRTDfunc will help me whit this. So for  that I have found the glazing.cal\nfile in the library to calculate my glas but is ther also an explanation of\nthese calculations\n\n\ncheers, Sierd.\n\n\n-----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\nVan: radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n[mailto:radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org] \nVerzonden: vrijdag 10 januari 2014 21:00\nAan: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nOnderwerp: Radiance-general Digest, Vol 119, Issue 9\n\n\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\n\tradiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n\tradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\n\tradiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than\n\"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n   1.
