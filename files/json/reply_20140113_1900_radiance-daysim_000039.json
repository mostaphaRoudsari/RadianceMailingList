{"body": "Hi Mostapha ,\n\n\nThat keyword indicates the number of user types in the space. For example  \nan user profile named 'active' comes after it, 'active 100 1 3.' If you  \nwanted to simultaneously simulate a passive user as well, you would set  \nthe user_profile to 2. Its been a long time since I worked with this  \nkeyword, but from memory I think if you have 2 user profiles, it will  \nproduce separate active and passive daylight autonomy (plus other metrics)  \nand interior gains schedule files.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 13 Jan 2014 16:29:21 -0500, Mostapha Sadeghipour\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-January/000039.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "January 13, 2014 at 07:00PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000038", "id": "radiance-daysim_000039"}
