{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nYes, the latest version of falsecolor is a Perl script, requiring Perl to be installed on your system. A couple of questions:\n\n\n1. what operating system are you using? I\u2019m guessing Windows, since Mac and Linux OSes ship with Perl. Regardless, here\u2019s where you can get info on getting Perl:\n\n\nhttp://www.perl.org/get.html\n\n\n2. Are you sure you want an illuminance rendering? If so, you need to pass the \u201c-i\u201d (that\u2019s a lowercase \u201cI\u201d) option to rtrace to get an irradiance image.\n\n\nAs always, the man page is the best source for usage info:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/falsecolor.pdf\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009940.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 14, 2014 at 12:01PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009939", "id": "radiance-general_009940"}
