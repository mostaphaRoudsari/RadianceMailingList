{"body": "Hi Sierd,\n\n\nas Christopher wrote in his mail, you should consider Optics as a \nstarting point if you have a e.g. coated glazing. Whatever you do, \nreflection and transmission should be a function of the incident \ndirection for clear glazings. One other approach may be the trans \nmaterial, which allows to define reflection and transmission at normal \nincidence. The angular dependance will follow a Fresnel-term if you stay \nwith only clear transmission and reflection, roughness=0. This may be \nwhat you want?\n\n\nPeter did a very nice comparision on the various models available in \nRadiance:\n\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4214.pdf\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009944.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
