{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nYou can give the direction vector in rtrace command to get irradiance\nvalue. Check rtrace manual.\nFor example: If you assign input arguments \"xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir\"\nas \"xorg yorg zorg 0 0 1\" then you will get irradiance at the horizontal\nplane (or floor of the building). Similarly, you can do for other vertical\nplanes by assigning their correct location and direction. To convert\nirradiance to illuminance, see this command:\n\n\n$ echo xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir | rtrace -I [options] yourScene.oct |\nrcalc -e \u2019$1=$2;$2=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)\u2019\n\n\nRegards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009948.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "January 19, 2014 at 08:02PM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009947", "id": "radiance-general_009948"}
