{"body": "Hi Maria,\n\n\nThank you for following good list etiquette and posting your image on a website.  You may want to check to be sure that you are subscribed with the HDRI mailing list <http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists>, as I had to manually pass your post onto the list.  We don't seem to have you in our system, at least not at this address.\n\n\nI can't say seeing your light probe which is just shown as white out the window, but mksource will tend to create multiple sources for long, skinny regions.  Reducing the -d setting will reduce the maximum number of sources created in this way.  Your threshold setting also seems to be quite low, and you might consider letting mksource determine this threshold automatically.\n\n\nThe general idea with mksource is to replace only the very brightest regions in a distant environment map with direct sources.  The rest will be handled well enough in the indirect calculation.  Which brings me to my last point -- are you giving mksource the room description as well as the exterior environment?  It completely ignores the local geometry, using only your environment map (light probe) to decide where to place sources.  Perhaps you could post that?\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-January/000508.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 20, 2014 at 11:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000507", "id": "hdri_000508"}
