Thanks!\n\n\nI think once you patch up your install, that will work.\n\n\nThere really isn't much current documentation.  Me, I'd be inclined to \nget the current cvs version from radiance-online.org and follow the \ninstructions in the README, but that's a bit much if you aren't a \nsoftware dinosaur like me.  I think one could probably create a Debian \nsource package without too much trouble, since most of that work is \nalready done, but I'm not sure of the procedures.\n\n\nRob?\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Vaib\n> \n> \n> On 21 January 2014 01:54, Randolph M.
