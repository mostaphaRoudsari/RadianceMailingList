{"body": "Hi Greg, \n\n\nThanks for your response. \nI've also tried to run the simulation using mksource default parameters, I\nobtained this picture but it seems that there is too many sources identified\n(see finalsceneview02.tif in\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ra7xtansk8rdz0/z0aG1qlTHr ). I thought that in\nincreasing -d, the problem disappears. In this simulation, I gave the room\ndescription but the ground is not specified because I was not sure on how to\ndescribe it in IBL.\nIn the following simulation I added the ground in describing it using\ngensky... I am not sure that it is a good idea (see finalsceneview02.tif in\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/4gu3onc08d933ea/xIwc2E9Kc6 ).\n\n\nIn these two folders you also will find the local geometry, the light probe\nimage...\n\n\nThanks, \nBeatriz\nEl 20-01-2014, a las 16:28, Gregory J.
