{"body": "Hi Bernhard,\n\n\nThis formula comes from the more general formula you can compute from the normal transmittance and index of refraction.  If you look in ray/src/cal/cal, you will find the file \"trans.cal\" that contains the more complete definition.  The numbers you quoted are the simplification of the equations with the index of refraction (n) set to 1.52, a typical value for glass.\n\n\nThe formula itself was derived from Fresnel's equations and the infinite series solution for float glass.  You can trust me on that or re-derive it yourself, as I don't have the derivation handy.  I don't know if there is an ISO standard where you can look it up.\n\n\nFor double-paned glazing, there are some good approximations built into the glaze script, which is distributed with Radiance.  It does not provide formulas, however.  The DOE Window program is available from:\n\n\n\thttp://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/6/W63_faq.html\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009959.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 24, 2014 at 11:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_007470", "id": "radiance-general_009959"}
