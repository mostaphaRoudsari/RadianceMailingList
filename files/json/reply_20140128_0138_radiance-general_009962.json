{"body": "Dear Greg\n\n\nI hope you don't mind me contacting you - i'm a lecturer and researcher at De Montfort University, working on an exciting HDR project with Birgit Painter. Birgit has told me a lot about the work that she did with Denis Fan and John Mardaljevic.\n\n\nThe current project involves using a Raspberry Pi to capture bracketed shots and I would love to be able to code Radiance onto it. I saw a post on radiance-online (regarding Beagle Bone), and therefore wondered if a compatible version of the code was now available for a Raspberry Pi please? I have trawled the internet and not as yet found a suitable version.\n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\n\nKind regards\n\n\nMarie\n____________________________________________\n\n\nDr. Marie Bassford MPhys PhD MInstP\nBSc/MPhys Physics Course Leader \nSenior Lecturer, Faculty of Technology\nMember of the Centre for Computational Intelligence\nSTEM Ambassador\n\n\nDe Montfort University\nT: +44 (0) 116 2577055\nE: mbassford at dmu.ac.uk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009962.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marie Bassford", "created_at": "January 28, 2014 at 01:38AM", "created_by": "Marie_Bassford", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009482", "id": "radiance-general_009962"}
