{"body": "Hello Marie,\n\n\nYou actually wrote to the Radiance mailing list, not me directly.  It's just as well, though, since I'm not aware if anyone has ported Radiance to the Raspberry Pi.  If anyone on the mailing list has worked on this or has some helpful information, I hope they will respond.\n\n\nThere were some folks working on a RP port of hdrgen, which I think they got working.  Perhaps this would be useful to your project as well?\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009963.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 28, 2014 at 10:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009482", "id": "radiance-general_009963"}
