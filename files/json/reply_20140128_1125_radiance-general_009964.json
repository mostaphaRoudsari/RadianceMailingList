{"body": "Dear Marie,\n\n\nthe raspberry pi is just a Linux system with limited resources. If you have a Debian system installed,\n\n\nsudo apt-get install radiance\n\n\nshould be all you need to install Radiance, given a working Internet connection or installation media.\n\n\nThere used to be a define to reduce memory requirements by using single precision floats when compiling Radiance, but probably no one used that for decades.\n\n\nAll in all, using the image processing tools may make sense, but I would not spend my time trying to get complete renderings from such hardware :)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009964.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
