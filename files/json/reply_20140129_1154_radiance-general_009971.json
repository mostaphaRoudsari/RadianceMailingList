{"body": "If you use antimatter, you will need to create a box that cuts through the wall to make an opening, creating more geometry than simply making an opening in the wall in the first place.\n\n\nUsing mixfunc, you can alternate materials in the wall, but if the wall has thickness, you will end up seeing \"into\" the wall this way, unless you also insert some sill geometry.  Again, it ends up being easier to create the opening for a thick wall.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009971.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 29, 2014 at 11:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009966", "id": "radiance-general_009971"}
