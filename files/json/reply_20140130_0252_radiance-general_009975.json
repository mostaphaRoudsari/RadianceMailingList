It's worth speaking to your\nlocal rep and asking about a loan of the equipment; they will have a\nsales model which you might be able to borrow for a few days. I've\ndone this in the past with other (horribly expensive) Minolta\nequipment.\n\n\nYou can also use a Macbeth, as Robert says. With a good camera, good\nlighting, careful photography, and careful processing you can expect\nabout a 4 dE average error, in my experience. This is not good enough\nfor applications like paint matching, where you really need to be\nunder 1, but may be OK for what you need.\n\n\nI have some software for calibrating off a Macbeth as well, it might\nbe easier to use than the macbethcal utility.\n\n\nhttp://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Colour_calibration_with_nip2\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009975.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Cupitt", "created_at": "January 30, 2014 at 02:52AM", "created_by": "John_Cupitt", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009969", "id": "radiance-general_009975"}
