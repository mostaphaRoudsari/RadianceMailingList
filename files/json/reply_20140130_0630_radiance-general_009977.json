{"body": "Hi George,\n\n\ngensky makes use of the standard sky distributions overcast (cloudy), clear (sunny) plus intermediate. The distributions are thus given, not affected by a turbidity. The turbidity value would be used to \"scale\" the distributions if you rely on the model-based assumptions instead of using measured / otherwise expected illuminance or luminance, but not when you pass that value using the -B parameter. Thus, in your case, you get a sunny sky and the turbidity is simply ignored. If you skip the -B parameter, then the sky luminance will be scaled based on the models included in gensky, and these would make use of the turbidity parameter. You can check this by varying -t and removing -B 55.87.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009977.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
