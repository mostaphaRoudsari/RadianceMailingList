{"body": "Thanks Lars/Greg,\n\n\nAh, I had expected increased turbidity to result in scattering that \ncorrelated with object-distance.\n\n\nI was hoping to estimate (roughly) how scatter changes the colour of \nstuff beneath water as a function of turbidity and distance (and viewing \ndirection). I may need to rein in my ambitions.\n\n\n\n\nWith regard to mist: By \"specfic light sources\" I take it you don't mean \ngensky then? Do you have a simple example of mist being used in a small \nmodel? I can then work this into my already bloated matlab wrapper.\n\n\n\"genocean\" I get it ;-) , but not before foolishly googling-it!\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 30/01/2014 16:07, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009981.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "P George Lovell", "created_at": "January 31, 2014 at 06:29AM", "created_by": "P_George_Lovell", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009976", "id": "radiance-general_009981"}
