{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nI developed a model which applies angular distance between any point on the\nsky and Sun disc to calculate radiance fraction and then having radiance\ndistribution and horizontal diffuse irradiation, radiance or even luminance\nof each point under clear sky condition can be calculated! I hope this\ninformation can be useful:)\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nEhsan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009985.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "created_at": "January 31, 2014 at 07:00PM", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009980", "id": "radiance-general_009985"}
