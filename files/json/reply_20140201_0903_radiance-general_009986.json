{"body": "Thanks Greg and Iebele,\n\n\nSeems like there are two possible solutions: 1) per Greg's suggestion, \nmonitor and wait for the files to unlock (or kill them); or, 2) create \noctrees at each iteration (if I'm understanding Iebele's suggestion \ncorrectly). My guess is that creating the octrees at the beginning of \neach iteration gives the OS plenty of time for the unlock to cascade. Is \nthat a reasonable possibility/assumption, or did I misunderstand the \nsecond solution?\n\n\nI will try these (and any other suggestions), and report if successful...\n\n\nThanks again!\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/009986.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "February 01, 2014 at 09:03AM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009982", "id": "radiance-general_009986"}
