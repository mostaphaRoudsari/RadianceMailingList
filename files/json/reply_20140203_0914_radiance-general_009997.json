{"body": "Hey Tim,\n\n\nJust to clarify the OpenStudio piece, OpenStudio can use Radiance and the 3-Phase method for annual daylight simulation (or the one phase (Greg insists this is a two phase) method). The OpenStudio app then generates lighting schedules based on the daylight availability and lighting control setpoints which are then pushed to an EnergyPlus input file (idf) for inclusion in an EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation. There is no limit to the number of thermal zones you look at simultaneously, but you are currently limited to one space per thermal zone.\n\n\nWe are currently adding the ability to specify shading controls from within the OpenStudio app and SketchUp plugin; when this is done, the user will be able to select from the standard EnergyPLus shading control modes, and the effect of the shades will be calculated automatically both in Radiance for the visual and in Energyplus for the thermal. Effects of \"borrowed light\" from one zone to another will also be calculated correctly.\n\n\nNo plans as of yet to implement the 5-phase in OpenStudio, but we'd hope that there would be an easy path from an OpenStudio model to a Daysim/DIVA/SPOT/whatever space-based model, with better control simulation, where the spatial resolution of the five phase method would pay dividends.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/009997.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 03, 2014 at 09:14AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009987", "id": "radiance-general_009997"}
