{"body": "Hi Vaib,\n\n\nAnyone looking for a copy of \"Rendering with Radiance\" should still contact \"Randolph M. Fritz\" <randolph at panix.com>, who has been generously volunteering his time to distribute copies more or less at his cost.\n\n\nIf you use gensky or gendaylit for validation, be sure to input the global and diffuse values to calibrate them to your actual sky.  In the end, John concluded in his thesis that accurate comparisons required a full sky (directional) measurement using a sky scanner (goniophotometer or gonioradiometer).\n\n\nBest of luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/009999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 03, 2014 at 09:47AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009992", "id": "radiance-general_009999"}
