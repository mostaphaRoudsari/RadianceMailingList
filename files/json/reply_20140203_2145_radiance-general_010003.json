{"body": "Dear renderers,\n\n\nMy solution (to the SMP file busy problem reported earlier) is to not \nuse Radiance on modern virtual machines (in this case: Virtual Box \nrunning Ubuntu on a Windows 7 host).\n\n\nWithin the virtual machine (VM) environment, 4-core SMP was only about \n30% faster than single thread rendering. After installing Ubuntu \ndirectly onto the computer, rpiece was fast, and the file busy problems \ndisappeared.\n\n\nThanks to those who gave advice...I hope this message helps future \nrenderers.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010003.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "February 03, 2014 at 09:45PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009982", "id": "radiance-general_010003"}
