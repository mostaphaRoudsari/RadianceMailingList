{"body": "Fellow Renderers,\n\n\nThere are numerous documents that reference (read as: require) \ninformation found in the rtcontrib lesson: \nhttp://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:fOxLoeW5cFIJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,36 \n\n\n\n\nMy suggested long-term solution is for the community to produce and \nmaintain a Radiance wiki, which would have avoided this unfortunate \ndilemma. Here are two examples of wikis that I have enjoyed using and \nlearning from in my work and play:\n\n\n1) The Blender Wiki: http://wiki.blender.org/\n2) A video gamer's wiki: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Oblivion\n\n\nWikis solve many communication bottlenecks and dilemmas that we are \ncurrently experiencing as a virtual community.\n\n\nSincerely,\nChris\n\n\nOn 2/5/14 3:20 AM, Axel Jacobs wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010006.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 04:30AM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010004", "id": "radiance-general_010006"}
