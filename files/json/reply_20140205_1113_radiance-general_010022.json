{"body": "Thank you Chien Si for mentioning Ladybug.\n\n\nAlejandro, You can use Honeybee which is a part of Ladybug plugin (\nhttp://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug) to prepare the geometry and\nwrite the files (sky files, rad files for the geometry and materials).\nThere are components to create the materials and assign them to the\ngeometry.\n\n\nI haven't announced the release for Honeybee yet but you can download it\nform the github repository: https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/\n\n\nCurrently you can run rtrace and rpict lines from the runDaylightAnalysis\ncomponents. The project is open source though and you can modify the code\nto suite the purpose of your study or you can develop a new component to\nrun forward raytracing simulations from Honeybee/Ladybug. The latter sounds\nperfect to me! ;).\n\n\nI can send you an example file if that helps.\n\n\nCheers,\nMostapha\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 5, 2014 at 12:48 PM, Chien Si Harriman <chien.harriman at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010022.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010007", "id": "radiance-general_010022"}
