{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nas I second that a FAQ would be really useful, a short comment. I am among the many who brought up that idea here and than. The infrastructure is rather easy to set up. I did with a CMS (Drupal), a FAQ template to fill, some useful tools such as a TeX interpreter to enable writing math into the FAQ. It works well. Pitfalls are others:\n\n\n1) spammer - even with spam protection, a site without content review gets filled with spam easily - captchas do not entirely filter out this\n\n\n2) the volume of the knowledge around - compiling a list with only the top 20 Q&As is a lot of work if you want to be accurate (e.g. trans definition...), and than - chances to find a solution to my specific question are still higher using the search engine of the mailing list archive\n\n\n3) maintenance - the archives have recorded decades of discussions in a quite complete approach, who can commit to capture just, say, the next five years\n\n\nSo I think it would be useful, I did not even give up my futile attempt, but learned that given my limited time budget it will take me a year just to complete the top ten Q&As...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010025.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
