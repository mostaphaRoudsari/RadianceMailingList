{"body": "Thank you Andy and Greg,\n\n\nPlease do consider the points I've raised in the last email, and let's \nhope that the community makes an effort to upload content. I am willing \nto partake in the organization and uploading of portions of the \nradiance-online content, but a plan of action would be a good first task.\n\n\nAlso, there are numerous ways to set up a wiki. I personally like the \nhomepage of http://wiki.blender.org/ and was able to teach myself \neverything I needed to learn through their intuitive structure. The \nsoftware is provided freely by: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki \n--I'm not an advocate of any particular wiki distro, but some just work \nbetter and look prettier than others.\n\n\nThanks to all!\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010026.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 12:19PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010014", "id": "radiance-general_010026"}
