{"body": "Just thinking about strategy:\n\n\n1) start with manpages\n2) go through radiance-general, adding content and linking relevant \nmanpage(s)\n3) add major topics (installation, tutorials, etc.)\n4) go back and fill in blanks, while keeping up with radiance-general \n(unless realtime updating of wiki can occur with Q&A and software updates).\n\n\nQuestion: what, if anything, can be copied verbatim? Inverse question: \nWhat needs to be rewritten (code, text, images) to avoid copyright \nviolations? It may be best to initially add placeholders where direct \ncopying is a problem, and content needs to be rewritten.\n\n\nBTW: I am open to any and all concerns and criticisms, and always glad \nto be wrong--if someone can propose a solution. Happy to be one of the \ngraduates who gave back to the community, after having written my \ndissertation...\n\n\nThanks again for the advice and opportunity.\n\n\nSincerely,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010033.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "February 05, 2014 at 05:25PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010014", "id": "radiance-general_010033"}
