{"body": "Chris, Andy et. al.,\n\n\nNow that this is going to happen here is my 2 cents.\n\n\nI think everybody agrees that there is already so much really valuable\ninformation in the email list. I have personally found the answer to many\nof my questions by reading the emails from the archive but always suffered\nfrom the poor layout. The attachments are missing and in some cases it is\nreally hard to follow the conversations.\n\n\nI would be happy to devote some time to develop the code to parse the email\narchive and put them in a better format that is easier to follow.
