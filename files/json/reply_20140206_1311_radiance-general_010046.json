{"body": "Hi Zack,\n\n\nI have to admit that calling it 2.5-phase was a bit tounge-in-cheek of \nme.  All those different phases keep confusing the living daylight out \nof me, and by reading the posts on this list, others see to share \nsimilar sentiment.\n\n\nAnyhow, and I'm glad you pointed this out. My intention with the little \n2.5p exercise was exactly this--to compare Radiance to DaySim.  I have \nto admit that to me, DS is a bit of a black box, but this is probably \nonly because I don't use it much.\n\n\nAlso, nailing down a nomenclature of dds terminology is a great idea.  I \nthink there is much confusion as to what the different methods and \nsoftware packages can and cannot do, so having some overview of \ncapabilities, fields of application, accuracy, limitations etc would be \ngreat.\n\n\nAnd:  How about test cases?  Has anybody ever compared, say, DaySim \nagainst Radiance for DDS.  There are quite a few clever algorithms that \nonly seems to exist in DS, not anywhere else, making a verification of \nDS results against Rad rather challenging.  What can DS do that Radiance \ncan't, and vice versa?\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/02/14 20:01, Zack Rogers wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010046.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 06, 2014 at 01:11PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010037", "id": "radiance-general_010046"}
