{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nI can't say I fully understand the innerworkings of the DS algorithms but I\nbelieve they are really just an implementation of rcontrib probably similar\nto what you are working on.  There is a little diddy it uses called\n\"gen_dc\" that automatically generates the skypatch and solar array DC\nfiles.  This calls out to an \"rtrace_dc\" program which I think was the\nprecursor to rcontrib.  It then has a couple programs that use those DC\nfiles to perform annual simulations.  One called \"ds_illum\" which uses the\nDC files and a weather file, creates perez sky models and assigns flux to\npatches and solardisc locations, and ultimately creates an annual\nilluminance file.  I would like to see this annual illuminance file format\nbecome a standard as well.  All the new dynamic daylight metrics we are\ndeveloping can be calculated from this one annual illuminance file and SPOT\ncreates an identically formatted annual illuminance file.\n\n\nRegards,\nZack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010047.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zack Rogers", "created_at": "February 06, 2014 at 02:30PM", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010037", "id": "radiance-general_010047"}
