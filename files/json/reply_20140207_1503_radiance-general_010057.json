{"body": "Hi Jill,\n\n\nA couple of ways to search the archives. One is to just rely on Google, but\na better way is to browse the archives here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-general\n\n\nThe best way is usually to search the archives here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/search-1\n\n\n...but this doesn't seem to be working at the moment. Boo.\n\n\nNow then, your specific question: the so-called NREL Radiance binaries do\nnot include the obj directory because they are not part of the program,\nthey are just \"auxiliary\" files. You can get them by downloading this\narchive:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R1supp.tar.gz\n\n\n...and unpacking the archive like so:\n\n\ntar -xzf rad4R1supp.tar.gz\n\n\nOnce you have those, you'll also wanna make sure you have X11 installed. I\nlike XQuartz for that, which you can get here:\n\n\nhttp://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg\n\n\nThen you should be able to run that example scene you're trying to do. I\nwould recommend looking at some of the other tutorials on the\nradiance-online site, though.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010057.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 07, 2014 at 03:03PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010056", "id": "radiance-general_010057"}
