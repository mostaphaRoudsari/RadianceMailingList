{"body": "Hi Sierd,\n\n\nfirst, it is important to understand that the problem indicates that the way the scene was modeled is probably not very suitable for light simulation. As a general advice, model geometry only which is relevant to the simulation output you expect - try to avoid too much detail. In this case, probably you either have lots of overlapping surfaces, or a huge amount of surfaces which are very long an thin, which may happen with bad meshing algorithms...\n\n\nAs an immediate solution, you can try to make oconv accept more surfaces in each voxel and help out by starting with a higher octree resolution. E.g. try setting higher -r values, e.g.\n\n\noconv -r 32768 -n 7 (your rad files) > (your octree file)\n\n\nThis may make the rendering slower...\n\n\nThis is a typical FAQ, if you enter the subject line into your favourite search engine, you will find lots of related mails, e.g.\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008318.html\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010066.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
