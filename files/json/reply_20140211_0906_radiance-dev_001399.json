{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nYes, there is a MAXLINE #define of 8192 in the version of rlam you are using.  I just increased it to 64KB, which should handle just about anything.  You can download the new HEAD version or change MAXLINE in src/cal/lam.c and recompile.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-February/001399.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 11, 2014 at 09:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001398", "id": "radiance-dev_001399"}
