{"body": "getbbox will solve the issue at hand. Rooms/scenes are mostly right\nrectangular prism; and also they are normally kept aligned with principal\naxes, only the sky (if with sun) is rotated to change the North. I guess,\nto rotate the sky instead of the scene must be preferred for modeling\narchitectural scenes in Radiance.\n\n\nFurther, just out of curiosity: getinfo -d foo.oct gives [Xmin, Ymin, Zmin,\nSize] of the bounding cube (I guess cuboid too?). I couldn't figure what\ndoes Size mean? Is it Xmax or Y/Zmax?\n\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010067.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "February 12, 2014 at 02:08PM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010054", "id": "radiance-general_010067"}
