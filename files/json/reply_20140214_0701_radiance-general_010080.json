{"body": "Hi German,\n\n\nthere will be no light loss. However interpolation does not increase resolution. Think of it as if you were taking a picture with a smartphone from the 90's - the overall average luminance may be correct, but you will never be able to add information on detail in between the pixels by interpolation. So if you want / need high resolution, run genBSDF accordingly.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010080.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
