{"body": "Many thanks, Jan.  This is a new module that computes view factors for EnergyPlus.  It is still undergoing testing...  Looks like I forgot to link to the standard math library, which is automatic on my system.  Just checked in a fix to the Rmakefile.  Not sure if CMakeLists.txt needs to change -- I think it's savvy about such things.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-February/001402.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 14, 2014 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001401", "id": "radiance-dev_001402"}
