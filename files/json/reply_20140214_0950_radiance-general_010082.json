{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nWhy not use a tensor tree output of genBSDF in this case?  High resolution on incoming and outgoing angles where it matters is why it was developed.  You can use the C routines to query the TT directly, or use bsdf2rad to generate a Radiance model for visualization.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010082.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 14, 2014 at 09:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010078", "id": "radiance-general_010082"}
