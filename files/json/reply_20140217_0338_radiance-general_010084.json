{"body": "Hello Greg, and thanks for your answer.\n\n\n I did not know of the existence of bsdf2rad, I will try it soon... also, I\nthink I will forget about interpolating, haha.\n\n\nIs it possible to integrate the outgoing radiation with TT???  My idea is\nto just plot DIRECTIONAL transmittance, so people can choose one or another\nshading device for their designs. I want to explore the posibility of\noverlaying these plots with a solar plot of a certain location, and choose\na device that blocks the Solar Heat Gains when needed.\n\n\nTHANKS A LOT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-14 14:50 GMT-03:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010084.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "German Molina", "created_at": "February 17, 2014 at 03:38AM", "created_by": "German_Molina", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010078", "id": "radiance-general_010084"}
