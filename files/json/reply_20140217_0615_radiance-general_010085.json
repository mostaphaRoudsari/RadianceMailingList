It will not hide the light source\ncompletely but the source itself is shown in black instead of the actual\nbrightness that the object (lamp, light fitting etc) would have. I think\nthat was done to avoid high intensity peaks that would confuse certain\nevaluation algorithms in other applications.\n\n\nIn your case you should be able to hide the light sources using a clipping\nplane. Check the -vo option of rpict.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 17, 2014 at 06:15AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010083", "id": "radiance-general_010085"}
