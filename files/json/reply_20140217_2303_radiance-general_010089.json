{"body": "Hi Greg, Vaib and all,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout my question, I asked earlier, here are more details about the problem.\n\n\nI am doing daylight analysis for a room using Radiance with output showed in Ecotect, I have the drawing with all required details ( the latitude, longitude, weather data, time, date and surface materials and colour) I already did calculate all the illuminance points at 0.8m on the grid created in Ecotect and got the result I need. Know I need to calculate the vertical illuminance for similar point I have in the grid that just facing the window opening as I need these readings to calculate the glare index for room I am studying it.\n\n\nThe problem that I am no that expert in using radiance, so is there any simple tips can help me in solve this problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do appreciate your help in this matter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks and best regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHana\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010089.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Hana Al-Jawder", "created_at": "February 17, 2014 at 11:03PM", "created_by": "Hana_Al-Jawder", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009947", "id": "radiance-general_010089"}
