{"body": "Hi Hana,\n\n\nIf I understood your question correctly, you need to calculate illuminance\non a vertical grid in Ecotect. I guess you have already calculated\nilluminance on a horizontal grid at 0.8m height above ground (working\nplane). If this is correct, then please see the image attached.\n\n\nI also started with Ecotect, but I am not sure it has its own user group.\nBut in this group too, there will be people who are experts in Ecotect.\nHope it helps.\n\n\nRegards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010090.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "February 18, 2014 at 04:23AM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009947", "id": "radiance-general_010090"}
