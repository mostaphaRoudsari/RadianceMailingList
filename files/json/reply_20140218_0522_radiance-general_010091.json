{"body": "Wow, that is exactly what I was looking for. I will modify bsdf2rad in\norder to get the Hemispherical transmittance (or reflectance) as the stdout.\n\n\nSo I should do, for every pixel\u00b4s incident Theta and Phi I want, the\nfollowing:\n\n\n*bsdf2rad  -t  TT_bsdf.xml in_Theta in_Phi 2>\nhemispherical_transmission.txt*\n\n\nThanks, Greg, as usual.\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-17 18:55 GMT-03:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010091.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "German Molina", "created_at": "February 18, 2014 at 05:22AM", "created_by": "German_Molina", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010078", "id": "radiance-general_010091"}
