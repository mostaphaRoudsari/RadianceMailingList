{"body": "Hi Ian,\n\n\nThanks very much for your detailed analysis of the algorithm used in findglare and glareval.  You are of course correct that the Guth position index is applied broadly even where a particular glare metric calls for a different treatment.  This was done as an effort-saving measure in what turned out to be a rarely visited cul-de-sac in the Radiance roadmap.  I am not sure at this point if anyone relies on these calculations in their regular practice.\n\n\nPersonally, I never held much faith in the various glare metrics.  As important as this topic is, there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to what constitutes a good glare metric or what it is even supposed to measure.  The notion of human comfort is very ill-defined and has a wide range of variance from one individual to the next and even one moment to the next for the same individual.\n\n\nThis is an aside from the central topic you raise, which is whether or not findglare and glareval adhere to the specified calculations they claim to support.  I must concur with your assessment that they do not, at least in the case of UGR.  I remember when I wrote these tools about 23 years ago that I was more focused on VCP than any of the others, which were added mostly for comparison purposes and not as definitive implementations.  In making a general interface for scene analysis (findglare), I was forced to compromise some of the more peculiar specifications in UGR and the other glare metrics.  At the time, this was still an active area of research, and our particular interest at the EPFL was in the application of glare analysis to daylighting situations, which were problematically different from typical electric lighting scenarios the index creators had in mind.\n\n\nIf there is strong interest in developing an accurate UGR calculation in Radiance, I am happy to help whoever wants to work on it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-February/001405.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 19, 2014 at 02:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001404", "id": "radiance-dev_001405"}
