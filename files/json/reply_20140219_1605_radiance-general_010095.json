{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI'm getting near perfect agreement between the two programs.\nMake sure you understand the front/back conventions for bsdf2rad:\n\n\nThis gives *back transmission* for the normal patch:\nbsdf2rad -t mybsdf.xml 0 0 > myrad.rad\n\n\nThis gives *back reflection* for the normal patch:\nbsdf2rad -p mybsdf.xml 0 0 > myrad.rad\n\n\nThis gives *front transmission* for the normal patch:\nbsdf2rad -p mybsdf.xml 180 0 > myrad.rad\n\n\nThis gives *front reflection* for the normal patch:\nbsdf2rad -t mybsdf.xml 180 0 > myrad.rad\n\n\nAnd yes, when your theta is greater than 90 (to get front values) the\ncurrent behavior is that -t  gives reflection and -p gives transmission\n(not sure if this is expected!)\n\n\nIf you're still not getting agreement, send me your xml file in a separate\nemail.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010095.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 19, 2014 at 04:05PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010078", "id": "radiance-general_010095"}
