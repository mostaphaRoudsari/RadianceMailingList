{"body": "Hi Greg and David,\n\n\nThat is great.  I looked at the man page of rsensor program, that is what I\nneed.  I have a few questions for which I am struggling.\n\n\n   1.  you mentioned I still have to use a cone to cutoff light even if I\n   define the sensitivity data files?  should I list all from 0-90 (row\n   degree) in the row or just view angle range (e.g., from 0 - 54 deg in row)?\n     does the program do some interpolation for angles are not defined in the\n   sensor files?\n   2. Our program was built based on Daysim, and use gen_dc to generate\n   daylight coefficient and us ds_illum to calculate the sensor readings. The\n   readings are cosine weighted, but it seems no way to integrate rsensor with\n   ds_ill or .dc files. I understand the 3 or 5 phase DC methods is good to\n   handle this. Since we already have the code from Daysim, it may be easy to\n   directly integrate resensor with current Daysim generated .dc files? Do you\n   have some suggestion?\n   3. If we use three phase DC method, we have to generate the BSDF files,\n    genBSDF +f +b will double the time, so for blinds in the south wall\n   settings, I only need use deault (+b only, not +f), is tha right?  +b will\n   generate Transmission From (Window 6 convention), is that right?\n\n\n  Thank you very much,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010106.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "February 20, 2014 at 10:37AM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010100", "id": "radiance-general_010106"}
