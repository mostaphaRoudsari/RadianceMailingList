{"body": "Hi Nithya,\n\n\nThis belongs in the non-existent FAQ.  Did you run a search on evalglare in the mailing list?\n\n\nThe \"getinfo -d\" command only reports the dimensions, not the view.  If you run getinfo without the -d, you should see a line of the form:\n\n\nVIEW= [various -v options]\n\n\nIf you don't, then that is your problem with evalglare.  Where did the picture originate?\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010117.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 21, 2014 at 03:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010113", "id": "radiance-general_010117"}
