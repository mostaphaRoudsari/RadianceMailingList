{"body": "Chantal,\n\n\nIn order to use BSDFs in EnergyPlus you will have to use WINDOW.\n\n\nIn window, after you create a Glazing system, you can \"report as an IDF\nBSDF file\" (or something like that). A big file will be created, with one\nfront transmission and one reflection matrix per each layer, plus one\nvector that represents the absorbtance of each layer.  In addition to that,\nthe file will contain several other EPlus elements (basis, etc).\n\n\nIf you design the CFS yourself, and use Radiance to assess the BSDF, you\ncan import it to WINDOW by creating a \"new Shading System from xml file\"\n(or something like that).\n\n\nIf I remember correctly, the IDF-BSDF file will contain everything needed\nup to the construction you have to assign to the model. So, you should just\npaste it on your in.IDF file, and assign the construction correctly.\n\n\nI hope it helps, I am telling you this from memory, so some specifics might\nbe wrong.\n\n\nGood Luck with this!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Molina\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-21 14:38 GMT-03:00 minchaca <miinchaca at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-February/000117.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "February 21, 2014 at 11:17AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000116", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000117"}
