{"body": "Chantal,\n\n\nI understand WINDOW does not support Tregenza basis. However, I guess that if you have the \"raw data\" obtained from the photogoniometer, you could mannage to use Radiance's bsdf2klems program (probably not available in the NREL's binaries).\n\n\nAnother option might be to perform the Klems matrix calculation in Matlab or something like that, and write the BSDF IDF file yourself. The procedure, I understand, is Very explained in detailed in two papers named \"A new method for calculating solar heat gains\" by J. Klems.\n\n\nNone of these options is straightforward... They might end up being quite hard, actually.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\nPs: I am answering from my phone, which  is in spanish, so the \"autocorrect\" might have caused some gramatical and spelling disasters... Sorry for that\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-February/000119.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n", "created_at": "February 23, 2014 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000116", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000119"}
