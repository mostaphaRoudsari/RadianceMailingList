{"body": "Hi.\n\n\n>> May I ask you one more thing (even if I kind of 'feel' what is gonna be the answer) :\n>> what about if the xml file was generated by a photogoniometer, based in Tregenza's subdivision of the sky?\n>> \n>> Do you know if there is a way to import such file in Window? \n\n\nDavid presented examples step by step where he imported data into Window6. Check recent workshop presentations please. However you would need 145x145 BSDF values according to the Klems subdivisions for following the method. Is your data measured or from genBSDF?\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-February/000120.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
