{"body": "Chantal,\n\n\nI understand WINDOW does not support Tregenza basis. However, I guess that\nif you have the \"raw data\" obtained from the photogoniometer, you could\nmannage to use Radiance's bsdf2klems program (probably not available in the\nNREL's binaries).\n\n\nAnother option might be to perform the Klems matrix calculation in Matlab\nor something like that, and write the BSDF IDF file yourself. The\nprocedure, I understand, is Very explained in detailed in two papers named\n\"A new method for calculating solar heat gains\" by J. Klems.\n\n\nNone of these options is straightforward... They might end up being quite\nhard, actually.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\nPs: I am answering from my phone, which  is in spanish, so the\n\"autocorrect\" might have caused some gramatical and spelling disasters...\nSorry for that\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-23 20:38 GMT-03:00 Lars O.
