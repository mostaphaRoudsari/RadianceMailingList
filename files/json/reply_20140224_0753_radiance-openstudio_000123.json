{"body": "Hi Chantal,\n\n\nI'm not completely sure about that, but if I remember right, you can use\nthe bsdf2klems routine for your problem. Therefore you need to properly\nspecify you angle basis (i.e. the Tregenza resolution) in you input\nXML-file. If I do not completely mix up things, the BSDF routines in\nRadiance are able to load any user-defined angle basis (as long as it is\nwell-defined). Maybe Greg can confirm my assumption...\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-24 13:32 GMT+01:00 minchaca <miinchaca at gmail.com>:\n\n\n> @German\n> Thanks a lot again, I'm gonna check that paper ...and don't worry , no\n> 'spanglish-spelling-disaster' detected ... everything was clear!   :)\n>\n>\n> @Lars, do you mean David Geisler-Moroder?\n> The data is from the gonio-photometer that we have in the lab, is based on\n> Tregenza's subdivision of the sky.. it seems\n> that the 'quiz/utopy' would be to translate tregenza to klems basis.\n> Anyway...I'll try to find the presentation that you are mentioning..  :)\n>\n>\n> Thanks to both, so kind of you!  :))\n>\n> Chantal.\n>\n>\n> 2014-02-24 2:25 GMT+01:00 Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com>:\n>\n> Chantal,\n>>\n>> I understand WINDOW does not support Tregenza basis.
