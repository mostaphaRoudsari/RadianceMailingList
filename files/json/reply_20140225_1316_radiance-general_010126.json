{"body": "Hi Alejandro,\n\n\nThere's basic material on (pre-rtcontrib/neolithic) use of Radiance to predict daylight coefficients in 'Chapter 6' here:\n\n\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=resources:thesis\n\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\n\nPS.  I ditched the 'Aimed Rays' approach about 10 years ago and now use ~900 \"light\" sources (i.e. solid angles) per Tregenza patch.  Probably overkill, but it's quick nonetheless.  The 'aimed rays' approach only really worked for clear glazing, whereas the many light sources per patch will handle diffusing and redirecting materials described by cal files.\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn/\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com<http://climate-based-daylighting.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010126.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "February 25, 2014 at 01:16PM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010122", "id": "radiance-general_010126"}
