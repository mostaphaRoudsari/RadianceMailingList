{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\na short note from my side:\nYes, you can import BSDFs of systems into WINDOW and generate new BSDFs\nincluding the glass panes of your IGU. Therefore my approach is usually to\nsimulate only the system without any glazing and put the overall system\ntogether in WINDOW with the right glass.\nConcerning the generation of BSDFs for various applications of a single\nsystem you should decide if the kind of system you are simulating is\nrepresentative for your application. I tend to simulate typical periods of\na systems (e.g. for a lamella system you can use the -dim settings to get\nthat right) and model any frame in the geometric model. However, in cases\nwhere e.g. the ratio of system thickness to system size dimension is quite\nhigh and thus the frame will significantly influence the BSDF, it is better\nto include the real geometry in the BSDF simulation model. However, you\nthen probably end up generating more than a single BSDF for the same system\ndepending on the applications.\n\n\nI hope it's somehow clear... if not, let me know and I'll try again ;-)\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-26 1:03 GMT+01:00 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010130.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Geisler-Moroder", "created_at": "February 26, 2014 at 09:34AM", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010125", "id": "radiance-general_010130"}
