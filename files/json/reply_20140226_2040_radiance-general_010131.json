{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nWhat Andy said! To that end, I would add that tools like objview (for visualizing your CFS geometry) and bsdf2rad (for visualizing the BSDF distribution) are very useful for getting comfortable with your generated BSDFs. I am working on a little \u201ctest room\u201d model, a la the ltview script but for CFS instead of luminaries. When it\u2019s sensible I\u2019ll post some results. It\u2019s very helpful to visualize these things; Andy\u2019s BSDFviewer is awesome, but I also like to mock these things up in Radiance proper so I am certain the functions and the models are are being implemented and oriented correctly, you know what I mean?\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010131.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 26, 2014 at 08:40PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010125", "id": "radiance-general_010131"}
