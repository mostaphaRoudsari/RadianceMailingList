{"body": "Andy/David/Rob - Thanks for the encouragement and suggestions.\n\n\nI've been working through trying to troubleshoot as I go along. Studying it in a 10m cube so I can easily understand how the light is being redistributed rather than in my full model. I also found that running the CFS through genBSDF with an all black material helpful to digest that specular transmission is occurring as expected.\nAndy's reminder that +Z is \"in\" the space was helpful in making me understand why the Klems bsdf seemed backwards. Now my tensor tree bsdf seems backwards using the same geometry - which is unnerving. I'm reworking the process and will post updates, and inevitably more questions. I was finally able to get Andy's BSDF Viewer to compile in Ubuntu - it was much easier once I realized the network had been disabled and then resolved my proxy issues for the compiler's dependencies. I forgot about bsdf2rad, will look into it.\n\n\nDavid, your note was clear. Thanks. My system is grid a 10mm cubes fit into skylights that are 4m x 8m or larger. I think the edge condition can be ignored in the BSDF calculation.\n\n\n\n\nThanks again all for help here and in the tutorials, presentations, code, etc. Once I can confirm my results are wrong and its not as much of a user error as it likely is, I'll post more info/questions.\n\n\nChris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010132.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "February 27, 2014 at 06:43AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010125", "id": "radiance-general_010132"}
