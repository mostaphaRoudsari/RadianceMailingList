{"body": "That's good to hear...I was just about to upload some images asking for clarification.\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up to the 5-phase process:\nI'm using a small CFS model to generate my BSDF, do I need to create an array with the actual geometry covering the full aperture for the Direct Sun Contribution (Cds)?\n\n\nFor rendering - It seems so, otherwise I don't see how the shadow rays are traced that get piped to rcontrib. model_nosuns.oct doesn't have the proxy surface, only physical geometry.\nFor calc points - Maybe? The model_suns.oct has both physical geometry and proxied geometry.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough, when I try the as the tutorial states, I get a \"rtrace: Broken Pipe\" error. My tensor tree BSDF has an error for 110.9% rear reflection.\nJust to verify that wasn't an issue, I doubled back to the files used in Andy's tutorial, I also get the error. Code run there was:\nvwrays -c 4 -pj 1 -fa -vf views/back.vf -x 500 -y 500 | rtrace -h- -opn -faa -ab 0 octs/model_nosuns.oct | \\\n            rcontrib `vwrays -vf views/back.vf -x 500 -y 500 -d` -n 7 -fac -fo -o viewpics_ds/back_%04d.hdr \\\n            -e MF:6 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m solar -c 4 -I -ab 1 -ad 100 -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-2 octs/model_suns.oct\nMy standard build is the HEAD from 26SEP13, but also tried one from last week (2/21) with no success.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral question if 5-phase is unable to work without full geometry for the CFS, are we then limited to only systems that can be modeled (ie, no lenses, laser cut panels, etc)?\n\n\nSorry if I'm all over the place, I started writing this mail at 3p.\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010135.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "February 27, 2014 at 03:47PM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010125", "id": "radiance-general_010135"}
