{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nLooking at the command you quoted, the \"-opn\" option to rtrace should be \"-opN\" for better efficiency, but this isn't what's causing the \"broken pipe\" error.  That indicates that rcontrib is refusing input before rtrace is done supplying it.\n\n\nThe only think I can think of is that you are running out of file descriptors.  If using \"-e MF:2\" instead of \"-e MF:6\" solves the problem, then this is the most likely cause.  The MF:6 setting requires 5186 descriptors.  Quoting Thomas Bleicher from a Feb. 2007 post:\n\n\n> On Mac OS X the max number of open files is limited to 256 per\n> user process. That's pretty low and not sufficient for any subdivision\n> of the Tregenza sky pattern.\n> \n> To change the open files limit (on OS X!) I created a file\n> \"/etc/launchd.conf\" with the line \"limit maxfiles 1024 unlimited\"\n> and I set the kernel limit with \"sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=1024\".\n> \n> After a reboot I could set the shell's limit with \"ulimit -n 1024\".\n> This can go into your \".profile\" if you're going to use it a lot.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the method for changing the number of allowed descriptors varies from one system to the next.  Good luck!\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010137.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 03, 2014 at 09:46AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010125", "id": "radiance-general_010137"}
