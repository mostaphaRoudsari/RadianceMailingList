The .pl files that come with \nthe radiance installer (from NREL) don't seem to work for windows. It \nappears that you converted them to .exe files, but when I follow the link to \nyour webpage they are not found. Is there a way you could share the .exe \nversion of genBSDF (and the others)?\n\n\nThank you,\nJustin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010141.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Justin Shultz", "created_at": "March 05, 2014 at 10:16AM", "created_by": "Justin_Shultz", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009878", "id": "radiance-general_010141"}
