{"body": "Hi Nithya,\n\n\nevalglare calculates daylight glare probability based on luminance maps. It is up to you how you generate these. If you use simulation tools, they may be based on climate data, depending on how you set up your models. If you use a camera, they will probably be snapshots of the conditions when you took your picture.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-March/000518.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
