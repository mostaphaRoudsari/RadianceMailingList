{"body": "Justin,\n\n\nWhat do you mean with \"transforms the solar heat gain\"? The last thing I\nheard is that OpenStudio uses Radiance to calculate the Daylight\ncontribution, and choose the Artificial Lighting power in each zone, using\na script called MKSCHEDULE. EnergyPlus, then, will have to calculate Solar\nHeat Gain by itself, and the luminaire power will be defined from a\nSchedule created with the MKSCHEDULE script.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I worked on that topic during my M.Sc. Thesis, working\nwith integrated Thermal and Lighting simulations of spaces with controlled\nLuminaires and Complex Fenestration Systems. I used Radiance and\nEnergyPlus, but no OpenStudio. You (and anyone) can ask me for my thesis,\nor related information.\n\n\nI wanted to contribute to OpenStudio, but my programming skills and lack of\ntime did not allow me.\n\n\nBye!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n2014-03-11 14:42 GMT-03:00 Justin Shultz <jss5237 at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-March/000129.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "March 11, 2014 at 10:57AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000128", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000129"}
