{"body": "Hello German,\n\n\nThank you for the quick reply. Yeah, that's my understanding of the\ndaylight contributions and the mkschedule.rb code. The part that I don't\nunderstand is if the OpenStudio simulation of Radiance and EnergyPlus\ncalculates the new solar heat gain (of the CFS) using Radiance or\nEnergyPlus, if at all.\n\n\nLet's use a dynamic venitican blind as an example, ones that track the\nsun's altitude. The intercepted solar irradiance will block some direct\nsunlight and solar heat gain. The part I'm unclear about is how to\nimplement (if it's not already) the interception of solar heat gain from\ndirectly entering the thermal zone modeled in EnergyPlus. If\nOpenStudiodoes this already, maybe I'm just missing it and someone can\npoint me in\nthe right direction. If it doesn't, is there a tutorial that goes over\nRadiance daylight and solar heat gain simulations and how they plug into\nEnergyPlus. Also, the limitations of using said method.\n\n\nIf you don't mind sharing, I think your thesis would be very helpful in\nunderstanding how to apply thermal and daylight simulations to an\nEnergyPlus simulation.\n\n\nThank you,\nJustin\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Mar 11, 2014 at 1:57 PM, Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-March/000130.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Justin Shultz", "created_at": "March 11, 2014 at 11:11AM", "created_by": "Justin_Shultz", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000128", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000130"}
