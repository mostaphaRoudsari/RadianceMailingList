{"body": "Although I have heard some things about calculating solar heat gains with\nRadiance, I do not think OpenStudio does that... I did not do that, at\nleast.\n\n\nEnergyPlus allows modelling simple glazing, Venetian Blinds, shades and\nother shading devices, and also inserting the BSDF of a CFS, and it will\ncalculate the solar heat gains. My understanding is that the BSDF-based\nmodelling of a CFS will be accurate enough for performing the\ncalculation... maybe Radiance would be better for more complex handling\ngeometries and materials though.\n\n\nI also understand that VenetianBlinds, as defined in EnergyPlus, allow you\nto choose a \"block beam radiation\" algorithm. I guess that, from that, you\ncan report the VB position, and perform the lighting simulation in\nRadiance, and choose the artificial lighting power for the luminaires, and\nwrite them down in a schedule. Finally, you can go back to EnergyPlus, and\nuse the lighting power, and use it to control the internal gains caused by\nthe artificial lighting. *THIS WOULD BE VALID FOR THIS CASE. In my thesis\nyou might find how to do it with some other kind of shading device.*\n\n\n\n\nI will attach my Thesis directly to you later.\n\n\nBye!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n2014-03-11 15:11 GMT-03:00 Justin Shultz <jss5237 at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-March/000131.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "March 11, 2014 at 11:33AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000128", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000131"}
