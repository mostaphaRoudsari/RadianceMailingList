{"body": "If the VB model does not work for you, you can allways dynamically modify\nthe BSDF by using the EnergyManagementSystem (EMS).\n\n\nEnergyPlus calculates the SHG through a CFS by passing the beam radiation\nthrough the BSDF you define in the IDF file. The diffuse radiation, I\nunderstand, is averaged.\n\n\nCalculating SHG using Radiance is something I would like to know of! if you\nfind anything, let me know.\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n2014-03-11 16:06 GMT-03:00 Justin Shultz <jss5237 at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-March/000133.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "March 11, 2014 at 12:36PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000128", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000133"}
