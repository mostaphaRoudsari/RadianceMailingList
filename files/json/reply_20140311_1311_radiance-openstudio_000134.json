{"body": "I'm responding to the \"things about Radiance solar heat gain calcs\" query. I\nsuspect you're looking for something along the lines of radiation maps?\n\n\nhttp://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/radiation-maps\n\n\nI have not followed this closely enough to make any statements on how\nportable/interoperable this would be to whole-building energy simulation\n(e.g. E+).\n\n\n\n\nNot sure if this is of any help though, as this is somewhat old now (7\nyears ago) and buried deep in ESP-r development branches:\n\n\nhttp://espr.trac.cvsdude.com/esp-r/browser/branches/Denis_Bourgeois/tester/test_suite/dds_diff_shading?rev=1227#cfg\n... based on the Daysim/Radiance daylight coefficient (DC) approach and the\nDDS format, there was work done to explore run-time coupling of detaiiled\nDC-driven irradiance maps for some of the Bestest diffuse solar shading\ntests. Results were quite promising, but I believe ESP-r development since\nwent down another route (i.e. avoiding dependence on external tools like\nDaysim/Radiance). Nonetheless, it remains an example of how\nDaysim/Radiance-generated irradiance DCs can be directly coupled to energy\nsimulation. I don't see why similar concepts couldn't rely on CFS/BSDF,\n3-phase, 5-phase approaches. Anyways, the source code is open-source.\n\n\n\n\n Denis Bourgeois PhD | denis at rd2.ca\n\n\n\n\n2014-03-11 15:06 GMT-04:00 Justin Shultz <jss5237 at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-March/000134.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Denis Bourgeois", "created_at": "March 11, 2014 at 01:11PM", "created_by": "Denis_Bourgeois", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000128", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000134"}
