{"body": "Hello Justin and OpenStudio and Radiance users and developers,\n\n\nWhat an interesting discussion. By now I'm working in my PhD and this question -how I could integrate illuminances with solar heat gains through windows- has been one of the hardest things.\n\n\nFirstly, because when I simulated my models there weren't some tools like DIVA or OpenStudio, or the were starting, so I decided to duplicate the simulations: every model has been calculated with DAYSIM for getting the illuminances for each time step throughout a year, and has been calcualted with DesignBuilder (EnergyPlus) for getting the solar heat gains for the same time step and period. I think you can do as I did with OpenStudio and Radiance.\n\n\nSecondly, how to integrate both results. Illuminances are given for every sensor and Solar heat gains are given for the whole thermal zone; one is punctual and other is volumetric, so I decided to treat every measure in order to find a common place to be compared and integrated.\n\n\nSo I think the question is not if the programs are coupled or could be coupled (anyway, every engine is design to calculate different aspects so soon or later they will work \"together\"), the key question is to obtain measures for the same climatic conditions, period, time step (these three are conditions are now able to achieve) and, very important, dimension.\n\n\nHope to be able soon to show you how I treated those measures.\n\n\nBest,\nPaula Esquivias\n\n\nDate: Tue, 11 Mar 2014 17:19:57 -0400\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-March/000137.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "paula esquivias", "created_at": "March 12, 2014 at 01:02AM", "created_by": "paula_esquivias", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000128", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000137"}
