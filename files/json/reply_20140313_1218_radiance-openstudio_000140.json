{"body": "Depending on what you are using CFS/BSDFs for, you could do most everything you want with the existing OpenStudio stuff, and getting the rest of it working would be a lot easier by leveraging the OpenStudio SDK. At least, you wouldn't be starting from scratch.  I apologize for the dearth of good documentation on this.\n\n\nAs German mentioned, the OpenStudio utility script \"MkSchedule.rb\" basically illustrates how to create a lighting schedule for OpenStudio (and in turn, for EnergyPlus), and how to replace an existing OpenStudio lighting load schedule, and disable the EnergyPlus daylighting calculations. If the dynamic CFS you have is only two state, and the controls are rotationally invariant, you can do what you need to do now with OpenStudio. If your model has complex spaces that borrow light from other thermal zones, or have orientation-dependent controls operation, then our stuff is a couple of months away from supporting that. But it's possible that your use case would be helpful for us in our debugging, so we should probably talk offline.
