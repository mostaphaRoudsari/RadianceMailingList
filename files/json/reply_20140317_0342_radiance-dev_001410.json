{"body": "It requires a Perl environment to run which isn\u2019t as user friendly as a regular binary.\n\n\nI\u2019ve packed it into an executable using PAR::Packer but in my benchmark tests it\u2019s about 20-30% slower than running the perl script since it has to decompress itself to a temporary location before it runs then clean itself up afterwards. When you\u2019re running hourly sims for a full year (around 6000 sims discounting the hours without daylight) that 20-30% mounts up significantly (my benchmark went from 45 minutes down to 28 when switching to running the perl script instead of the packed binary).\n\n\nThis is on Windows using Strawberry Perl for all my Perl environment needs BTW.\n\n\n[IES]<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher\nSoftware Platform Engineer\n\n\nT:\n\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8500\n\n\nF:\n\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8501\n\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\n\n\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
