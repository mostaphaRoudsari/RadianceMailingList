{"body": "George,\n\n\nMy guess would be the -vh and -vv included in your rpict command. These will change the x and y mappings of your view. \nAre they the same values in your view.vf file? If so, they are redundant and could be misleading in the future. If not, this is why your rpict and rtrace images do not align (vwrays is generating a different set of rays).\n\n\nSorry, but I don't have a quick answer/suggestion for your other questions.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nChris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010154.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "March 19, 2014 at 06:57AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010152", "id": "radiance-general_010154"}
