{"body": "Of course.  Radiance pictures as output from rpict, etc. are linear floating-point in RGBE format.  You can change these to ASCII or binary floats using the pvalue program.  If you don't like the 1% precision this gives you, there is the option of outputting to 4-byte IEEE float or ASCII from rtrace.  You can couple this with vwrays if you want to generate specific views.\n\n\nWhat is your purpose?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 20, 2014 at 10:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010158", "id": "radiance-general_010159"}
