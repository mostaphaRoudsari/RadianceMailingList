{"body": "Hi Greg,\nThank you so much for the prompt reply! I want to generate some simulation\nimages for my project, but Matlab can't read in the .oct file or .pic file\ngenerated by oconv and rpict. So I was wondering what I should use to\noutput raw images with linear light coordinates and then extract the pixel\nvalues. As you mentioned  the gile generated by using rpict should be the\nraw format? Or I could use rtrace option to get the pixel values?\n\n\nBest,\nVera\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010160.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vera Liu", "created_at": "March 20, 2014 at 12:11PM", "created_by": "Vera_Liu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010158", "id": "radiance-general_010160"}
