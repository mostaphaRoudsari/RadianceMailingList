{"body": "If I understand your situation correctly, I believe you would need to know the reflectance of the material at the point of the irradiance measurement to backtrack to illuminance for calibration. This works when the surface is Lambertian (diffuse), and much more difficult if there's any glossiness. For calibration purposes, people often include a photographic grey card of known reflectance in their scene and take actual luminance or illuminance meter measurements at the grey card.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010172.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "March 27, 2014 at 07:44AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010171", "id": "radiance-general_010172"}
