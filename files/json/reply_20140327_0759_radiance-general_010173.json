{"body": "Thanks Christopher,\n\n\nMy situation is a little different, I think.\n\n\nI point to SIGMA 180 degree field-of-view lens vertically upwards and make a full hemisphere HDR image (radiance map) from that. I then integrate to get the vertical irradiance in each of the three color channels. These values are calibrated so they are in W/m^2.\n\n\nSimultaneously, I place a light meter flat (sensor pointing vertically upwards) and take a reading. This reading is a single value in Lux.\n\n\nSo, how do I convert the three irradiances to a Lux value? Spectral integration, yes, but how exactly?\n\n\nCheers\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010173.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "March 27, 2014 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010171", "id": "radiance-general_010173"}
