{"body": "Claus,\n\n\nLet me see if I can help here.\nI am not sure what camera set up you have but I see it hard for you to be capturing a radiance map with your HDR images.\nThat would mean that your camera can record from the IR to the UV, well beyond the visible light only.\nIf that's the case, I want the same camera!\n\n\nOtherwise, if you have a normal SLR fitted with a Sigma 180 fisheye, you'll likely be recording luminance maps. Integration of the brightness values (forget about colours) over the hemisphere will give you your illuminace reading at the focal point of the camera, to be compared with the reading from the lux meter.\n\n\nEvalglare has a handy option to do this integration for you.\n\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////\nGiovanni Betti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010174.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giovanni Betti", "created_at": "March 27, 2014 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010171", "id": "radiance-general_010174"}
