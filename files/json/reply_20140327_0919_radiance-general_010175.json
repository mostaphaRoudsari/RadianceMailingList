{"body": "Giovanni,\n\n\nThanks. You're right. My camera is band-limited as yours :-)\n\n\nBut then again. I don't think the light meter measures into IR nor UV, either.\n\n\nThe values of my HDR images are true radiance values, but for the three relatively narrow rgb bands respectively.\n\n\nSo, brightness values you say. But which of the many ways of converting from RGB to brightness do I choose? Which weighting if the color channels?\n\n\nBest\n\n\n- an iPhone mail\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010175.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "March 27, 2014 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010171", "id": "radiance-general_010175"}
