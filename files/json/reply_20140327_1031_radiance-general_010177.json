{"body": "There must be some kind of misunderstanding.\n\n\nRAW image (or HDR image made using a calibrated response curve) pixel values are, up to a global image scaling factor, radiance values measured in W/(m^2 * sr), in the each of the three bands. If my pixels were luminance values I wouldn't have the problem of converting RGB to brightness as everything would already by weighted with the human response/sensitivity function. Luminance can't be separated into frequency bands, it's a weighted spectral integration over the entire frequency domain. If not, I am totally baffled :-)\n\n\nIrradiance is in W/m^2 and I get that from hemispherical cosine weighted integration.\n\n\nI'm pretty sure we are somehow talking past each other, though.\n\n\n\n\n- an iPad mail\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010177.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Claus Br\u00f8ndgaard Madsen", "created_at": "March 27, 2014 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010171", "id": "radiance-general_010177"}
