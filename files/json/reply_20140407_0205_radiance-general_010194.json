{"body": "Hi Ehsan,\n\n\nas far as I understand the scan pattern used by the scanner is close \nenough to the Tregenza patches to use it with dctimestep and daylight \ncoefficients. To get an idea of the format expected by that tool, have a \nlook at the output of gendaylit.\n\n\nBe aware that the sun is excluded in the measurements, so you will have \nto find a way to get the direct sun contribution. As there are no \"color \nchannels\" in the measurement, you would use the luminance readings and \napply them to all three channels in Radiance equally (R=G=B).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010194.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
