{"body": "Dear Lars,\n\n\nAs I understood correctly I have just distribution of diffuse using sky\nscanner. So I need to include the sun separately. Now I have two questions:\n1) what is 10 real arguments in the sky scene generated by gendaylit (below\nyou will find the example)\n\n\nvoid    brightfunc    skyfunc\n2    skybright    perezlum.cal\n0\n10    3.114e+01    2.426e+01    -0.989445    -0.210729    22.988    -5.9264\n   1.398847    -0.010398    -0.415479    0.909543\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) why when we generate a sky for instance with sun description, we should\nalways include the sky scene as a glowing source otherwise the illuminance\nvalues will be zero.\n\n\nI guess I have some fundamental misunderstanding about the sky scene\ndescription. It would be real help if I can get some explanation why this\nhappens.\n\n\nCHeers,\nEhsan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010195.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "created_at": "April 07, 2014 at 10:03AM", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010192", "id": "radiance-general_010195"}
