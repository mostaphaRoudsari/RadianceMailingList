{"body": "Ehsan,\n\n\nIf you check the \"perezlum.cal\" file, you will see what the 10 values are:\n\n\n*     All-weather Angular Sky Luminance Distribution .*\n\n\n*     Additional arguments required for calculation of skybright:*\n\n\n* A1 - diffus normalization*\n* A2 - ground brightness*\n* A3,A4,A5,A6,A7 - coefficients for the Perez model*\n* A8,A9,A10 - sun direction*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding your second question about why do we need to add the glow source;\nthat is because the material created by \"gendaylit\" or \"gensky\" is actually\na modifier. That modifier is what gives the sky semi-hemisphere and the\nground semi-hemisphere the correct luminance for each angle, representing\ndifferent sky models.\n\n\nWhy does not the program just write the Glow Source as well? No idea...\n\n\nI hope it helps!\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n2014-04-07 14:03 GMT-03:00 Ehsan M.Vazifeh <em.vazifeh at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010196.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "German Molina", "created_at": "April 07, 2014 at 10:17AM", "created_by": "German_Molina", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010192", "id": "radiance-general_010196"}
