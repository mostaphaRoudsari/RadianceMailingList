{"body": "Thanks, Devon.  Definitely helps me to know some context....\n\n\nWrapping rcollate isn't a bad approach, since I wrote this program to be very efficient.  It doesn't attempt to decode floating-point numbers (atof() is a very expensive call) and file i/o is streamlined as much as possible.\n\n\nHowever, if there are specific changes you can suggest to specific Radiance tools that would make your life easier, I will look into it.  I know some of the tools differ with regards to tabs and spaces between the final record and the newline, for example.  This has caused me trouble when tried to use rcalc input formats, so I wouldn't working on that issue.\n\n\nAs far as spaces versus tabs between RGB values, I can probably fix this as well for some tools, but generic programs like rcalc are not going to differentiate between fields in a record.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-April/001416.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 08, 2014 at 11:47AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001413", "id": "radiance-dev_001416"}
