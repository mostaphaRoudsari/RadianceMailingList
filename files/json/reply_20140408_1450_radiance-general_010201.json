You can use genklemsamp, but have to flip the sign on the z\ncomponent of the vector.\n\n\nUsing Schedules in EnergyPlus:\n> \"EnergyPls code modified to allow schedule of surface heat gains\"\n> (modification by Thierry Nouidui and Brian Coffey).

The relevant\nobjects are:\n\n\nSurfaceProperty:SolarIncidentInside\nComplexFenestrationProperty:SolarAbsorbedLayers\n\n\nThe built in BSDF module gives identical results as using Radiance to\ndetermine solar absorption in the CFS layers.  However using Radiance\noffers some improvement in the interior distribution of energy (though it\nmight not be worth using Radiance for this now that EnergyPlus has built in\nBSDF capabilities).\n\n\nThat is the extent of my knowledge of EnergyPlus. I don't want to be\nmistaken for someone who knows things about EnergyPlus.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010201.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 08, 2014 at 02:50PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010198", "id": "radiance-general_010201"}
