{"body": "Justin,\n\n\nI understand there is something called \"Scheduled Surface Gains\" that you\ncan use for \"importing\" solar gains in surfaces. However, I am not sure if\nthis is advisable because of the difficulties in calculating the solar\ngains on each surface. Also, if I remember correctly, Andy's method did not\ncalculate solar inter-reflection on interior surfaces, so I believe that\nthe \"standard\" EnergyPlus CFS calculation should do...? it will\nre-distribute the beam radiation just as Radiance would... the diffuse,\nthough, I believe is averaged.\n\n\nUsing Andy's method, I believe, would be justified in cases with complex\ninterior and exterior geometries, where Radiance's ray-tracing works better.\n\n\nThat is my opinion... not sure what others may think.\n\n\nBye\n\n\n\n\n2014-04-08 18:50 GMT-03:00 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010204.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "German Molina", "created_at": "April 08, 2014 at 03:12PM", "created_by": "German_Molina", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010198", "id": "radiance-general_010204"}
