{"body": "Actually, when you use the scheduled surface heat gains, energy plus\nredistributes energy to account for inter-reflection. It's not as accurate\nas computing inter-reflection in Radiance.\n\n\nBut generally, I agree with German that the standard EnergyPlus CFS method\nis simpler to implement. We wouldn't have developed our Radiance method if\nEnergyPlus supported CFS at the time.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010205.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 08, 2014 at 04:24PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010198", "id": "radiance-general_010205"}
