{"body": "Hi Devon,\n\n\nI looked into this some more, and there's not much I can do to change rtrace without breaking other tools, unfortunately.\n\n\nI just tweaked dctimestep so that it doesn't insert a leading tab on the first record, bringing its output in line with that of rcollate.  Not sure if this is any help.\n\n\nThe reason I don't actually output columns on a single line with gendaymtx is that most text editors will choke on a 130 KByte line, although you can get that easily with something like \"rcollate -oc 8760\" if you want it.  Passing to dctimestep (if that's your plan) is faster with the gendaymtx \"-of\" option, anyway, since you avoid the back-and-forth between ASCII and float representations that takes so much time.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-April/001417.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 08, 2014 at 04:58PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001413", "id": "radiance-dev_001417"}
