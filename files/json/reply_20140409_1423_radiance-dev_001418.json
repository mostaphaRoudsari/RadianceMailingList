{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks very much for your help here. It seems like the best way forward is\nto use an rcollate-based \"rcheck\" program to unify data as needed, and\nthen to build analysis tools around this output format. If the new format\nproves particularly helpful, I may have a go at patching my local Radiance\ninstall and see how far I get. Happy to share my findings.\n\n\nAll very helpful. Thanks again! -- Devon\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-April/001418.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Devon Sparks", "created_at": "April 09, 2014 at 02:23PM", "created_by": "Devon_Sparks", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001413", "id": "radiance-dev_001418"}
