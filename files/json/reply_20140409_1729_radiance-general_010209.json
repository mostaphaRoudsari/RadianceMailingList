{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nYour approach is valid. Depending on what your plan to do with the data, you can also use just global horizontal irradiance and use the Reindl (or another separation model) to model direct and diffuse components. I have used Reindl extensively in the past with satisfactory results. For validation work using two sensors is of course preferable. You can use the gen_reindl.exe command in Daysim to convert a time series of\nmonth day hour global-irradiance\n\n\ninto a Daysim weather file.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nChristoph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010209.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christoph Reinhart", "created_at": "April 09, 2014 at 05:29PM", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010208", "id": "radiance-general_010209"}
