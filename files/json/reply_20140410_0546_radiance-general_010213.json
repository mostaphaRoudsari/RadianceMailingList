{"body": "Hi Kyle,\n\n\nI can confirm, that the delta-T sensor delivers very good and accurate \nvalues. Problematic is just sun-rise and sun-set.\n\n\nIn case you have only the global horizontal iilluminance, the Erbs model \nis the most accurate one (but still the error could be huge). This model \nis implemented in the current version of gendaylit (-E option). you \ncould also see the error and spread of the data in our presentation at \nthe last radiance workshop:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co/sprenger_wienold_gendaylit.pdf\n\n\nIf you can afford the sensor, I would go for the delta-T. We used it in \nseveral projects and also did comparisons with a tracking pyrheliometer.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 04/10/2014 09:10 AM, Axel Jacobs wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010213.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "April 10, 2014 at 05:46AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010208", "id": "radiance-general_010213"}
