{"body": "Dear Professor Mardaljevic,\n\n\nAs I understood, to use the source method for modeling the 145 patches of\nTregenza. First of all, I have to calculate the ratio of (disk area of the\npatch divided by real area of each patch), then multiply it by radiance of\neach patch. is it right?\nSecond, in this case, I will have some dark points between the disks which\nlook like diamonds. Unfortunately, by now I didn't find the time to\nimplement a code to create these disks.\nThank you for the consideration and support.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nEhsan\n\n\nOn Sat, Apr 12, 2014 at 1:41 PM, John Mardaljevic <J.Mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010217.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "created_at": "April 14, 2014 at 05:23AM", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010192", "id": "radiance-general_010217"}
