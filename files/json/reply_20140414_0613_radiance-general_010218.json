{"body": "Hi Ehsan,\n\n\nYes, that's right -- you simply scale the measured (circular patch) luminance or radiance values by the ratio of the 'rectangular' patch solid angle to the circular source solid angle, i.e. some factor > 1.  Your sky will of course not be continuous, but at least the total luminous output will be realistic.  See table 3-7, p70 in Chapter 3 here:\n\n\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=resources:thesis\n\n\nAnother way is to use the measured data to create a 'brightdata' representation of the sky, which will be continuous.  How that is done is also described in Chapter 3.\n\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010218.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "April 14, 2014 at 06:13AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010192", "id": "radiance-general_010218"}
