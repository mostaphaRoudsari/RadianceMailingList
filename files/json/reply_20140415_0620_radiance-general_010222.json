{"body": "Ehsan,\n\n\nI understand you can't find the R,G and B values from the total luminance\nvalues (i.e. finding R, G and B from the equation\n\"L=179*(0.265*R+0.67*G+0.065*B)\" is not mathematically possible).\n\n\nYou can use a \"gray\" sky by assigning R=G=B=L/179, which solve your\nequation.\n\n\nThere might be a way of using a Colored sky, but I do not know it.\n\n\nBye!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014-04-15 10:10 GMT-03:00 Ehsan M.Vazifeh <em.vazifeh at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010222.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "German Molina", "created_at": "April 15, 2014 at 06:20AM", "created_by": "German_Molina", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010192", "id": "radiance-general_010222"}
