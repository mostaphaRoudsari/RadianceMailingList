{"body": "Sorry -- this is probably my fault.  To make dctimestep work for multiplying matrices together, I altered it to output a header if and only if there was more than one column being produced.  This is pretty non-standard behavior for a Radiance tool, and wasn't documented by Andy because he wrote the scripts before the change.\n\n\nThe -h option of rcollate means don't expect a header on input AND don't produce one on output.  To get what you want, you need to take away the -h option to rcollate and/or insert \"getinfo -\" somewhere to strip the header.  This should work for your last command:\n\n\ndctimestep -n 8760 -if matrices/directsun.dsmx matrices/OakLand_direct_m6.smx | \\\n      rcollate -oc 1 | getinfo - > i_ds5ph.txt\n\n\nOr this:\n\n\ndctimestep -n 8760 -if matrices/directsun.dsmx matrices/OakLand_direct_m6.smx | \\\n     | getinfo - | rcollate -h -oc 1 > i_ds5ph.txt\n\n\nIf you are OK with having a header in the output, use the first command above without the getinfo call.  Does this make sense?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010237.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 15, 2014 at 10:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010236", "id": "radiance-general_010237"}
