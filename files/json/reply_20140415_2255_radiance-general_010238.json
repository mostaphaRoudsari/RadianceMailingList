{"body": "Greg-\nThanks for the quick response.  Yes, it all makes sense and works. I was expecting -h to suppress the header rather than not to expect it.\n\n\nRcollate is still a bit confusing (especially at this lovely hour on the east coast). Is there a quick way I can take the single column of 52560 values (8760hrs * 6pts) and place them in a matrix/array that is 8760 hours long/rows and the data points read across the columns? This would help me import the illuminance profiles into Excel templates I had already created using the 2-phase method. I'm sure I can write a script to clip the files into 8760 rows each then rlam them back together, but if I can just manage it on output from rcollate that would be better/cleaner. I see the note in the man page about it being inflexible - maybe this is the only behavior.\n\n\nThanks again!\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010238.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "April 15, 2014 at 10:55PM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010236", "id": "radiance-general_010238"}
