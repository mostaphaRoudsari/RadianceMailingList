{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI think the answer to your question is 'yes,' but you probably want something more specific.  Unfortunately, I don't understand your format well enough from your description, so it's difficult for me to instruct you.  If your 6 points each have 3 values for RGB and you just want to arrange them into rows that look like this (ignore labels before the colon):\n\n\nhour1:\tR1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2 R3 G3 B3 R4 G4 B4 R5 G5 B5 R6 G6 B6\nhour2:\tR1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2 R3 G3 B3 R4 G4 B4 R5 G5 B5 R6 G6 B6\n....\nhour8760:\t\tR1 G1 B1 R2 G2 B2 R3 G3 B3 R4 G4 B4 R5 G5 B5 R6 G6 B6\n\n\nThis can be achieved with a simple rcollate command, here assuming no header:\n\n\n\trcollate -h -oc 6 input.txt > output.txt\n\n\nIf instead, your input is ordered with 8760 RGB values for sensor 1, followed by 8760 RGB values for sensor 2, etc., you'll need to transpose using:\n\n\n\trcollate -h -ic 8760 -ir 6 -t input.txt > output.txt\n\n\nI hope this is clear enough, but I realize it's confusing.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010239.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 16, 2014 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010236", "id": "radiance-general_010239"}
