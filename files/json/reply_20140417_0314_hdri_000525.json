{"body": "Hi Fatemeh,\n\n\nI do not know wether the dynamic range of the raw images you get from \nyour camera matches the requirements of what you intend to do with those \nimages. The wide dynamic range in typical daylid scenes led folks here \nto use exposure series. About the software, I have some doubts that \nAdobe will tell you about the internals of their HDR code. So it will be \ndifficult to get support or any information about the meaning of pixel \nvalues in the resulting images. Does Adobe claim the resulting HDR \nimages to have physically correct values?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-April/000525.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
