{"body": "While you *might* be able to use Adobe's CameraRAW processor to convert the original images to JPEGs, later to be combined using hdrgen or similar, Lars is right that Photoshop itself does not maintain absolute photometric calibration throughout its processing.\n\n\nAdobe actually hired me to improve their HDR image merge process, so CS3 and later (I think) derive a camera curve and maintain correct relative values in the images, similar to Photosphere, but I never convinced Adobe to include calibration information in their output.  So, you would need to include a gray card or something whose luminance you measured when you captured the image and use this to correct the final output using a scale factor.  (It is usually a good idea to do this, anyway.)  The procedure for doing this can be found on Mehlika Inanici's site, and also in other posts to this mailing list.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-April/000526.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 17, 2014 at 08:37AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000523", "id": "hdri_000526"}
