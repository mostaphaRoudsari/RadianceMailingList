{"body": "Greetings, ray wranglers.\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce the availability of fresh Radiance installers for Windows, OSX, and Linux, on the NREL Radiance Git mirror (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4>).  This new batch of installers is based on our tag 4.2.a.4 (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4 ) which was created today, and includes all updates to HEAD as of this morning. These tags are *unofficial* snapshots of the *official* LBNL Radiance source tree (HEAD), located at: http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN.\n\n\nA couple of things worth noting for this release:\n* The Windows installer now optionally adds the Radiance \"bin\" directory to the user or system %PATH%, and creates a %RAYPATH% environment variable and sets it to  the Radiance \"lib\" directory.\n* A couple of nifty new utilities written by Axel Jacobs are included, ltview.pl and ltpict.pl. They work similarly to objview and objpict, but are intended for visualizing luminaires (there's a manpage for each =)). ltview.pl supersedes the \"-l\" option to objview.rb that was added last year, and therefore objview.rb has been removed from the Radiance source.\n* As always, see the release notes for more info: https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/4.2.a.4/doc/notes/ReleaseNotes\n\n\nFollow the photons, people.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010240.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 17, 2014 at 09:00PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_008572", "id": "radiance-general_010240"}
