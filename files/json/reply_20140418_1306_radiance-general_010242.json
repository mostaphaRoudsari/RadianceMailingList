{"body": "Chris,\n\n\nYour view settings for genklemsamp look appropriate. You also need to\nrotate the angular bins in your view matrix simulation. You can do this\nwith the -b argument:\n\n\n-b 'kbin(0,0,1,1,1,0)'\n\n\nfirst three values are from the -vd in genklemsamp and the last three\nvalues are from the -vu option.\n\n\nYou can use any number of sky divisions, but the number of sky divisions\nmust be the same when generating the sky matrix and daylight matrix. If\nthey are not the same then matrix multiplication won't work.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 18, 2014 at 11:15 AM, Chris Coulter <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010242.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 18, 2014 at 01:06PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010125", "id": "radiance-general_010242"}
