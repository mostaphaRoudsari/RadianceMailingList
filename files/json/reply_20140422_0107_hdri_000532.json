{"body": "Hi Fatemeh,\n\n\nIt is possible to calibrate HDR images against the illuminance at the\nlens.  I have found, however, that calibrating against the luminance\nof an object that's in the image is more reliable.\n\n\nSee page 9 of my presentation from the 2012 Radiance workshop:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen\n\n\nthe columns labelled CF_lumi and CF_illu list the calibration factors\nfor that scene, a photo of which is on the previous page.  You can see\nthat luminance-based CFs are much more consistent.\n\n\nThe story might change for sky capture, but I am not familiar with the\nmethodology proposed by Kumaragurubaran and Inanici.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 22 April 2014 04:59, gs33070 <gs33070 at mutiara.upm.edu.my> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-April/000532.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "April 22, 2014 at 01:07AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000531", "id": "hdri_000532"}
