{"body": "Anne,\n\n\nYes, your situation seems quite complicated (or maybe just confusing). I had enough troubles visualizing without the added roatations you have. It seems as if you understand the basics, the view up vector correctly aligns/rotates your BSDF (about the normal vector) to the geometry in your model.\nIf your vector math is correct for the rotations you\u2019ve noted below, I would have expected a kbin of (-0.09,0.26,1,-0.82,0,0.57). I also would have expected the vu vector to have non-zero components for Y. My understanding of order of operations would be: rotate BSDF 55d on a flat plane, then orient that vu to your real-world geometry. The base BSDF is oriented in XY, with +Y being the vu vector. Andy\u2019s note the other day on rotation got me to full visualize having to orient both view and daylight matrices to the xml file. Think of them as hemispheres (or your cupped hands) about the geometry of the bsdf\u2026\n\n\nI might suggest a few things:\n\n\n1)     if you have access to a CAD/modelling software, it is probably worthwhile taking some simple geometry with a line for the normal vector and one for the vu vector as it is aligned to your BSDF (assuming +Z is into room, +Y is \u201cup\u201d, geometry lives in \u2013Z space). Then, begin the necessary rotations required to properly orient the geometry to what is in your model. Query the normal and view up vectors and there you have it.\n\n\n2)     I also find extremely helpful is physically rotating something on your desk w/ some indicating lines on it to better visualize things. I grab a pack of gum, my phone, post-it notes, etc and hold a pen in the vu vector and start spinning it around to understand at least what quadrants the vectors should lie in. While this won\u2019t give you the vector components, this at least helps understand the relative rotations.\n\n\n3)     If your BSDF is quite complex and you\u2019re not sure how it should behave, you might try to substitute with a simple blind/slat system that obscures a known set of sun positions. This also helped me in verifying that the rotations seemed correct before inserting the more complex BSDF.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010245.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "April 22, 2014 at 11:15AM", "created_by": "Chris_Coulter", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010244", "id": "radiance-general_010245"}
