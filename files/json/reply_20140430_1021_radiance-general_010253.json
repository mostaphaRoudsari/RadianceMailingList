{"body": "Hi Aris,\n\n\nI am puzzled by your use of the -I+ option to rcontrib (first command) and -i option to rsensor (second command). These options are very different from each other, and I don't think you really want to use either.  The -I+ option tells rtrace to interpret its 6 input values as virtual illuminance point and orientation, rather than ray origin and direction as produced by rsensor.  Using the -i option in the second rsensor command tells the program to evaluate surfaces in your scene as if they were all Lambertian with 314% reflectance.  Again, probably not what you had in mind.\n\n\nTry taking these options off and seeing what you get.  The rest of it looks OK as far as I can see.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010253.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 30, 2014 at 10:21AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010250", "id": "radiance-general_010253"}
