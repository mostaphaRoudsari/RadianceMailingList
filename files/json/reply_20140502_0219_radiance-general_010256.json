{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nthanks a lot for the reply. So, piping data from rsensor to contrib  with\n-I+ , makes  rcontrib to use measurement point position and direction from\nthe view file (as expected)  but ignores the rays emitted in accordance to\nthe sensor file. That explains the fact that the results remained more or\nless the same when sensor file was replaced. Now comparing the results\n(narrow versus cosine corrected sensor, overcast sky) using rsensor/rcontrib\n3phase  method, without -I+, there is a difference (58%),  but it is\nmuch-much less than the difference observed using rsensor only command.\nConsequently, calculation of illuminance values  with 3phase method can be\ndone either using the standard method (measurement points to rcontrib with\n-I+ ) or with the combination of rsensor (cosine corrected sensor file)\n/rcontrib without using -I+ but with some \"handling\" of the rays emitted in\norder to get similar view matrix files.\n\n\n\n\nBest,\nAris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010256.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aris Tsangrassoulis", "created_at": "May 02, 2014 at 02:19AM", "created_by": "Aris_Tsangrassoulis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010250", "id": "radiance-general_010256"}
