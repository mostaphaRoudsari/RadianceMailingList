{"body": "Hiroaki,\n\n\nI agree with Greg that it's not clear what you're doing, but I'm assuming\nthat you're using the climate data to create a sky file and then comparing\nthe horizontal direct illuminance to horizontal direct calculated from\nsolar angle and the climate data.\n\n\nIntegrating over pixels of a rendering is a round about way of getting at\nilluminance. There's also potential error introduced by the pixel\nresolution of the sun in the image. To address this you should make your\nimages very large (~4000x4000 pixels). Also I think you want to multiply\nthe result by 4, not 16, in your rcalc command (you have to multiply by\n4/pi to counter the effect of the black edge pixels and also multiply by pi\nas part of your hemisphere integration - pi cancels and the 4 remains).\n This plus fixing your view as Greg suggests should give agreement.\n\n\nYou might consider instead using rtrace with -I+ (capital i) and -ab 1 like\nso:\n\n\nrtrace -h -I+ -ab 1 -aa 0 -ad 10000 -lw 1e-5 sky.oct\n\n\n\n\nAlso gendaylit is probably a better option than gensky for creating a sky\nfrom a weather file. Gensky will give agreement in this test, but the sky\ngenerated won't as valid as one generated by gendaylit.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010259.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 02, 2014 at 02:07PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010251", "id": "radiance-general_010259"}
