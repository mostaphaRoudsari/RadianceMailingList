{"body": "Vera\n\n\nThis sounds like you are trying to create something like an \"ambient\nocclusion\" or \"clay rendering\"; the closer you are to an object the more\nobstructed the view of the sky is and so the ground gets darker.\n\n\nYou can indeed create this using a uniform sky but you have to use \"-ab 1\"\nfor your rendering or the sky will not contribute to the scene. The \"no\nlight sources found\" warning comes up because a \"glow\" material that is\nused for the sky technically does not count as a light \"source\" Radiance.\n\n\nIf you plan to use the rendering for analysis you can set the sky\nbrightness to a known quantity so that the rendering can be interpreted as\nan absolute value of the obstruction of the sky. I think John Mardaljevic\nwrote down the math for this in the Rendering with Radiance chapter on\nskies/daylight. You should also add \"-av 0 0 0\" or the added ambient value\nwill skew your results.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010264.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 05, 2014 at 07:02AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010260", "id": "radiance-general_010264"}
