{"body": "Thank you for your reply.\n\n\nMy view file was wrong. And it was a simple mistake.\nThough I should have turned a viewpoint below, I took an upswing.\n\n\nI'd like to study the distribution of solar radiation.\nAs a result of having noticed a mistake, I could get good result as follows.\n1. Got parallel view by Radiance.\n2. Picked original data by pvalue.\n3. Calculated solar radiation (W/m2) by (R+G+B)/3*4*0.8\nThe value I got was same as the value that I input in gensky command.\nBut I did not know why it was necessary to multiply 0.8.\nSomeone, please tell me.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nHiroaki\n\n\n2014-05-03 6:07 GMT+09:00 Andrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010268.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u6ff1\u7530\u88d5\u7ae0", "created_at": "May 08, 2014 at 01:36AM", "created_by": "\u6ff1\u7530\u88d5\u7ae0", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010251", "id": "radiance-general_010268"}
