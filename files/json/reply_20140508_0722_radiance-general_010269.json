{"body": "Hiroaki,\nTwo questions for you, although I can\u2019t really answer yours yet:\n1. Can you describe your view and what scene your file \u201ct1_1.pic\u201d shows? You still mention a parallel view, but Greg and Andy both recommended a hemispherical view (-vth).\n2. Is it intentional that your \u201cskyfunc glow groundglow\u201d definition includes the values 0 0 0 0 instead of 1 1 1 0?\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010269.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 08, 2014 at 07:22AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010251", "id": "radiance-general_010269"}
