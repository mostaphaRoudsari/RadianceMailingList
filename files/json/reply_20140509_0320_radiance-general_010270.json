{"body": "Hi Bshara (& Rob),\n\n\n> As far as the 30% difference, it's hard to say if that's good agreement or poor, without knowing more about the model, particularly how you re-created the sky conditions for the model.\n\n\nFor a real-world setting (with trees!), I'd say you were doing pretty good to get within 30%.  Is that repeatable for other times/days?  If not, it might be a 'lucky hit'.  Either way, comparison of simulation with measurements is a valuable exercise I'd recommend to anyone new to Radiance (or any lighting simulation program for that matter).\n\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010270.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "May 09, 2014 at 03:20AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010266", "id": "radiance-general_010270"}
