{"body": "Hi Alpana,\n\n\nTypically, the first day of the workshop is devoted to some form of tutorial, training, or software demo(s). The other days are for presentations by the attendees, on work they've done using Radiance, or tools they've developed that extend Radiance or use it in some way. Rarely has any of the content fit what I would call \"systematic training\", and I don't believe there's enough time in a three day workshop that is 2/3 devoted to user presentations and case studies to really do a top to bottom job of accomplishing such a thing. I will say that the workshops are truly inspiring, and spending three days with the inspiring people tends to spawn all kinds of impromptu meetings and discussions of the educational variety!\n\n\nWhile it's probably not precisely what you are looking for, I would say that the workshop *is* quite valuable.\n\n\n-Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNREL Commercial Buildings Research Group\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010273.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 11, 2014 at 05:08PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010248", "id": "radiance-general_010273"}
