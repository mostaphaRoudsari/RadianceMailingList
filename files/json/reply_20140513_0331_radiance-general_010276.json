{"body": "Dear Vaib,\n\n\nI will prepare sky files based on sky scanner measurements for the period\nyou mentioned in your presentation.\n\n\nThe reason you get acceptable values for horizontal irradiance outside is\nthat gendaylit is based on direct and diffuse data therefore you will get\nsimilar values in simulation. As Lars also mentioned distribution of\ndiffuse is an-isotropic specially in case of breaking clouds. So after I\nsend you the files please re-simulate again and let us know if you see any\nimprovement in interior sensors values in comparison to the measured values.\n\n\nCheers,\nEhsan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010276.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "created_at": "May 13, 2014 at 03:31AM", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010274", "id": "radiance-general_010276"}
