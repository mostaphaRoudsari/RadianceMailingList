{"body": "Thank you Ehsan, Lars, Prof.Mardaljevic !!\n\n\nNow, the reason behind weak correlation for cloudy sky conditions (with\nmeasured values) makes sense.\nApart from that I couldn't think of any other modeling parameter (surface\nproperty, geometry, or ambient parameter etc.) that can be tweaked to\nfurther improve the results.\n\n\nI have also followed all the modeling best practices mentioned in Building\nSimulation for Design and\nOperation<http://www.amazon.com/Building-Performance-Simulation-Design-Operation/dp/0415474140>\nbook.\n\n\n\n\nI will go ahead and conclude the thesis research with these results. Better\nresults can be expected when sky-scanner is used to give better/precise sky\nluminance distribution for the sky model.\n\n\n\n\nEhsan, Thanks!\n\n\nIt would be great if you can provide me sky-scanner's data, so that I can\nhave a quick test to support the conclusion. Will discuss more about the\nvertical irrad. sensor that you said.\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010278.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "May 14, 2014 at 08:46AM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010274", "id": "radiance-general_010278"}
