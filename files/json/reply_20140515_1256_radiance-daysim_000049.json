{"body": "The problem with your approach is that it does not accurately address the shading devices, which need to close completely across a window group to prevent direct sunlight from striking more than 2% of the work plane analysis points.  Shading devices must be applied to obtain sDA according to LM-83.  Penn State currently have a new module for DAYIMps that can do this, but it requires a slightly different header file format that is not 100% compatible with the GUI.\n\n\nTo correctly calculate sDA with a manual approach like you are trying, you can determine the direct sunlight values by running the model with the shades up and -ab set to 0.  The points without sunlight will have values of zero.  At any hours when the more than 2% of the points from this \"-ab 0\" run reach 1000 lux, you apply the data from a full shade run, otherwise you use the data from an unshaded window.  We are currently finalizing a new interface to address this and other advanced calculations, but it is primarily designed to analyze a single space rather than an entire building.  We are also working on a solution for an entire building, but that is perhaps 9 or so months from completion.\n\n\nRick Mistrick\nAssociate Professor\nPenn State University\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-May/000049.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Mistrick", "created_at": "May 15, 2014 at 12:56PM", "created_by": "Richard_Mistrick", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000048", "id": "radiance-daysim_000049"}
