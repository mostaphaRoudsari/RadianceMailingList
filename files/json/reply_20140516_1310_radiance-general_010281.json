{"body": "Hi Vera,\n\n\nThey are a bit dated at this point, but some older Radiance models may be found from the original Download page under \"models\":\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html\n\n\nwhich gets you to:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html\n\n\nYou generally need to use \"make\" to build the octrees, etc., so hope you're OK with that.  If you don't have the make program, you can do it by hand following what is written in the included Makefile's.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010281.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 16, 2014 at 01:10PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010279", "id": "radiance-general_010281"}
