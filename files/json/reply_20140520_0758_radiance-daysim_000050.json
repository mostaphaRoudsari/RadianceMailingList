{"body": "Rick:\n\tIf the glare has to be calculated by the ASE 1000-250 with no\npassive shading devices, won't that force us to design spaces that\neffectively have no glare that needs to be controlled by the user.  Of\ncourse I can use the dynamic shading model options in daysim to limit the\nglare as well, whether it is option 1 standard blinds or option 2 the\ndynamic model.\n\n\n\tWith that in mind will the work flow work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with your approach is that it does not accurately address the\nshading devices, which need to close completely across a window group to\nprevent direct sunlight from striking more than 2% of the work plane\nanalysis points.  Shading devices must be applied to obtain sDA according to\nLM-83.  Penn State currently have a new module for DAYIMps that can do this,\nbut it requires a slightly different header file format that is not 100%\ncompatible with the GUI.\n\n\nTo correctly calculate sDA with a manual approach like you are trying, you\ncan determine the direct sunlight values by running the model with the\nshades up and -ab set to 0.  The points without sunlight will have values of\nzero.  At any hours when the more than 2% of the points from this \"-ab 0\"\nrun reach 1000 lux, you apply the data from a full shade run, otherwise you\nuse the data from an unshaded window.  We are currently finalizing a new\ninterface to address this and other advanced calculations, but it is\nprimarily designed to analyze a single space rather than an entire building.\nWe are also working on a solution for an entire building, but that is\nperhaps 9 or so months from completion.\n\n\nRick Mistrick\nAssociate Professor\nPenn State University\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-May/000050.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "James F Geers", "created_at": "May 20, 2014 at 07:58AM", "created_by": "James_F_Geers", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000048", "id": "radiance-daysim_000050"}
