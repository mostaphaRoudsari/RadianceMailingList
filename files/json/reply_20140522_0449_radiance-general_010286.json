{"body": "Hi Vaib\n\n\nIt is common to apply a reduction factor of up to 50 % to the light output\nof a luminaire. This accounts for\n\n\na) reduced output of the lamps due to age,\nb) dirt buildup within the luminaire,\nc) failing lamps (in large arrays, if all your lamps are working you don't\nneed that).\n\n\nd) probably something else that I'm forgetting right now\n\n\n\n\nYou also have to account for dirt on the walls unless you used measurements\nfor the room surface materials. In your case the reflectance of the ceiling\nwill have a big influence on the results.\n\n\nThe nominal lumen output of 4300 may also not be correct for your\nparticular type of lamp. Make sure you're using one in your fittings that\nhas the same specs as the test lamp, otherwise you have to scale the output\nproportionally.\n\n\nFor fluorescent T8 fittings a total reductions to 75% output seems\nappropriate (my quick estimate). You can look up the standard reduction\nvalues for the above points in the lighting manuals (IESNA or SLL).\n\n\nBTW: You seem to have table surfaces in your room. Usually illumination\ncalcs are done on an unfurnished room.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010286.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 22, 2014 at 04:49AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010285", "id": "radiance-general_010286"}
