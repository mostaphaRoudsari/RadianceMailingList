{"body": "What command line syntax and options do you use with the ies2rad command to create your radiance definition of the light fixture? It could be an error with the particular manufacturer\u2019s IES file, if they\u2019ve somehow made the IES file incorrect in the process of normalizing the IES file and applying the 8.6 multiplier. In other cases IES files are sometimes reported with a candela multiplier of 1.0 (instead of normalizing them first). Can you test with another manufacturer\u2019s IES file of similar distribution, efficiency, and lamp type (maybe Zumtobel Claris).\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010287.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "May 22, 2014 at 06:14AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010285", "id": "radiance-general_010287"}
