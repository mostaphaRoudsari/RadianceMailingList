{"body": "Hi Thomas, Christopher,\n\n\nI used a similar luminaire of different make (Zumtobel Claris, Thanks!\nChristopher), and it gave quite similar results to the initial luminaire.\nThat means that initial IES file was fine (even with Candela Multiplier of\n8.6). I then reduced the luminaire's brightness to 50% (as Thomas\nsuggested) by using \"-m 0.5\" in ies2rad. Now the simulated illuminance are\nquite close to the measured ones.\n\n\nThough I will calculate Lamp Loss Factor using the standard method to fine\ntune the results further. Thank you !\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010289.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "May 22, 2014 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010285", "id": "radiance-general_010289"}
