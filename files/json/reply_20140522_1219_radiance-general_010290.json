If you feed it with\nthe same input values for maintenance factor and room reflectance you\nshould get a similar output as with Radiance. You need to be familiar with\nthese tools though because they have some hidden or implicit options that\nyou need to account for. But then, so does ies2rad, I think.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010290.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "May 22, 2014 at 12:19PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010285", "id": "radiance-general_010290"}
