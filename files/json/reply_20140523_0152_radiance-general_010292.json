{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nYou are right, its better to check the converted IES file, to have\nconfidence in what ies2rad has converted (as Thomas also pointed out). I\njust did mine using ltview.pl, and it looks okay to me. Distribution looks\napparently similar to the polar diagram. I have included the image from\nltview.pl in the initial report on cloud.\n\n\nThanks for letting me know about the script.\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaibhav\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010292.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Vaib", "created_at": "May 23, 2014 at 01:52AM", "created_by": "Vaib", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010285", "id": "radiance-general_010292"}
