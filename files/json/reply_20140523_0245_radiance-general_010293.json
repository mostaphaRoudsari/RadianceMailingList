{"body": "Hi Vaib,\n\n\njust to add to Rob's comment.  There is also a new ltpict.pl script that\nrenders a four-view representation of the light output distribution of\na light fitting or IES file.\n\n\nConceptually, the ltview/ltpict pair is simular to objview/objpict:\nOne is interactive, the other renders an HDR image.\n\n\nI don't think ltpict helps you with your particular problem, but I\nthought this thread provides a good opportunity for promoting it.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 23 May 2014 09:52, Vaib <vaibhavjain.co at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010293.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "May 23, 2014 at 02:45AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010285", "id": "radiance-general_010293"}
