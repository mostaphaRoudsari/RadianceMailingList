{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI missed to mentioned that I tried -s a (auto) also. Also I tried to get\nthe peak value from pextrem. But I got skeptical as these values were about\n100 times more (for sunny sky) than what I saw in some research papers; and\nthe image was just one color. :)\n\n\nThat's why I came back to manually tracing the brightest pixel approach.\n\n\nCan you please elaborate on the \"log 2\" scale approach ?
