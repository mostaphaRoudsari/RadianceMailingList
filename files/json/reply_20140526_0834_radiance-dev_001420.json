{"body": "Pally,\n\n\nThe CVS repo at radiance-online.org is the de facto, de jure, and just plain The One repository for Radiance. Everything else is mirrors. \n\n\nThe Kitware repo started as a staging area for all the changes necessary to get Radiance reliably building on Windows, including the additions for the windows rvu. As such, a branch called \"combined\" was created, which held the master branch as well as all the changes we'd made. This was initially a testing branch, from which we made all the patches for Greg. Eventually we migrated the Git repository to NREL's public Github site, and for no particularly good reason, we left the combined branch. So the Github \"combined\" branch is actually a mirror of the radiance-online CVS \"main\", aka HEAD. \n\n\nLong story short, if you want to use Git for your Radiance source needs, you should be looking at the combined branch:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined\n\n\n*That* branch is synced hourly with the CVS, which is the \"real\" source:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN\n\n\nThe version of falsecolor on combined has that change...\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/combined/src/px/falsecolor.pl\n\n\n-Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-May/001420.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 26, 2014 at 08:34AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001419", "id": "radiance-dev_001420"}
