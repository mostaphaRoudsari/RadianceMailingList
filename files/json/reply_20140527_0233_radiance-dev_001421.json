{"body": "Cheers Rob. Was a bit concerned that the kitware repository hadn\u2019t been updated in over 2 months. I think I\u2019ll have to use the public Github repository since it\u2019s also got the handy \u201cDownload Zip\u201d button.\n\n\nThe \u201cRepository\u201d link at http://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=radiance should probably be changed to point at one of the 2 up to date repositories (link is under the \u201cProject\u201d menu).\n\n\n[IES]<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher\nSoftware Platform Engineer\n\n\nT:\n\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8500\n\n\nF:\n\n\n+44 (0) 141 945 8501\n\n\nhttp://www.iesve.com<http://www.iesve.com/>\n\n\n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>**\n\n\nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
