{"body": "Don't edit the IES file to change to feet before you run it through ies2rad unless you're very confident in this. There should be a marker value in the IES file that indicate what units the dimensions are given in, so if you manually edit the dimension to feet, you also have to change the marker to tell it you've changed to feet. The -df option that you give to ies2rad should read the units of the IES file, accounting for the units it was created in, and convert it to feet for you. Also, confirm the units in your radiance scene are in feet, and no conversions happened in your output if you're using any modeling software (e.g. a square from 0,0,0 to 1,1,1 has 1ft long sides and area of 1ft2).\n\n\nAlso, one of those things that seems obvious but easy to forget, double check any transformations of the radiance light source definition put the light in the place you are expecting it, if you're using the xform command or similar.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010310.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "June 04, 2014 at 06:13AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010298", "id": "radiance-general_010310"}
