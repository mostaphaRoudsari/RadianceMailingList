{"body": "Dear Kyle,\n\n\nsuch PV panels are not easy to model. The reflected light that you are \nprobably interested in is mainly the light reflected from the \nfront-glazing. Glass panes used for PV panels are typically structured \nwith pyramids, smooth structures and such. So without knowing the \nreflective properties of the frontglazing, modeling the panel will be \ntry and error. The built-in material models are probably not \napproximating the reflective behaviour of the panel at all.\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010311.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
