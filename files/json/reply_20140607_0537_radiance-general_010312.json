{"body": "Dear Kyle,\n\n\nWe did some reflective modeling of a PV array causing glare at an airport  \nwhere such models were very important. There was no possibility of a  \ngoniophotometer measurement, so we settled with using a portable  \nspectrophotometer to get total reflectance and HDR photography to  \napproximate the range of 'specular spread' depending on the angle of the  \nsun. Its definitely not perfect, but worked well for the study. You can  \nread more from the link at the front of this paragraph.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010312.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "June 07, 2014 at 05:37AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010301", "id": "radiance-general_010312"}
