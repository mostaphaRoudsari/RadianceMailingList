{"body": "Ross\n\n\nFor a beginner it's usually easier to use the rad command with the *.rif\nfile to get scenes rendered.\n\n\n$ rad test.rif\n\n\n\n\nThat will start rendering all scenes and create the images - in your case\nonly one.\n\n\nHowever, looking at the *.rif file I see that there is a warning at the end:\n\n\n## total number of objects too large\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember why I put this message there. There may be a\nbuilt-in limit for oconv or another process in Radiance. What happens if\nyou combine all the output files to a single file with the xform command?\n\n\nxform test.rad > test_combined.rad\n\n\n\n\nIf this works you can run oconv with the test_combined.rad file:\n\n\noconv test_combined.rad > test.oct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW: Is there a specific reason to have so many materials in your scene?\nMost of your scene files contain only a few polygons. You can also try to\nexport the scene by group or by layer in su2rad. That (probably) reduces\nthe file count and can solve your problem.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010323.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 17, 2014 at 06:11AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010321", "id": "radiance-general_010323"}
