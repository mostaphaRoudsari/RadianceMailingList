{"body": "Ross,\n\n\nI think this is because you don't have the current working directory in\nyour RAYPATH.\nThis is a fault in the instructions on setting RAYPATH on NREL's installer\npage. I'd tell you how to rectify it, but I personally don't know how to\nindicate current working directory in a Windows environment variable (on\n*nix systems it's a period). a work around is to use the whole path in the\nrad file (starting with c:) but you have a space in one of your directory\nnames, so you'd have to do something to escape the space (on *nix it's a\nbackslash before the space - Don't know if it's the same on Windows).\n\n\nCan any Windows Radiance user help with including the current working\ndirectory in RAYPATH?\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010327.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "June 17, 2014 at 11:08AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010324", "id": "radiance-general_010327"}
