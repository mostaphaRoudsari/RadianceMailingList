{"body": "Hi Maria,\n\n\nThe problem you're seeing is aliasing. It's a common problem in rendering\nthat is usually solved by rendering the image larger and down-sampling. The\nrendering has a (default) resolution of 512x512. If you increase the size\nto say 1536x1536 then use pfilt to down sample you should get a much nicer\nimage.\n\n\nHere are example commands:\n\n\nrpict *-x 1536 -y 1536 *-vth -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 1.20 5.5 1.5 ab 7 -av 0.01\n0.01 0.01 -dp 4096 -ad 8192 -as 4096 -ar 160 -ms 0.085 -ds 0.2 -dt 0.05 -dc\n0.75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st 0.1 -aa 0.08 -lr 12 -lw .005 sunny_21-03_12-00.oct >\nresults/zn_b2_sin_sunny_21-03_12-00_full.pic\n\n\npfilt -x 1024 -y 1024 -r 1 results/zn_b2_sin_sunny_21-03_12-00_b.pic |\npfilt -x 512 -y 512 > results/zn_b2_sin_sunny_21-03_12-00_filtered.pic\n\n\n(I like to do a double pfilt using a gaussian filter with high radius on\nthe first and then regular box filtering on the second)\n\n\nThis command will take longer since it is rendering 9x as many pixels, but\nyou can probably reduce most of the parameters (ad, as, ar, aa etc.) to\nincrease speed (they seem a bit excessive for this model)\n\n\nHere's an example I rendered (with much lower parameters for faster\nrendering):\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sc/xxs0i7srcruoe46/AAARZz-44yjktcpcDTFLdUvEa (your\noriginal rendering is on the left and my filtered rendering is on the right)\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 19, 2014 at 10:41 AM, Mar\u00eda Beatriz Piderit <mpiderit at ubiobio.cl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010333.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "June 19, 2014 at 11:43AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010332", "id": "radiance-general_010333"}
