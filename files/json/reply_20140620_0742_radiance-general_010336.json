{"body": "Hi German,\n\n\nin those cases, we usually use \"Meteonorm\" to generate a specific weather data set. It  interpolates from the closest weather stations and they have a huge data basis. For Chile I would guess around 20 (just rough estimation looking at the map).\nBut it is important to know that the hourly irradiation data is generated stochastically from the monthly data (from the weather stations), so Meteonorm does not use hourly measured data as basis.\n\n\nSo in some kind you get a artificial weather data set, based on the interpolation of real measurements.\nIt includes also temperature and humidity, all you need for thermal simulation, too.\n\n\nThe output can be chosen in different formats, also epw.\n\n\ncheers,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010336.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Wienold Jan", "created_at": "June 20, 2014 at 07:42AM", "created_by": "Wienold_Jan", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010334", "id": "radiance-general_010336"}
