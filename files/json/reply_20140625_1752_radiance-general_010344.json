None seemed to work.\n\n\ngenklemsamp.pl -vp 50 0 25 -vh 80 -vv 40 -vd 0 -1 0 > samplerays_1.dat\n\n\nThe above in DOS cmd, creates the file samplerays_1.dat but it contains 0KB.\n\n\nAny suggestions or developments on solving this? \nThanks for any help,\n\n\nBest,\nPatrick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010344.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Patrick Drewello", "created_at": "June 25, 2014 at 05:52PM", "created_by": "Patrick_Drewello", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009658", "id": "radiance-general_010344"}
