{"body": "Hi, Andy, thanks for sharing LBNL's sky mapping experiment!\n\n\nCan you kindly advice on resources that elaborate on how to use HDR sky\nimage for daylight simulation? Does it involve specifying the HDR image,\nrather than a \"skyfunc\", as the material identifier for the sky geometry?\nHow is the pixel value of a given point on the HDR image converted to\nluminance value of the corresponding position on the sky?\n\n\nThanks!\n- Joe\n\n\nAndrew McNeil <amcneil at lbl.gov>\u4e8e2014\u5e746\u670827\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e94\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010349.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe Smith", "created_at": "June 26, 2014 at 09:59PM", "created_by": "Joe_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010349"}
