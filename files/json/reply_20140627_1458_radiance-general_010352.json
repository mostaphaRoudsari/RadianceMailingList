{"body": "Hi German, and everyone else. Certainly one could use these HDR images to\ngenerate sky vectors and apply them to daylight coefficients for a given\nmodel(s). Greg Ward has created a cool tool called mksource to facilitate\nthis process in Radiance, identifying small, intense pixels in the image;\ncreating and placing Radiance light sources in their stead, and zeroing the\npixels to avoid double counting.\n\n\nConsiderations:\n- Capturing the true (full) dynamic range of an exterior scene with direct\nsun is difficult.\n- Using locally-captured HDR images for daylight availability analysis is\nstatistically dubious. Granted, so is using TMY data, for different\nreasons. This is why I changed the title of this list to \"considerations\",\nfrom \"problems\". =)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 27, 2014 at 3:38 PM, CHI-German Molina <gmolina at hdlao.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010352.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 27, 2014 at 02:58PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010352"}
