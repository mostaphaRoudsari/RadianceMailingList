{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nI haven't done any testing myself, I wanted to make the data available\nright away so that others could tinker too (and maybe make it easier for\nme).\n\n\nJoe - You're correct that the HDR sky image essentially replaces the\nskyfunc modifier, here's a thread where Kyle was doing the same thing:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008962.html\n\n\n\n\nRob - In a clear sky condition our HDR images won't capture the full\nluminance of the sun. Mksource would be helpful to zero out the pixels, but\nthe source that it makes won't be useful without adjusting the radiance of\nthe source to match that of the sun.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 27, 2014 at 2:58 PM, Rob Guglielmetti <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010353.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "June 27, 2014 at 04:28PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010353"}
