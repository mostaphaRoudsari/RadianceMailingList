{"body": "I think that a reasonable approach is to use the global illuminance reading to determine the direct + indirect integrated total, then compare this to the integration of the HDR sky dome recording.  You can then add in a solar source whose solid angle is enlarged to cover the \"clipped\" pixels in the HDR image, adjusting its radiance such that the new total:\n\n\n\tintegrated_masked_HDR + solar_source*adj_solid_angle*cos_theta = measured_illuminance\n\n\nThe larger sun that includes circumsolar will lead to slightly enlarged penumbras in some cases, but it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm sure a script could be made to automate the above process without too much effort.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010354.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 28, 2014 at 01:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010354"}
