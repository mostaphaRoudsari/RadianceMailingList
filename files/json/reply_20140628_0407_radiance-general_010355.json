{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n> The larger sun that includes circumsolar will lead to slightly enlarged penumbras in some cases, but it's a reasonable compromise.\n\n\nI thought that (with default settings) a single ray is used to sample a \"light\" source solid angle, resulting in no solar penumbra.  Has this changed and/or am I misunderstanding this?\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk>\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn/<http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/civil-building/staff/mardaljevicjohn>\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010355.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "June 28, 2014 at 04:07AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010355"}
