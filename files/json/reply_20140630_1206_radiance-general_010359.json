{"body": "Hi Joe,\n\n\nThe global values in the CSV file are in footcandles so you will need to multiply them by 10.76 in order to get Lux.\n\n\nAlso, you'll need to add a source description for the sun in order to get the solar contribution as the camera sensor can not capture the intensity of the sun for the HDR image.  Essentially the HDR image allows you to get a close approximation of the global diffuse value.  I use gendaylit (see below) to generate the sun and sky scene. You can get the altitude, azimuth, direct-normal-illuminance and diffuse-horizontal-illuminance from the CSV file (be sure to multiply the latter two values by 10.76 to translate them from footcandles to Lux for input into Gendaylit). Also be sure to adjust your 'rtrace' results by dividing by 10.76 to get footcandles if you want to compare to the global-horizontal-illuminacne readings in the CSV file. \n\n\n########Sun and Sky scene -----> global.rad\n!gendaylit -ang 45.41 85.92 -w -O 0 -L 80463.28 19916.76  |  xform -e -rz 0\nvoid colorpict skypict\n11 red green blue 140621_1530.hdr fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 180\n0\n0\n\n\nskypict glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 1\n\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nskypict glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180\n#########\n# 3. the cmd.sh file\noconv ./global.rad > ./scene_empty.oct\n\n\necho '0 0 0 0 0 1' | rtrace -I -h -w -ab 1 -oov ./scene_empty.oct > ./results_position_irradiance_RGB_wm2.txt\n\n\ncat ./results_position_irradiance_RGB_wm2.txt | rcalc -e '$1=179*(0.265*$4+0.670*$5+0.065*$6)/10.76' > ./results_illuminance_lux.txt\n##########\n\n\nWhen I run the above I get a global horizontal illuminance value from 'rtrace' of approx. 6900 footcandles.  The photometer gave a reading of 7176 footcandles.\n\n\n\n\nI'm still working my brain around all this as well and hope that these discussions will foster a better understanding of how to use the HDR images for the highest level of accuracy possible.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nBest,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010359.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "June 30, 2014 at 12:06PM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010359"}
