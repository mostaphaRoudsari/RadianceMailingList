{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThank you very much for your reply, especially for reminding me the\nconversion of the unit between foot candela and lux!\n\n\nMay I ask the following questions?\n\n\n1. why the hdr fisheye image needs to be rotated along x axis for 90\ndegrees and along z axis for 180 degrees? using the fisheye.cal file as\nreference when defining the colorpict \"skypict\"?\n\n\n2. why \"skypict is used as a modifier to define the \"glow\" material\n\"groundglow\"? I thought usually this position is set as \"void\"\n\n\n\n\nUsing your approach, I tried some other hdr image provided by your project,\nand it seems the global horizontal illuminance is always underestimated as\ncompared to the one reported in the csv file.\n\n\nrubbing my head about this issue, and advices are greatly appreciated!\n\n\nRegards,\nJoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 1, 2014 at 3:06 AM, Christian Humann <chris at christianhumann.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe Smith", "created_at": "June 30, 2014 at 10:26PM", "created_by": "Joe_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010360"}
