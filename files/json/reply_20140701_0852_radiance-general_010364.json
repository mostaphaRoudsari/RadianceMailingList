{"body": "Hi Joe,\n\n\nThank you for the references.\n\n\nThe HDR image by default is co-planar with the x and z axis with its surface normal pointing in the negative y direction.  You'll need to translate the image so that its surface normal is pointed down along the negative z axis and rotate it so that North is up when looking up towards zenith.\n\n\nThe groundglow description is actually not necessary and has no effect. If you wanted to define the ground for inclusion in a scene you could use the following:\n\n\nvoid glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4 .15 .15 .15 0    #(.15 .15 .15 = RGB values for the ground material)\n\n\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180 \n\n\n\n\nI too have been getting lower values than the measured global horizontal illuminance.  I think the suggestions made made by Rob and Greg about using mksource and adjusting the subtended angle of the solar source may be the solution.  Not sure yet how to implement the latter but I will certainly keep you posted.\n\n\nCheers,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010364.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christian Humann", "created_at": "July 01, 2014 at 08:52AM", "created_by": "Christian_Humann", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010364"}
