{"body": "Following up here, (and on the referenced thread from about a year ago), i\ndid succeed in rendering some simple Radiance objects with HDR skies.\n\n\nI have uploaded an example video here with the LBNL Skycam images (June 21,\n2014 until about 10:40 AM) which was all I could process during the world\ncup match:\nhttp://performance-and-form.com/projects/rendering-digital-objects-with-high-dynamic-range-hdr-sky-images/\n\n\nThanks are due to Coralie Cauwerts for corresponding to provide me with the\nproper .cal file for mapping hemispherical (rather than spherical) images.\n\n\nThe skies are used to render a chrome sphere sitting on a pedestal. You can\ntell it is not a real object because it is outside for several hours and no\nbirds sit or poop on it. (Good luck HDR Skycam ! )\n\n\nI have zipped all the files used to make the video and put them on the page\nfor download, as well as a few experiments i have made in manipulating\nsurfaces (either transmission or shading) in response to sky data from\nPortland, Oregon using a Canon A570 with Stereo Data Maker used to automate\nbracketed image acquisition (i have a plan to post the details for that, as\nit is a very low-cost < $80 approach and will get to it).\n\n\nlet me know (offline) if there are issues downloading or executing the\nfiles,\n\n\nbest,\n\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n\n\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 1, 2014 at 8:52 AM, Christian Humann <chris at christianhumann.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010365.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kyle Konis", "created_at": "July 01, 2014 at 04:10PM", "created_by": "Kyle_Konis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010365"}
