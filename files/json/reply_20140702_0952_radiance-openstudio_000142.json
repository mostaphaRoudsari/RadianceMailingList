{"body": "Greetings, light lovers!\n\n\nA fresh batch of packages (installers) has been posted to the NREL Radiance GitHub site:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.b.0\n\n\nA couple of noteworthy doodads:\n* These packages are based on Radiance 4.2.b, which now includes a new Hessian-based error control protocol for the ambient calculation\n* The stdout from gendaymtx has a new format, which breaks the OpenStudio daylighting routines. We are working on a fix.\n\n\nIn addition, the Radiance 4.2.a.4 Windows package was updated, and now includes the GUI applications, such as rvu.exe. This idiot regrets the omissions.\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4\n\n\nNow go throw some virtual photons around.\n\n\n- RobG \u2013 NREL\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-July/000142.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 02, 2014 at 09:52AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-openstudio_000101", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000142"}
