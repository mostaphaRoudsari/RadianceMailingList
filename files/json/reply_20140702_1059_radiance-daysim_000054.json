{"body": "Hello Varma,\n\n\nIf you install Daysim 4.0 and the new DAYSIMps tool addition, you can open  \nthe Java-based interface with the command,\n> java -jar c:\\DAYSIM\\bin\\DAYSIMps.jar\nI wouldn't recommend trying to use the woefully outdated version 3.1  \ninstaller personally.\n\n\nAs for the Ecotect problems, Ecotect should be compatible with Daysim 4.0  \nas the header file format is largely unchanged and should be backwards  \ncompatible. I would recommend to see if you can find the location of  \nEcotect's Daysim batch file and appending \"PAUSE\" to the end of it in  \norder to see the error message. We might be able to help more seeing that  \noutput.\n\n\nSadly it does sound like an Ecotect issue interfacing with Daysim. Perhaps  \nAutodesk's support could also be helpful in this situation?\n\n\nBest regards,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 02 Jul 2014 12:03:29 -0400, hara kumar varma namburu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-July/000054.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "July 02, 2014 at 10:59AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000053", "id": "radiance-daysim_000054"}
