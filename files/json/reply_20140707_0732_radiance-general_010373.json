{"body": "Hi Giuseppe,\n\n\nYou only really need either +f or +b, not both.  genBSDF does +b by default\nso if you only wanted to do the forward direction you should use +f -b.\nDoing one direction takes about half as much time as doing both directions.\nHowever, if you want to import into Window you'll need to do both\ndirections.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 3, 2014 at 12:45 AM, Giuseppe De Michele <giudm.87 at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010373.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 07, 2014 at 07:32AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010366", "id": "radiance-general_010373"}
