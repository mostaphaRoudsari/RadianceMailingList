{"body": "Reciprocity works for every BSDF type in Radiance except isotropic tensor trees, so specify +f with the -t3 option if you want transmission to go both ways.  Also, you need +f to get the reflected rays on the opposite side of the surface, so you may want it under some other circumstances as well.\n\n\nThe geometry (if present) is used for shadow calculation during the direct calculation and for viewing the system, while the BSDF is used for all other purposes.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010375.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 07, 2014 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010366", "id": "radiance-general_010375"}
