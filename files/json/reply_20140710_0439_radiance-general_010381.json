{"body": "Dear Chris and the list,\n\n\nMay I ask if the \"*fisheye.cal*\" file come with Radiance installation only\nworks with fisheye image took/generated by *angular projection *which is\nused by most of the fisheye lens?\n\n\nSuppose I want to use the HDR fisheye image (for example, a sunny sky\ndefined by gensky's \"+s\" option) generated from RPICT as input for\n\"colorpict\", following the approach you explained, I need to use the \"-vta\"\noption for RPICT, is it?\n\n\nIf it is the case, how to create our own .cal file to map fisheye image\nusing hemispherical (-vth) or stereographic (-vts) projection?\n\n\nThank you!\nJoe\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 1, 2014 at 11:52 PM, Christian Humann <chris at christianhumann.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010381.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe Smith", "created_at": "July 10, 2014 at 04:39AM", "created_by": "Joe_Smith", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010347", "id": "radiance-general_010381"}
