{"body": "Hi Giuseppe,\n\n\nThanks for sending your input files.  There's nothing you are really doing wrong, but you've run up against a limitation in genklemsamp to find surfaces that are widely separated.  Your windows are nice and close-together, so they don't pose a problem, but your doors are small relative to the space between them, such that the sampling process, which is based on the bounding cube, cannot locate them even with 1000 initial samples (your -c setting).  The solution is to either run genklemsamp on each door individually, or to increase the sampling rate to -c 10000, which works in your case.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010389.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 15, 2014 at 09:59AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010386", "id": "radiance-general_010389"}
