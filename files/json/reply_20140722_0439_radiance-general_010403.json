{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nI wonder if I could ask if it is possible to use Radiance to assess the albedo of an urban setting, e.g. a street gorge, where Radiance can take into account the near infra-red component of the solar spectrum as well as the visible one, please? Perhaps the visible component would have to be assessed first, and then the IR on a second run, after modifying the surface reflectances?\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nRichard Watkins\n\n\nKent School of Architecture  :  University of Kent  :  Kent  :  CT2 7NZ\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010403.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Watkins", "created_at": "July 22, 2014 at 04:39AM", "created_by": "Richard_Watkins", "parent_id": "radiance-general_006033", "id": "radiance-general_010403"}
