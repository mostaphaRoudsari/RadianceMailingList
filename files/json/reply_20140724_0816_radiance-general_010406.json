{"body": "Hi Eshan,\n\n\nYour error does not really make sense, since the first use of \"split\" in genskyvec happens at line 39.\n\n\nI don't know why you included \"filename.dat\" at the end of your command, unless you wanted to redirect output to it, in which case you need to include the '>' character before it.\n\n\nFinally, I believe you need to set the PATH variable to locate Radiance Perl scripts rather than simply executing them by explicit paths, because they in turn call other Radiance programs that will not be found if the PATH environment variable doesn't include the appropriate executable directory.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010406.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 24, 2014 at 08:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010405", "id": "radiance-general_010406"}
