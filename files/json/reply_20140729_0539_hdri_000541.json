{"body": "Hello Tobias,\n\n\nUnfortuately you will need to crop the image using some of the Radiance  \ntools.\n\n\nFirst you have to set the image exposure to 1 using ra_xyze,\nra_xyze -r -o in.hdr > exposure.hdr\n\n\nThen use pcompos to do the cropping,\npcompos -x 450 -y 450 exposure.hdr X Y > cropped.hdr\n\n\nWhere X and Y are the anchor coordinates from the lower left corner of the  \nimage, if I recall correctly. I always end up having to tweak them until I  \nget it correct. Some examples can be found by searching the mailing list.\n\n\nFinally, this process will eliminate the view information you have, so it  \nwill need to be put back into the header.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\nOn Tue, 29 Jul 2014 08:01:00 -0400, Tobias Porsch  \n<Tobias.Porsch at technoteam.de> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-July/000541.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "July 29, 2014 at 05:39AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "hdri_000536", "id": "hdri_000541"}
