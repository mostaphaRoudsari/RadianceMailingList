{"body": "Hi Kelly,\n\n\nA perfectly valid question.  Although findglare isn't much used these days, that's no excuse for not having it work properly!\n\n\nThe -n, -u, -bv, and -m* options were added after findglare was created, and I apparently forgot to go back and add them.  The other options (-I, -i, -h, and -e) are unsupported because they are not really appropriate for findglare.\n\n\nI have gone ahead and added in the missing options mentioned above and checked the changes into CVS.\n\n\nThanks for pointing out this oversight!\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-July/001425.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 29, 2014 at 02:39PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001424", "id": "radiance-dev_001425"}
