{"body": "It's all explained (as best I can) in the macbethcal man page:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/macbethcal.1.html\n\n\nYou give it an HDR file of a Macbeth color checker chart under uniform illumination, and identify the chart corners in the image.  From that, it creates a color mapping file you can use with pcomb to correct the image.\n\n\nHowever, it does not work very well for digital cameras.  You are much better off converting the RAW files directly using Dave Coffin's dcraw, which you can find on the web.  Getting to reflectance is more difficult, and depends on your situation.\n\n\nCheck out the following if you haven't already:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/sg96crs.pdf\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010427.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 30, 2014 at 09:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010417", "id": "radiance-general_010427"}
