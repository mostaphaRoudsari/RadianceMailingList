{"body": "Dear All,\n\n\nI am using Perez sky model (gendaylit) in Radiance. When I calculate the\nhorizontal irradiance and compare it with global irradiance sensor I get\nsystematic error (rtrace gives around 70% lower values). I checked\neverything in between so far nothing was wrong in the code, Here is one\nsample:\n\n\ngendaylit -ang 22.11 -64.30 -W 370.67 108.20 > genday_03_22_07_20.rad\n\n\nthen I add the sky description in the rad file:\n\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nvoid glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180\n\n\nthen I create an octree file:\n\n\noconv genday_03_22_07_20.rad > genday_03_22_07_20.oct\n\n\nafter that using rtrace I calculated the horizontal irradiance which is:\n150.718 w/m^2\n\n\necho '0 0 0 0 0 1' | rtrace -w -ab 7 -ad 4096 -ar 512 -aa 0.1 -as 64 -I -h\ngenday_03_22_07_20.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065'\n\n\n150.718\n\n\nbut the measured global horizontal irradiance\n (Pyranometer)\nis 252.2 w/m^\n2\n\n\nI calculated this output for the whole year but still the Perez is\nsignificantly underestimating the horizontal irradiance. I should add that\nI used gensky to generate the same output and results showed gensky\nhorizontal irradiance fit well with Pyranometer irradiance. Does anyone\nhave any idea what is wrong here?\n\n\nThank you all, Ehsan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010428.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "created_at": "July 30, 2014 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000309", "id": "radiance-general_010428"}
