{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n I do not require a high accuracy of reflectance. How about If I use pvalue\nto calculate the average of RGB values for a surface of interest in the HDR\nimage, and then use the average to estimate the surface reflectance?\n\n\nThanks :)\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010433.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jia Hu", "created_at": "July 30, 2014 at 04:48PM", "created_by": "Jia_Hu", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010417", "id": "radiance-general_010433"}
