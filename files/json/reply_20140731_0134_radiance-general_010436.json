{"body": "Dear Ehsan,\n\n\njust one more comment - if you use the -O 1 option, the simulation is \nperformed in the solar spectrum, so you can't calculate the visible \nrange with it (because you don't use the in-built luminance efficacy \nmodel). For solar spetrum calculations, you also need \nreflectance/transmission values for the solar range. For spectral \nsensitive materials/coatings, the difference can be huge. (e.g. for \nglazing).\nSo for daylight simulations, you should use the default option of \ngendaylit, then the luminance efficacy is calculated for the sky/sun \ncondition according to the Perez efficacy model.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nAm 7/31/14, 9:31 AM, schrieb Ehsan Vazifeh:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010436.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "July 31, 2014 at 01:34AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_000309", "id": "radiance-general_010436"}
