{"body": "Hi Vayia,\n\n\nUnfortunately genBSDF assumes that the two apertures of your system are\nparrallel and rectangular, so i don't think your light pipe BSDF will be\nvalid. Greg has written a new tool, rfluxmtx, that will allow you to\ngenerate a coefficient matrix for a relationship between arbitrary\npolygons. Your model is a good example of what wasn't possible before that\nis enabled by the new tools.\n\n\nUnfortunately there's not much documentation of rfluxmtx other than the man\npage. I'm working on providing a three-phase simulation example using\nrfluxmtx hopefully ready by the workshop in September.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010440.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 31, 2014 at 10:33AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010439", "id": "radiance-general_010440"}
