{"body": "Hi Trygve,\n\n\nyou can do it... :) Greg demonstrated an example where he used something \nsimilar to render caustics on the inside walls of a swimming pool. For \neach surface, create locations on it to achieve a sufficient resolution \nand render the illuminance at each location. Alternatively, for simple \ngeometry, you may find the location and extents of the surface, place a \nvtl-type camera just in front of it, and render an image (clipping all \npixels not belonging to the surface using the rtrace object id output).\n\n\nIt is a bit of work though... :D\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010456.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
