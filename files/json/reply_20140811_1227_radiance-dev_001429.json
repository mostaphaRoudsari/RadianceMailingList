{"body": "Hi German,\n\n\nIs one process that is running at 100%? If so, it could be that there is a\nbottle neck assembling the results from the individual processes.\n\n\nFirst check that you're using a recent version fo genBSDF - There was a\nsevere bottleneck issue with genBSDF before Greg moved the ray tree\nprocessing from the parent process to the child processes.\n\n\nThere could still be a bottle neck even with a recent version of genBSDF if\nraytracing your model is very quick, which might be the case with black\nmaterials (I see your material file is named Black.mat). Also, I think the\nfinal step, rttree_reduce, will use just a single process.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Aug 11, 2014 at 11:16 AM, CHI-German Molina <gmolina at hdlao.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-August/001429.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "August 11, 2014 at 12:27PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001426", "id": "radiance-dev_001429"}
