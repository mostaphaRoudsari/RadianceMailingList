{"body": "Shri,\n\n\nIn the images you sent I suspect that the sunpatch is over exposed, so it\nappears white in all three renderings. If you create a falsecolor rendering\nyou'll likely see that the sunpatch has different luminance values (make\nsure to set the scale sufficently high).\n\n\nOne of the drawbacks of using Radiance's trans material to model\ntranslucent fenestration materials is that the transmission is divided into\nstrictly specular and diffuse. The specular component is not scattered at\nall, and the diffuse component is completely lambertian. You might have\nexpected the sunpatch to soften and broaden as the diffusion increases, but\nwith the trans material the shape of the sunpatch doesn't change as\ndiffusion increases, it just reduces in intensity.\n\n\nTo study diffusion like this, you'll really want to use a BSDF. Probably\nalso a tensor tree BSDF so you get sufficient accuracy in the sun patch.\nAnd unfortunately LBNL hasn't measured BSDFs for diffusing glazing, so I\ncan't offer an immediate solution.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 12, 2014 at 3:51 PM, Shrikar Bhave <shrikarbhave at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010461.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "August 12, 2014 at 04:26PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010460", "id": "radiance-general_010461"}
