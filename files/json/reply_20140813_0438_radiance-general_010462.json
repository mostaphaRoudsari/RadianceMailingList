{"body": "Hi Shri and Andy,\n\n\nI think you can \"spread\" the \"direct\" component when applying a \nroughness to the trans material. Then, the scattered light is not \nlambertian any more. You can control the scattering \"width\" by the \nroughness.\nYou can see the difference then if you look directly onto the material \n(smaller or larger spot towards sun direction).  Getting different \npatches on the wall etc. is quite hard I guess. The reason for this is , \nthat as soon as the \"direct part\" is scattered (when applying \nroughness), it is handled by the ambient calculation and it is not part \nof the direct calculation any more.\n\n\nUsing a BSDF with a fine resolution is in fact the best way to handle this.\n\n\ngood luck,\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010462.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "August 13, 2014 at 04:38AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010460", "id": "radiance-general_010462"}
