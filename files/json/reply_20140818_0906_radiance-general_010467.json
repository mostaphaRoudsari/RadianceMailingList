{"body": "Hi Stanley,\n\n\nYour problem can be studied with Radiance and either a BSDF or\napproximated with a \"trans\" material. It's not as simple as giving you a\ncommand or two, unfortunately. As for the solar trigger, this too is\ntotally possible in Radiance \u2039 but again, Radiance alone needs some help\nto make this a painless and efficient process. I would look at SPOT,\nLadybug, Daysim, and DIVA for Rhino for said help. In the shameless plug\ndepartment, NREL is currently working on modifications to OpenStudio that\nwill also allow you to do exactly what you are talking about, applying\nshade controls to different window groups in your model, and controlling\nthem -- as one of several options -- by solar setpoint trigger, and\nintegrating the contributions from several spaces to \"shared\" daylit\nspaces such as atria.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 8/14/14, 1:10 PM, \"StanleyCheung\" <stanleyshc at yahoo.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010467.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 18, 2014 at 09:06AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010466", "id": "radiance-general_010467"}
