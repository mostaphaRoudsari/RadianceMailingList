In the \"Contents\" folder, you'll see a file called Archive.pax.gz, which is all the executables. Unpack that, and grab image, copy to your Radiance location.\n\n\nFor Windows, I think you'd have to run the installer, but you could always just install it to a secondary location and copy ximage.exe to your usual location, then delete this second install without messing about with paths.\nWindows installer:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-win32.exe\n\n\nHTH,\nRob\n\n\nOn 8/19/14, 8:37 AM, \"Marie-Claude Dubois\" <marie-claude.dubois at ebd.lth.se<mailto:marie-claude.dubois at ebd.lth.se>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\n\nDoes anyone know where I can find the Radiance ximage viewer?\n\n\nI would like to use the simple \"t\" command to pick a luminance value in a HDR image.\n\n\nI used to have it but cannot locate it anymore and do not feel like a full program reinstallation....\n\n\nOr can you suggest another way (apart from sending my image to pvalue)\n\n\nThx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n\nMarie-Claude Dubois, M.
