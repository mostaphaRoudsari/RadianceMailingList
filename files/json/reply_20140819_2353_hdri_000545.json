The simple \"t\" command works very well when I use a *.pic file as input (a file generated in a Radiance simulation). However, now I am trying to use a *jpg image generated with WebHDR and this does not work.\nWhat should I do? I need to be able to pick pixles in this image to check if my luminance measurements match with parts of the scene.\nPlease give me some tips....\nThx\n\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><>\nMarie-Claude Dubois, M.

Since image relies on the X11 driver, it would require a re-write (using Qt or some other cross platform display driver) to work on Win. So we punted on that one.\n\n\nAll is not lost for Windows users, though. We *did* port rvu to Windows, and you can use that to pick luminance values from pixels, instead.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 8/19/14, 8:50 AM, \"Guglielmetti, Robert\" <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>> wrote:\n\n\nFor Windows, I think you'd have to run the installer, but you could always just install it to a secondary location and copy ximage.exe to your usual location, then delete this second install without messing about with paths.\nWindows installer:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-win32.exe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHDRI mailing list\nHDRI at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/hdri\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-August/000545.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Marie-Claude Dubois", "created_at": "August 19, 2014 at 11:53PM", "created_by": "Marie-Claude_Dubois", "parent_id": "hdri_000542", "id": "hdri_000545"}
