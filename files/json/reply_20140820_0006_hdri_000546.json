{"body": "Marie-Claude,\n\n\nthe JPG images that WebHDR generates are in a special HDR format that \nGreg developed.  They are essentially 'normal' JPEGs, but with a clever \nHDR header bolted to them.  With almost all image editing software, the \nHDR info is lost or ignored.\n\n\nYou should use the RGBE file (.hdr) the WebHDR also generates.\n\n\nThere is a Windows HDR viewer called HDRView that was developed by Paul \nDebevec.  It is no longer available on his web site, but you can still \nfind it through a Google search.  HDRView displays the pixel's RGB under \nthe cursor in the status line.  I am not sure if this takes into account \nthe exposure value, but do give it a try.  If nothing else, it's a small \nand very fast HDR viewer for Windows.\n\n\nIf you know the pixel coordinates for which you need the luminance, you \ncould also extract it with pvalue, although this generates rather large \ntext files.  Unfortunately, you don't get the UNIX text processing \ncommands on Windows, but some are available as extra downloads.  The \n'grep' command is pretty handy for filtering out exactly what you need.\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 20/08/14 07:53, Marie-Claude Dubois wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-August/000546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "August 20, 2014 at 12:06AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000542", "id": "hdri_000546"}
