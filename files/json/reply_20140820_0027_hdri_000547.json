There is only an option to save it as either *.jpg or *bmp. I clicked on all I could see that resembles what you describe but the only thing it returns is a text file?\nPlease give me some tips if you have...\nThank you.\n\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><>\nMarie-Claude Dubois, M.

They are essentially 'normal' JPEGs, but with a clever\nHDR header bolted to them.  With almost all image editing software, the\nHDR info is lost or ignored.\n\n\nYou should use the RGBE file (.hdr) the WebHDR also generates.\n\n\nThere is a Windows HDR viewer called HDRView that was developed by Paul\nDebevec.  It is no longer available on his web site, but you can still\nfind it through a Google search.  HDRView displays the pixel's RGB under\nthe cursor in the status line.  I am not sure if this takes into account\nthe exposure value, but do give it a try.  If nothing else, it's a small\nand very fast HDR viewer for Windows.\n\n\nIf you know the pixel coordinates for which you need the luminance, you\ncould also extract it with pvalue, although this generates rather large\ntext files.  Unfortunately, you don't get the UNIX text processing\ncommands on Windows, but some are available as extra downloads.  The\n'grep' command is pretty handy for filtering out exactly what you need.\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 20/08/14 07:53, Marie-Claude Dubois wrote:\n> --------\n> WARNING: At least one of the links in the message below goes to an .exe file,\n> which could be malicious.
