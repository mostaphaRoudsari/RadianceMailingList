{"body": "Hi Marie-Claude,\n\n\nYou should be able to just download the various different image\nformats by right-clicking over the link and selecting 'Save link\nas...'\n\n\nHere's an example of what you get:\n\n\n- Medium size (800x531)\n-- Radiance RGBE (1.23 MB)\n-- OpenEXR (1021.62 kB)\n-- JPEG-HDR (130.81 kB)\n- Large size (1024x680)\n-- Radiance RGBE, (1.85 MB)\n-- OpenEXR (1.44 MB)\n-- JPEG-HDR (137.04 kB)\n\n\nWhat you want is the large RGBE image.  This is in Radiance format,\nwith the extension '.hdr'.  Some older HDR viewers, e.g. the one that\ncame with Ecotect, insist on the old '.pic' extension.  You can just\nrename the file if you're using such software.\n\n\nHope this works for you\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 20 August 2014 08:27, Marie-Claude Dubois\n<marie-claude.dubois at ebd.lth.se> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-August/000548.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "August 20, 2014 at 01:34AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000542", "id": "hdri_000548"}
