This is in Radiance format,\nwith the extension '.hdr'.  Some older HDR viewers, e.g. the one that\ncame with Ecotect, insist on the old '.pic' extension.  You can just\nrename the file if you're using such software.\n\n\nHope this works for you\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 20 August 2014 08:27, Marie-Claude Dubois\n<marie-claude.dubois at ebd.lth.se> wrote:\n> --------\n> WARNING: At least one of the links in the message below goes to an .exe file,\n> which could be malicious.
