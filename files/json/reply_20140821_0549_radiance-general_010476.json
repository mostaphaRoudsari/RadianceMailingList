{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nThere is a man page for rfluxmtx, but that's about all we have at this point.  I sent Vayia some slides I plan to present at the workshop in London, and I can send this to others who are interested.  (I'm following my own recommendation not to include attachments in radiance-general posts, and my website is inaccessible at the moment for unknown reasons.)\n\n\nRfluxmtx was created to simplify common sampling operations used with rcontrib, and will ultimately be used to simplify the internals of the genBSDF script, which is a less general tool.  The only program rfluxmtx completely replaces is genklemsamp.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010476.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 21, 2014 at 05:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009633", "id": "radiance-general_010476"}
