{"body": "Hi Shrikar,\n\n\nI suppose you have discovered the -pal and -palettes options, but this \nstill doesn't give you what you want?\n\n\nYou can create custom scales using the -r, -g and -b options.  Here is \nan example for a 3-step blue-yellow-white scale:\n\n\nfalsecolor \u2013ip picture.hdr \u2013s 5000 \u2013r \u2018if(v-0.3,1,0)\u2019 \\\n\u2013g \u2018if(v-0.3,1,0)\u2019 \u2013b \u2018if(v-0.3,if(v-0.7,1,0)1)\u2019 > picture_fc.hdr\n\n\nIt requires a bit of cal magic.  You may also look at the falsecolor \ncode for inspiration.\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 28/08/14 21:20, Shrikar Bhave wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010488.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "August 28, 2014 at 01:32PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010487", "id": "radiance-general_010488"}
