{"body": "Hi Mario,\n\n\nThe programs do things very differently from each other.\n\n\nOne source of difference is in the options, both programs require \ndifferent settings for the same set of options. Rcontrib actually \ndisables the ambient cache by setting -aa 0, so you will need to \nincrease ambient divisions (-ad) parameter along with a few others. As \nquick experiment you could try 2x or 4x whatever is set for -ad in the \nrtrace run in your rcontrib run. Also it would be instructive to see \nwhat defaults rcontrib uses and perhaps work from those. To do this you \ncan do rcontrib -defaults.\n\n\nAxel Jacobs had a very instructive tutorial on rtcontrib (older version \nof rcontrib) that included a section that compared running rtrace and \nrtcontrib. I think unfortunately it is no longer available though.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010494.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "September 03, 2014 at 12:05PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010492", "id": "radiance-general_010494"}
