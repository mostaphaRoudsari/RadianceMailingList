{"body": "Hi Stephen,\n\n\nWhat is outside your space?  Did you model a ground plane?  What rendering parameters is rad handing to rpict and rpiece?\n\n\nMy best guess is that when your rays get to the upper sill of the window, they bounce outside and create ambient values that then leak some energy into your scene interior.  It shouldn't really happen with the latest release, so if that's what is going on, then there may be a bug in the new interreflection code.\n\n\nIf you want to send me your complete model, etc. offline, I can try to have a look at it tomorrow.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010501.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 11, 2014 at 08:01PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010500", "id": "radiance-general_010501"}
