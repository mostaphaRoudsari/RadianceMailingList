{"body": "Thank you for answered. Greg\n\n\nI have any question.\n\n\n1. Is my simulation of result about A,B spot/sun=0.1785  different from Optics \nglass reflectance 0.178?\n\n\n2. You explain me 'Fresnel equations' about refraction right? \nDoes RADIANCE apply it? \nIf not, Could tell me which theory does RADIANCE apply?\n\n\nKind regards,\nTae Wook\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010506.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tae wook", "created_at": "September 15, 2014 at 05:36AM", "created_by": "Tae_wook", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010502", "id": "radiance-general_010506"}
