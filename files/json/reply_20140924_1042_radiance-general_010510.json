{"body": "Hi German,\nSorry to have taken so long to respond. When I first read your email I\ndidn't have time to dig in and planned to come back to it. Then I promptly\nforgot about it.\n\n\nThe one thing that stands out, and could be a major source of error for a\nclear sky is the ground reflectance. You're using 70% in the rtraced model,\nbut you aren't using it in the 5-phase method. Though if you have large-ish\nlocal ground plane defined in scene.rad (which you always should, but even\nthe best of us sometimes leave out) this will be less of a problem.\n\n\nYou can specify ground reflectance in gendaymtx with the -g argument. The\ndefault is -g 0.2 0.2 0.2 (which is a lot different from 70%). You\ngendaymtx command would look something like this:\ngendaymtx -h -g 0.7 0.7 0.7 -m 1 Santiago.wea > full_sky.skv\n\n\nLet me know if this doesn't improve things and I'll dig in further.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010510.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "September 24, 2014 at 10:42AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010498", "id": "radiance-general_010510"}
