{"body": "Edward,\n\n\nWhen I create ground truth renderings I pay close attention to the\nfollowing parameters:\n-aa 0\n-ad very high (like 10,000 - 50,000)\n-lw between 1/ad and 1/ad^3\n\n\nAlso, if you're using large area illumination sources, use the glow\nmaterial instead of light material. If you're use light material for small\narea sources pay attention to the direct sampling parameters (-d?).\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Sep 24, 2014 at 3:04 PM, Edward Zhang <edzhang at cs.washington.edu>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010512.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "September 25, 2014 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010511", "id": "radiance-general_010512"}
