Daysim also converts tinted materials (e.g. unequal red, green, blue values) into the average of the RGB channels for a grey scene \u2013 presumably to limit data processing to a single channel for simplification.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "October 01, 2014 at 08:00AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000064", "id": "radiance-daysim_000065"}
