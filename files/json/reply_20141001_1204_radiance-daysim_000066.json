It will then assign the values\nbased to a calculation grid based on the sequence of the values in the\nresults file. I don't have Ecotect around so you should verify this first\nbefore you rely on it in your workflow.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000066.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 01, 2014 at 12:04PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000057", "id": "radiance-daysim_000066"}
