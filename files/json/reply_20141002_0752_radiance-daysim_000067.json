{"body": "Hello Christopher Rush, \n  Thank you for your thorough reply.  \n  The file splitting I was expecting. What is concerning me is that the glas material has in both files different values -in the test.rad and test_material.rad files. For this reason, after starting Daysim3.1  I am not sure whether I should correct the test_material.rad values with the ones in the test.rad file and overwrite them.  \n  What do you think?  \n  Regards,  Niya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\n\n\u041e\u0442: Christopher Rush Christopher.Rush at arup.com\n\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-daysim] different values in test.rad and\n test_material.rad\n\n\n\u0414\u043e: DAYSIM discussion  \n\n\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: \u0421\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430, 2014, \u041e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 1 18:00:39 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The behavior you note appears to be the typical process of Daysim\u2019s subprocesses.   \n\n\n     Daysim automatically splits all materials into a separate file as you\u2019ve found, particularly if your materials and geometry in your scene are originally combined within files. Daysim also converts tinted materials (e.g. unequal red, green, blue values) into the average of the RGB channels for a grey scene \u2013 presumably to limit data processing to a single channel for simplification.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\n Electronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup\n business\n systems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses   \n\n\n var m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000067.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 02, 2014 at 07:52AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000064", "id": "radiance-daysim_000067"}
