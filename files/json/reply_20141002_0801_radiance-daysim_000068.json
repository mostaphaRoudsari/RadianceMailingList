{"body": "Hello Thomas, \n  Ecotect does assign values per point if the point is assigned as a sensor. The issue is that I am not using on purpose a grid but an irregular cloud of points. Hence, it is drawing a problem for recognizing them back after reimporting.  \n  Niya  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\n\n\u041e\u0442: Thomas Bleicher tbleicher at gmail.com\n\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-daysim] View Daylighting Analysis Results by DAYSIM\n 3.1b (beta)\n\n\n\u0414\u043e: DAYSIM discussion  \n\n\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: \u0421\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430, 2014, \u041e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 1 22:04:38 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Todor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    I'm not sure about the format of the *.da file but with regards to your second question I think that Ecotect expects the results in a separate file without any coordinates, one value per line. It will then assign the values based to a calculation grid based on the sequence of the values in the results file. I don't have Ecotect around so you should verify this first before you rely on it in your workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    On Wed, Oct 1, 2014 at 5:44 AM, Todor Syarov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000068.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 02, 2014 at 08:01AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000057", "id": "radiance-daysim_000068"}
