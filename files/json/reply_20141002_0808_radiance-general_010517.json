{"body": "Hi Mostapha, \n  It is kind of you correcting me.\n\n\n  My question concerns only the visual output of the points and their respective values in Radiance image(render).  In short: as the image of the interior is, to see the preselected(from ecotect) sensor point with its value for daylight factor.  \n\n\nbest,  Niya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\n\n\u041e\u0442: Mostapha Sadeghipour sadeghipour at gmail.com\n\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-general] Sensor points visualize\n\n\n\u0414\u043e: Radiance general discussion  \n\n\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: \u0427\u0435\u0442\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0442\u044a\u043a, 2014, \u041e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2 14:31:31 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Hi Niya,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    I think you need to be more clear about what you want to visualize? Do you want to find the sensor in Radiance's files? Is it related to your question about annual run with Daysim and you want to see hourly values for a single sensor during the year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Mostapha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    On Wed, Oct 1, 2014 at 7:59 AM, Todor Syarov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010517.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 02, 2014 at 08:08AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010515", "id": "radiance-general_010517"}
