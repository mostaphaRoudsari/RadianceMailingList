{"body": "Thank you Robin for writing back, \n  I am reading that a coating touching an interlayer is not possible in Optics5.  I am using Optics6 yet I could not find within the IGDB a PVB coating.

You can't model that in WINDOW. You need to model it in Optics and then import it into the WINDOW Glass Library as a monolithic layer. There are detailed instructions about how to do this on our WINDOW Knowledge Base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     http://windows.lbl.gov/software/NFRC/NFRCLaminates.html  -- click on the first link called Laminate Procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Robin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Robin Mitchell\n\n\nBuilding Technology and Urban Systems Department\n\n\nEnvironmental Energy Technologies Division\n\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     On Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 8:13 AM, Todor Syarov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010520.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 02, 2014 at 08:40AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010518", "id": "radiance-general_010520"}
