{"body": "Todor\n\n\nThere is no simple way to visualize the numeric output from Radiance in an\nimage. If you are only doing it for a small number of renderings the\nsimplest way is to use something like PowerPoint or Photoshop to add labels\nwith arrows to the right locations. If you set up a template this can also\nbe quite fast.\n\n\nIf you want to visualize a larger number of images you have to use some\nhome made scripts to make this work. You would first calculate the DF\nvalues for your points and then use psign and pcompos to add text at the\nright place in the image. You need to be fairly familiar with your\nscripting environment (Bash on Linux, CMD or PowerShell on Windows) to get\nthis to work. If you are a stranger to the command line ask someone to\nassist you with this or you won't see daylight soon (pardon the pun).\n\n\nYou can find excellent information on scripting for Radiance on Axel\nJacob's page:\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010525.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 05, 2014 at 08:13AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010515", "id": "radiance-general_010525"}
