Including color would have required 435 channels which the author probably decided was too much of an increase simulation time without much benefit. So when you import the model, it converts all materials to a grey equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Andy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    On Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 9:11 AM, Todor Syarov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000075.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 06, 2014 at 06:16AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000064", "id": "radiance-daysim_000075"}
