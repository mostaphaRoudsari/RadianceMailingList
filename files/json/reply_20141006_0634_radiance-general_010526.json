If you are only doing it for a small number of renderings the simplest way is to use something like PowerPoint or Photoshop to add labels with arrows to the right locations. If you set up a template this can also be quite fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    If you want to visualize a larger number of images you have to use some home made scripts to make this work. You would first calculate the DF values for your points and then use psign and pcompos to add text at the right place in the image. You need to be fairly familiar with your scripting environment (Bash on Linux, CMD or PowerShell on Windows) to get this to work. If you are a stranger to the command line ask someone to assist you with this or you won't see daylight soon (pardon the pun).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You can find excellent information on scripting for Radiance on Axel Jacob's page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Regards,\n\n\n\n\n    Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    On Thu, Oct 2, 2014 at 10:08 AM, Todor Syarov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010526.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 06, 2014 at 06:34AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010515", "id": "radiance-general_010526"}
