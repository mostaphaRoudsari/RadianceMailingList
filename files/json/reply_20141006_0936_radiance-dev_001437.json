{"body": "German,\n\n\nsome years ago we did something related to that - we used 81 instead of 3\nchannels to allow spectral renderings. Although having a factor of 27 in\nthe number of color channels, the computational overhead compared to the\nRGB calculation was only around 40%. From that you can assume that going\nfrom 3 to 1 channel would no really be worth it - as Greg already said.\n\n\nBest,\nDavid\n\n\n2014-10-06 18:28 GMT+02:00 Gregory J.
