{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI would also do it with OpenDX. Still, another option all within Radiance:\n\n\n1) pipe the point locations and the corresponding values into rcalc to \nget a falsecolor value corresponding to the photopic average and the \nlocation as output,\n\n\n2) use awk to add the string around the numbers to translate this into \nglow (from falsecolor of photopic average) and sphere (from location, \nset radius fixed according to density and size of grid or relative to \nphotopic average)\n\n\n3) render using your favorite raytracer, optionally with all the scene \ngeometry switched to gray (xform -m ...) using all the wonderful view \noptions\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010528.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
