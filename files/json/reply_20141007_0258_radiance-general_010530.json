Still, another option all within Radiance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1) pipe the point locations and the corresponding values into rcalc to get a falsecolor value corresponding to the photopic average and the location as output,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2) use awk to add the string around the numbers to translate this into glow (from falsecolor of photopic average) and sphere (from location, set radius fixed according to density and size of grid or relative to photopic average)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3) render using your favorite raytracer, optionally with all the scene geometry switched to gray (xform -m ...) using all the wonderful view options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cheers,\n\n\n Lars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     May I suggest: \n\n\n    \u201copendx\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    or as my friend would say nowadays \"Paraview\" or \"MayaVI\"\n\n\n\n\n    no need of fancy scripting.\n\n\n\n\n    take the output -opv, make the photopic average (if R = G = B just take Rx179).\n\n\n\n\n    then with the formatted file containing\n\n\n\n\n    x y z value\n\n\n\n\n    should be very simple in opendx.\n\n\n\n\n    for the others I am not sure but I am told it is also simple.\n\n\n\n\n    if you need more help let me know, I am happy to provide further help.\n\n\n\n\n    ciao\n\n\n\n\n    G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      On 6 Oct 2014, at 14:34, Todor Syarov <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010530.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 07, 2014 at 02:58AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010515", "id": "radiance-general_010530"}
