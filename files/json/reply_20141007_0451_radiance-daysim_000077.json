{"body": "Hi Niya,\n\n\nthis is a warning and no error! This can't be a cause for a problem - \nexcept this is your only surface in your scene, because it has no area!!!\nThere must be another problem.\n\n\nAre you sure daysim is the right tool? daysim is not meant to make \nvisualizations, but annual simulations to calculate \nilluminance/luminance/irradiance at certain sensor points! I would \nrather use rpict or rvu with -av option to \"visualize points\". have you \ntried this? Is this what you want to do?\nFor linux/bash I have a small script generating a geometry out of sensor \npoints for a visual check, if the points are correctly located. But I \nhaven't ported that to windows.\n\n\ngood luck!\njan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 10/7/14, 12:08 PM, schrieb Todor Syarov:\n> Hello,\n> I am experiencing a consistent error message that I could not overcome.\n> After the attempt to run simulation in Daysim 3.1\n> there`s the error message:\n> c:/daysim/bin_windows/oconv: warning-zero area for polygon \n> \"zone01.rad00013\"\n>\n> Further on it draws the problem to \"raypath c:\\daysim\\lib`.\n> stil I haveve added the Radiance\\bin\\. and Daysim\\bin\\. and \n> Radiance\\lib\\., Daysim\\lib\\. to the environmental variables in Raypath \n> and Path manually(working on Windows7)\n>\n> I am analysing orbitrory sensor points that Ive generated with a \n> script from ecotect(zero polygon area I suppose describes that)\n>\n> How do you read such message to proceed completing a visualization?\n>\n> Kind Regards,\n> Niya\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-daysim mailing list\n> Radiance-daysim at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-daysim\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
