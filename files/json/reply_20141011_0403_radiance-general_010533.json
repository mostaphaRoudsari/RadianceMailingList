From the instructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndxf2rad input.dxf output.rad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo your command would want to look like this (I wouldn't bother with a batch file for this):\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndxf2rad solid.dxf solid.rad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the lack of a redirect caret (\">\"), and the use of the filename without the full path. Obviously this means you should run the command from the directory containing your source dxf file. The dxf2rad program should be somewhere on your system's search path for this to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010533.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "October 11, 2014 at 04:03AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010531", "id": "radiance-general_010533"}
