{"body": "Hi\n\n\nAre you sure you have also modelled the \"infinite\" ground plane as a glowing source ? This has to be modelled even if you also put a large disk for the ground plane.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n________________________________\nDe : Alejandro Pacheco Di\u00e9guez [paxeco2205 at hotmail.com]\nEnvoy\u00e9 : jeudi 16 octobre 2014 10:36\n\u00c0 : radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] Size of ground the plane\n\n\nHi all,\nI am assessning DF levels in a 4th floor of a building in an unobstructed area, so I am not considering any surrounding building just a ground plane that I modeled as a circle.\nAlmost by chance I discovered increasing the size of my ground plane has a significant effect on my DF. Using a ground plane of 500m radius I had an average of 3.34%, if I increase it to 1000meters I get over 12%. As long as I understand, this should not have such a big effect, should it? Could I be doing something wrong? Can I do something to make sure I get reasonable values?\nI am running the simulation though DIVA for Rhino in Grasshopper. My radiance parameters are: -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 256 -aa 0.1. My ground plane reflectance is 0.25.\nThanks in advance,\nAlejandro\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010539.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 02:23AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010538", "id": "radiance-general_010539"}
