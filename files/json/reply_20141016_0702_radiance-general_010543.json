{"body": "All the tools I'm aware of include this distant ground source automatically. Santiago is right, the issue here is your huge local ground plane and consequently relatively low -ar value. For a single story building, the rule of thumb is your ground plane plan projection should be about 5x the window head height. With that, even your current -ar of 256 should be adequate to avoid these interpolation errors. \n\n\n-rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010543.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 16, 2014 at 07:02AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010538", "id": "radiance-general_010543"}
