{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\n\nI've noticed this issue with some images on the latest Radiance 4.2  \nversions as well.\n\n\nGreg, the length of the file name doesn't seem to have any effect for me  \n-- the errors remain the same. I've been ignoring the problem, so haven't  \ntraced the reason as for why it occurs, but it tends to manifest itself  \nwith Radiance images generated in certain atypical ways: (1) HDR  \nphotographs and (2) renderings using electric lighting via IES2Rad.\n\n\nHere is another (very basic) rendering which has the same problem on  \nWindows: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/pcond_error.pic\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 20 Oct 2014 11:54:33 +0800, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "October 19, 2014 at 09:14PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010544", "id": "radiance-general_010546"}
