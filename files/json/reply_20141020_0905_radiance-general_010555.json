This call that was hand-written by Georg Mischler was recently replaced under Microsoft's Visual-C compiler, and I think the issue is that I'm not explicitly setting the binary file type in pcond.  Schorsch's win_popen() must have done this for me without my realizing it.\n\n\nI have checked in the new module and it should get recompiled at some point.  My apologies, and I hope this solves the issue.\n\n\nIn the short term, just use the older version of pcond.  It's the same, anyway.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010555.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 20, 2014 at 09:05AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010544", "id": "radiance-general_010555"}
