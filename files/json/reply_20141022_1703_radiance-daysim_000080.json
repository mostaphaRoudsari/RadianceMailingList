{"body": "Hi Alstan,\n\n\nThis is exactly what I needed, and also I assume the rotation will be\nanti-clockwise?\n\n\nFor some reason both the keyword and the subprogram are missing from the\nDaysim page. Would be great if someone add them to the page as they are\nboth really useful.\n\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 22, 2014 at 7:48 PM, J.
