{"body": "Having Radiance in /usr/local/bin as well as /usr/local/radiance/bin can be problematic, even with a tightly configured environment. Your initial change to .profile *should* have worked though, i.e., \"which gensky\" should have found the one in /usr/local/radiance/bin. My guess is you didn't source ~/.profile or start a new terminal window before trying the \"which\" command. Or maybe the order the way you have it there is wrong. Personally I start with the existing path and append /usr/local/radiance/bin to that. I'm with Ehsan, you may want to start clean (unfortunately there's no clean way to uninstall Radiance), reinstall, and add the following to your environment (personally I make these changes to ~/.bash_profile):\n\n\n## Radiance path crap\nexport PATH=$PATH:.:/usr/local/radiance/bin\nexport RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib\nexport MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/radiance/doc\n\n\nHTH\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/23/14, 7:24 AM, \"Ehsan M.Vazifeh\" <em.vazifeh at gmail.com<mailto:em.vazifeh at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nI guess its better to cleanup all the radiance files from bin and install it from scratch!
