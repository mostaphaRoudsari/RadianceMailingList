{"body": "Thanks, Joe.  \n\n\nThis probably belongs on the \"dev\" mailing list, so will cross-post there and you can sign up and respond on that list if you don't mind.\n\n\nNone of these warnings generated the \"There were some errors.\" conclusion at the end.  This was caused by a failed \"clean\" operation that didn't matter on the TIFF library:\n\n\ncd tiff; make distclean\n/bin/sh: line 0: cd: tiff: No such file or directory\nmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.\nmake: *** [clean] Error 2\n\n\nNevertheless, it was helpful to see some of these warnings, particularly the \"implicit declaration\" issues, which I needed to fix.  There was also a genuine bug in the ezxml code, which was likely never triggered as it had to do with an unused attribute types extension.  I fixed that one as well, even though it isn't really my code.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010585.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 26, 2014 at 10:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010584", "id": "radiance-general_010585"}
