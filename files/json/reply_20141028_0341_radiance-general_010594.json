{"body": "Hello Thomas\n\n\nI managed to import rtrace illuminance values back into Sketchup via\nsu2rad, see the picture:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6h2rfc1odxzh3xu/su2rad_import.png?dl=0\n\n\nHowever, su2rad creates 3D contour (see the cones in the picture). Is there\na way to have a 2D (line) contour? I presume that should be easier than\ntriangulation process to create 3D contour.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nEry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Jun 28, 2014 at 4:54 AM, Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010594.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ery Djunaedy", "created_at": "October 28, 2014 at 03:41AM", "created_by": "Ery_Djunaedy", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010345", "id": "radiance-general_010594"}
