{"body": "Congrats! Nice model, btw.\n\n\nThe generation of the contour lines depends on the 3d \"topography\" of the\nimported data. I use the SketchUp \"intersect\" function to slice the 3d\nshape into bands. The resulting edges are the contour lines you see. I'm\nsure there are better and more direct ways of generating the contours but\nin 2008/2009 SketchUp's API was not that advanced. Today it may be feasible\nto implement an alternative using a Ruby library.\n\n\nAnyway: you can just scale the 3d map to an almost flat plane or use one of\nthe SU plugins to flatten the geometry. I never tried it with the su2rad\nimport but I'm using the \"Flatten\" plugin by Thomas Thomason regularly on\nCAD imports.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 28, 2014 at 5:41 AM, Ery Mailing-List <ery.mailinglist at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010596.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 28, 2014 at 06:31AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010345", "id": "radiance-general_010596"}
