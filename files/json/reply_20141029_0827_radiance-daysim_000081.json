{"body": "Hi Mostapha,\n\n\nsorry I just saw by chance your posting... do you still have this problem?\n\n\nHave you tried with angular fish eye view? I'm also not sure if the \nkeyword \"Perspective\" in the view file might cause a problem.\nTry it with this and see if this solves your problem:\n\n\nrview  -vta -vp 2.004 5.478 1.496  -vd -0.526326 -2.530093 0.0 -vu 0.0 \n0.0 1.0  -vh 180.000 -vv 180.000\n\n\nAlthough -vth is implemented in evalglare, I'm still a little suspicious \nif a hemispherical view works in all kind of situations correctly \n(especially if a glare source is close to the border). The main thing \nis, that \"outside\" the \"circle\", the view is not defined for a  \nhemispherical view. If a pixel lies partly inside and outside the \ncircle, problems might occur and then division by zero is causing \noverflows in variables. I tried to prevent this and for the testing \nscenes it worked.\nBut I still recommend also in the description to use an angular fish eye \nview, where this cannot happen. So as long as you are simulating, please \nuse always a angular fish eye projection.\n\n\nBut, I also don\u00b4t know if this is really the problem here, but it might be.\n\n\nsorry for the late answer.\n\n\nBest and good luck\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000081.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "October 29, 2014 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000060", "id": "radiance-daysim_000081"}
