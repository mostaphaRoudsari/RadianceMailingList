{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nThanks for the reply. I couldn't find this email and reply back to the\ngroup to update everyone.\n\n\nThe issue turned out to be exporting an empty sensor file. I assumed that\nDaysim doesn't need sensor information and will only look for .vf file if I\nwant to only run an annual glare analysis but then I checked the source\ncode and I saw that gen_dgp_profile looks for sensor file in two different\nfunctions.\n\n\nI'm not still clear how gen_dgp_profile uses sensor points for annual glare\nanalysis but adding the sensor files solved the issue. I really appreciate\nit if you can shed some light about the relationship between sensor files\nand annual glare analysis.\n\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-October/000082.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "October 29, 2014 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000060", "id": "radiance-daysim_000082"}
