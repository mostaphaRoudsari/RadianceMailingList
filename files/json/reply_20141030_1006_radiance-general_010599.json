{"body": "findglare cannot resolve the sun in that image, not sure how to overcome \nthis. increasing -r doesn't help.\n\n\nwhy are you evaluating such a scene with UGR? UGR doesn't make sense for \nvery small glare sources and also not for daylight situations.\n\n\nAs far as I know, for exterior spaces no established glare rating exist.\n\n\nYou could use evalglare (version 12) instead and look for the CIE \nveiling glare index (-d option, last index printed), gives you the \nveiling luminance in the eye according to the cie disability glare \nequation. This option is pretty new in evalglare, so if you use it, pls \ncheck it against hand calculation and report any problem... I checked it \nonly quickly when implementing.\nI also wouldn't use DGP for exterior spaces.\n\n\ngood luck\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nAm 10/30/14, 5:04 PM, schrieb Joe Smith:\n> Dear all, I got a warning when using findglare to process a hdr image \n> file:\n>\n> *findglare: warning -- missing 1% of samples*\n>\n> And the ugr value produced by glarendx using the .glr file generated \n> in the previous step is zero.\n>\n> May I ask why the hdr image, which looks fine in Photomatix, is \n> causing findglare error?\n>\n> The HDR image is shared in the following link:\n> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_FMUh4Urmx4dzZoYVNkSEVzNzQ/view?usp=sharing\n>\n> Thanks!\n> Joe\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
