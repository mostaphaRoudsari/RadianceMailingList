{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nOh wow, an MGF question. In all my years, never. Wow.\n\n\nInteresting question. I'm not sure what having the MGF description will\nbuy you in terms of your problem. The MGF is just a geometry section\nAFAIK; the photometry is still tied to the ies-format data, so I don't\nthink you gain any added flexibility there. Depending on how diffuse the\ntop and bottom of the luminaire are, you probably *could* remove the rings\nand have a reasonably fair distribution for the cylinder, but I'm guessing\nthey are some really diffuse, blobby lenses and so you're getting some\nscatter. Another option would be to generate the simple geometry with\nies2rad and then add some sort of \"caps\" with added geometry to the top\nand bottom of the luminous geometry created from ies2rad. Not sure how\naccurate the \"thing\" needs to look, versus the space lighted by the thing.\nIf you only care about the distribution, this option may work for you.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 11/5/14, 5:14 AM, \"Axel Jacobs\" <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010602.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 05, 2014 at 06:33AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010602"}
