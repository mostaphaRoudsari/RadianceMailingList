{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nthanks for your reply.  Yes, MGF is still alive and kicking--now\nofficially endorsed by the IESNA as far as I understand.\n\n\nThe product I'm looking at is this:\nhttp://products.iguzzini.com/iway_round\nwhich is why I want to get rid of the top and bottom bits of the\nies2rad geometry.\n\n\nWhat I was hoping to be able to do with MGF is tell it what the\nfitting looks like.  In this particular case, I'd model 3 stacked\ncylinders, enclosed with a disk at the top. Only the middle cylinder\nwould act as an emitter.  Does that make sense?\n\n\nBest\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 5 November 2014 14:33, Guglielmetti, Robert\n<Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010603.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 05, 2014 at 07:03AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010603"}
