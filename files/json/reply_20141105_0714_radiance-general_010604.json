{"body": "Do I understand that the problem is not generating geometry much taller than the actual lens, but rather that that it generates a cylinder with top and bottom circles, while only the shell of the cylinder is the actual light emitter? I had started to reply regarding adjusting the height in the IES file, but maybe someone else knows a solution for the top/bottom surface problem - which would be good to know.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\n\nThe product I'm looking at is this:\nhttp://products.iguzzini.com/iway_round\nwhich is why I want to get rid of the top and bottom bits of the\nies2rad geometry.\n\n\nWhat I was hoping to be able to do with MGF is tell it what the\nfitting looks like.  In this particular case, I'd model 3 stacked\ncylinders, enclosed with a disk at the top. Only the middle cylinder\nwould act as an emitter.  Does that make sense?\n\n\nBest\nAxel\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010604.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "November 05, 2014 at 07:14AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010604"}
