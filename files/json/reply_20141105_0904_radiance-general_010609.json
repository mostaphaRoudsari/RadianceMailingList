{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nYes, as Randolph reminds me, LM-63 did have the geometry spec in there.  All I remember is that it was never supported by anyone.  At least we are using MGF in our XML specification for complex fenestration system BSDFs, so it's not a complete waste.\n\n\nRegarding the local box correction, you could take out the third term \"noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3\" from the formula:\n\n\nlboxprojection = (\tnoneg(abs(Px-Dx*Ts)-A2/2)*A3*A4 +\n\t\t\tnoneg(abs(Py-Dy*Ts)-A3/2)*A2*A4 +\n\t\t\tnoneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3 ) / Ts;\n\n\nI think that should work.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010609.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 05, 2014 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010609"}
