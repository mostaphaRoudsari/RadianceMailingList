{"body": "Hello again,\n\n\nI've run some quick tests on with my bollard photometry. falsecolor\nimages below:\n\n\nUnaltered IES file as it came from the manufacturer:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_fc.jpg\nThis uses a short, capped cylinder.  rvu complains about\n\"source aspect too small for cylinder xxx\naiming failure for light source xxx\"\nLooks weird.\n\n\nsphere, generated with ies2rad's -i option:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_sphere_fc.jpg\nThis is a little darker than the previous image.\n\n\nbox geometry with all 6 sides (edited IES file):\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_closed_box_fc.jpg\nsome 'streaky' artifacts that didn't show up in the sphere image.\n\n\nbox with top and bottom removed. Unaltered source.cal\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_open_box_fc.jpg\na little darker than the full box\n\n\nbox with top and bottom removed.  source.cal edited as per Greg's instructions\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_open_box_fixed_fc.jpg\nLooks identical to the previous picture.\n\n\nI used the new ltview command for the previews, so the lower side of\nthe enclosing plane is much further away than the actual ground would\nbe.  This might be the reason why the 'corrected' and 'uncorrected'\nopen boxes produce the same results.  Equally, there is hardly any\ndownward or upward component.  Virtually all of the emitted light is\nprojected into a narrow strip.  It still seems as if the open box does\nemit a little less light than its closed brother, even with the\ncorrection in source.cal\n\n\nBest\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 5 November 2014 17:19, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010611.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 06, 2014 at 03:02AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010611"}
