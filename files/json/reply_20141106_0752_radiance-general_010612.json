{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nInteresting results.  The correction of removing the third term for the local box correction would make the most difference in the upwards and downwards direction, so the sparse output there is why you don't see anything in your falsecolor comparison.  You could try computing a difference image using src/cal/cal/picdiff.cal.\n\n\nAlso, the differences between using a large sphere and the lboxcorr won't be noticeable until your surfaces are up close.  What did you set -dj to in your runs?  This will also make a difference, and could show up artifacts in some of the simpler methods.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 06, 2014 at 07:52AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010612"}
