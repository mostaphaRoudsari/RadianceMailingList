{"body": "Hi Niya,\n\n\nI also worked with Daysim and Ecotect. I did not use the auto generated\ngrid in Ecotect, but made a sensorpoint file myself, so I do not know if it\nis the same with the Ecotect grid. However, when I tried to rotate the\nbuilding in Daysim, the sensorpoints did not rotate with the model. I had\nto make a new sensorpoint file to match the rotated building.\n\n\nCheers,\nAmalie\n\n\n2014-11-11 18:57 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov <thodor at abv.bg>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-November/000085.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amalie Momme", "created_at": "November 12, 2014 at 04:08AM", "created_by": "Amalie_Momme", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000078", "id": "radiance-daysim_000085"}
