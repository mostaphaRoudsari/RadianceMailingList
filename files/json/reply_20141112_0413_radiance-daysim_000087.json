{"body": "Hello Amalie, \n  After I edit the.hea file and rotate the scene I get created a new filename.pts.rotate.pts file. I assume it is with the rotated points - i am trying to find a way to verify this still.  \n  I would be interested to know how do you create the rotated sensorpoint file?\n\n\n  Best,  Niya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\n\n\u041e\u0442: Amalie Momme amaliemomme at gmail.com\n\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-daysim] Changing north direction in Daysim\n\n\n\u0414\u043e: DAYSIM discussion  \n\n\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: \u0421\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430, 2014, \u041d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 12 14:08:52 EET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Hi Niya,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    I also worked with Daysim and Ecotect. I did not use the auto generated grid in Ecotect, but made a sensorpoint file myself, so I do not know if it is the same with the Ecotect grid. However, when I tried to rotate the building in Daysim, the sensorpoints did not rotate with the model. I had to make a new sensorpoint file to match the rotated building. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Cheers, \n\n\n\n\n    Amalie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2014-11-11 18:57 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov \n      thodor at abv.bg > :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Hello Alstan,   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          I need to apply the same command. There is some weird correspondance btw the Ecotect and the Daysim values, and I assume from reading the forums, that it is because of the North orientation.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Could you, please, assist me with how to\n run the Daysim subprogram rotate_scene to make this work?   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Regards,   \n\n\n\n\n           Niya   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\n Radiance-daysim mailing list\n\n\n\n\n      Radiance-daysim at radiance-online.org \n\n\n\n\n      http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-daysim \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n var m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-November/000087.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "November 12, 2014 at 04:13AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000078", "id": "radiance-daysim_000087"}
