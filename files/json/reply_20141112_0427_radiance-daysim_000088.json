{"body": "Hello Niya,\n\n\nI got the rotated pts file as well, however this was not correct - but this\nwas the pts file I made myself. If you download the program Notepad++ (It's\njust an advanced Notepad which can handle different types of text files),\nyou can see your pts file.\n\n\nA pts file contains nothing but the coordinates of your sensor points and\nthen a direction vector, (0 0 1) pointing up.\n\n\nExample:\n2.000 3.000 0.850 0.000 0.000 1.000\n3.000 3.000 0.850 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n\nthis is two sensor points placed at the coordinates (x,y,z) = (2,3,0.85),\nand they're both pointing straight up.\n\n\nWith notepad++ you can create this, and when saving the file, type the name\nand add '.pts'. Voila, you have a pts file :-) Of course, then you have to\nknow the coordinate system in DAYSIM, and I believe that north is always\nthe same as positive y-axis.\n\n\nBut if you do create your own sensorpoint file, you cannot see the results\nin Ecotect as I believe you can with the auto generated pts file.\n\n\nGood luck with it!\n\n\nAmalie\n\n\n\n\n2014-11-12 13:13 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov <thodor at abv.bg>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-November/000088.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amalie Momme", "created_at": "November 12, 2014 at 04:27AM", "created_by": "Amalie_Momme", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000078", "id": "radiance-daysim_000088"}
