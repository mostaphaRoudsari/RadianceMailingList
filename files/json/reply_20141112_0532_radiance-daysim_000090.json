{"body": "Hi Niya\n\n\nUnfortunately I haven't worked with results in Ecotect, so I have no\nexperience with importing DAYSIM results back into Ecotect. I had a lot of\nsensor points (parametric study, offices in urban environments), so I used\nExcel for data analysis and presentation. I created the 3D model in\nEcotect, that's all, and then manually set the material properties and\nsensor points.\n\n\nIf you are concerned about reliability and you need only to create a\nrendering of the Daylight Factor and particular daylight scenes without it\nbeing too complicated, you can use the software Velux Visualizer - this\ndoes 3D renderings as well. Of course not with the same precision as DAYSIM\n(annual based tool) or RADIANCE (renderings). If you wish to do this, you\ncan create your 3D model in Google Sketchup, and then import this into\nVelux Visualizer. This is very fast and simple and gives a nice visual\nimage. This does not take electrical lighting into account though, it is a\ndaylight tool :-) Also, there is Dialux but this I am less familiar with.\nThis does take electrical lighting into account.\n\n\nI hope you figure it out, do post the answer if you do - I am sorry I do\nnot have the time to dig deeper into this.\n\n\nAmalie\n\n\n2014-11-12 13:53 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov <thodor at abv.bg>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-November/000090.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Amalie Momme", "created_at": "November 12, 2014 at 05:32AM", "created_by": "Amalie_Momme", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000078", "id": "radiance-daysim_000090"}
