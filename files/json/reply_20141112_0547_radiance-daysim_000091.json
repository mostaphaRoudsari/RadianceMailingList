I had a lot of sensor points (parametric study, offices in urban environments), so I used Excel for data analysis and presentation. I created the 3D model in Ecotect, that's all,\nand then\nmanually set the material properties and sensor points. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    If you are\nconcerned about reliability and you\nneed only\nto create a rendering of the Daylight Factor and particular daylight scenes\nwithout\nit being too complicated, you can use the\nsoftware Velux Visualizer - this does 3D renderings as well. Of course not with the same precision as DAYSIM (annual based\ntool) or RADIANCE (renderings). If you wish to do this, you can create your 3D model in Google Sketchup, and then import this into Velux Visualizer. This is very fast and simple and gives a nice visual image. This does not\ntake\nelectrical lighting into account\nthough, it is a daylight tool\n:-) Also, there is Dialux but this I am less familiar with. This does take electrical lighting into account. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    I hope you figure it out, do post the answer if you do - I am sorry I do not have the time to dig deeper into this. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Amalie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2014-11-12 13:53 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov \n      thodor at abv.bg > :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Hi Amalie, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        thanks for the fast response. this approach ive been using as well- for this reason i also rotated back the file in Daysim. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        I don\u00b4t know if you have experienced this... Sometimes, the Daysim Sensor point file used for a model imported from  \n\n\n\n\n        Ecotect has some odd coordinates, that do not match \nthe\n   previously defined grid in Ecotect. This is usually the case when you export from\n   Ecotect a model that has the North position rotated from the default   axis for the simulation ... I suspect that \nthe\n   original \"test.pts\" (Ecotect )grid becomes\n   translated into a coordinate axis responing to the north orientation,\n   and the sensor point file used in Daysim is then named\n   \"test.pts.rotated.    pts\".\n    Hence, the \".da\" files reimported to Ecotect from\n  Daysim show the same rotated\n   coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         This is my concern, WHETHER  \nthey are reliable to\n\n\n\n\n          display the simulation results without me having to intervene with rotating the scene in .hea file?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          best,  \n\n\n\n\n          Niya  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e -------- \n\u041e\u0442: Amalie Momme  amaliemomme at gmail.com  \n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-daysim] Changing north direction in Daysim \n\u0414\u043e: DAYSIM discussion  radiance-daysim at radiance-online.org > \n \u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: \u0421\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430, 2014, \u041d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 12 14:27:58 EET \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Hello Niya, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             I got the rotated pts file as well, however this was not correct -\nbut\nthis was the pts file I made myself. If you download the program Notepad++ (It's just an advanced Notepad which can handle different types of text files), you can see your pts file. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             A pts file\ncontains nothing but the coordinates of your sensor points and then a direction vector, (0 0 1) pointing up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Example: \n\n\n\n\n             2.000 3.000 0.850 0.000 0.000 1.000 \n\n\n\n\n             3.000 3.000 0.850 0.000 0.000 1.000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             this is two sensor points placed at the coordinates (x,y,z) = (2,3,0.85), and they're both pointing straight up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             With notepad++ you can create this, and when saving the file, type the name and add '.pts'. Voila, you have a pts file :-) Of course, then you have to know the coordinate system in DAYSIM, and I believe that north is always the same as positive y-axis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             But if you do create your own sensorpoint file, you cannot see the results in Ecotect as I believe you can with the auto generated pts file. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Good luck with it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Amalie \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             2014-11-12 13:13 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov \n              thodor at abv.bg > : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Amalie, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                After I edit the.hea file and rotate the scene I get created a new filename.pts.rotate.pts file.

I did not use the auto generated grid in Ecotect, but made a sensorpoint file myself, so I do not know if it is the same with the Ecotect grid. However, when I tried to rotate the building in Daysim, the sensorpoints did not rotate with the model. I had to make a new sensorpoint file to match the rotated building. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Cheers, \n\n\n\n\n                    Amalie \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    2014-11-11 18:57 GMT+01:00 Todor Syarov \n                     thodor at abv.bg > : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Hello Alstan,    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         I need to apply the same command.
