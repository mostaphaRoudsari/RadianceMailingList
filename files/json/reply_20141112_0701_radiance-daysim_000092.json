{"body": "it seems you are using an old version of gendaylit (the new version don \nt need these files any more). Maybe this old version is still part of \nthe daysim package. You should replace it by the new version from the \nradiance distribution.\nI also assume you have a path problem. Are you sure you set the RAYPATH \nvariable correct? In the /lib directory you should find the missing \nfiles, but then the old version of gendaylit should work.\nJan\n\n\nAm 11/12/14, 1:09 PM, schrieb Todor Syarov:\n> Hello,\n>\n> I get from the Daysim DGP simulation this consistent warning:\n>\n> file coeff_perez.dat cannot be opened\n> lect_coeff_perez does not work\n> gendaylit call failed at time:.... ...\n>\n> Could you ,please, tell me, where to look for the problem and how can \n> I solve the issue so I can rely on the SIM result?\n> Kind Regards,\n> Niya\n>\n> -------- ?????????? ????? --------\n> ??: Jan Wienold jan.wienold at epfl.ch\n> ???????: Re: [Radiance-daysim] incomlete Daysim visualization\\daysim\\lib\n> ??: DAYSIM discussion <radiance-daysim at radiance-online.org>\n> ????????? ??: ???????, 2014, ???????? 7 14:51:00 EEST\n>\n> Hi Niya,\n>\n> this is a warning and no error!
