Maybe this old version is still part of the daysim package. You should replace it by the new version from the radiance distribution.\n\n\n I also assume you have a path problem. Are you sure you set the RAYPATH variable correct? In the /lib directory you should find the missing files, but then the old version of gendaylit should work. \n\n\n Jan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n var m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-November/000093.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "November 13, 2014 at 02:08AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000086", "id": "radiance-daysim_000093"}
