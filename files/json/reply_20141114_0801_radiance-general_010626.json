{"body": "I haven't used Ecotect in a long time, so I don't really know what it means to \"use Ecotect to simulate light pipes\". I have used Radiance in the past to model them, usually using the photometric files supplied by Solatube. These files assume a certain amount of luminous flux, and apply that to a blobby distribution based on a straight tube of fixed length, and certain combination(s) of lenses at either end. Obviously this characterizes a certain time step, or season (see the manufacturers' websites for details). The flux can be scaled with a script to do a crude annual simulation, which I have done in the past.\n\n\nAndy McNeil posted an exciting example of how you might use the new rfluxmtx tool in Radiance to do a proper climate based annual simulation based on daylight coefficients at the 2014 Radiance Workshop, which you can check out here (starting at slide 92):\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/14, 3:09 AM, \"Bhartendu Awasthi\" <bhartendu.awasthi90 at gmail.com<mailto:bhartendu.awasthi90 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nDear All,\n\n\nI am new to Radiance and trying to show the effect of light  pipes in daylight levels with ECOTECT and Radiance. I have created the building in ECOTECT but unable to model the light pipes exactly. Is there any reference document for the same? Or if anyone can guide me in detail how to model the same?\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\n\nMany Thanks,\nBhartendu Awasthi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010626.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 14, 2014 at 08:01AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010625", "id": "radiance-general_010626"}
