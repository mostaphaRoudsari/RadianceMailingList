{"body": "HI Andreas,\n\n\nI am sorry to hear about this issue, and it is unlikely that there is any way to debug it.  A hung process doesn't respond to debugging, either!\n\n\nThe best approach is to kill one of the processes using \"kill -QUIT\" and seeing if it leaves behind a diagnostic file in $HOME/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/.  Then at least, we may find out what routine it is hanging in.\n\n\nThe only other idea I had is to disable \"App Nap\" system-wide to see if this is causing the problem.  See:\n\n\n\thttp://www.defaults-write.com/10-9-disable-app-nap-in-os-x\n\n\nI don't know why this would affect non-application processes, or why it would present an issue in 10.10 if it wasn't an issue in 10.9, but it's worth a try.\n\n\nI will see if I can reproduce this on my copy of Yosemite as well.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-November/001441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 18, 2014 at 08:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001440", "id": "radiance-dev_001441"}
