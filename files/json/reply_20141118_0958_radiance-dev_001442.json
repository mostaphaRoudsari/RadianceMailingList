{"body": "Hi Andreas,\n\n\nA quick follow-up to this.  I tried it out on my copy of Yosemite, and confirmed the problem.  It seems to be an intermittent problem with the system select() call, which means there's little I can do about it except hope Apple recognizes the issue and posts a patch at some point.  The last change I made in this code related to a hanging condition was in 1997, and it's been working across Unix implementations since then.\n\n\nFor now, I can only suggest you avoid multiprocessing until the next patch release.  You can try reporting a bug to Apple, but without a simple test case to reproduce it, they are unlikely to do anything other than register the complaint.  I haven't seen anything on the net about it, yet.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-November/001442.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 18, 2014 at 09:58AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001440", "id": "radiance-dev_001442"}
