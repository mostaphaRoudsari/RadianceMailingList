{"body": "Zack Rogers developed a module for Python (IES_gensky.py) that is part of\nSPOT and updates the gensky model.\n\n\nI also seem to remember that in one of the early Radiance workshops there\nwas a reference to an updated CIE sky generator that could produce all 15\nstandard sky models. I don't think it ever got a public release but the\nsource files were exchenged off-list now and then.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010633.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "November 20, 2014 at 05:24AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010627", "id": "radiance-general_010633"}
