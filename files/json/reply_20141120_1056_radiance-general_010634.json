{"body": "Hello again,\n\n\nAs promised, here are some more images of my box bollard.  Definitions \nfirst:\n'closed' ... actual 6-sided box, as generated by ie2rad\n'open'  ...  the above, with the top and bottom removed\n'open_fixed' ... the above, with a modified source.cal\n\n\nThe light sources in a test room:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/closed_box_f.jpg\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/open_box_f.jpg\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/open_box_fixed_f.jpg\nThere is no noticeable difference between 'open' and 'open_fixed'.\nBoth are slightly different to 'closed'.\n\n\nDiff images:\n$ pcomb -f picdiff.cal closed_box.hdr open_box_fixed.hdr \\\n > closed_v_fixed.hdr\netc\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/closed_v_fixed_f.jpg\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/closed_v_open_f.jpg\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/open_v_fixed_f.jpg\n\n\n'closed_v_open' and 'closed_v_fixed' are identical.  The reason for\nthis might be that practically all of the light is emitted side-ways,\nso that removing the top and bottom of the box makes no difference at\nall. Equally, fiddling with source.cal as per Greg's advice\n\n\n\"Regarding the local box correction, you could take out the third term\n\"noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3\" from the formula:\nlboxprojection = (      noneg(abs(Px-Dx*Ts)-A2/2)*A3*A4 +\n                        noneg(abs(Py-Dy*Ts)-A3/2)*A2*A4 +\n                        noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3 ) / Ts;\"\n\n\nseemed to give identical results.\n\n\nNot sure if this provides a general answer to my question, but in my\nparticular case, it appears to be safe to reduce the box to its four\nsides, which probably only works because of the very special\nphotometry.\n\n\nBest\nAxel\n\n\nOn 06/11/14 16:42, Axel Jacobs wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010634.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "November 20, 2014 at 10:56AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010601", "id": "radiance-general_010634"}
