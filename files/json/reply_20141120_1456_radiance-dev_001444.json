{"body": "I just received the following from DropBox and it seemed like it *might* be\nrelevant:\n\n\nWe\u2019re reaching out to let you know about an issue in Apple\u2019s new OS X\nYosemite that causes problems withDropbox. You can resolve this issue by\ninstalling the latest Software Update for OS X Yosemite.\n\n\nOS X Yosemite may occasionally cause some programs to crash when you open,\nsave-as, or first save a file. These crashes are rare but happen when an\napplication, such asDropbox, uses Yosemite\u2019s official Finder integration \u2014\nand if that program crashes because of this interaction, unsaved changes\nmay be lost.\n\n\nTo fix this issue, Apple has released OS X Update 10.10.1. This update is\navailable for free in the Mac App Store. Details on how to update your Mac\nare available onApple\u2019s support site <http://support.apple.com/HT1338>.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-November/001444.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tim Perry", "created_at": "November 20, 2014 at 02:56PM", "created_by": "Tim_Perry", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001440", "id": "radiance-dev_001444"}
