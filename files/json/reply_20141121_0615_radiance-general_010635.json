{"body": "Hi Thomas,\n\n\nThank you for the information. I don't have problem with implementing it in\nMATLAB or something, but thought would be good to have latest CIE in\ngensky. I will do my best to do a comparison of current gensky with the\nlatest CIE model to see if there is a significant improvement in prediction\nor not. if so, why not to update the gensky.\n\n\nCheers,\nEhsan\n\n\nOn Thu, Nov 20, 2014 at 2:24 PM, Thomas Bleicher <tbleicher at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010635.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ehsan Vazifeh", "created_at": "November 21, 2014 at 06:15AM", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010627", "id": "radiance-general_010635"}
