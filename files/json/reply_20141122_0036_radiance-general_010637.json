{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nI am copying this email to the Radiance-Daysim list as well. There are two  \nmore streamlined ways to go about this right now: using Daysim or using  \nthe Radiance three or five-phase methods.\n\n\nFor using Daysim, there is a lot of information I can provide:\n- Tutorial from NRCAN:  \nhttp://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/daysim-tutorial (slightly  \nupdated by Harvard)\n- Daysim Documentation page: http://daysim.ning.com/\n- A presentation I gave in 2012 on Daysim:  \nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day1/Jakubiec/jakubiec,reinhart_radiance-workshop-presentation_daysim.pdf\n\n\nIf you are using DIVA on Windows, there are Daysim batch files you can  \nopen from the c:\\DIVA\\Temp\\RhinoFileName\\ folder after running a  \nsimulation in order to see how the programs are called.\n\n\nFor the 3/5-phase methods, I am no expert, but a good place to start is  \nhere,\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf\nOthers on the mailing list are highly expert in this.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n\n\nOn Sat, 22 Nov 2014 15:24:16 +0800, David Davidson\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010637.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "November 22, 2014 at 12:36AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010636", "id": "radiance-general_010637"}
