{"body": "Hello, \n  I wanted to post, that via grasshopper i ve managed to rotate back and clean the list . The backwards re-import into Ecotect from Daysim was not reliable and giving odd results . The whole visualisation of the output Im making now in grasshopper ,\n  with the help of small script ive assembled.  \n  Thought of posting this, since maybe there could be new users, as me, in the community working with the same pipeline ecotect#radiance#daysim experiencing the same concern and not being able to get the final graphic output.  \n  best,  Niya  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\n\n\u041e\u0442: Todor Syarov thodor at abv.bg\n\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: [Radiance-daysim] View Daylighting Analysis Results by DAYSIM 3.1b\n\t(beta)\n\n\n\u0414\u043e: radiance-daysim at radiance-online.org\n\n\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: \u0421\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430, 2014, \u041e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 1 13:44:12 EEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Dear all,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   I am working on a daylight simulation with pipeline:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   IGDB#optics6#window7.2#ecotect2011#radiance#daysim3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Wanted to correct the suggested lines in the Daysim generated *.da file before feeding back into ecotect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Is that the way the edited file should look like? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    # UDI_100-2000 - Static Shading\n\n\n\n\n    # sensor_file_info 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    8.937460\n       3.357410\n       0.850000\n       53\n\n\n\n\n    7.818620\n       3.555310\n       0.850000\n       51\n\n\n\n\n    10.334970\n       3.110880\n       0.850000\n       68\n\n\n\n\n    12.336220\n       6.915090\n       0.850000\n       57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Sadly,the sensor points are rotated from Ecotect into Daysim.
