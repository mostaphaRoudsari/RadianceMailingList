{"body": "Hi Brian,\n\n\nHow did you determine the \"small area mean\" of 131 nits using falsecolor?\n\n\nThe discrepancy between the two programs has to do with a bug in the \"pextrem\" program, which uses the intensity rather than the luminance to determine the brightest pixel.  In your case, the red shelves have higher intensity than the top shelf, despite the fact that the top of the bookcase has a higher luminance value.  Therefore, pextrem (used by falsecolor) thinks the brightest point is on a red shelf rather than on top, and both the luminance scale (using \"auto\") and the max value are incorrectly determined.\n\n\nIt is possible to correct this flaw in falsecolor without too much difficulty by replacing some lines of code, at a small expense in computation time.  This hasn't come up before, to my knowledge, as people tend not to use such strong primary colors.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010653.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 04, 2015 at 12:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010651", "id": "radiance-general_010653"}
