{"body": "For the small area, in Photosphere I dragged and dropped a selection box,\nwhich updated the histogram. I wanted to perform a sanity check to see if\nvalues in my Radiance model where matching the real world model. Guess I'm\nused to that type of selection in other programs and it appeared to work.\nmaybe need to check further.\n\n\nPoint well taken on the strong primary color, its federal paint standard\nInsignia Red, aka Red Safety No 11105, aka Fire Suppression System red\npaint. Its used on all the launch pad sprinkler system pipes. The grey is\nGrey Standard No 16473, which is launch pad grey.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nBrian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010654.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Brian Karr", "created_at": "January 04, 2015 at 03:36PM", "created_by": "Brian_Karr", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010651", "id": "radiance-general_010654"}
