{"body": "Hi Brian,\n\n\nI don't think you can read the values in that corner accurately using \"-s auto\", which gets the wrong maximum due to the issue with pextrem and sets the scale too low.  If you use \"-s 400\" instead, you will see what I mean.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010659.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 05, 2015 at 09:29AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010651", "id": "radiance-general_010659"}
