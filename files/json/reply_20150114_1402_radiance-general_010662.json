{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI missed that thread, so a late reply. While having the current CIE skies in gensky would certainly nice, we do not really depend on it. Philip Greenup had the models implemented in  a little cal-file (ssldlum.cal), which used to be on www.radiance-online.org in the patches-directory but disappeared with the installation of the new web-site.\n\n\nStill, the file is documented on page 251 of Philip's thesis (a highly recommended reading, not only that one page..). For a quick pragmatic problem-solving copy&paste will do: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15936/1/Philip_Greenup_Thesis.pdf\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010662.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
