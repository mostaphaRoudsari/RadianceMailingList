Might be better to just try asking your system where it thinks your installed binaries are, e.g., \"which rpict\" should print the full path location of rpict on your system, like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$which rpict\n\n\n/usr/local/bin/rpict\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that command returns nothing, then your system doesn't know where Radiance is (which seems to be what the benchmark script is saying too). Double check that your paths are set properly, and that you are running the benchmark script from a NEW terminal window, not the one you used to compile Radiance and set the paths.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010680.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010680"}
