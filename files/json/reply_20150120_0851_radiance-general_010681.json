This is something you need to have on your system in addition to XCode in order to build a few of the Radiance programs (rvu, image, etc.). Your build probably failed and you have a somewhat busted installation of Radiance, here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bias alert) may I suggest you try the Mac Radiance installer we have available?\n\n\n https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese have everything built already, and the installer puts everything in:\n\n\n/usr/local/radiance/bin\n\n\n/usr/local/radiance/lib\n\n\n/usr/local/radiance/man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026and you can follow Andy's path setting tricks in that video you posted to get this all dialed in and working for ya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010681.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010681"}
