{"body": "Yeah, grab radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg and double-click that, then dbl-click on the installer package and follow the directions. Afterward, you still need to do the path setting step detailed by Andy in his video, just substituting the paths from my last email. If you use that installer, you don't need the source code (well, it's still useful for general interest, but you don't need it to run Radiance on your computer).\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nP.S. You can also browse the source code on the GitHub mirror, and see the entire revision history, here:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined  (make sure you're on the \"combined\" branch, which is the one we keep up to date with Greg's changes (hourly).) It's pretty awesome to see every change through time!\n\n\nOn 1/20/15, 9:51 AM, \"Todor Syarov\" <thodor at abv.bg<mailto:thodor at abv.bg>> wrote:\n\n\nThank you Rob, for the fast reply and the link provided!!!\n\n\nok, so I would need now only to the radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg to unpack, no?\nwhat do I need the source code for? -is it the non-compiled version of radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\u041e\u0442: \"Guglielmetti, Robert\" Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov<mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov>\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n\u0414\u043e: Radiance general discussion <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: 20.01.2015 18:35\n\n\nOK this one means you don't have the X11 libraries installed. This is something you need to have on your system in addition to XCode in order to build a few of the Radiance programs (rvu, image, etc.). Your build probably failed and you have a somewhat busted installation of Radiance, here.\n\n\n(Bias alert) may I suggest you try the Mac Radiance installer we have available?\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases\n\n\nThese have everything built already, and the installer puts everything in:\n/usr/local/radiance/bin\n/usr/local/radiance/lib\n/usr/local/radiance/man\n\n\n\u2026and you can follow Andy's path setting tricks in that video you posted to get this all dialed in and working for ya.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 1/20/15, 9:25 AM, \"Todor Syarov\" <thodor at abv.bg<javascript:%20internSendMess('thodor at abv.bg')><mailto:thodor at abv.bg>> wrote:\n\n\nOne of the first messages I was getting before error 127\nwas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx11image.c:26:11: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found\n\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n\n\n\n\n\n\neventhough i I had checked before installing the compatibility btw OS system and Xcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------- \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e --------\n\u041e\u0442: \"Brian Karr\" brianakarr at yahoo.com<javascript:%20internSendMess('brianakarr at yahoo.com')><mailto:brianakarr at yahoo.com>\n\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e: Re: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127\n\u0414\u043e: \"'Radiance general discussion'\" <radiance-general at radiance-online.org<javascript:%20internSendMess('radiance-general at radiance-online.org')><mailto:radiance-general at radiance-online.org>>\n\u0418\u0437\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430: 20.01.2015 17:46\n\n\nNot sure if this applies, when I installed on Mac this thread helped:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000221.html\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010683.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 08:59AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010683"}
