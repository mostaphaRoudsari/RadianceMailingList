However, your last error message about the X11 header file not being found, makes me think you don't have a complete set of binaries anyway. I'd recommend you install the binaries we have available at the NREL Radiance GitHub site, and then change the paths thusly, in your \"~/.profile\" file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexport PATH=/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexport RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexport MANPATH=/usr/local/radiance/man\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis way we can eliminate any build/compile errors from the scenario and just focus on getting your system pointing to Radiance. How's that sound?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010684.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 09:02AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010684"}
