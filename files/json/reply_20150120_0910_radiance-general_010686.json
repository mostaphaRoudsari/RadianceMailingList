Afterward, you still need to do the path setting step detailed by Andy in his video, just substituting the paths from my last email. If you use that installer, you don't need the source code (well, it's still useful for general interest, but you don't need it to run Radiance on your computer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. You can also browse the source code on the GitHub mirror, and see the entire revision history, here:\n\n\n https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined   (make sure you're on the \"combined\" branch, which is the one we keep up to date with Greg's changes (hourly).) It's pretty awesome to see every change through time!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010686.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 09:10AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010686"}
