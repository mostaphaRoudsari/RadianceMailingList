Uninstalling the last attempt is just a matter of deleting that directory. Looks like Andy has you install to /Applications/radiance/head or whatever. Just delete that directory, assuming everything is in there. When you change the paths, you'll be all set. Getting close!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010687.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010687"}
