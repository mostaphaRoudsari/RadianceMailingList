If you ran the installer and changed the patches, you are all set to\u2026 \"begin\". =)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you might now wanna try running the benchmark, or at least checking the basic installation is sound by typing \"which rpict\" at the command line. Should return \"/usr/local/radiance/bin/rpict\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you have now is Radiance installed on your Mac. Actually using it is the next exciting step, unfortunately it's  a little more complicated than just running an executable and poking around in some menus. I recommend checking out some tutorials on the main site, and browsing the radiance-online listserv archives ( http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-general). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWheeeeee!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010689.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Todor Syarov", "created_at": "January 20, 2015 at 09:55AM", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010672", "id": "radiance-general_010689"}
