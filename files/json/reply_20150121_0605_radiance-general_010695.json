I also use Radiance in Windows OS (but 8) and the\nonly thing required (in addition to the Radiance execution file) is a Perl\ninterpreter (i.e. Strawberrya and Raspberry), which is needed in order to\nrun some commands, such as genklemsamp.\n\n\nTake a look at this discussion:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010431.html\n\n\n\n\nPS: There was also a tutorial about the Radiance Installation on window SO\n(I guess by NREL) called \"Getting Started with Radiance\", but it seems to\nbe disappeared.\n\n\nCheers,\nGiuseppe\n\n\n2015-01-21 12:18 GMT+01:00 Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com>:\n\n\n> Hello Jiajie,\n>\n> Are you aware of the NREL precompiled WINDOWS Radiance\n> <https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases>?
