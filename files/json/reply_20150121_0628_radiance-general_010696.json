I also use Radiance in Windows OS (but 8) and the only thing required (in addition to the Radiance execution file) is a Perl interpreter (i.e. Strawberrya and Raspberry), which is needed in order to run some commands, such as genklemsamp.\n\n\nTake a look at this discussion:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010431.html\n\n\nPS: There was also a tutorial about the Radiance Installation on window SO (I guess by NREL) called \"Getting Started with Radiance\", but it seems to be disappeared.\n\n\nCheers,\nGiuseppe\n\n\n2015-01-21 12:18 GMT+01:00 Germ?n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com<mailto:germolinal at gmail.com>>:\nHello Jiajie,\n\n\nAre you aware of the NREL precompiled WINDOWS Radiance<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases>? I have succesfully used them at work along with Raspberry Perl. If that does not convince you, I guess you can keep trying Cygwin... but I have no idea how to help you there.\n\n\nBye!\n\n\nGerm?n\n\n\n2015-01-21 8:05 GMT-03:00 Jonathan Zhu <jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com<mailto:jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com>>:\nhi everyone,\n\n\nI am a student and i am completely new to Radiance.\nI have already installed Cygwin and downloaded the latest source code.\nCould someone tell me how to install Radiance on my windows 7 system in detail?\n\n\nmany thanks,\nJiajie\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiuseppe De Michele\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010696.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 21, 2015 at 06:28AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010693", "id": "radiance-general_010696"}
