{"body": "Thank you at all for the precious help. We will take in account all your\nadvices.\n\n\nIn the next weeks I will update you with the project evolution.\n\n\nHappy weekend,\nGiuseppe\nFor another datapoint, the Research Support Facility here at NREL is rather\nwell daylit, and is 60' deep, but receives light from the north side as\nwell as the south, in addition to heavy use of daylight redirection from\nthe south. From experience (I've had a desk in the  middle of this building\nfor the last few years), I'd say that the daylight redirection devices\nprovide useful daylight as far back as 35' under ideal conditions, and on\naverage to 25' from the south wall. These devices can also paint the back\nwall - 60' away from the source - with daylight! While impressive, I still\nsay that *useful* daylight from those things (i.e. horizontal task\nilluminance >=250 lux) penetrates 35' or so at most; pretty much about as\ndeep as LBNL's new test space (FLEXLAB).\n\n\nI also like Christoph's idea for a standard office reference model for\nsimulation; liked it the first time when it was called CIE 171:2006, too.\n;) In all seriousness, I believe this Reinhart et al. model is a great idea\n-- especially product comparisons in simulation, across climates.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 1/22/15, 11:24 AM, \"Andrew McNeil\" <amcneil at lbl.gov<mailto:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010701.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "January 23, 2015 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "Giuseppe_De_Michele", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010697", "id": "radiance-general_010701"}
