{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nmy 2cents: The long wave part sounds basically achievable by ESP-r. You would probably need to model the courtyard as \"indoor\" with a very transparent roof, however. Long wave exchange can be tracked in ESP-r with quite high detailing. Possibly, you could also answer the solar question with ESP-r (separating \"reflection\" from \"direct/diffuse solar\" is probably also tricky, if actually necessary and likely a question of designing a few \"experiments\"). I am not entirely sure, though, how detailed reflections in closed spaces are followed (they are, to some degree). You can couple ESP-r with Radiance and if your material properties are \"solar\" and not \"visual\", I would expect that you could get a very good idea of what is happening in your space of interest.\n\n\nA CFD package may be the alternative approach. However, I am not aware of any specific package in which solar reflection may be handled sufficiently. Long wave exchange should be covered O.K. One other possible source of a modelling package I am aware of could be Physibel (Belgium). They have tools that may cover your requirements.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010705.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "January 25, 2015 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010671", "id": "radiance-general_010705"}
