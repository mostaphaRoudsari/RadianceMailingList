{"body": "Mike,\nOut of curiosity, at what image size (pixels) are you rendering, and are you using pfilt to filter down to the final image? I believe rendering many extra pixels with lower \u2013ad and filtering down by /5, /10, etc. is the typical approach for the sake of rendering time when setting \u2013aa 0. I\u2019m not an expert in this, just recalling things I\u2019ve seen in the distant past. I wonder if this approach would also reduce the size of those rendering artifacts.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010711.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "January 27, 2015 at 06:10AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010708", "id": "radiance-general_010711"}
