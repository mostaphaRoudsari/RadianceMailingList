{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nAre you getting any error messages?\n\n\nI guess you can try\n\n\n   1. changing rview by rvu (not sure if they are exactly the same...)\n   2. the line  \"vi room.rad\" should not be in the room.rad file. It is the\n   command for creating the file.\n\n\nI do not use \"vi\"... you can try editing using \"gedit room.rad\", which is a\nMUCH simpler text editor.\n\n\nTell us you error messages and maybe we will be able to help you!\n\n\nBye\n\n\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n2015-01-27 14:28 GMT-03:00 Jonathan Zhu <jonathan.zhu.uk at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010713.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "January 27, 2015 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010712", "id": "radiance-general_010713"}
