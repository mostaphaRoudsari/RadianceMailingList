{"body": "Joe - indeed, Axel's resources are fantastic.\n\n\nMark, thanks for the tip - I'll see how it goes. So much for what I thought\nI knew about -ar... It turns out you can get a pretty nice -aa 0 rendering\nwith today's newer machines in about the same time a \"traditional\" run\n(complete with sampling artifacts) would take on 7-8 year old hardware...\nIt's a bit of an apples to oranges test, but interesting to see\nadvancements in hardware performance reducing the need for indirect\ncalculation optimization.\n\n\nChris, it's a 3000px rendering pfilted down to 1000px. I'll test out a\nlarger resolution too and see if the artifacts scale with the increased\niamge size.\n\n\nThanks!\nMM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 27, 2015 at 6:10 AM, Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010714.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mike Martinez", "created_at": "January 27, 2015 at 01:21PM", "created_by": "Mike_Martinez", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010708", "id": "radiance-general_010714"}
