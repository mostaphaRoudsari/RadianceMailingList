{"body": "Marco,\n\n\nPuzzling. I'd suggest starting by adjusting the simulation parameters to\nmake sure all ambient rays and direct rays are traced.\n\n\nHere are the simulation parameters you used:\n -I -h -dp 2048 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -st .01 -lr 12 -lw\n.0005 -ab 2 -ad 1000 -as 20 -ar 300 -aa 0.1\n\n\nHere are the parameters I recommend testing:\n -I -h -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-5 -ab 2 -ad 2000 -as 1000 -aa 0\n\n\nIf that doesn't help I'd like to see your Solyndra.pts file.\n\n\nOn a side note, this is the second posting where someone is using the -ms\nparameter. Are people really using mist in daylight simulations these days?\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010720.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "January 29, 2015 at 11:11AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010718", "id": "radiance-general_010720"}
