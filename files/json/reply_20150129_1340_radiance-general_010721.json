{"body": "Hi Wendelin,\n\n\nThere should probably be a clarification in the man page regarding uniform sampling, which currently ignores the surface orientation.  I don't know whether it would be better to document this in the man page or change the code so that back of uniform receivers do not accumulate energy.  Is this important in your application?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010721.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 29, 2015 at 01:40PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010719", "id": "radiance-general_010721"}
