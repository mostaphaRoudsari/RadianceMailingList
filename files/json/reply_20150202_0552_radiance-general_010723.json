{"body": "Dear Andy,\nThank You for your interest, I must apologize, as I simply copied the command from a diva grid based illuminance simulation: I changed the input parameters to -W (Global Horizontal, Diffuse Horizontal)and the output to irradiance \"-O 1\"(Watt/m2); of course having some mist doesn't make any sense as it is already accounted in the parameters I have as input (which are from a weather station nearby(meters away from the panel)).\nAbout the approximations I just completely trust who wrote the code for Diva, now I will try without any and keep you up to date\nThank You very Much\n                                                   Marco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010723.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lovati Marco", "created_at": "February 02, 2015 at 05:52AM", "created_by": "Lovati_Marco", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010718", "id": "radiance-general_010723"}
