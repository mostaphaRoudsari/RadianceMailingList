{"body": "Dear Joe and Greg,\n\n\nNot sure if this is a question... there it goes though.\n\n\nI was trying to emulate a micro perforated metal the other day (I do not\nwant to draw thousands of little holes!)... I tried to use TRANS equations\nto derive the parameters I needed, but it did not seem to work. I think\nTRANS properties vary with the angle of incidence?? (the percentaje of\nspecular transmission does no change with different angles of incidence in\na perforated screen)\n\n\nI ended up using a mixture between VOID and a Plastic material, on which I\nvaried the percentage of \"Void\"... I am not sure, maybe that trick would\nalso help modelling trees.\n\n\nAm I correct? Is, what I did, legally from the physical laws of lighitng?\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2015-02-05 8:52 GMT-03:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010726.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 04:30AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010724", "id": "radiance-general_010726"}
