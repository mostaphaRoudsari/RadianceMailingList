{"body": "Dear Joe and Greg,\n\n\nI was trying to emulate a micro perforated metal the other day (I do not\nwant to draw thousands of little holes!)... I tried to use TRANS equations\nto derive the parameters I needed, but it did not seem to work. I think\nTRANS properties vary with the ngle of incidence??\n\n\nI ended up using a mixture between VOID and a Plastic material, on which I\nvaried the percentage of \"Void\"... I am not sure, maybe that trick would\nalso help modelling trees.\n\n\nAm I correct? Is, what I did, legally from the physical laws of lighitng?\nHi Joe,\n\n\nIf you want to model your tree as a sphere (on a stick?) with a certain\ntransmittance, the \"trans\" material type should suit your purpose.\nParameter setting is a bit tricky, but since you don't have any reflection\nor scattering to consider, simply set values according to your\ntransmittance T:\n\n\nvoid trans treeT\n0\n0\n7 T T T 0 0 1 1\n\n\nI hope this addresses your question.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010727.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 04:46AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010724", "id": "radiance-general_010727"}
