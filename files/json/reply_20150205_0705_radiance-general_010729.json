{"body": "I see Rapha\u00ebl just pointed out what I was in the middle of typing about the square root transmittance correction. Also, keep in mind this will only be a very rough approximation for any measurements very near the tree, where rays passing through all parts of the tree get the same reduction even if they just glance the fringe of the sphere or other shape. In reality, rays passing through the outer fringes of a tree canopy would intersect with fewer leaves than those passing through the more substantial core of the tree (also depending on tree species).\nI would love to here if anyone has a more ideal solution for modeling trees that is relatively accurate, and reasonable in terms of rendering time and use of RAM \u2013 in other words without modeling every single leaf. If it looked nice that would be a bonus. Is this a possible application for something exotic like mist? I\u2019ve never even investigated mist so apologies if that\u2019s a ridiculous suggestion.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010729.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 07:05AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010724", "id": "radiance-general_010729"}
