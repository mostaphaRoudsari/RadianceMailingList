{"body": "Yes, I should have thought about the square root -- good catch!\n\n\nThe trans type doesn't change with incident angle (unlike glass or dielectric), which is part of why I suggested it.  I don't know what's happening in Germ\u00e1n's case, but using a mixfunc with void and plastic is a perfectly acceptable approach.\n\n\nAs for varying the absorption using mist, a ball of mist might indeed have the desired behavior, as the absorption is an exponential function of the volume traversed using the mist material.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010730.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 05, 2015 at 04:14PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010724", "id": "radiance-general_010730"}
