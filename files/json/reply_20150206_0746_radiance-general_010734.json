{"body": "Hi Joe,\n\n\nThe setting of trans parameters is a bit tricky and an oft-visited question that should be the first in a FAQ, if indeed such a thing will happen if it hasn't yet after 25 years....  If you do a search on the Radiance mailing list for \"trans parameters\" or similar, I'm sure you'll find some choice entries.  Maybe someone can recommend a calculator for you, but the basic formulae are given in Section 5.2 on p. 325-6 of \"Rendering with Radiance,\" attached below.\n\n\nI like the concept of using a mixfunc with void and plastic on the outside and mist on the inside.  Working out the appropriate parameters to get a reasonable look would be a challenge, but the results might be worth it.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010734.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2015 at 07:46AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010724", "id": "radiance-general_010734"}
