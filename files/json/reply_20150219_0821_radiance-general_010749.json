You could try\ninstalling a custom version from python.org.\n\n\nAlso, I recommend switching to os.popen instead of os.system. You have much\nmore feedback from the output stream and any errors that show up.\nConverting the code is usually very easy.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 18, 2015 at 10:43 PM, Joe Smith <the.oat.cracker at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010749.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "February 19, 2015 at 08:21AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010747", "id": "radiance-general_010749"}
