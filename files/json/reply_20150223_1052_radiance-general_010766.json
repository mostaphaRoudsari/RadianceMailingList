We get the number of points from the input file (created by the OpenStudio-to-Radiance model translator), here:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/blob/develop/openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/radiance/DaylightSim-Simple.rb#L375-377\n\n\n...then pass that to the -y option to rfluxmtx here:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/blob/develop/openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/radiance/DaylightSim-Simple.rb#L433\n\n\nBTW this was all merged to the main develop branch just last week; we are testing it and documenting it now and this whole 3-phase/shade control thing will be included in OpenStudio v1.7.0 next month, and it'll be in the next iteration release for bleeding edge types, next week. =)\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010766.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010761", "id": "radiance-general_010766"}
