{"body": "Hi Greg, et. al,\n\n\nIs there any chance that you can also add some notes about the headings.\nThere are couple of them in Andy's presentation for .rad or sky files (e.g\n#@rfluxmtx h=kf u=+Y or #@rfluxmtx h=u u=Y). I wonder what are other\noptions available.\n\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n\n\nPS: Congrats Rob! Can't wait to see it flying in the wild! :)\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 23, 2015 at 1:52 PM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010767.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mostapha Sadeghipour", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 11:08AM", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010761", "id": "radiance-general_010767"}
