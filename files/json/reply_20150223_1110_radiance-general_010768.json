{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nI don't think there's an easy way to do this with Radiance.  If you have complete spectral information for the sky, you can perform a multi-pass spectral calculation by substituting the appropriate components and material reflectances/transmittances for your subdivided spectrum.  There are a few posts related to this in the list archives.  Try searching on \"spectral\".\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010768.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 11:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010765", "id": "radiance-general_010768"}
