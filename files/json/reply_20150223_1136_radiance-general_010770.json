{"body": "Eduardo,\n\n\nI have done some experimentation with clouds in Radiance, and there\nare two ways that seem to work.\n\n\nOne is to define a closed cloud volume and apply the \"mist\" material\nto it. This mesh must be closed, watertight, and non-intersecting, and\nwill appear to be of constant \"cloud\" density. It helps considerably\nif it's in the shape of a cloud. It can look something like this:\nhttp://markjstock.org/graphics/ray/clouds04.jpg\n\n\nThe other method allows varying density throughout the cloud, but is a\nlot more work. It consists of creating a large number of small,\nnon-overlapping cubes (a dense matrix of cubes with small spaces\nbetween them), each with a different mist material applied to them.\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/img2_00.jpg\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/img3_01.jpg\n\n\nThese options seemed to create the most cloud-like volumes (with\nclouds of size 1 and mist \"voxels\" of size ~0.01):\n-ma 0.95 0.95 0.95 -mg 0.05 -ms 0.001\n\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/22/15, Eduardo Artigas <eduardoartigas at yahoo.es> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010770.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "February 23, 2015 at 11:36AM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010763", "id": "radiance-general_010770"}
