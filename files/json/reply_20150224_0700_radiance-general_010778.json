{"body": "It could be that you need more -ab bounces, or more -ad rays traced in order to avoid the unexplained divergence you see for the areas farthest from the windows in the 10m deep room. This could also impact your drop from 60% to 40% UDI when increasing room depth to 10m.\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the solutions do perform similarly at more than 4m from the glass, unless your lamella or your light shelf have special specular or prismatic materials or shapes intended to really redirect light farther into the space. By that distance from the window, the light has bounced so many times that the reflectance of the floor and ceiling probably have a bigger impact than either of two relatively comparable window systems. Or, at that distance the illumination could be reliant almost entirely on the view of the sky from each point on the workplane which could be similar for both systems at a distance.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010778.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "February 24, 2015 at 07:00AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010777", "id": "radiance-general_010778"}
