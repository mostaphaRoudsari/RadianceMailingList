{"body": "Dear Christopher,\n\n\n\n\nThank you for the comments. As ambient parameters options I have used:\n\n\n -ab 12 -ad 50000 -as 2048 -ar 1024 -lw 1e-8 (following the 3-phase method\ntutorial).\n\n\nOtherwise, I think that the dropping of UDI due to the increasing of room\ndepth is not a strange effect. This because the contribute of the rays\nrefracted from the bottom wall is smaller.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the \u2013ab 12, it can be that the reflectance of the inner walls\nand ceiling have a bigger impact compared with the systems as you said.\n\n\n\n\nI suppose that also the dimension of the upper window, compared with the\nlower one, does not have a great influece on the inner illuminance values.\nHere the dimension http://s5.postimg.org/ezlt60cp3/lab.jpg.\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this work it is to analyze the daylight level in a deep room\nusing a system of daylight redirecting. Therefore, I would like to have an\neffect of the shading system after 4 meters.\n\n\nMaybe I have to test different systems in order to reach the effects\nexpected.\n\n\n\n\nAnother question: Considering the characteristics of a real product I have\ncreated this material for the light shelf\n\n\nvoid metal shelf_mat\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n5  0.98 0.98 0.98  0.96 0.01\n\n\nCan it be realistic? Do you suggest to use also a mirror on the shelf\nand/or on the ceiling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\n\nGiuseppe\n\n\n2015-02-24 16:00 GMT+01:00 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010779.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "February 25, 2015 at 06:35AM", "created_by": "Giuseppe_De_Michele", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010777", "id": "radiance-general_010779"}
