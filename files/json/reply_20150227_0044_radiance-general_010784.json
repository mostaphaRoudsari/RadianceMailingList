Fact\nis the software seems to work fine.\n\n\nKnowing that I have tried to install it on LinuxMint 17.1. There I had to\nadd -fPIC to MACH in the RMakefile and after the g++ in the install.sh . The\nshell still finishes on a warning\n\"BSDF.h:105:8: warning: 'SDComp_s\" has a field 'SDComp_s::func' whose type\nuses the anonymous namespace [enabled by default] \n struct SDComp_s {\n        ^\n\"\nWhatever, BSDFViewer seems to work well.\n\n\nThanks \nSerge\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010784.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Serge Neuman", "created_at": "February 27, 2015 at 12:44AM", "created_by": "Serge_Neuman", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010781", "id": "radiance-general_010784"}
