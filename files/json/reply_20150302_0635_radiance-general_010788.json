{"body": "Hi Peter,\n\n\nI am assuming you have Type C photometry files, perhaps some for a directional, amiable luminaire like a track fixture or something like that. In this case you would convert the ies file to radiance format using ies2ead, and then do your tilting and rotating using the Radiance xform utility to do translations.\n\n\nSee:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ies2rad.1.html\nand\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/xform.1.html\n\n\nThere are also extensive examples of how to aim luminaries in Rob Shakespeare's art gallery tutorial in Rendering With Radiance.\n\n\nhth,\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 3/2/15, 2:04 AM, \"Peter Za\u0165ko\" <petozatko89 at gmail.com<mailto:petozatko89 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi there,\n\n\nI'm new here and actually I'm doing interior visualiyations with a proper IES light, and in some cases I need to tilt them or rotate, and I realized that is not allowed. I searched then for some tilted files but there are not existing for my luminaries.\nCan I ask, If there is any programe to tilt the actuall IES file and than put it into Radiance or is there any possibility to rotate or tilt an IES file in Radiance ? Any tips and hints?\n\n\nThanks a lot\nKind regards,\n\n\nPeter Zatko\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010788.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 02, 2015 at 06:35AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010786", "id": "radiance-general_010788"}
