{"body": "The xform command can shift, rotate, tilt, and array the .rad file definition that gets created from ies2rad. Please write again if you have any trouble finding the manual page for it.\n\n\nThe .rad file that comes from ies2rad represents the geometry of the IES file \u2013 and makes reference to a data translation of the luminaire intensity. You should also get such a .dat file out of ies2rad, but shouldn\u2019t have to perform any actions on this because it\u2019s a data reference into the .rad file rather than a geometry that must be rotated.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the replmarks command which can be helpful for locating light sources if you\u2019re exporting a model from some other modeling software.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010789.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "March 02, 2015 at 06:38AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010786", "id": "radiance-general_010789"}
