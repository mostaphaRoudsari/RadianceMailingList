{"body": "Thanks, Joe.  The fc image you put up on Dropbox was created with the\nold palette, which is available in the latest falsecolor.pl with the\n'-pal spec' option.  You're using either an older official version, or\nfalsecolor2 (not sure what the default palette is there).\n\n\nAnyhow, I'm glad it's all working for you\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 3 March 2015 at 13:31, Joe Smith <the.oat.cracker at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010791.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 03, 2015 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010774", "id": "radiance-general_010791"}
