{"body": "Hello! \n\n\n\n\nI am doing simulations using Daysim and SketchUp. I have this glass material: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid glass GenericDoubleGlazing72 \n0 \n0 \n3 0.784590 0.784590 0.784590 \n\n\n\n\nbut at the .rad file in Daysim it appears as: \n\n\n\n\nvoid trans GenericD 0 0 7 0.8848 0.8848 0.8848 0.0000 0.0000 0.4760 1.0000 \n\n\n\n\nI am aware of the RGB/monochrome conversion but the type of radiance material is changing too ( \"glass\" to \"trans\" ). Is that correct? Does that mean that the results the way as they are refer to a translucent material instead of a glass ? \n\n\n\n\nBesides that, if I want to customize a material file I would have to directly run the radfiles2daysim instead of importing the material using the GUI? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would appreciate any directions on that subject.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2015-March/000101.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kamila Mendon\u00e7a", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 10:45AM", "created_by": "Kamila_Mendon\u00e7a", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000102", "id": "radiance-daysim_000101"}
