{"body": "Hi Reinier,\n\n\nAre you being sure to group your same-material surfaces together when passing them to rfluxmtx?  The program isn't smart enough to group them for you, and I suppose this requirement needs to be mentioned explicitly in the man page.  That was an oversight on my part...\n\n\nIf your receiver surfaces are already grouped by modifier and you are getting this error, send me your files off-list and I will see if I can figure out what's going on.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010803.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 12, 2015 at 11:22AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010800", "id": "radiance-general_010803"}
