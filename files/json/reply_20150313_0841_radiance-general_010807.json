{"body": "Wow Kera, all that info, and from your iPhone?! Impressive. Kera hit all\nthe points, I think. I would only add that I think AGI *can* produce\npretty convincing images, within the limitations of the radiosity approach\n(i.e. no true specular reflection model). In fact the brains behind AGI\n(Ian Ashdown) recently contributed to a thread on a LinkedIn forum about\nhow AGI is the only commercial lighting simulation tool that can render\nchromatic adaptation (constancy), which is pretty damned impressive and\ngoes along way toward \"true to life\" renderings.\n\n\nShri, your specific case of wanting accuracy in the translucent realm is\nwhat finally drove me from Radiance dabbler to Radiance user many moons\nago. Since then however, AGI has matured quite a bit. In my book, the\ninability to do climate based simulations and metrics is a non-starter,\nthough.\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/13/15, 9:19 AM, \"Kera Lagios\" <keralagios at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010807.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 13, 2015 at 08:41AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010805", "id": "radiance-general_010807"}
