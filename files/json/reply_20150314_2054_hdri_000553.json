{"body": "Hi Greg,\nThank you for taking a look at my issue. You\u2019re right, the issue was resolved by retyping the command. As you mentioned there must have been a hidden character in the string. I was copy and pasting it from a text document due to the length, but it must have included something strange.\nThanks,\nWalter\n\n\nC. Walter Beamer IV, Ph.D.\n\n\nHi Walter,\n\n\nIt doesn't really make sense that you would get this error.  Are you sure there aren't some \"hidden characters\" or something else going on with your command line?  I can't reproduce this on my end.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2015-March/000553.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "C.
