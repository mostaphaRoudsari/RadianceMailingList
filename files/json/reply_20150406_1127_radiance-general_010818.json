{"body": "Aditya,\n\n\nTrans isn't really a great option for modeling glazing with frit since the\ntransmission properties don't change with angle. I'd recommend using the\nglaze script that comes with Radiance to build up your glazing material.\nYou simply type 'glaze' at the command line and follow the prompts. the\ninternal demo database already has the V175 frit.\n\n\nJack de Valpine gave a presentation describing how to use glaze to build up\nan IGU. And how to use data from LBNL optics to add entries to your glaze\ndatabase (slide 10). He has the low-e coating you're proposing on slide 10,\nso you might be able to just copy it into your local database.\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2009-boston-ma/Presentations/devalpine_visarc_glazing.pdf\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Apr 5, 2015 at 10:57 PM, Aditya Potipireddi <aditect at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010818.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 06, 2015 at 11:27AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010817", "id": "radiance-general_010818"}
