{"body": "Andy/Jack,\n\n\nThank for providing great resource. I am tying to follow to the process\noutlined and have couple of more questions:\n\n\n1) Since I am using radiance using DIVA for Rhino( Windows operating\nsystem), it creates a Radiance folder with in the DIVA folder. I navigated\nto the radiance folder via command prompt window and tried to call for \"\nglaze\" it gave error as glaze is not recognized. I have even installed the\nRadiance versions 4.3.a.2 for win32.exe that I downloaded form NREL\nradiance releases. Is there a command error ?\n\n\n2) The \"lib\" folder under both Radiance folders has only glaze.1cal( single\npane fritted) and glaze2.cal(double pane fritted) files , there is no\n\"glaze\" file are these the same as glaze file?\n\n\n2) does the example work flow example in the website use unix or cygwin, if\nso do i need to install cygwin? and is there specific version of radiance\nthat i need to install ?\n\n\n4) can I not execute glaze and optics2glazedb via windows?\n\n\n3) Should the \"optics2glazedb\" file put in a specific location and where\ndoes the generated database get written to. Also, what is the file\nextension for optics2glazedb ?\n\n\nAppreciate your help and input.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAditya\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010821.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Aditya Potipireddi", "created_at": "April 06, 2015 at 05:00PM", "created_by": "Aditya_Potipireddi", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010817", "id": "radiance-general_010821"}
