{"body": "Aditya,\n\n\nWell, shoot. Glaze is one of the few remaining c-shell scripts, which means\nit won't run in DOS. Yes, you could install CGWIN. But, to save you the\nhassle I've run it using the parameters you gave and the database from\nJack's blog (thanks Jack!). Though I put the frit on surface 3, because\nglaze won't let you use a frit and low-e coating on the same surface. I\ndon't really know what effect putting the frit on surface 3 vs. underneath\nthe low-e on surface 2 has, but I'd guess you're much better off than had\nyou used a simple trans material. The BRTDfunc material definition is at\nthe very end of the text copied below.\n\n\nhope this helps,\nAndy\n\n\nglaze -f jacksLibrary.db\nAdding glazing types from file jacksLibrary.db :\nppg-clear-6\nvir-ve12m\nvir-ve22m\nvir-ve32m\nvir-ve42m\nvir-ve52m\nvir-ve62m\nvir-ve72m\nvir-ve82m\nv-175\nv-933\nEnter the number of panes in the system: 2\n\n\nWindow normal faces interior\n\n\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |-->\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n s1 s2  s3 s4\n\n\nSupported surface types are:\n   1 - ppg-clear-6\n   2 - vir-ve12m\n   3 - vir-ve22m\n   4 - vir-ve32m\n   5 - vir-ve42m\n   6 - vir-ve52m\n   7 - vir-ve62m\n   8 - vir-ve72m\n   9 - vir-ve82m\n   10 - v-175\n   11 - v-933\n\n\nWhat is the type of s1? 1\nWhat is the type of s2? 9\nWhat is the type of s3? 10\nWhat is the type of s4? 1\nEnter fraction coverage for s3 (0-1): .6\n\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision: 2.8 $\n# Loaded: jacksLibrary.db\n# Mon Apr  6 17:18:12 PDT 2015\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 2\n# Exterior surface s1 type: ppg-clear-6\n# Inner surface s2 type: vir-ve82m\n# Inner surface s3 type: v-175\n# s3 coating coverage: .6\n# Interior surface s4 type: ppg-clear-6\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.193682287\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.23918856\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.287884687\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze2_unnamed\n10\nif(Rdot,cr(1*rclr,0.4*1*tclr,fr(0.022)),cr(fr(0.052),ft(0.5),0.4*rclr))\nif(Rdot,cr(1*rclr,0.4*1*tclr,fr(0.036)),cr(fr(0.055),ft(0.648),0.4*rclr))\nif(Rdot,cr(1*rclr,0.4*1*tclr,fr(0.024)),cr(fr(0.056),ft(0.505),0.4*rclr))\n0.4*1*ft(0.5)*tclr\n0.4*1*ft(0.648)*tclr\n0.4*1*ft(0.505)*tclr\n0 0 0\nglaze2.cal\n0\n9\n0.1494\n0.1464\n0.1452\n0.0885\n0.148646016\n0.09027885\n0.063\n0.081648\n0.06363\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 6, 2015 at 5:00 PM, Aditya Potipireddi <aditect at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010823.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "April 06, 2015 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010817", "id": "radiance-general_010823"}
