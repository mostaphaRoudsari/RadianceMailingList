{"body": "Nasa? Awesome... haha.\n\n\nAnyway, I did not really finished reading, but I have some questions\n\n\n   1. Radiance already has a virtual photogoniometer... genBSDF program.\n   easy yo use and, I would say, very optimized. Why is that you do not want\n   to use it?\n   2. Radiance also has some programs that allow you to give a BSDF\n   \"function\" into a BSDF matrix or tensor tree: bsdf2klems, bsdf2tensortree,\n   or something like that.\n\n\nWere you aware of this? is there a reason not to use them?\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2015-04-09 11:38 GMT-03:00 Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.
