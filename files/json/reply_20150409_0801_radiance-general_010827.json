{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nThank you for the response. Yes I do know of these programs (genBSDF,bsdf2kelms,bsdf2tensortree). But we need our own version because I need direct control of exporting BRDF data, also I want a clear understanding how rtrace should be used for radiance and irradiance measurements.
