{"body": "I won't try to answer all of your questions, and my answer is based only on reading documentation rather than close knowledge of the actual code... but I'll try to comment related to the difference between the uppercase and lowercase -I and -i options. When using uppercase -I rtrace will inherently offset your x,y,z meter position slightly in the direction of your measurement vector in case you've given a coordinate that is coplanar with the surface (I forget the distance used but with my clues and a little searching this should be found somewhere in the mailing list archives). When using the lowercase -i rtrace will trace a ray along the given vector, calculate the luminance at the point of intersection with a surface, then determine illuminance by correcting the luminance with factors of pi and reflectance at the intersection point. I've never investigated if non-Lambertian materials actually do impact this value, but if so the -I option would better serve your purpose for non-lambertian materials, but you may have to scale your model or edit the code to have the offset of measurement coordinates become negligible.\nI wouldn't consider myself an authority on the topic, but I want to try to respond with the hope that others will better explain my understanding if it deserves clarification.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010828.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 09, 2015 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010825", "id": "radiance-general_010828"}
