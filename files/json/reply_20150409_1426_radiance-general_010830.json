{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nThank you for your input. I was not aware of the bsdfquery program, I looked in my Radiance/bin folder & couldn't locate this program in my Windows or Linux installs. I'm using Radiance 4.2. Can you please tell me the location of the bsdfquery program? \n\n\nThank you for explaining the difference between -i & -I rtrace input args. The values L1 and L2 are now equal, and I feel like I have a better understanding of rtrace.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010830.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "April 09, 2015 at 02:26PM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010825", "id": "radiance-general_010830"}
