{"body": "Hi Alejandro,\n\n\nOne option is to run the evalglare program with the -d and -c parameters.\n > evalglare -d -c check.hdr image.hdr\n\n\nThis will do two things: (*1*) the -d option will give you a list of all \ncontrast-based glare sources, including reflections from your facade; \n(*2*) the -c option will colour the separate contrast-based glare \nsources randomly in the check.hdr file. You can even plug the values \nfrom 1 into the contrast half of the DGP equation.\n\n\nOf course running the calculations either with the building as a black \nhole or (more realistically) as not present at all produces some \ncomparative value as well.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010845.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "April 22, 2015 at 07:21AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010844", "id": "radiance-general_010845"}
