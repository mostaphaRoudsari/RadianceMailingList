{"body": "Hi Rick,\n\n\nradiance-online.org is still the home of Radiance. It's there where you can find all the old links, and the source code repo on CVS (which Dan Fuller just linked to). That is home base. The GitHub thing is simply a mirror of the CVS repo, and from time to time I make Radiance installers and host them there. It's purely out of convenience for the OpenStudio project, so that users have access to recent versions of Radiance on all platforms.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/23/15, 11:04 AM, \"Boettger, Richard G.

In the past I would go to the radiance-online.org site to get the latest release of Radiance. Has development and access to the latest source code moved to GitHub? Is the latest official release 4.2.2? Sorry I've been out of the loop for a while.\n\n\nThanks,\nRick Boettger\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010850.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 23, 2015 at 10:18AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010848", "id": "radiance-general_010850"}
