{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI'm pretty sure the scons build system hasn't been updated in a while. The Radiance source hasn't been build-able for Windows these last couple weeks anyhow. The good news is, the Windows issues were fixed as of this commit, yesterday:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/e5017d45dddb919079d5ced7a914f463f8a86f2a\n\n\n\u2026and so you could use CMake/MSVC with this vintage of the source code to make your own Windows binaries:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/e5017d45dddb919079d5ced7a914f463f8a86f2a\n\n\nI'm gonna do a couple tests this morning and then make a new set of packages for all platforms, including Windows, so there's always that option. I'll post something here once they're all available.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 4/23/15, 11:51 PM, \"\u51b7\u9762\u5bd2\u67aa\" <503271081 at qq.com<mailto:503271081 at qq.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi,erveryone\n When I build up radiance using scons ,following errors are shown:\nTypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, function found:\n  File \"/home/zhaoyongqing/Radiance-5.0.a.1/SConstruct\", line 57:\n    load_plat.load_plat(env, ARGUMENTS, platform=None)\n  File \"/home/zhaoyongqing/Radiance-5.0.a.1/build_utils/load_plat.py\", line 78:\n    read_plat(env, args, pfn)\n  File \"/home/zhaoyongqing/Radiance-5.0.a.1/build_utils/load_plat.py\", line 12:\n    cfig.read(fn)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/ConfigParser.py\", line 305:\n    self._read(fp, filename)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/ConfigParser.py\", line 554:\n    options[name] = '\\n'.join(val)\nwhich is why?My radiance source package version is 5.0.a.1,and phython version is phython2.7.\n\n\n\n\nYongqing Zhao\nChangsha Green Building & Energy Saving Technology CO.,LTD\nNO.438,Shaoshan Road,Changsha,Hunan,China\nTelephone:13574805636\nEmail:zhaoyongqing1987 at 126.com<mailto:zhaoyongqing1987 at 126.com>\n         503271081 at qq.com<mailto:503271081 at qq.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010854.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 24, 2015 at 08:32AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010853", "id": "radiance-general_010854"}
