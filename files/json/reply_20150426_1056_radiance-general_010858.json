{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nThe EPW weather file should contain total solar irradiance values in watts/sq.meter.  Radiance also reports values in watts/sq.meter, but only over the visible spectrum.  Therefore, we normally include an \"efficacy\" calculation that converts the EPW's radiometric values into these semi-photometric values.  (It's a bit confusing, but suffice it to say that Radiance's units have a relation to photometric units that employs a predefined efficacy/conversion value of 179 lumens/watt.)\n\n\nIf you want Radiance to actually give you total solar irradiance, then you should employ the -O1 option of gendaylit and gendaymtx.  This should forgo the usual correction factors.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010858.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 26, 2015 at 10:56AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010857", "id": "radiance-general_010858"}
