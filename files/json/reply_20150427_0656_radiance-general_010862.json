{"body": "Dear\u00a0Wendelin,\n\n\n\u00a0Thank you so much for your answer. I found the skartveit.c in the Daysim source files. I will take a look at it tonight.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I want to ask one more thing; I create a WEA weather data file based on illuminance values instead of irradiance. Then I use ds_shortterm to create a WEA file with 1 minute intervals. As you see in the following, around sunset on 31st\u00a0of July, the illuminance values suddenly (in only minute) dropped from 107 to 0, however it should take much longer in real.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n7 31 20.158 0 122\n\n\n7 31 20.175 0 117\n\n\n7 31 20.192 0 112\n\n\n7 31 20.208 0 107\n\n\n7 31 20.225 0 0\n\n\n7 31 20.242 0 0\n\n\n7 31 20.258 0 0\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nIs there any way to estimate the length of this period (from 100 lux to 1 lux)? It is probably different with different sky conditions, but if we think about clear sky, is there any studies that mention this period or not?\n\n\n\n\nBest,Majid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010862.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Majid Miri", "created_at": "April 27, 2015 at 06:56AM", "created_by": "Majid_Miri", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010860", "id": "radiance-general_010862"}
