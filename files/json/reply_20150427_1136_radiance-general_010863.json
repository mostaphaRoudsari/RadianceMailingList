{"body": "Dear Radiance Users,\n\n\nI successfully built and tested the 64 bit executables of Radiance 4.3.a.2 (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/4.3.a.2), using Visual Studio 2013 64 bit and CMake 3.2.2. However, I'm running into a similar run-time crash when using rpict and oconv for very large geometries (2.4 GB geometry .rad file).\n\n\nI ran 64 bit rpict in Debug mode inside Visual Studio 2013 to determine the cause of the \u201cUnhandled Memory Exception\u201d error. The error was traced to line 198 in objset.c of Radiance 4.3.a.2 source code.\n\n\n\tLine 198: os = ostable[osentry];\n\n\n Variable, osentry (int), is used as an index to access an entry in the ostable[], object table array; osentry crashes with the value -26,513. I\u2019m not sure what is causing osentry variable to attain a negative value.. I\u2019ve printed the osentry to screen and noticed that it is evaluated to a positive integer many times before it attains the negative value. I printed the last few osentry values during run-time.\n\n\nOsentry: 230041\nOsentry: 145409\nOsentry: 196801\nOsentry: -243553\n\n\nOconv, breaks in the same line of code as rpict (line 198 in objset.c).\n\n\nWhat can be causing a break at this point in the code?\n\n\nIs there a limit to the maximum number of polygons/vertices that can be present in a scene depending on 32 or 64 bit Radiance executables?\n\n\nWindows has limits to a function's recursion depth that is determined by the maximum stack size, which by default is set to 1 MB. Can the limit on the stack size be causing the unexpected run-time error?\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010863.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "April 27, 2015 at 11:36AM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010840", "id": "radiance-general_010863"}
