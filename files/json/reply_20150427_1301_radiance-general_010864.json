{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nI don't know of any hard and fast limits to the size of a Radiance model,\nbut it looks like you've found one.\n\n\nSince you're compiling the source code yourself, here's a suggestion to try\nin objset.c. This should keep you from trying to access a negative entry in\nostable. Change lines 182-183:\n\n\nint  osentry, ntries;\nlong  hval;\n\n\nto:\n\n\nunsigned int  osentry, ntries;\nunsigned long  hval;\n\n\nFor good measure, you might also change line 197:\n\n\nosentry = (hval + (long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n\n\nto:\n\n\nosentry = (hval + (unsigned long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n\n\nI'd suggest moving this thread over to the radiance-dev list. I'm\ninterested to hear how your large models go.\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 27, 2015 at 2:36 PM, Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010864.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nathaniel Jones", "created_at": "April 27, 2015 at 01:01PM", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010840", "id": "radiance-general_010864"}
