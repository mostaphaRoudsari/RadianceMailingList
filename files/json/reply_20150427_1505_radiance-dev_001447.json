{"body": "Agreed -- thread now moved to radiance-dev list.  (Andrei, you can sign up for this list if you aren't already at <www.radiance-online.org>.)\n\n\nThat's a good idea to use unsigned integersh, Nathaniel.  I've also suggested (in a private message to Andrei) that he try it with \"long long\" in place of \"long,\" as I think the latter only uses 32 bits in VS on 64-bit Windows.\n\n\nLet's see what happens with \"long long\" and in either case, I'll probably change to unsigned types where I can.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-April/001447.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 27, 2015 at 03:05PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001446", "id": "radiance-dev_001447"}
