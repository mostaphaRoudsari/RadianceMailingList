{"body": "Hi Greg & Nathaniel,\n\n\nThank you for the input and help. Both of you spotted the error amazingly quick!\n\n\nI changed hval declaration from \u201clong hval\u201d to \u201clong long hval\u201d in objset.c, rebuilt oconv & rpict and both are working correctly for a large geometry (2.4 GB .rad file) \u263a\n\n\nI think the problem is that hval goes beyond the long limit and becomes a huge negative number, causing osentry to become negative, which is an index to ostable array.. osentry should never be negative. So I agree that some of these variables should be changed to unsigned.\n\n\n               osentry = (hval + (xtra_long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n               os = ostable[osentry];\n\n\nThe reason oconv & rpict worked on Linux is that \u201clong\u201d data type is assigned 8 bytes just like the \u201clong long\u201d data type.. so no issues. However, on Windows a \u201clong\u201d takes up 4 bytes and a \u201clong long\u201d takes up 8 bytes, so there is the inconsistency.\n\n\nNathaniel, can you please recompile Accelerad rpict and oconv with updated objset.c, to account for this for this issue? I would like to test Accelerad with a large geometry scene.\n\n\nThank you so much,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-April/001448.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "April 28, 2015 at 07:12AM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001446", "id": "radiance-dev_001448"}
