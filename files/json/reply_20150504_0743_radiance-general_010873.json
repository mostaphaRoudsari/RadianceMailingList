{"body": "Dear Greg,\n\n\nThank you very much!\n\n\nHope you and the list can shed light on the following question about *Spectral\nFraction* value in Fluent solar load model based on your explanation:\n\n\nIn * Fluent *(CFD simulation software) menu for its *solar load\nmodel*, the *spectral\nfraction *is defined as the* fraction of incident solar radiation in the\nvisible part of the solar radiation spectrum*, which is calculated as *V\n(the visible incident solar radiation)* divided by *V+IR (the total\nincident solar radiation , visible plus infrared).*\n\n\nI'd like to ask if the following calculation using Radiance is correct\n(using Singapore's epw weather file, Mar-20, 3pm as an example):\n\n\n*Step 1:* get the global horizontal irradiance (full spectrum, in wh/m2)\n\n\n\n\n*gendaylit  3 20 15 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120 -W 447.0 378.0  -O 1   >\n ./gendaylit.skyoconv ./gendaylit.sky ./gendaylit_sky.rad >\n./gendaylit_sky.oct*\n\n\n*echo 0 0 0 0 0 1 | rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 1 ./gendaylit_sky.oct | rcalc -e\n\"$1=$1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065\" >\n./gendaylit_global_horizontal_irradiance_in_Wh-m^2.txt*\n\n\nThe content of the gendaylit_sky.rad file, which describes the sky\ngeometry, is:\n\n\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nThe output is: *771.593 (wh/m2)*,\n\n\n\n\n* which is close to 799 wh/m2 (global_horizontal_radiation) reported in the\nepw file.*\n*Step 2: *\n*get the global horizontal irradiance (integrated over the visible\nspectrum, in wh/m2) *\nThe three commands are basically the same except that the [-O] option of\ngendaylit is set as [-O 0]*:*\n*gendaylit  3 20 15 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120 -W 447.0 378.0  -O 0   >\n ./gendaylit_visible.sky*\n\n\n*oconv ./gendaylit_visible.sky ./gendaylit_sky.rad >\n./gendaylit_sky_visible.oct*\n\n\n*echo 0 0 0 0 0 1 | rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 1 ./gendaylit_sky_visible.oct |\nrcalc -e \"$1=$1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065\" >\n./gendaylit_global_horizontal_irradiance_visible_in_Wh-m^2.txt*\n\n\nThe output is: 465.338 (wh/m2), which corresponds to global horizontal\nilluminance of 465.388*179(lm/w) = 83304 (lux), which is close to 89300lux\n(global_horizontal_illuminance) as reported in epw file.\n\n\nSo, the Spectral Fraction for Mar-20, 3pm is *465.338 / *\n\n\n*771.593 = 0.603*\nIs it correct?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010873.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "David Davidson", "created_at": "May 04, 2015 at 07:43AM", "created_by": "David_Davidson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010857", "id": "radiance-general_010873"}
