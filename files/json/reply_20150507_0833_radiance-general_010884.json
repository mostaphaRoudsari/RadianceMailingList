{"body": "Hi Urtza,\n\n\nThe problem is the use of double-quotes for  \"vwrays -vtv -vh 94 -vv 70 -vp 1.5 5 1.75 -vd 0 -1 0 -x 600 -y 600 -d\", which used singe back-quotes under Unix.  This replaces the command with its output on the command line, something Windows does not do.  Substituting with double-quotes is the wrong thing to do.  Instead, execute this command yourself, then cut and paste the output into the rcontrib command line in its place.\n\n\nThe output is \"-x 600 -y 392 -ld-\", so you would use:\n\n\n\tvwrays -ff -vf -vtv -vh 94 -vv 70 -vp 1.5 5 1.75 -vd 0-1 0 -x 600 -y 600 | rcontrib -x 600 -y 392 -ld- -ffc -fo -o vmx/window_%03d.hdr -f klems_ang.cal -b kbinS -bn Nkbins -m windowglow -ab 2 12 -ad 50000 -lw 2e-5 model_vmx.oct\n\n\nAs the actual command in Windows.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010884.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 07, 2015 at 08:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010878", "id": "radiance-general_010884"}
