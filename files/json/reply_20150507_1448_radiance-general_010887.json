{"body": "Hi Anna,\n\n\nThe transdata (and transfunc) materials do not fully model material behavior as well as the newer BSDF type (or even BRTDfunc).\n\n\nI have a few models of roller shades, which you might be able to modify to your purpose.  I do not (currently) have any measurements to offer.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Shade material s99745 by Mechoshade, white facing front (inside)\n# Measurements by Mehlika Inanici & Judy Lai 9/20/2004\n# Diffuse measurements by Mike Rubin 10/7/2004\nvoid BRTDfunc Mechoshade99745\n10\n\t0 0 0\n\t.02*tspec .02*tspec .02*tspec\n\t0 0 0\n\tshade.cal\n0\n11\n\t.628\t.628\t.628\n\t.377\t.377\t.377\n\t.0225\t.0225\t.0225\n\t56\t68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Shade material #1 by Mechoshade\n# Measurements from Steve Hebeisen <steveh at mechoshade.com>\nvoid BRTDfunc Mechoshade6020\n10\n\t0 0 0\n\ttspec tspec tspec\n\t0 0 0\n\tmechoshade.cal\n0\n9\n\t.37\t.37\t.37\n\t.56\t.56\t.56\n\t.03\t.03\t.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Shade material #2 by Hexcelshade\n# Measured from sample 11/3/2003\nvoid BRTDfunc HexcelshadeS065\n10\n\t0 0 0\n\ttspec tspec tspec\n\t0 0 0\n\thexcelshade.cal\n0\n9\n\t.26\t.28\t.30\n\t.59\t.61\t.60\n\t.02\t.02\t.02\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010887.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 07, 2015 at 02:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010886", "id": "radiance-general_010887"}
