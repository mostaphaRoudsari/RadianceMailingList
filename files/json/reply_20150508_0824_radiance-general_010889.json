{"body": "Hi Greg,\nand thank you for your super quick response!\nAt the moment I can't implement in my simulation the BSDF type since I'm using Radiance via DIVA, and the actual Daysim version implemented in DIVA doesn't support BSDF type for the annual calculation.\nThis was the reason for whose I thought to use transdata.\nInstead the BRTDfunc seems to work. I tried to run an annual simulation and it seems like nothing wrong happened.\n\n\nSo, I've only to understand how BRTDfunc exactly works. Any suggestion will be very appreciate!\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nAnna\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010889.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Anna Maria Atzeri", "created_at": "May 08, 2015 at 08:24AM", "created_by": "Anna_Maria_Atzeri", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010886", "id": "radiance-general_010889"}
