{"body": "Hi Anna,\n\n\nThe \"directional diffuse\" portion is in fact not diffuse from beam; it is the scattering that is *neither* purely specular nor purely diffuse.  If you wish to manipulate the amount of diffuse scattering, use the first 9 real arguments of the BRTDfunc type for the different components, front diffuse reflection, back diffuse reflection, and diffuse transmission.\n\n\nThe \"directional diffuse\" portions have to be defined as functional procedures using the *.cal language, and should not be necessary in this case.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010895.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 11, 2015 at 10:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010886", "id": "radiance-general_010895"}
