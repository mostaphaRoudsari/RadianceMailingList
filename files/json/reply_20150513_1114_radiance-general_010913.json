{"body": "Zhe,\n\n\nThe one error that is visible in your screenshot isn't what cause rpict to\nfail to compile. There are probably more errors above in the terminal\nwindow if you scroll up. Can you copy all the text from when you started to\ncompile alll the way to the end into an email? Just use copy paste rather\nthan attaching screenshot images.\n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010913.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 13, 2015 at 11:14AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010910", "id": "radiance-general_010913"}
