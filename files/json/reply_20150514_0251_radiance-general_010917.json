I usually use RadianceIV.exe program from Ecotect.\n\n\nC:\\Radiance\\test\\20150505\\vmx>ximage window_000.hdr\n\"ximage\" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo,\nprograma o archivo por lotes ejecutable.\n\n\n  However, I find klems_full.cal file that it has all information about\nkbinS and Nkbins.\nNow I have 145 .hdr files. They have light source, but the room walls are\nblack (is it usual?)\n\n\nIn reference to /pcompos,/ window1_*.hdr is invalid argument. Do you know\nwhy?\n  C:\\Radiance\\test\\20150505\\vmx\\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1\n\"window1_*.hdr\" > al\n  lwindow1.hdr\n  window1_*.hdr: Invalid argument\n\n\nThank you in advance,\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com> escribi\u00f3:\n\n\n> What do you use to view the HDR image?
