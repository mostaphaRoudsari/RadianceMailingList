You can test this by going to a command prompt and typing:\n\n\nrtrace.exe -version\n\n\nYou should see the Radiance version printed. If you get a \"rtrace.exe is not recognized...\" error, then your paths are likely not set up correctly.\n\n\nHaving said that, I recommend you try out the latest v5.0 release of Radiance. There are some important bug fixes and new features, including 64-bit Windows binaries. We posted new installers just the other day, here:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 5/14/15, 12:25 PM, \"Ikrima Amaireh\" <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk<mailto:ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: At least one of the links in the message below goes to an .exe file,\nwhich could be malicious.
