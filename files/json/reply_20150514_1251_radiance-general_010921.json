{"body": "Yes, that was the whole point of getting Windows binaries together, was so\npeople could use Radiance on their Windows computers. At this point, just\nabout everything in Radiance works on Windows, including all the \"core\"\nprograms needed for lighting analysis, renderings, daylight coefficients,\netc. This is, as they say, awesome.\n\n\nUnfortunately Windows does have some differences (and straight-up\nlimitations), and so the command syntax will differ slightly in some cases\nas you work through the tutorials. For example, Windows doesn't support\nmultithreading the way it's implemented in the Radiance tools. So the \"-n\n(n)\" options to rtrace, rpict, and rcontrib don't work. Also back ticks\nare not recognized as a way of passing output from a command to another\none. Greg just posted a Windows workaround for that one the other day, on\nthis list. I suggest trying the tutorial and see how it goes, and search\nthe radiance-general archives or post here if you get stuck.\n\n\nBy way of a shameless plug, I should tell you that OpenStudio also uses\nRadiance for daylighting simulations, and these many workarounds for\ngetting Radiance to work on Windows are scattered throughout the source\ncode\u0160\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 5/14/15, 1:25 PM, \"Ikrima Amaireh\" <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010921.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 14, 2015 at 12:51PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010920", "id": "radiance-general_010921"}
