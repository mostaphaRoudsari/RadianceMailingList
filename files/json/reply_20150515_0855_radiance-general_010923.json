{"body": "Welp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with Windows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with other internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat').

You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing Git for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell in Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.\n\n\nOn 5/15/15, 9:23 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nI'm probably not the one to answer this, as I don't use Windows and haven't seen this error, but did you check to make sure there are files that match \"window1_*.hdr\" in the directory where pcompos is executed?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010923.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 15, 2015 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010878", "id": "radiance-general_010923"}
