{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks. I asked this question because I am interested in simplifying the\norganization of files in a project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have run into issues in the past with projects that have multiple\nluminaire definitions. The image below is a screenshot from the directory\ncontaining rad files for one such project. Add or removing luminaires, or\neven sky definitions with .cal files, in a scene will be easier if I could\nadd or  replace rad files alone without worrying about the linking data\nfiles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010939.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "May 20, 2015 at 11:15AM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010937", "id": "radiance-general_010939"}
