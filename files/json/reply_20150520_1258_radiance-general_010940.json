{"body": "Well, if you make sure your luminaire (*.rad) and data (*.dat) files are uniquely named, you can just store everything together in a separate directory and put it in your RAYPATH environment variable as I suggested.  Since the xform command will look in your RAYPATH directories and so will Radiance, you don't need to have them in your current directory at all.  Everything can live somewhere else.  You can even use the \"-l\" option of ies2rad to put files there for you.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010940.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 20, 2015 at 12:58PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010937", "id": "radiance-general_010940"}
