{"body": "Hi Urtza,\n\n\nI think you are right to suspect that you need to change the -m option parameter sky_glow to sky_mat with the change in your file.  Otherwise, I think your results in \"south.dmx\" might be missing.  What is the size of this file, and does it contain any data?\n\n\nIt's also untrustworthy to use binary file times under Windows.  I would remove the \"-faf\" option to rcontrib for that reason.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010944.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 21, 2015 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010941", "id": "radiance-general_010944"}
