{"body": "Hi Urtza,\n\n\nYou make it challenging to help you when you provide so little information in your posts.  This forces folks to ask silly follow-up questions, like \"Where did you get your XML file and what is in it?\"  Judging by the filename, it looks like it uses a non-standard (and non-square) BTDF matrix, which probably won't work with dctimestep.  That would make sense with the error you are seeing, but it can be no more than a guess without further clues from you.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010972.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 27, 2015 at 12:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010957", "id": "radiance-general_010972"}
