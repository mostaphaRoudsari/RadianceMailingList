{"body": "Dear Andrew,\n\n\nFinally I added the +forward and +backward in genBSDF sentence, but the\nproblem continued. Then I compared many XML files BSDFs and I noticed\nmissing the first line with information from the encoding of the file:\n<? xml version = \"1.0\" encoding = \"UTF-8\"?>\n\n\nI added that line manually and then, it was be exported to WINDOW smoothly.\nIt is rare that genBSDF did not put that line automatically. In this case,\nI worked in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Radiance 5.0.\n\n\nRegards,\nDaniel\n\n\n2015-05-13 16:00 GMT-03:00 <radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010973.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Daniel Uribe", "created_at": "May 28, 2015 at 07:26PM", "created_by": "Daniel_Uribe", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010905", "id": "radiance-general_010973"}
