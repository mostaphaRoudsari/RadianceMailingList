{"body": "Hi Sarith,\n\n\nSince rtrace is looking for ray origins and directions on its standard input, you cannot send it an octree through a pipe.  However, you can run it like so:\n\n\n\trtrace -ov \"\\!oconv -i static.oct lights1.rad\" < samples.inp > radiance.out\n\n\nThe backslash before the '!' may not be necessary if your shell does not treat this character specially.  Basically, you give your command to create the octree in place of an octree file.  (This also works for rpict, rvu, and rcontrib.)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010977.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 30, 2015 at 11:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010976", "id": "radiance-general_010977"}
