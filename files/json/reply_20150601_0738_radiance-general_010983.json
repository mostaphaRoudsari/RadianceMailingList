{"body": "Generally speaking, the best thing to do is to break your building down\ninto the least number of daylighting simulation problems. I would define a\nsimulation problem as any space (or group of spaces, if they all can\n\"share\" daylight) that represents a unique architectural daylighting\nscenario. Look for unique combinations of form factors, orientations, and\nroom surface characteristics (e.g. room surface reflectance, glazing\ntransmittance). A row of offices all facing the same way could be reduced\nto a single office model. If those offices all have access to potential\ndaylight from the atrium, then a model with the atrium geometry and an\nexemplar office model for each orientation might work. Of course it's hard\nto model the effect of atria on adjacent spaces without modeling a lot of\nthe building, to be honest; the effects of the atrium will vary\nvertically, as well. But you can still probably reduce your entire\nbuilding model to a subset of modeling challenges for Radiance.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 6/1/15, 5:15 AM, \"imenslama at voila.fr\" <imenslama at voila.fr> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/010983.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 01, 2015 at 07:38AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010979", "id": "radiance-general_010983"}
