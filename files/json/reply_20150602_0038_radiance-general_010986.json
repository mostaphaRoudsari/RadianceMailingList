{"body": "Hi Christopher and Robert,thank you for your answer.i think that i will to do \u00a0three scenarios daylighting simulation:- the first is to simulate the quatity and the quality of daylighting given in offices by external windows according their WWR, the orientation of building \u00a0glazing transmittance of window and climate characteristics (Tunisian climate)-The second is to simulate the quatity and the quality of daylighting providing by atria in adjacent offices and in different floors-The third is to simulate the quantity of daylighting given by glazing exterior office building to office adjacent atria when we have glazed wall in corridorhow can-I proceed for each scenario knowing that I'm going to do modeling geometry in Ecotect to analyze it in radiance software?\nIm\u00e8ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Le Lundi 1 juin 2015 15h35, Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com> a \u00e9crit :\n\n\n\n\n Im\u00e8ne,\nCan you be more specific with your question? Is your difficulty in choosing CAD modeling software (plenty of previous posts on this if you search the archives)? Ecotect interface specifics? Setting up calculation grid points within or outside of Ecotect? Scientific/design methodology for your purposes (if so please clarify the intent of your study)? Other difficulties? If your questions are specific to using Ecotect to export you might try searching the radiance-online archives for the word Ecotect to get started, as there have been many similar questions before and only a portion of Ecotect users in this mailing list.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup\u00a0 business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/010986.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "slama im\u00e8ne", "created_at": "June 02, 2015 at 12:38AM", "created_by": "slama_im\u00e8ne", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010979", "id": "radiance-general_010986"}
