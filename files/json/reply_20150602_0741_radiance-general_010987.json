Is your difficulty in choosing CAD modeling software (plenty of previous posts on this if you search the archives)? Ecotect interface specifics? Setting up calculation grid points within or outside of Ecotect? Scientific/design methodology for your purposes (if so please clarify the intent of your study)? Other difficulties? If your questions are specific to using Ecotect to export you might try searching the radiance-online archives for the word Ecotect to get started, as there have been many similar questions before and only a portion of Ecotect users in this mailing list.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/010987.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "June 02, 2015 at 07:41AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010979", "id": "radiance-general_010987"}
