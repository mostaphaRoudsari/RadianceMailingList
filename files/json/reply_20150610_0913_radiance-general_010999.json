{"body": "Hi Greg,\nThank you for the informative reply. Yes, the efficacies you mentioned make sense as these are the ones used to compute photopic luminance from radiance.\nUsing the ra_xyze & the ra_bmp command I can convert from Radiance RGB color space to sRGB color space used by common digital monitors. Converting the rpict .hdr rendering of my material to sRGB color did produce a much more realistic color. Thank you for pointing out this transformation, as I forgot to that the final rendering must be transformed to the display color space.\nKind Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/010999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "June 10, 2015 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010997", "id": "radiance-general_010999"}
