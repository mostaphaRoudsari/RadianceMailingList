{"body": "Hi Giuseppe\n\n\nThanks for reporting this problem. The 1.0 version (I assume it's\n\"1.0alpha\") is a bit old and some issues might have been fixed in more\nrecent updates. Please try to download the latest release from this Dropbox\nlink:\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pewocv4df0i2i05/su2rad_2014.0.0.rbz\n\n\nI am currently migrating my projects to GitHub as Google Code is shutting\ndown project hosting. The source code is already migrated but I still need\nto update my upload scripts and create a new documentation page. I hope to\ncomplete the migration shortly and will disable the old code.google.com\npage to avoid any confusion.\n\n\nPlease report new issues via the GitHub repository bug tracker:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/tbleicher/su2rad/issues\n\n\n(I just noticed that a new issue has been reported there but I never got a\nnotification. Still requires some fine tuning.).\n\n\nAnyway, I hope your issue is fixed in the 2014 release. If not, let me know\nand I'll review the code.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 11, 2015 at 4:20 AM, Giuseppe De Michele <giudm.87 at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011001.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 11, 2015 at 06:36AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011000", "id": "radiance-general_011001"}
