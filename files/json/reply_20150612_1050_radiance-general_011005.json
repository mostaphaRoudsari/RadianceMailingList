{"body": "Hi Orn,\n\n\nIt looks like the specular transmission component is sampled\nstochastically, this happens because you have non-zero roughness in your\ntrans definition. To reduce the blotches in your sun patches you'll need to\ncrank ad, reduce aa and set st to zero. I'd keep lw at roughly 1/ad because\nyou want to heavily sample the window but with so many rays you don't need\nthem to split much further. You could also consider turning off the ambient\ncache by setting -aa 0. This changes the effect from blotches to noise,\nwhich sometimes has a better appearance.\n\n\nOr you could change roughness from 0.010 to 0. I'm not sure how important\nthe roughness is to you simulation, but I don't expect it'll have much\naffect on your illuminance result. But if you're interested in simulating\nappearance accurately then the roughness is important.\n\n\nI'd also suggest double checking your trans definition. It has a very low\ntotal transmission (~9%) and is mostly specular.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011005.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "June 12, 2015 at 10:50AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011004", "id": "radiance-general_011005"}
