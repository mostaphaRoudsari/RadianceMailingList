{"body": "Orn,\nWith clear glass, a very significant contribution is made by the direct sun, so all the ambient bounces (and their calculation parameters) contribute less to the scene, and you see less blotches.\n\n\nFor the translucent glass, try again with all of your first run parameters, but instead of -ar 64 try -ar 500 or -ar 1000. This probably has the biggest impact on visibility of blotches. This is particularly important if your model includes a room that's part of a much larger building, or a full building floor with a very large site context modeled around it.\n\n\nIn the parameters you tested in the second run, when you increased -ad and lowered -aa those should also improve accuracy, but might not be necessary depending on how much importance you put on accuracy versus calculation time.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011006.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "June 12, 2015 at 10:51AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011004", "id": "radiance-general_011006"}
