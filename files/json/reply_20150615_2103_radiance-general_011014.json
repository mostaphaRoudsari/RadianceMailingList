{"body": "Hi Sarith,\n\n\nThis seems related to the broken handling of text versus binary files under Windows.  Try reading the file from stdin, instead:\n\n\nrcollate \u2013h \u2013fa1 \u2013t < a.txt > d.txt\n\n\nIf this works, let me know and I'll see if I can put in a fix.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011014.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 15, 2015 at 09:03PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011013", "id": "radiance-general_011014"}
