{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command that you suggested returns the usage options for rcollate in\nwindows. (ie.  Usage: rcollate [-h[io].....)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, I had tried feeding the file to rcollate via stdin through using\npipe ( | ) as well as the 'type a.txt' shell command in windows but didn't\nget it work either way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011015.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "June 15, 2015 at 09:45PM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011013", "id": "radiance-general_011015"}
