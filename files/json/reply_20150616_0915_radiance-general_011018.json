{"body": "Looks like a line endings problem. If I create an input text file on Windows and run rcollate, I get the \"error loading file into memory\" error. But if I create an input text file on the Mac, copy it to my Windows VM and run rcollate, it works fine with the first invocation David lists below. What I don't know about this crap could fill a book, but I am ASSuming rcollate lacks certain file type handling that other radiance programs have. (?)

Honestly, I don't know why redirecting stdin from a file would fail completely.
