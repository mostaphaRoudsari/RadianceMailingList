{"body": "Hi Ikrima,\n\n\nI'm afraid LEARNIX is no longer maintained.  You can still download the \nISO image from here: http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/index.shtml\nbut be aware that the latest release is from 2011.\n\n\nChances are that if you run it on hardware later than 2011, you will get \nproblems, which are most likely to show up with weird display issues, or \nnetworking hardware not working.\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, the copy of Radiance that comes with this old \nLEARNIX CD-ROM is from, well... 2011.\n\n\nYou are much better off trying out a bootable UBUNTU CD-ROM or DVD.  If \nyou read the 'Running LEARNIX' PDF, available under 'Documentation', \nyou'll find a number of different ways of running LINUX alongside or \nwithin Windows.\n\n\nInstalling Radiance from the standard Debian or Ubuntu repositories is \nfairly straight-forward.\n\n\nHope you will succeed with you endeavour.\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011023.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 16, 2015 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011019", "id": "radiance-general_011023"}
