{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nthanks for pointing this out.  I tend to compile Radiance from source\non all of my machine, which is why I didn't realise it is no longer\nmaintained as a Debian/Ubuntu package.  Debian's package tracker lists\nit as removed from Testing: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/radiance\n\n\nAccording to the package tracker, the following actions are needed:\n- Does not build reproducibly during testing\n- The package has not entered testing even though the delay is over\n- The package depends on source packages which need a new maintainer.\n- lintian reports 278 warnings\n- Build log checks report 2 warnings\n\n\nSo that's probably the end of it  :-(\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 17 June 2015 at 14:13, Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011025.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 17, 2015 at 07:45AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011019", "id": "radiance-general_011025"}
