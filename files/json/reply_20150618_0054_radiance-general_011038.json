{"body": "Dear Christian,\n\n\nI made a little GUI that I essentially use for my teaching of RADIANCE to\nPhD students. It is called Geronimo and was developed during my time at\nEPFL. The idea of the tool was to see the effect of complex fenestration\nsystems represented by their BSDF in typical office rooms.\n\n\nIn short:\n- you can download the latest version (1.3) on:\nftp://kaemco.synology.me/Geronimo\n- you can find some information and a guide on: http://leso.epfl.ch/geronimo\n\n\nYou have a main GUI window to give options and start the simulation, and a\nlittle command window in which you can see the started commands. It is an\neasy was to learn by trying the shown commands and looking at the\ncorresponding .rad files.\n\n\nHoping this helps,\nBest,\nJerome\n\n\nDr J\u00e9r\u00f4me KAEMPF\n<jk at kaemco.ch>\n*[image: EPFL] <http://people.epfl.ch/kaempf> *// team leader *urban\nsystems simulation*\n[image: kaemco] <http://www.kaemco.ch> // founder and managing partner\n\n\n[image: bandeau_email_encadre] <http://cisbat.org/>\n\n\n2015-06-16 23:37 GMT+02:00 Christian Sarmiento <csarmiento at ufl.edu>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011038.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me K\u00e4mpf", "created_at": "June 18, 2015 at 12:54AM", "created_by": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me_K\u00e4mpf", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011026", "id": "radiance-general_011038"}
