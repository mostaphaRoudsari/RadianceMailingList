{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nI am really sorry for writing on the same point again but really in-need for clear and complete answer, if possible.\nHere, in my institution, people are in doubt if simple daylight calculation tools like Ecotect (both standalone Ecotect as well as Ecotect using Radiance engine methods) are efficient/enough for characterising different complex fenestration systems (CFS) and most importantly differentiate them for purpose of classification and rating?\nMany are saying there's no need to go through Radiance to get almost the same thing that can be achieved using other simple tools (like Ecotect). For me, as a beginner with some readings and research, I found that Ecotect is still not efficient tool to differentiate different CFS (especially if they are very close in geometry, etc.) so we need something that's more robust like Radiance to do the Job; does that sound right?\n\n\nYour reply is highly appreciated.\n\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message and any attachment are intended solely for the addressee\nand may contain confidential information.
