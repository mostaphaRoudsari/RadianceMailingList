{"body": "Hi Ikrima,\n\n\nIf you need to run Radiance on a non-Windows platform, you can\nessentially go MacOS or LINUIX (e.g. Ubuntu).\n\n\nIt's probably a good idea to rely in NREL's binaries:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/\nunless, that is, you want to compile from source.  But this is rather\nmore difficult.\n\n\nYour choice of MacOS vs LINUX will not only depend on the hardware\nthat you have available, but also on the support you can get from your\nlocal IT support..\n\n\nHave a look at the Running LEARNIX pdf on this page:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/docs.shtml to see whether one of\nthe available options might suit you.  The document is fairly old, and\nI never found the time to actually finish it.  I think that installing\nUbuntu into a VirtualBox virtual machine is quite a good solution.\nThis is how I used to run all Radiance jobs at my previous place of\nwork.  The big advantage is that you can Windows and LINUX at the same\ntime, but you need lots of RAM for this (I recommend at least 8GB).\n\n\nHope this gets you started.\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 18 June 2015 at 14:27, Ikrima Amaireh <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011043.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "June 18, 2015 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011041", "id": "radiance-general_011043"}
