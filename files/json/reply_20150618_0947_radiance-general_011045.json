{"body": "Ikrima,\n\n\nI have used genBSDF in Windows... what you have to do is the following:\n\n\n   1. Install Radiance (add it to path... that is a matter of checking the\n   option)\n   2. Install a perl interpreter... I used THIS <http://strawberryperl.com/>\n   3. Then, in order to use genBSDF (at least for me), you have to write\n   the whole directory... What I usually do is just copy and paste the program\n   in the folder where you are going to work in.\n   4. run 'perl genBSDF.pl ....'\n\n\nAnyone knows why the perl scripts are not recognized as part of the PATH?\n\n\nHope it helps!\n\n\nBye\n\n\n2015-06-18 10:27 GMT-03:00 Ikrima Amaireh <ezxia at nottingham.ac.uk>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011045.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "June 18, 2015 at 09:47AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011041", "id": "radiance-general_011045"}
