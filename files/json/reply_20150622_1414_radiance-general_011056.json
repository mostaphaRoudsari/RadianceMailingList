{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThank you for your reply! Is the formula incomplete for calculation of the irradiance value or it is missing 179 luminous efficacy value for conversion of irradiance to illuminance? What if we decide to measure the effective irradiance with respect to another curve (for instance C-lambda)? Should the summation of the C-lambda weighting functions be also equal to 1? Is this a rule in Radiance or it can be violated?\n\n\nCheers,\nParisa\n\n\nOn 22 Jun 2015, at 18:10, Guglielmetti, Robert <Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011056.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Parisa Khademagha", "created_at": "June 22, 2015 at 02:14PM", "created_by": "Parisa_Khademagha", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011053", "id": "radiance-general_011056"}
