{"body": "Thank you all for your reply. I have now tried several variations with your suggestions and although the blotching issue is not resolved, the images do get slightly better. Could the issue in fact be that the diffuse and specular transmissive properties are so low that in reality very little light would pass into the scene, thus causing a very low light condition closely represented by the blotching case we see from the simulations? \n\n\nJust to clarify the light transmission of translucent glazing is equal to the sum of the diffuse and specular transmission.... right?\n\n\n\u00d6rn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011059.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "\u00d6rn Erlendsson", "created_at": "June 24, 2015 at 12:54AM", "created_by": "\u00d6rn_Erlendsson", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011004", "id": "radiance-general_011059"}
