{"body": "Hi Greg and Jan,\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your detailed replies!\n\n\nHere is my precise application: I want to use Radiance to estimate/simulate\nthe effective irradiance with respect to the C-lambda.\n\n\nFirst option is to use different (-0.034 IR + 0.323 IG + 0.558 IB)\nweighting functions for C-lambda as suggested by Geisler-Moroder & Dur\n(2010) in their paper (entitled *\u2018**Estimating melatonin suppression and\nphotosynthesis activity in real-world scenes from computer generated\nimages\u2019*). My question is whether using these C-lambda weighting functions\nis a correct way of getting effective irradiance with respect to C-lambda\nin W/m2 or not?\n\n\nSecond option is to use the spectral rendering as suggested by Ruppertsberg\n& Bloj (2008) in their paper (entitled *\u2018Creating physically accurate\nvisual stimuli for free: Spectral rendering with RADIANCE\u2019*) . In this case\nmy question is how can I spectrally model the sky?\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nParisa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011061.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "parisa khademagha", "created_at": "June 24, 2015 at 06:04AM", "created_by": "parisa_khademagha", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011053", "id": "radiance-general_011061"}
