{"body": "Hi Parisa,\n\n\nIf you are only comparing one set of C-lambda values to another, then the scaling does not matter.  If, on the other hand, the RGB coefficients from David & Arne's paper were somehow computed to correlate with other aspects of irradiance, such as photopic adaptation, then you probably should use them as given.  I guess I need to read their paper....\n\n\nA full spectral calculation probably is not needed in this case, but it would help to have a good estimate of the sky color either way.  You should check out Mark Stock's implementation of the Utah sky model using Radiance:\n\n\n\thttp://markjstock.org/radiance\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011064.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 24, 2015 at 10:15AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011053", "id": "radiance-general_011064"}
