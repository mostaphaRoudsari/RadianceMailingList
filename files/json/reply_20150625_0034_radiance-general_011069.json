{"body": "Hi all,\n\n\nI was just writing an reply when David sent his mail...\nSo I just wanna add, that for a full spectral simulation you definitely should add the spectral transmission of the glazing (and also the spectral behaviour of all other materials) and to be sure about the used sun and sky spectrum. In my point of view, the spectral sky model is the largest uncertainty at the moment (besides the general discussion about the c(lambda) itself).\n@Mark and Greg: Did the Utah sky model undergo a validation by the use of spectral and luminance data?  I know that currently TU Berlin is acquiring a huge dataset containing such data in order to develop a spectral sky model.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011069.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Wienold Jan", "created_at": "June 25, 2015 at 12:34AM", "created_by": "Wienold_Jan", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011053", "id": "radiance-general_011069"}
