{"body": "Hi Mio,\n\n\nI am not seeing the same problems as you are.  Here is what I get using your exact command with my version of raw2hdr:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/outputHalfOnF9RAW.hdr\n\n\nHave you updated your version of dcraw?  Sometimes, there are improvements and bug fixes (and new camera support) that require an update.  I am currently using dcraw v9.26, and the attached raw2hdr.pl script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest version of dcraw is always available from Dave Coffin's website:\n\n\n\thttps://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/\n\n\nJust download dcraw.c and compile with:\n\n\n\tcc -DNODEPS -O2 -o dcraw dcraw.c -lm\n\n\nThen (of course) copy the new version of dcraw to the appropriate executable directory.\n\n\nThe green cast could be a white balance issue.  Sometimes, using raw2hdr -w helps with this.  I wasn't seeing it (at least not severely) in my run, though.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2015-July/000560.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 01, 2015 at 01:28PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000559", "id": "hdri_000560"}
