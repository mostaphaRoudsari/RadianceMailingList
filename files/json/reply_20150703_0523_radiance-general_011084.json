{"body": "Hi Achim\n\n\nYou may want to download a file named tracefromsun.tar from this URL:\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/public.php?service=files&t=5b1df34fbb0f39db18a8d73494fdbdf4\n\n\nIt contains a C program that will do what you need.\nBefore compiling it, you have to adjust the latitude of your site at the beginning of the source file.\n\n\nTo use it you just need to call the tracefromsun program this way:\n\n\ntracefromsun #month #day x y z\n\n\nwhere\n#month is the month number\n#day the day within the month\nx,y,z the coordinates of the \"centre\" point toward which all the rays will be traced\n\n\nThe program will send one ray per hour (true solar time is assumed) for te specified date. The output contains:\nx y z coordinates of a remote starting point (i.e. the sun...)\ndx dy dz the direction of the sunray toward the centre point\n\n\nI hope this will help you.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n\n\n________________________________\nDe : Achim Geissler [achim.geissler at intergga.ch]\nEnvoy\u00e9 : vendredi 3 juillet 2015 10:26\n\u00c0 : radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] View from sun position\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\nit should be possible to automate a viewpoint as \u201cview from the sun position\u201d in order to generate a sequence of images over a day, for example. Sadly, I was unable to find anything on the net or in Rendering with Radiance to this end. Does anyone know a good source \u2013 I would want to avoid having to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011084.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "July 03, 2015 at 05:23AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011081", "id": "radiance-general_011084"}
