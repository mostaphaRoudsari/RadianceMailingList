{"body": "Hi Raphael,\n\n\nbeing a lazy bum, I have to ask: Do you also have such a nifty tool to\ncalculate vh and vv from the Distance of the viewpoint (D) and the desired\nsize of the surface around (x,y,z)_center? \n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\nVon: Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl [mailto:Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch] \nGesendet: Freitag, 3. Juli 2015 14:23\nAn: Radiance general discussion\nBetreff: Re: [Radiance-general] View from sun position\n\n\nHi Achim\n\n\nYou may want to download a file named tracefromsun.tar from this URL:\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/public.php?service=files&t=5b1df34fbb0f39db18a8d7349\n4fdbdf4\n\n\nIt contains a C program that will do what you need.\nBefore compiling it, you have to adjust the latitude of your site at the\nbeginning of the source file.\n\n\nTo use it you just need to call the tracefromsun program this way:\n\n\ntracefromsun #month #day x y z\n\n\nwhere\n#month is the month number\n#day the day within the month\nx,y,z the coordinates of the \"centre\" point toward which all the rays will\nbe traced\n\n\nThe program will send one ray per hour (true solar time is assumed) for te\nspecified date. The output contains:\nx y z coordinates of a remote starting point (i.e. the sun...) dx dy dz the\ndirection of the sunray toward the centre point\n\n\nI hope this will help you.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl\n\n\n________________________________\nDe : Achim Geissler [achim.geissler at intergga.ch] Envoy\u00e9 : vendredi 3 juillet\n2015 10:26 \u00c0 : radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nObjet : [Radiance-general] View from sun position\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\nit should be possible to automate a viewpoint as \u0093view from the sun\nposition\u0094 in order to generate a sequence of images over a day, for example.\nSadly, I was unable to find anything on the net or in Rendering with\nRadiance to this end. Does anyone know a good source \u0096 I would want to avoid\nhaving to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011087.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "July 03, 2015 at 07:18AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011081", "id": "radiance-general_011087"}
