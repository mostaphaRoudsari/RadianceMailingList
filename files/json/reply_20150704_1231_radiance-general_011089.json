{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\nThank you very much for explanation. Now I have more idea of the\nThree-Phase Method.\nI do not know how the sky rotate, but, I will check Sky Vector's\nparameters.\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com> escribi\u00f3:\n\n\n> Urtza,\n> \u00a0\n>     REGARDING QUESTION 1.\n>     \u00a0\n> The CIE Overcast sky is simetric and independent of the date and\n> location.
