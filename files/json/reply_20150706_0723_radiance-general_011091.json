{"body": "John Mardaljevic shared a nifty little shell script at the 2003 Radiance Workshop that automated the generation and rendering of solar viewpoints for a whole day; it leveraged this information from Gensky as Thomas points out. I used John's script a few times for work and modified it for an art project as well, but I cannot find any of that stuff at the moment. If I unearth it I'll post a sample of John's code, but as Thomas points out Gensky gives you most of the info you need to do this.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 7/3/15, 6:23 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at gmail.com<mailto:tbleicher at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nGensky gives you the sun angle as a comment. You still have to convert it to a view vector and calculate the actual camera location yourself.\n\n\n\n\nAchim Geissler <achim.geissler at intergga.ch<mailto:achim.geissler at intergga.ch>> wrote:\nDear all,\n\n\n\n\nit should be possible to automate a viewpoint as \"view from the sun position\" in order to generate a sequence of images over a day, for example. Sadly, I was unable to find anything on the net or in Rendering with Radiance to this end. Does anyone know a good source - I would want to avoid having to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?\n\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\nSent from my Android phone with K-9 Mail.
