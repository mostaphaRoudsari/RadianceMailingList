{"body": "Dear all,\n\n\nthank you all for your help! The little tool and additional information from\nRapha\u00ebl did the trick for me - no additional brain-work necessary which was\ngood due to the brain-cooking temperatures around here, the past days.\n\n\n@Robert: If the script surfaces, as \"hunter-and-gatherer\" I would still be\ninterested, though.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\nVon: Guglielmetti, Robert [mailto:Robert.Guglielmetti at nrel.gov] \nGesendet: Montag, 6.

If I unearth it\nI'll post a sample of John's code, but as Thomas points out Gensky gives you\nmost of the info you need to do this.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 7/3/15, 6:23 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\"\n<tbleicher at gmail.com<mailto:tbleicher at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nGensky gives you the sun angle as a comment.

Does anyone know a good source - I would want to avoid\nhaving to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?\n\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nRadiance-general mailing list\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.org<mailto:Radiance-general at radiance-online\n.org>\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\nSent from my Android phone with K-9 Mail.
