{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nMy $0.02, as an outsider:\n\n\nThe NREL GitHub site is simply a place where we (NREL) post our installers. Perhaps unfortunately, GitHub expects the \"official\" and \"pre-release\" tags on all the releases hosted there. I follow the convention laid out by Greg Ward as far as what is the official release and what is pre-release code, and we name our installers based on this convention (where \".a\" is alpha code, \".b\" is beta, and the absence of a letter denotes \"official\" releases. To be clear, the NREL Radiance GitHub site is simply a mirror of the main Radiance code repository which is managed with CVS, is hosted by LBNL, and this is the official release page:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information\n\n\nAs far as testing, there is no standard test protocol for builds or releases. I started some tests that can be run in the CMake framework, here:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined/cmake_tests\n\n\nA (long) while ago, (I believe it was) Georg Mischler (who) started an Scons-based test framework, that got about as far as mine did:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined/test\n\n\nMy tests are stupid and fallible. Georg's tests are very old and test a lot of seldom-used stuff (and none of the new stuff like rcontrib or photon map). They are both in the source for what they're worth; people could build on either of these.  I believe CMake's test framework (CTest) is awesome and could be used to build a very robust set of tests, and we would love to add these to the Radiance source and incorporate them into a dashboard, but this is unfortunately way down there, on a long TODO list.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 7/7/15, 2:34 PM, \"Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.

Is there a validation procedure carried out? If so, who is in charge of this and what are some of the test cases used for validation?\n\n\nThank you in advance,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011097.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 07, 2015 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011095", "id": "radiance-general_011097"}
