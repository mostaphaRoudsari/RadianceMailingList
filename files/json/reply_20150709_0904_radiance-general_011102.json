{"body": "Hi Majid,\n\n\nNormally, it's not a good idea to use the -ff option under Windows, even in a piped command, but I don't think that is the source of your problem in this case.  Did you double-check that your actual image size is 1024x591 by running vwrays with the -d option?\n\n\nSince it stopped after 508 files when there should be 578, I suspect there is a limit under your version of Windows (or MINGW -- whatever environment you are using) to 512 simultaneously open files.  I bet if you use MF:1 it would work.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011102.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 09, 2015 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011101", "id": "radiance-general_011102"}
