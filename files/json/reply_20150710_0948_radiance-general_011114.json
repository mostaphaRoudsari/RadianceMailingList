{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThe trick is to use the \"-dim\" option of genBSDF to sample an interior region of the blinds, thus avoiding the edge condition and creating a BSDF that you can apply generically.  Andy McNeil has an example of this in the genBSDF tutorial he is writing.  I will send you a draft of it off-list, as he's not quite done editing it.\n\n\nIn general, genBSDF always creates a virtual surface for sampling, and when you apply it to a surface for rendering, it behaves as a proxy for the actual geometry.  You can of course include real geometry if you like by giving the BSDF primitive a thickness, and this is described in my presentation from a few workshops back:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW2_New_BSDF.pdf\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011114.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 10, 2015 at 09:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011112", "id": "radiance-general_011114"}
