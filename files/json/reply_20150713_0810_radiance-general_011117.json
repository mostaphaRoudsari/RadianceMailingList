{"body": "Dear Urtza,\n\n\nIf you are working with one of the last Radiance release, you can try the\nnew command *rmtxop*\n\n\n*dctimestep.......  | rmtxop -fa -c 47.4 119.9 11.6 > illum.dat *\n\n\nthat allows to convert from irradiance to illuminance values, in a matrix\nof size #sensors x 8760.\n\n\nTake a look at the following presentation  for more details:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest,\nGiuseppe\n\n\n2015-07-13 12:32 GMT+02:00 <urtza.uriarte at upc.edu>:\n\n\n>  Dear experts,\n>\n> I would like to calculate a Daylight Autonomy by annual data of\n> Three-Phase Method.\n>\n> Following the tutorial of McNeil for annual results of illuminance by\n> *dctimestep* command, RGB conversion is not used. I suppose that it is\n> because it takes a lot of time. If I use RGB conversion as follow:\n>\n> dctimestep results/photocellsSouthWest.vmx\n> data/JK_ClearGlass_T70_emis2_0.077_VBlinds.xml results/southwest.dmx\n> skies/Geneva.smx | rcalc -e \"$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)\" >\n> results/illum_vb20-smxklemsSW.dat\n>\n> will I have problems? I would like to manage with sensorpoints x 8760 file.\n>\n> Thank you in advance.\n> Kind regards,\n> Urtza.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n>\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Giuseppe De Michele*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011117.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Giuseppe De Michele", "created_at": "July 13, 2015 at 08:10AM", "created_by": "Giuseppe_De_Michele", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011116", "id": "radiance-general_011117"}
