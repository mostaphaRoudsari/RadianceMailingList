{"body": "You need to throw in an \"-ab 1\" (or higher) in the rvu line. The HDR image\ndoes not count as light source and so does not \"illuminate\" objects with\nthe default of \"-ab 0\". If you had more geometry in the scene you would\nnotice that everything is dark. The only thing you see is the HDR image\nitself in direct view or reflected in the sphere (reflection is calculated\nindependently of the light distribution).\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011132.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "July 20, 2015 at 08:16PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011131", "id": "radiance-general_011132"}
