{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nHow big are the holes relative to the thickness of the material?  What percentage of \"holiness\" does the surface possess, on average?  Are the wholes aligned in a grid or a hexagonal pattern?  Are you going to be in a rendering position where you actually see the holes, or do you just want the correct average behavior with a minimum of noise?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011135.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 08:51PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011134", "id": "radiance-general_011135"}
