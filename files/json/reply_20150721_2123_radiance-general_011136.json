{"body": "Greg, \n\n\nThe spec at the moment is 4mm thick aluminium with 8mm diameter holes at 12mm pitch in a hexagonal pattern. The open area is 40%. The viewing position is at a distance, so correct average behaviour might work, however I am relying on the inside surface of the holes to reflect light to the viewer, so I\u2019m not sure how using a trans material or suchlike would work in this case. The plan was to render one panel to show effect of being internally when veiwed from below on ground level. \n\n\nThanks, \nJohn. \n\n\n(may be duplicated- replied from wrong address)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011136.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Ford", "created_at": "July 21, 2015 at 09:23PM", "created_by": "John_Ford", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011134", "id": "radiance-general_011136"}
