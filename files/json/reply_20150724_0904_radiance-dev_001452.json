{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nIt's really difficult to find any information on low-level system calls in Mac OS X.  Unfortunately, searching for \"select\" comes up with many irrelevant hits, and bug fixes tend to list applications and behavior rather that root causes.  The only really way to tell if the bug has been fixed is to update to the latest version of Yosemite on one machine and run some tests using rpiece to see if it hangs.  (It's easy enough to test by running \"rad -N 4 -v 1 scene.rif\" or similar.)\n\n\nI can perform such a test tomorrow or the next day if no one else has a current version of Yosemite to try it on.  I'm still running Lion, which is the *oldest* version of Mac OS X that my laptop supports....\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-July/001452.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 24, 2015 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001440", "id": "radiance-dev_001452"}
