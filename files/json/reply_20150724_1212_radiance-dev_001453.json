{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nI went ahead and tried it out, and can confirm that as of Yosemite 10.10.4 (the latest), multi-processing is still very seriously broken.  Processes freeze and you are forced to kill them as the only remaining option.\n\n\nThe good news is that multi-processing seems to work find under Mavericks.  I ran the same test and didn't encounter any problems.  I recommend that no one using Radiance upgrade past 10.9 at this stage.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-July/001453.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 24, 2015 at 12:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001440", "id": "radiance-dev_001453"}
