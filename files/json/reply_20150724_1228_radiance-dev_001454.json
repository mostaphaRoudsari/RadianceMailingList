{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthank you so much for your test- so we will install Mavericks on all our \nmachines now.\nyes, I can confirm that Mavericks works fine regarding multiprocessing \n(since my desktop machine has it installed as well and I often use \nrtrace -n ...).\nIt is also a wise decision to keep older systems as long as possible - \nsome simple tools are harder to install on the newer systems. E.g. it \ntook me several hours to install the netpbm - package (e.g. for \npnmtojpeg ) on Mavericks (but got it finally by the usage of macports).\n\n\nthanks again!\n\n\ncheers,\n\n\nJan\n\n\nOn 07/24/2015 09:12 PM, Gregory J.
