{"body": "The bug seems to be an intermittent problem with the system select() call, for which there is no substitute. Almost all multiprocessing methods in Radiance rely on it. It's difficult to investigate as the main process hangs in the system call and there is no way to determine why except by putting printf() statements in the OS X (Darwin) kernel, assuming you know how to recompile it.  Even coming up with a simple test case to reproduce the problem is challenging. I'm really at a loss on this one....\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-July/001456.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 24, 2015 at 10:08PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001455", "id": "radiance-dev_001456"}
