{"body": "What's missing? There may be some missing teeth in the CMake files,\nresulting in incomplete installs. To clarify, I assume you want to use the\nphoton map stuff.(?) Those new programs (mkpmap, etc) are getting built,\nbut perhaps the \"install\" target is not quite right. So: what platform are\nyou trying to do this on, what is your workflow, and what is missing or\nnot working? Apologies that there aren't instructions for using the CMake\nstuff in the Radiance source; it's on the list of things to do. Basically\nyou use CMake to generate the makefiles, and then just use make like\nnormal.\n\n\nYou could also use the \"makeall\" csh script which comes with the source\nand is maintained by Greg (and probably Roland now too). That guy has has\nalways been pretty bulletproof on unix systems. Andy's YouTube vid on\ninstalling Radiance on OSX demonstrates the use of the makeall script; the\nprocess is basically the same for Linux:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68\n\n\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/31/15, 9:16 AM, \"Chris Kallie\" <kallie at umn.edu> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011145.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "July 31, 2015 at 08:49AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011144", "id": "radiance-general_011145"}
