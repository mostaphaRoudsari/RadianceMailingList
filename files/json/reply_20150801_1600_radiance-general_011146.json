{"body": "Hello Rob, developers,\n\n\nThanks for your helpful comments. I managed to install rad4R0supp.tar.gz \nand radiance-HEAD.tgz. However, I had to install XQuartz to avoid \nerrors. Still lots of installation warnings though.\n\n\nAlso, the github releases seem to be different than the releases \nmentioned above. Other than warnings, my standard (non-github) \ninstallations seem to be working. I might benefit from using CMake, but \nI don't know how to use it.\n\n\nAs long as the warnings are non-problematic, I am happy with the \ninstallations that seem to be working.\n\n\nThanks for your help!\n-Chris\n\n\nInstallation output, in case the devs find them useful..\n\n\n1) Radiance 4.2 installation (output: www.kallie.org/RadInfo/Rad42info.txt )\n2) Radiance-4.2.2.tar.gz did not have a lib folder, so I tried adding \none, but it installed with errors (output: \nwww.kallie.org/RadInfo/Rad422info.txt )\n3) rad4R0supp.tar.tz and radiance-HEAD.tgz (output: \nwww.kallie.org/RadInfo/Rad50info.txt )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/31/15 11:49 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011146.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "August 01, 2015 at 04:00PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011144", "id": "radiance-general_011146"}
