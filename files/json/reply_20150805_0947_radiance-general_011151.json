{"body": "Hello Jan,\n\n\nI suppose this behavior is rather confusing.  Firstly, the reason that \"0.1\" does not complain whereas \".1\" does is because the program stops looking past \"0\", which it assumes means exactly zero.  This is a special case for specifying that you have no directional diffuse component, since these string arguments are usually used to give the name of a function of three or four parameters.\n\n\nIn any case, there is no need to specify constant values for the directional diffuse component (other than zero) because that would turn them into a diffuse component, which is already provided in the first six real arguments for this type.  These things are explained as best I can in the materials section of the Radiance reference manual, which I assume you are using:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html\n\n\nTo get a pattern to modify your BRTDfunc, why not use the standard mechanism in Radiance and give it a pattern modifier?  This will modify the diffuse transmission value as well, but perhaps that's OK in your situation.  If not, then you can define a directional diffuse component that ignores the given scattered direction and uses instead the surface position (or whatever) to modify its value in the function file.\n\n\nI'm not sure I've explained this well, so please follow up with any questions you have.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011151.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 05, 2015 at 09:47AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011150", "id": "radiance-general_011151"}
