{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nChris has good advice regarding convergence testing, and the appropriate parameter settings are really dependent on your scene and lighting conditions.  That said, there is a table that discusses various rendering parameters and is a good place to start.  Unfortunately, it is badly in need of an update:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/rpict_options.html\n\n\nThis same out-of-date text file sits in the ray/doc/notes directory of the standard distribution.\n\n\nThe main thing to be aware of is that changing the -aa setting alone is no guarantee of overall accuracy, since this parameter *only* controls the indirect irradiance interpolation accuracy.  If the indirect irradiance values themselves are wrong due to a too-low setting of the -ad parameter (for example), then improving the interpolation won't help you.  This goes for the other parameters as well.  You can think of each as a link in a chain.  It would be great to have an overall accuracy setting, but that would require a much more basic (and necessarily slower) calculation method, such as naive Monte Carlo, to work.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011158.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 06, 2015 at 09:24AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011155", "id": "radiance-general_011158"}
