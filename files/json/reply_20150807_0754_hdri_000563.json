{"body": "Hi Mio,\n\n\nfrom my understanding (important disclaimer...), such an option would \nnot be possible or usefult. The response function maps the pixel value \nto a sensor signal (sensor illuminance) by comparing the values of pairs \nof pixel values at different exposure settings. If e.g. the pixel \ncoordinate on the CCD x1y1 has leads to a pixel value of 100 at an \nexposure time of 100ms, and of 50 at an exposure time of 50ms, the \nresponse would be flat. So the idea of reconstructing the response curve \nis based on the assumption that you have several frames of the same \nscene to compare, and that the exposure differs between those frames. \nEven if you got the response time of your camera, it would not be useful \n- as you are assuming to work with raw sensor data. So what is in the \nfile should be what the sensor gave as a signal.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2015-August/000563.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
