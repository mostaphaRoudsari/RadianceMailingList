{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nI'd add one more thing to Chris and Greg's comments. When you use a\nnon-zero -aa value, your ray paths that have gone through differing numbers\nof bounces to affect the ambient lighting calculation. Thus, it may not be\na fair comparison to use the same -lr and -lw values for comparing -aa 0 to\n-aa 0.01. Instead, you might need to choose a smaller -lw or possibly a\nlarger -lr for your -aa 0 simulation. I've tested a few scenes where I get\nsignificantly more illumination by using a non-zero -aa value, all other\nsettings being equal, and I generally believe the non-zero -aa simulations\nto give closer results to physically measured values.\n\n\nAlso, perhaps Greg can correct me on this, but I'm not sure if there's\nanything to be gained by setting -ab larger than -lr when -lr is positive.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nNathaniel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011159.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nathaniel Jones", "created_at": "August 07, 2015 at 09:05AM", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011155", "id": "radiance-general_011159"}
