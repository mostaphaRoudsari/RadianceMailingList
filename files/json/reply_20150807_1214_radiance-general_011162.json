{"body": "Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nAppendix A and Appendix B of this linked document are excellent reference for the file format of IES and Elumdat files:\nhttp://www.helios32.com/Thinking%20Photometrically%20II.pdf\n\n\nOne of things you\u2019ll see is that the IES file includes a crude dimensional information for the X Y and Z size of the luminaire. Negative numbers in the file can be used to indicate if a dimension indicates a dimension of a round rather than rectangular shape. In manufacturer IES data the geometric information is often missing altogether, Z dimension is omitted for recessed luminaires, or the X and Y dimensions are in the wrong places in relation to the photometric distribution.\n\n\nIf you use the IES2RAD command it will produce a geometric definition of the luminaire based purely on the X Y Z dimension definition in the IES file. So it\u2019s best to correct the dimensions by editing the IES file with a text editor prior to running IES2RAD. Otherwise once you run IES2RAD it\u2019s easier to make a mistake if you scale the fixture geometry and scale the intensity accordingly after the conversion.\n\n\n-Chris\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011162.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 07, 2015 at 12:14PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011161", "id": "radiance-general_011162"}
