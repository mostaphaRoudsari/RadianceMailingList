{"body": "The basic technique is to wrap the visible geometry of the luminaire, if\nany, with a glow in a simple shape that actually radiates the light. The\nglow is transparent, so that the geometry can be seen, and direct\nillumination does not pass through the glow, so light can be used internal\nto the glow to give the luminaire a realistic look.\n\n\nThe glow geometry and description may be generated by ies2rad. IIRC only\nfour shapes are supported: sphere, rectangular, cuboid (box), and thin disc.\n\n\nIes2rad does not support eulumdat and again, IIRC, has not been updated to\nsupport the latest IES photometry standard, LM-63-02.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph M.
