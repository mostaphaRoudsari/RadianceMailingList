{"body": "Thomas has great info on lamp color and using replmarks. \u00a0Further to Randolph\u2019s post, the idea is to wrap the luminaire geometry as tightly as possible using the shapes Randolph mentioned, but this enveloping geometry will have *illum* applied to it, not glow. The glow is used to illuminate the luminaire geometry itself so that it appears realistic in a rendering. You apply glows to the lamp objects in the luminaire generally, or you could apply them to any shades or lenses in the luminaire.\u00a0\n\n\nThe luminous intensity of the illum is derived from the input lumens in the IES file and is modulated by a few cal files, which use the candela values from the IES file. The lamp color utility can give you reasonable values to use for the glows, based on lamp input lumens. Again, the glows illuminate the local luminaire geometry, and the illums actually illuminate the space. The ileum material is invisible when viewed directly, which is why you need the glows to make the luminaries appear correct in a rendering. The flux from the glow also does not make it past the illum geometry and so it does not contribute to the scene illumination or any calculations.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is some info on using illums and glows here:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/using-the-illum-material-for-smoother-renderings-in-radiance/\n\n\nI did a bunch of crap with different illum geometry and cal files (lboxcorr.cal et al.) and got pretty good at picking the best ones for the jobs at hand (wall mounted sconces and stuff like that can be tricky to get looking \u201cright\u201d), but never got around to posting a summary on that stuff. A good place to start is just running a few different luminaire types though ies2rad and see what you get, and then play with the output files from there.\u00a0\n\n\nAre we having fun yet?\n\n\n-Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011165.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 08, 2015 at 01:59PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011161", "id": "radiance-general_011165"}
