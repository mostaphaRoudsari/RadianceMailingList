{"body": "Could the lack of hotspot reflection also be related to the -st specular threshold parameter? By default this is -st 0.15 if not otherwise defined, so a glass definition with specular reflectance less than 0.15 could be ignored. I suspect -st 0.01 is more desirable for most typical simulations unless there are many parallel specular planes where it's desirable to leave out more specular component calculations.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011177.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 10, 2015 at 10:56AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011173", "id": "radiance-general_011177"}
