{"body": "ambient rays (this is what you do when using glass for your facade and \nplastic for the surrounding) will not traced along any specular \nreflection towards a light source (here sun), whatever (uhh.. not sure \nthis word is allowed to be used any more...) specular settings you are \nusing for the glass material. E.g. also rtrace -I facing a glass will \nget 0 contribution from sun reflection in the glass.\nSo either you use mirror material, photon-mapping or a modified version \nof Greg's cool tip:\nYou calculate the intersection points and render there a 180 \ndegree-fish-eye image instead and calculate from the image the \nilluminance or irradiance at that intersection point and transfer this \nback to an image. The main difference is that for an image view rays are \nsent out and the specular reflection towards a light source is taken \ninto account. But be aware that secondary effects are not covered with \nthis special trick (e.g. if your reflection hits a white surface (there \nit is covered) and then lights an adjacent surface (this is not covered).\nWhen using mirror you have to take care that you miss the sky \ncontribution from the mirror reflection, when using it normal. A mixing \nbetween mirror and glass might help, also regarding the \"appearance\".\n\n\ngood luck!\nJan\n\n\nAm 8/10/15 um 7:15 PM schrieb Guglielmetti, Robert:\n> There is a cool Greg Trick you can use to render irradiance on the glass material, which I summarize here:\n>\n> http://www.rumblestrip.org/2003/03/19/rendering-falsecolor-on-glass-with-vwrays/\n>\n> As for your quest to find the hotspot, if mirror material gave you a result in a reasonable timeframe, I'd say that may be the most expedient way to get what you're looking for, with the caveat that simply using the inverse of the glazing's transmittance for the reflectance is not correct.

If I change the facade material to mirror type, I can find an obvious 'hotspot' on the ground level as well as the facade in the final result. So I just wonder is it proper to modify the facade material into a mirror type if I am only interested in the exterior irradiance map of a building. Besides, if mirror type material can be used in my situation, how can I set the RGB reflectance values for mirror? For example, if the facade glass has a 40% transmittance, is it equivalent to set RGB values into 0.6 0.6 0.6 for a mirror material?\n> Many Thanks,\n> Jiajie\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
