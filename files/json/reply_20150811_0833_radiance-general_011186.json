{"body": "Hi Jasper,\n\n\nThis is one of the tricky aspects of doing glare analysis with your own \nHDR images. A couple of pointers are below,\n\n\n  * You will need to crop your image to a square aspect about the image\n    center using the pcompos\n    <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pcompos.1.html> tool.\n    There was a helpful discussion on maintaining image exposure values\n    while doing this here\n    <http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007701.html>.\n  * The -vv and -vh parameters are just best guesses according the HDR\n    generation software. Once you have cropped the image, you will want\n    to open the resulting HDR in a text editor and manually change the\n    header 'VIEW' field to include -vta -vv 180 -vh 180. You may also\n    specify them via the command line at this point, as you have done. I\n    like to keep it associated with the image.\n  * After that, unless I am forgetting something (others can chime in),\n    you are ready to run evalglare. I would run it with the -d flag,\n    which will report a lot of details. Most usefully, it reports\n    illuminance as derived from the image, which you can compare to your\n    measured Ev value to check the validity of the HDR. If your HDR is\n    well-calibrated, not inputting the measured illuminance value should\n    be perfectly accurate.\n  * I suspect that inputting measured illuminance is somewhat broken in\n    the current version of evalglare as I have the same problem that you\n    do. One option is to use the -1 option to evalglare, which will\n    return only a single DGP value. It seems to avoid this error.\n     > evalglare -1 -i 2500 image.hdr\n\n\nBy the way, to avoid some of this cropping and exposure value pain, I \nuse an image-processing tool (like PIL for Python) these days that can \nmaintain EXIF data while cropping the source jpeg files. Though perhaps \nthe cure is worse than the disease in this case..\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011186.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "August 11, 2015 at 08:33AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010867", "id": "radiance-general_011186"}
