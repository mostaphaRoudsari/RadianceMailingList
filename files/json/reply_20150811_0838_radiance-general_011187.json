{"body": "Dear Ikrima,\n\n\nDaysim comes with its own special version of the Radiance binaries that \ncan be downloaded at the Daysim website <http://daysim.ning.com/>. These \nget stored in c:\\DAYSIM\\bin\\ after installation on Windows. \nUnfortunately the binaries are based on an older Radiance version, so \nyou miss some options like using BSDF data. Still, Daysim is perfectly \nserviceable for most cases. I hope I understood your question.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011187.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "August 11, 2015 at 08:38AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011183", "id": "radiance-general_011187"}
