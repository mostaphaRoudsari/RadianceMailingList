{"body": "Dear Alstan,\n\n\nYes, you actually did :)\n\n\nWhat exactly I want to do is: modelling different CFS to assess their effect on indoor illuminance (Workplane). So, Daysim (with its current old version Radiance binaries) can do that; isn't it? At the same time, one can still say that simulations are based on the powerful Radiance tools, does that sound right, too?\n\n\nSo far, I don't think I still need to use BSDF as there is no need for 3- nor 5-phase methods for such level of work!\n\n\nCan you please correct me if there is something wrong with my understanding/assumptions?\n\n\nBest regards\nIkrima\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011188.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ikrima Amaireh", "created_at": "August 11, 2015 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011183", "id": "radiance-general_011188"}
