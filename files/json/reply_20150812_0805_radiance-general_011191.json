{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nApologies for the -1 comment -- I didn't know it did anything special \nbeyond only returning DGP.\n\n\nAs for the version of evalglare, I was using v1.10 -- Doh! I installed \nDaysim last week to get the source for Linux, and it put an old version \nin my path. The 0 result issue doesn't happen with version 1.11. \nProbably the Daysim installer should be updated at some point.\n\n\n     > /Also you should make sure, that you use a view type which really\n    corresponds to your lens. If your real lens is a hemispherical fish\n    eye and you provide  -vta as view string, the angles and solid\n    angles are calculated wrong in evalglare and you get wrong results.\n    So make sure that you use -vta only if your lens is a angular fish eye./\n\n\nI can also second this. I ended up with an equi-solid fisheye lens, and \nthere is no small amount of effort converting the images into a -vta \ntype for Radiance use.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011191.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "August 12, 2015 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_010867", "id": "radiance-general_011191"}
