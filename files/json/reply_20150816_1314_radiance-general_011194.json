I've updated the evalglare to 1.11.\nGetting the same results as Jan showed.\n\n\nI've desinstalled and reinstalled everything, and now the pcompos and other\nfunctions are not recognized. With a google search I couldnt find the\nproblem.\n\n\nany ideas?\n\n\ninstalled\nradiance 2.01\ndaysim 4.0\necotect 2011\nevalglare 1.11\n\n\nAs far as the picture. This is the only photo with an almost direct sun.\nOther photos (160) are within a more sober spectrum. The idea is to to an\nanalysis of cd/m2 ratios, with the evalglare as indicator, not as main\ntarget.
