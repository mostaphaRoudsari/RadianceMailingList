{"body": "Hi Jiajie,\n\n\ngensky calculates the radiance based on the \"old\" CIE standard skies. It \nsets all channels RGB to identical values (7.07e006 in your case). In \nmany cases, simulations aim at results over all three channels, which is \nwhy most models do not focus on the prediction of color / spectrum. If \nyou really need that, there are sky models aiming at color information, \ne.g. the Utah model.  Mark Stock shared his cal-file to support that \nmodel in Radiance:\n\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/radiance/\n\n\nHowever be aware that we usually rely on information that was measured \nwith sensors not resolving over color channels, so there are a lot of \nassumptions to generate such colorful sky descriptions.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011201.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
