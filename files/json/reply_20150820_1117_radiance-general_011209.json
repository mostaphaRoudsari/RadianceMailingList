{"body": "Dear UMmers,\n\n\nJust signed up to this, but failed to find any setting that would allow \nme to only follow certain tags such as 'Radiance' or 'Daylight'.  Given \nthat UM seems to be focussed on thermal stuff, this is probably going to \ncreate a lot of noise in my inbox.\n\n\nMoreover, tag filtering only appears to allow for one option, but not \nsomething like 'Radiance OR Daylight'.  Tag filtering is also not stored \nbetween sessions.\n\n\nAnyone found a work-around for this?\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 20/08/15 18:24, Greg Ward wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011209.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "August 20, 2015 at 11:17AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011206", "id": "radiance-general_011209"}
