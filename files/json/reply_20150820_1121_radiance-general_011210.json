{"body": "Thanks Mostapha, I was looking for this exactly when you emailed. Early findings after setting up an account:\n\n\nLook to the right side from the homepage to select your \u201cinteresting tags.\u201d The tag \u201cradiance\u201d is the most obvious one. It looks a little annoying that there are some redundant tags like both \u201cdaylight\u201d and \u201cdaylighting\u201d but if we\u2019re all consistent to tag \u201cradiance\u201d that is maybe all that matters. There are lots of potential tags! I haven\u2019t posted anything, but is it completely open to create new tags? For example if I was posting a question about CFS, and there\u2019s no CFS tag, will I tag my new post with both \u201cradiance\u201d and be allowed to add a previously undefined tag \u201cCFS?\u201d\n\n\nAlso, use a browser other than Internet Explorer. I have IE set to default due to some corporate Microsoft enterprise platforms, and it looks like you can provide answers from within IE, but the button to add comments or clarifications looks to be broken using IE.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011210.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 20, 2015 at 11:21AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011206", "id": "radiance-general_011210"}
