{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nI think that might make sense. Imagine a room that is perfectly well\ndaylit, where you never need to turn the lights on. It will not matter\nweather you installed 1W/m2 or 100W/m2, the energy consumption will always\nbe 0kWh/m2.\n\n\nI would expect that, since you doubled the Lighting Power in the room, the\nenergy consumption also doubled. Does that make sense?\n\n\nOtherwise... I am not quite sure how Daysim works.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2015-09-02 8:05 GMT-03:00 Per Haugaard <perhaugaard at yahoo.dk>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011229.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "September 02, 2015 at 06:01AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011228", "id": "radiance-general_011229"}
