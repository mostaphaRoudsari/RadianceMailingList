{"body": "Do you have the lighting control algorithm set to be dimming? If it was switching on and off for the same hours each year in two simulations, the energy use would be double. If the calculation assumes lights are dimmed, the 8% difference is only due to the interpolation difference between the low end energy use (minimum ballast power) and the upper end of the energy use. In other words, maybe you have many hours that daylight provides nearly all of the specified lux requirement, so your lights are always dimmed to a fraction of only 5W/m\u00b2 or 10W/m\u00b2 for most of the year at any times they are set to on.\n\n\nI\u2019m also not sure if your control algorithm might also assume that if you say the 10W/m\u00b2 provides 600 lux and the 5W/m\u00b2 provides 300 lux, but your daylight autonomy threshold is set to 300 lux, the calculation may never use the full 10W/m\u00b2 load. I\u2019m a bit out of practice with Daysim so I can\u2019t recall for sure if either of these scenarios are likely to occur without knowing it.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011232.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "September 02, 2015 at 06:44AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011228", "id": "radiance-general_011232"}
