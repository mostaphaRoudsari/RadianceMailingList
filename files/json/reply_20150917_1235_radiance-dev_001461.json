{"body": "Mark,\n\n\nThat's great! I didn't expect it, but it's actually quite logical that you\ncan reduce the -ad parameter when oversampling and when when the ambient\ncache is disabled. I guess a pixel in the final rendering is the average of\nthe oversampled pixels, so 4 ad samples oversampled 4 times is the same as\n16 ad samples without oversampling. That should help considerably when\noversampling for penumbras.\n\n\nThanks!\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-September/001461.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "September 17, 2015 at 12:35PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001457", "id": "radiance-dev_001461"}
