{"body": "Hi Ruggiero,\n\n\nIs the standing subject inside a complex space?  Do you need this for an annual simulation?\n\n\nIf the answer to either of these questions is \"no,\" then you can simplify the problem a bit.  If the answers are both \"yes,\" then your third option of a daylight coefficient calculation will be the most efficient.  You basically want to compute random positions on the cylinder with the surface normal facing outwards, and give these to rcontrib to compute an integrated daylight coefficient for sky patches (and ground).\n\n\nIf you confirm that this is what you need, I can help you with the appropriate command chain if you like.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011240.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 20, 2015 at 08:23AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011239", "id": "radiance-general_011240"}
