{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nThe subject is inside a complex urban environment and the calculation is\nperformed for a whole year or fraction of a year. However I need to keep\nthe hourly granularity because the irradiation information is used to\ncalculate other comfort parameters.\n\n\nI would like to avoid the use of a cylinder all together if possible. For\nexample, for the direct solar radiation, I could simply have:\n\n\nS_irrad = Id * fp(solar_altitude)\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n- S_irrad is the irradiation on the subject,\n- Id the direct radiation from the the sun\n- fp(solar_altitude) the projected area of the subject in the direction of\nthe sun\n\n\nMy idea is to consider a dome around the subject: if I can calculate the\nirradiation contribution for each direction I can then apply the projection\nfactor to each of these contributions and sum them up. This should give me\nthe total irradiation falling on the subject.\n\n\nThanks\nRuggiero\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011241.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ruggiero Guida", "created_at": "September 20, 2015 at 03:24PM", "created_by": "Ruggiero_Guida", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011239", "id": "radiance-general_011241"}
