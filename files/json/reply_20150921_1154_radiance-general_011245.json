{"body": "P.S.  I just realized that to be a fair average, the number of samples on the cap should be proportional to the area, and same for the body.  A cap of radius 0.2 is 1/20th as large as the cylinder body of height 2, so in my example, there should be 20 times more samples on the body.  That means 5 samples on the cap would be paired with 100 samples on the body, or 105 samples in total.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011245.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 21, 2015 at 11:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011239", "id": "radiance-general_011245"}
