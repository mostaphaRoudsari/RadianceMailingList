{"body": "If you are trying to unzip the latest release, the command is most likely:\n\n\ntar -zxf rad5R0all.tar.gz\n\n\n-zxf is options for the tar command, and the file name being unzipped is \nat the end.\n\n\nHere are my personal notes for installing on Mac and Linux (arrow > \nmeans command line, double quotes means replace with appropriate file \nname, brackets are notes):\n\n\n1) install XCode from App Store\n2) install X11\n\n\n3) compile, by running these commands\n > tar -xzf \"radiance_release\"\n > tar -xzf \"HEAD\"\n > cd ray/\n > sudo ./makeall install\n(use default, or direct to newly made 'bin' folder)\n(use default, or direct to 'lib' folder)\n > ./makeall library\n(direct to 'lib' folder)\n\n\n4) update your paths\n > nano ~/.profile\n\n\nPut these three lines in the .profile text file, replacing the \nappropriate paths. Your paths will look different, but they are the \npaths to the 'bin' 'lib' and 'doc' folders created during the \ninstallation. If you're on a Mac, the file will most likely be empty. If \nit's not empty, you can add these three lines anywhere in the file.\n\n\nexport PATH=/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/bin:$PATH\nexport RAYPATH=.:/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/lib\nexport MANPATH=/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/doc/man\n\n\n5) close and reopen terminal, and test installation\n\n\n > which mkpmap\n > man mkpmap\n\n\nDownload mark stock's benchmark, open a terminal, change to the \nappropriate directory, and type:\n >tar -xf bench4.zip\n > cd bench4\n(for single core, type:)\n >make\n(for multi core, type:)\n >NCPU=2; make smp\n\n\nIt will take a bit of practice and patience to get familiar with the \nUnix command line, so give it time and take plenty of breaks (I \nrecommend going to the gym).\n\n\nHope this helps,\nChris\n\n\nOn 9/27/15 6:48 AM, Marta Benedetti wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011256.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "September 27, 2015 at 07:17AM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011255", "id": "radiance-general_011256"}
