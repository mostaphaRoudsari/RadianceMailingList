{"body": "Hi Marta,\n\n\nYou should just download and use the package installer from NREL:\n\n\n\thttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0\n\n\nIt's much easier than compiling from source for those not used to such things.  Since you're on a standard OS X distribution, you should have no problem.  The recommendations for installing X11 and the developer tools still apply, however.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011259.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 27, 2015 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011255", "id": "radiance-general_011259"}
