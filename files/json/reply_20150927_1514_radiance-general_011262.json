{"body": "Marta,\n\n\nNot too many years ago, I was in the same place as you, and I \nfortunately had help from Rob Shakespeare (one of the authors of the \nbook \"Rendering with Radiance\"). So, the least I can do is pass on the \nknowledge to the next generation of users. If you are still stuck after \nsome trial and error, I would be happy to help out via personal \ncommunication.\n\n\nIf one looks back on the archives of this list, there is a constant \nexodus of young users who disappear after they get their masters/PhD's, \nso I am playing my part to take some of the burden off the senior \ndevelopers by offering a little help here and there to the new users...\n\n\nPS. for those who have read this far: How is the new knowledge base \nplatform working? I was happy to hear there were some recent efforts, \nbut I haven't seen or heard about it for a few weeks.\n\n\nBest,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011262.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "September 27, 2015 at 03:14PM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011255", "id": "radiance-general_011262"}
