{"body": "Fundamentally, you have to model your space by writing out the coordinates and materials in a text file following the correct .rad format, then use the command prompt to perform analysis commands on that. Otherwise, you have to model your space in a 3D CAD software and find a workflow to convert that to .rad (possibly export to .obj then use obj2rad command on the Windows command prompt). You could use Blender, Rhino, Sketchup, Ecotect, Groundhog, DIVA, su2rad, Honeybee, OpenStudio, etc., etc. as your modeling interface, some of which also include some interface to Radiance, or maybe to export into .rad format and do the rest at the command prompt.\n\n\nTo understand the workflow of what to do with a proper .rad file with materials and geometry (or write one yourself), maybe start with reading the tutorial which starts on page 17 of this PDF, and post your subsequent questions back here:\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/intro-to-rendering-with-radiance\n\n\nAfter that there would be several more steps to build your way up to doing annual simulation. Otherwise DIVA, Groundhog, Honeybee, etc. might be a jump-start as they manage some of the annual simulation parameters \u2013 but also take away some of the fun  ; )  of understanding what\u2019s happening.\n\n\n-Chris\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011267.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "September 29, 2015 at 12:23PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011266", "id": "radiance-general_011267"}
