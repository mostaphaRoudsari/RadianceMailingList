{"body": "Another option for you Wouter would be to use the phisto shell script\n(assuming you're running Radiance on Mac or Linux). From the man page:\n\n\n\"The primary function of this script is to precompute histograms for the\n       pcond(1) program, which may then be used to compute multiple,\nidentical\n       exposures.   This is especially useful for animations and image\ncompar-\n       isons.\"\n\n\nThis is pretty much right up your alley, for animations. As this method\nuses tonemapping, you must remain mindful of what it is that you are really\ndisplaying. Perhaps the best method is to show, side-by-side, a tonemapped\nimage alongside a quantitative falcesolor image of the real values.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011278.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 08:53AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011274", "id": "radiance-general_011278"}
