{"body": "I don't know why xform is complaining, but the problem with x11meta *may* be the MDIR environment variable, which should point to the appropriate library directory on your system.  Mine is set to the location of:\n\n\n\t$MDIR=/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/\n\texport MDIR\n\n\nNote the trailing '/' which is very important.  Generally speaking, this directory sits in a \"meta\" subdirectory of the main Radiance library.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011281.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011273", "id": "radiance-general_011281"}
