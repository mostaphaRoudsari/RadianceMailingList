{"body": "In Wouter's post, he stated \"In absolute terms one wall has a luminance \nof 15 cd/m2 at 9:00. That\nsame wall is 29 cd/m2 at 12:00, yet when displayed (using ximage) it \nappears darker.\"\n\n\nI would be interested to understand how the output images would remain \nlinear using a tone-mapping algorithm.\n\n\nThe general issue at hand is that some people want visually pleasant \nresults, and some need numeric accuracy in the outputs. Perhaps the best \napproach depends upon what the intended use of the output images is, \nimho. (Unless I am not understanding something about the tone-mapping \nalgorithm.) -Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011282.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Kallie", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 10:12AM", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011274", "id": "radiance-general_011282"}
