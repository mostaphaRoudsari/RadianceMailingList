{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nThis vchars.mta file, is this a Radiance thing, or a system thing? The only references I see to this filename in all the Radiance source are in pexpand.c and expand.c:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vchars.mta\n\n\nI do not see the file itself. I ASSumed this was because my installers weren\u2019t packaging it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be in the Radiance repo at all, at least not in the mirror. On my entire storage device, I only see this file in a couple of places, and they\u2019re all locations where I had really old archived installations of Radiance (built with your \u201cmakeall\u201d script). This makes me think this is a Radiance thing that somehow never got included in the mirror...\n\n\n-Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011284.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 10:50AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011273", "id": "radiance-general_011284"}
