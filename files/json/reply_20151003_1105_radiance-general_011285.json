{"body": "Hmmm....  Unlike other \"essential\" library files, the meta/ folder is only distributed as part of the supplementary material in the \"rad5R0all.tar.gz\" ball at:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/radiance-source-code/latest-release\n\n\nIt lives in the ray/lib/meta/ subfolder of this distribution.  We could think about creating a subdirectory in the ray/src/meta directory and having it install from there if that makes more sense.  We should probably take this offline, or move it to the \"dev\" list.\n\n\n@Ruggiero - try getting the above distribution and extracting the meta directory onto your system, setting the MDIR environment variable appropriately.  Hopefully, that will fix the issue for you.  We'll work on this for the next package, I guess.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011285.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 11:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011273", "id": "radiance-general_011285"}
