{"body": "Thanks Greg and Rob\n\n\nI added the \"meta\" folder from the source distribution in ray/lib/meta/ and\nthe problem with x11meta is gone and I can now see the output in X11. My\noriginal installation is still in /usr/local/radiance/.\n\n\nStill having one of the problems with xform though and not sure why\n\n\nI am working from the folder\n\n\n~/dev/radiance\n\n\nI create the file things.rad in ~/dev/radiance/objects\n\n\nand then I use \"objline ./objects/things.rad | x11meta\"\n\n\nThe use of \"./\" has solved the issue of objline not finding things.rad, but\nit still complains about the file things.orig. Do i need to create this\nfile or it is just a warning?\n\n\nThanks\nRuggiero\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011286.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ruggiero Guida", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 04:40PM", "created_by": "Ruggiero_Guida", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011273", "id": "radiance-general_011286"}
