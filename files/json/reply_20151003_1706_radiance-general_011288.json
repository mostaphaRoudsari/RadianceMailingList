{"body": "Hi Ruggiero,\n\n\nDo you have dot (\".\") in your RAYPATH?  If not, then xform won't look in your current directory(!) for named input files.  I would add \".\" to the beginning of RAYPATH if it isn't there already.\n\n\nI don't know why you wouldn't be getting an oblique view from objline.  It seems to generate all 4 views when I run it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011288.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 03, 2015 at 05:06PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011273", "id": "radiance-general_011288"}
