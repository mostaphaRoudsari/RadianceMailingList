{"body": "Chris,\n\n\n\n\nThe options that you have listed\nbelow are meant for mkpmap. The maps created through mkpmap are then\nincorporated in rpict or rtrace through the -ap option.\n\n\nAs mentioned in\npage 18 of the\n<http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/photonmap-user-guide>,\nthe workflow is roughly:\n\n\nmkpmap -apg globalpmap nphotons -apc causticpmap nphotons octree\n\n\nrpict -ap globalpmap bwidth -ap causticpmap bwidth -ab 1 -vf view octree \n\n\nI was able to get it to work on Linux as well as Windows. If you are on Linux\nand interested in just rendering images, you could even use the TRAD program to\nsetup the pmap options for you. \n\n\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011293.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 16, 2015 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011291", "id": "radiance-general_011293"}
