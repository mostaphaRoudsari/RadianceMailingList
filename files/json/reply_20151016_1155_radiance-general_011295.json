Until 5.0, the  \n-ap{g,c,v,d} parameters were symmetric between mkpmap and the renderers  \nrtrace/rpict/rvu. It's asymmetric now for ease of use as the photon map\ntype can be deduced from the file header, so it's no longer necessary to  \nexplicitly specify it via these options; just an -ap will do.\n\n\nI believe the scripts Chris mentioned were part of an earlier,  \npre-integration release from Fraunhofer ISE, and haven't been revised  \nsince the new parametrisation. It would make sense to update them and make  \nthem available via radiance-online.org, as they'd make a good starting  \npoint for new users.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSenior Research Associate\n\n\nLucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts\nSchool of Engineering and Architecture\nCC Envelopes and Solar Energy (EASE)\nwww.hslu.ch/ccease\n\n\nT direct: +41 41 349 36 26 (New)\nroland.schregle at hslu.ch\n\n\nTechnikumstrasse 21, CH-6048 Horw (Correspondence)\nEbenaustrasse 20, CH-6048 Horw (Office)\nT +41 41 349 33 11, F +41 41 349 39 60\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011295.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Schregle Roland HSLU T&A", "created_at": "October 16, 2015 at 11:55AM", "created_by": "Schregle_Roland_HSLU_T&A", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011291", "id": "radiance-general_011295"}
