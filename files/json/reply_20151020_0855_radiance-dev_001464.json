{"body": "Hi Terrance,\n\n\nIt's remarkable that you were able to sort this out without aid.\n\n\nThere's already a fairly sophisticated installation script written for trad, which gets triggered by \"rmake install\" in the src/util directory.  I wouldn't know how to replicate this using cmake, unless it can call the same script.\n\n\nI updated this to work with wish8.5, but if it isn't run on your system, I guess it won't work.  You can call it outside rmake using:\n\n\n\tcsh -f tradinstall.csh $(INSTDIR) $(LIBDIR)/tcl\n\n\nwhere $(INSTDIR) is the Radiance executable directory and $(LIBDIR) is the Radiance library directory on your system.\n\n\nRob and I will figure out how to get this working on the NREL installers.  Thanks for alerting us to the problem!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-October/001464.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 20, 2015 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001463", "id": "radiance-dev_001464"}
