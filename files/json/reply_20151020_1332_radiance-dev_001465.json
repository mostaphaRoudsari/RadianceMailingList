{"body": "Thanks for shedding light on this, Greg. Since trad won't run on Windows, and the NREL Linux \"packages\" are nothing more than tarballs of the executables and library files, the only package that could benefit from this effort is the Mac one. Furthermore, since OpenStudio doesn't rely on trad for anything, this is pretty low on my TODO list, but it IS on the list. =/\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 10/20/15, 9:55 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Terrance,\n\n\nIt's remarkable that you were able to sort this out without aid.\n\n\nThere's already a fairly sophisticated installation script written for trad, which gets triggered by \"rmake install\" in the src/util directory.  I wouldn't know how to replicate this using cmake, unless it can call the same script.\n\n\nI updated this to work with wish8.5, but if it isn't run on your system, I guess it won't work.  You can call it outside rmake using:\n\n\ncsh -f tradinstall.csh $(INSTDIR) $(LIBDIR)/tcl\n\n\nwhere $(INSTDIR) is the Radiance executable directory and $(LIBDIR) is the Radiance library directory on your system.\n\n\nRob and I will figure out how to get this working on the NREL installers.  Thanks for alerting us to the problem!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-October/001465.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "October 20, 2015 at 01:32PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001463", "id": "radiance-dev_001465"}
