{"body": "Hi Adriana,\n\n\nGood to hear from you.  While it is possible to convert this information in the other direction, it would be very difficult.  You would have to figure out which data conversion was performed and invert the operation, and there are no tools to help with that.  It would be much easier to edit the original IES file to somehow match the changes you made to the *.rad output.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011300.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 20, 2015 at 07:32PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011298", "id": "radiance-general_011300"}
