{"body": "You could place analysis points at 5-degree increments along an arc at a distance of about 25 feet (or 8 meters) from the center of the luminaire with the orientation vector directed straight back to the luminaire center, then multiply the illuminance value obtained by this distance squared to return the intensity values that go into the IES file.  This would need to be repeated at 22.5-degree azimuth angle steps to complete the vertical sweeps at different horizontal angles.\n\n\nRick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011301.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Mistrick", "created_at": "October 20, 2015 at 07:48PM", "created_by": "Richard_Mistrick", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011298", "id": "radiance-general_011301"}
