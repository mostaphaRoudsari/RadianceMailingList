{"body": "Terrance,\n\n\nYour trans material for the Opal version doesn\u2019t include any reflectance.  Assuming that the visible reflectance is similar to the 35% solar reflectance for this product, and all transmission is diffuse, the result would be:\n\n\nvoid trans Danpalon_Sheeting_Opal_4mm\n0\n0\n7   0.75   0.75   0.75   0   0  0.533   0\n\n\nIf you want to have this be a combination of specular and diffuse transmittance, then the last number is the fraction of light transmitted that is in the specular component.  You can add some roughness by changing the second zero in the fourth line.\n\n\nRick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011303.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Mistrick", "created_at": "October 21, 2015 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "Richard_Mistrick", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011302", "id": "radiance-general_011303"}
