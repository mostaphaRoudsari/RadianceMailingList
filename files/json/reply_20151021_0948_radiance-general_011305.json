{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nWhile specularities greater than 0.1 are not realistic for non-metals, specularity is limited only by physicality (i.e., 1.0) for metals.\n\n\nYour method should work well enough for metallic surfaces with uncolored highlights.  If you have colored specular reflections, then you may have to do something a little more sophisticated, like multiplying the CIE standard observer curves to get XYZ then convert to RGB for Radiance using xyz_rgb.cal.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011305.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 21, 2015 at 09:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011299", "id": "radiance-general_011305"}
