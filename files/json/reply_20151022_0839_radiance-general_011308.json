{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\n\nUnfortunately, as I pasted in the Specularity formula from MS Word into my original post, the division sign was lost in the process. The formula is intended to be a spectral power distribution (SPD) summation of the difference between a specular included (SCI) and a specular excluded (SCE) divided by the SCI.\n\n\nThis formula defines a relative specularity as a percentage of the total reflectance. As I understand, Radiance\u2019s material specularity variable is the total specular reflectance normalized percentage, and not the relative specular percentage I was previously thinking.\n\n\nSo that: total reflectance = total specular reflectance + total diffuse reflectance\n\n\nUsing this methodology for a black material I compute a 5% Total Reflectance, and a 20% Relative Specularity, meaning that my Total Specular Reflectance is (5%*0.2) = 1%, and this value (0.01) is used to define Radiance\u2019s specularity variable. Also, the Radiance RGB triplet is scaled by Total Reflectance (0.05).\n\n\nDoes this sound correct to you?\n\n\nThank you for the insight,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011308.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "October 22, 2015 at 08:39AM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011299", "id": "radiance-general_011308"}
