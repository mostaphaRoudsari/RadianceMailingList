{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nActually, your original formula came through for me.  Maybe it got mangled on the way back to your inbox.\n\n\nThe formula you had for the specularity, where you divided by the \"SCI\" component, was correct if you use the Radiance \"metal\" primitive and apply the overall reflectance as your RGB values.  This is because the specular component is multiplied by the RGB color for metals.  I don't recommend using the \"plastic\" type in your case, but if you did, you would want to leave off the denominator as you say.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011309.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 22, 2015 at 10:07AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011299", "id": "radiance-general_011309"}
