{"body": "Hi Toni,\n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no reliable method for getting the specular component based on just a few measurements.  What Andrei has done is similar to what I have done in the past for metallic surfaces, and works reasonably well when the specular highlight is (a) fairly well-defined as from a polished material and (b) large with respect to the diffuse portion.  If assumption (a) is wrong, then the highlight will spill over into the \"SCE\" region of the spectrophotometer's measurement, and if (b) is wrong, then subtracting \"SCE\" from \"SCI\" may not be a very accurate measure of the specular portion.\n\n\nShort of a full BRDF measurement, I don't know of any methods that work for all surface materials.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011311.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 22, 2015 at 03:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011299", "id": "radiance-general_011311"}
