{"body": "Hello Iris,\n\n\nIf the picture has been re-exposed by some other program (such as pfilt), then there will be an EXPOSURE= line in the header, which you can see with the getinfo command.  In any case, you can use the \"pvalue -o -b\" option to undo this exposure and convert to brightness, then multiply the output by 179 to get luminance in cd/m^2.\n\n\nThis is of course assuming your picture was generated by Radiance in the first place using a properly calibrated scene.  If it is just an HDR image you got from somewhere, it is unlikely that the pixels have an absolute basis.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011313.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 23, 2015 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011312", "id": "radiance-general_011313"}
