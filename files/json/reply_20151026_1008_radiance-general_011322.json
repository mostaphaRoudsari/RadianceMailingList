{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nI've tried that but it doesn't say exposure in the header, and while\nusing this the values still stay this high. I did notice that when I\nchange the image size, the values differ. I use \"| total\" because I\nneed the average cd/m2 value. Is it possible that I need to divide\nthis number that I get by pvalue | total before multiplying it with\n179?\n\n\nWith kind regards,\nIris\n\n\n2015-10-23 18:31 GMT+02:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011322.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iris Moonen", "created_at": "October 26, 2015 at 10:08AM", "created_by": "Iris_Moonen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011312", "id": "radiance-general_011322"}
