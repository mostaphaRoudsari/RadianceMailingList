{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nBefore I used \"pvalue -d -b -h -H picture.hdr | total\". This gave me\nnumbers such as 89057. After these mails I've been trying to use\n\"pvalue -o -b -d -h -H picture.hdr | total -m\" but now I get values\nwhich are about 0.2832. The cd/m2 values I should get should be about\n700 cd/m2, which I don't get by multiplying either of these 2 values\nwith 179. What do I do wrong?\n\n\nWith kind regards, Iris\n\n\n2015-10-26 18:21 GMT+01:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011325.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Iris Moonen", "created_at": "October 28, 2015 at 07:18AM", "created_by": "Iris_Moonen", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011312", "id": "radiance-general_011325"}
