{"body": "Hi Ryan,\n\n\nThis looks cool! Nice work. Regarding BSDFs, you absolutely can use them as materials, and you should see their effects in any of the Radiance tools such as rvu or rtrace. Make sure you are applying the BSDF correctly in a material, such as:\n\n\nvoid BSDF venetian_blind\n6 0 venetian_blind_slat90.xml 0 0 1 .\n0\n0\n\n\nNext, make sure you have the BSDF polygon oriented correctly, with the surface normal pointing into the space. Use at least one ambient bounce, and maybe double-check the BSDF itself using Andy McNeil\u2019s BSDF viewer app. \n\n\nGood luck! This looks really cool. \n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011328.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 08, 2015 at 05:46PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011327", "id": "radiance-general_011328"}
