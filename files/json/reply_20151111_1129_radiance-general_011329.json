{"body": "Hello again guys,\n\n\nI have a question now.... I have been reading about all this, and I would\nlike to input geometry surrounded by illum. However, ies2rad seem to only\nbe able to generate a Sphere. How do I try this with different shapes?\n(i.e. a box) is it just a matter of deleting the Sphere and put a lot of\nPolygons with the same modifier? I am worried about normals and stuff like\nthat.\n\n\nI hope I made myself clear, haha\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2015-08-10 10:24 GMT-03:00 Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011329.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "November 11, 2015 at 11:29AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011161", "id": "radiance-general_011329"}
