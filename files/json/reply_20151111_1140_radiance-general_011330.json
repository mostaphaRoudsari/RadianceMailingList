{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nYes, it is a little more complicated, and you are right to worry about normals!  Actually, it is the projected area that matters, which for the sphere is (mostly) constant.  The main thing you need to do is to compute a first real brightdata argument (A1) equal to the existing one produced by ies2rad, multiplied by PI*R*R, where R is the radius of the original sphere.  Multiplying the value thus by the projected area of the emitter gets you back to radiant intensity.  Then, use the \"boxcorr\" function as the first string argument to the brightdata primitive in order that this radiant intensity is divided by the projected area in the appropriate direction during rendering.\n\n\nIt would be prudent to verify the results by rendering illuminance in a large sphere around the light source before and after, just to make sure neither of us messed up!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011330.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 11, 2015 at 11:40AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011161", "id": "radiance-general_011330"}
