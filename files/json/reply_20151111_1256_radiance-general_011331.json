{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks very much for the information. I tried what you said, and I think\nthat you might be slightly wrong.\n\n\n- At First I did what you said... multiplied the original A1 value in\nbrightdata (127.324) by Pi and by R2 (0.05*0.05) and the returned number\nwas ridiculously close to 1, which is the -m option I input.\n\n\n- I checked the surce.cal file, and the boxcorr requires A1, A2, A3 and\nA4... the first one being a multiplier and the others being the length,\nwidth and depth of the box. Using A1...A4 = 1 0.1 0.1 0.1, I got the\nfollowing results\n\n\nTOP VIEW <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NfkTSl19hQVkdzN1JlWFllcE0/view>\nBOTTOM VIEW\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NfkTSl19hQVXRvTXRWYV9hR2s/view?usp=sharing>\n\n\nOne of them is using just ies2rad , the second is using ies2rad -i 0.05 and\nthe third one is transforming this to a box as explained before.... *THEY\nLOOK GOOD TO ME...?*\n\n\nI think the area and that kind of things has to be used for planar\nsurfaces. right? I mean, for when we do crazier boxes...?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2015-11-11 16:40 GMT-03:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011331.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "November 11, 2015 at 12:56PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011161", "id": "radiance-general_011331"}
