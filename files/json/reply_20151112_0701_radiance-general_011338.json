{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI do not really like promoting myself, but there is another SketchUp plugin\nout there (groundhog, www.groundhogproject.org) that might help you\novercome the challenges you are finding with su2rad...? I honestly do not\nknow, because I have not used su2rad in a very long time, but I can tell\nyou that I am using Groundhog succesfully on SU2015.\n\n\nAbout the Revit to Radiance plugin, I actually thought on developing it a\nwhile ago, after an important person on the industry recommended it.\nHowever, I do not use Windows, do not have a Revit license and did not have\nthe resources to work on a project like that. As I mentioned, someone on\nthe industry asked about it, so I have to agree in that there are\nincentives to do it.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015-11-12 11:35 GMT-03:00 Shakespeare, Robert A. <shakespe at indiana.edu>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011338.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "November 12, 2015 at 07:01AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011337", "id": "radiance-general_011338"}
