{"body": "Now, when I did this, I ended up using the export to DWG and working on the\nresulting model in Rhino; a colleague did the same with SketchtUp.  The\ngeneral problem I found with exports from Revit is that one gets hugely\nmore information than one needs, resulting in a large and unwieldy model\nwhich must be simplified for effective simulation. For simple models,\nsometimes it is easier to refer to plan and section drawings and rebuild\nthe model entirely!\n\n\nAn excellent custom exporter is most likely possible. Revit keeps a huge\namount of information about the details of its models, and it seems to me\nthat in principle it is possible to do a thorough and accurate Radiance\nexport of any part of a Revit model. Revit exposes some of its internals\nwith a Python interface, and there are also tools like BIMlink (Ideate\nSoftware) which provides access to Revit's internal databases through\nExcel. However, developing dedicated Revit <-> Radiance export tools seems\nto me likely to be expensive and hence would probably have to be done as a\ncommercial product. At least, I wouldn't want to try it without good\nfunding \u2014 extensive knowledge of Revit would be required, and that\ninformation is not available for free.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011341.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
