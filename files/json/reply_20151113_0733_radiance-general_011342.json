{"body": "If you want to try Thomas\u2019 recommendation, look in the IES file for a pair of lines just below the header that look like this. I\u2019m borrowing the example out of Ian Ashdown\u2019s \u201cThinking Photometrically Part II\u201d which you can easily find online.\n1 50000 1 5 3 1 1 .5 .6 0\n1.0 1.0 495\n\n\nIn that example the 50000 represents number of lumens (now sometimes noted as -1 for LED luminaires tested differently), 495 represents number of Watts, and the values 0.5, 0.6, 0 represent the X, Y, and Z dimensions of a rectangular luminaire. In some cases, certain dimensional values could be given as negative, which signifies various types of rounded shapes for interpretation by software.\n\n\nYou can freely change the XYZ values in the IES file without affecting the data. Only when you import the IES file through IES2RAD (or into Dialux, AGI, etc.) does software interpret the dimensions and apply the brightness functions across the appropriate surface areas given by the dimensions.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011342.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "November 13, 2015 at 07:33AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011161", "id": "radiance-general_011342"}
