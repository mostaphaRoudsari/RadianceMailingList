{"body": "Dear \u6749\u539f\u6167 or pkh0128,  :)\n\n\nI suspect that your first problem is caused by matrix headers, which are\nnew since the tutorial was written. The first 9 rows are likely the result\nof rcalc processing the header in a way that was not meant to be processed.\nI suggest either using getinfo to remove the header, or use rmtxop to\ncombine the matrices.\n\n\ncat yourmatrix.mtx | getinfo - | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3''\n\n\nIf you are piping from rlam or something directly into rcalc just insert\nthe getinfo part (don't use cat).\n\n\nFor the second part of your question, yes the last three values are the\nsensor orientation. It is difficult to suggest a fix since we don't know\nanything about your problem. Please describe more about your model, your\ncommands, your result, and why you think the result is incorrect.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011347.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "November 14, 2015 at 03:54PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011345", "id": "radiance-general_011347"}
