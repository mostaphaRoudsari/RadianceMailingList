{"body": "Hi Jan and Rob,\n\n\nThanks for the quick response,\n\n\nNo, i just used the NREL installers . . .\n\n\nSpecifically : *radiance-5.0.0-Darwin.dmg*\n<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0/radiance-5.0.0-Darwin.dmg>\n\n\nfrom\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0\n\n\nBut here's a clue . . .\n\n\nSince i have an old version of evalglare (and radiance) on my machine, i\ndeleted evalglare just to see if the installer would replace it.\n\n\nI also deleted the radiance program \"total\"\n\n\nI opened the radiance installer and followed all the steps, and got the\n\"Installation was successful\"  screen.\n\n\nHowever no evalglare in /usr/local/ray/bin/evalglare\n\n\nand no /usr/local/ray/bin/total\n\n\nSo i think my prior issue is probably that i had a very old version of\nevalglare on my machine.\n\n\nAnd the new issue is that i am expecting the installer to overwrite the\nfiles in /usr/local/ray/bin/ and it seems to not be doing this ( ? )\n\n\n\n\n-Kyle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011354.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kyle Konis", "created_at": "November 17, 2015 at 02:13PM", "created_by": "Kyle_Konis", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011351", "id": "radiance-general_011354"}
