{"body": "Per,\nFor a little extra clarity, when you say \"glazed\" are you talking about glazed surface such as glazed terra cotta or similar, such as the way you would use the term in reference to pottery? Or are you referring to \"glazed\" such as being framed and covered in glass, like an opaque back-painted glass wall?\n\n\nGreg,\nIf it were a glass with opaque paint on the back side, would you still say the 0.06 specularity would represent the mirror-like reflections from the smooth glass surface?\n\n\nIf it were glass with any type of reflective treatment it could obviously have higher specularity. What if the front face of the glass is 0.06 specularity but the wall behind the glass could also be high gloss paint and add another 0.06?\n\n\nI'm probably getting beyond the level of what's possible to estimate without talking about specific materials. But maybe there's a little extra of the theory behind it to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011363.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 09:47AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011359", "id": "radiance-general_011363"}
