{"body": "A regular piece of glass has about 4% front-surface reflection, so glazing a material (where you create a single dielectric interface) typically matches this 4%.  If the outer surface is smooth, which is the general reason you would glaze something, then you get nice highlights due to low scattering rather than the amount of light that is reflected.  The amount of light reflected also increases towards grazing due to Fresnel's law, which is modeled correctly by \"metal\" and \"plastic\" when the roughness is zero.\n\n\nTo get two dielectric surfaces, which would add to 8% or so as you suggest, you would need the coating to not quite meld with the underlayer.  This is what plastic wrap looks like on a surface, and is not generally what people go for when glazing ceramics, etc.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011364.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 20, 2015 at 10:08AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011359", "id": "radiance-general_011364"}
