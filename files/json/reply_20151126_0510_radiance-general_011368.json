{"body": "Dear Urtza,\n\n\nit is not 100% clear to me what you have measured besides your image. Do \nyou have an illuminance value also at camera level? This is very much \nneeded to check the validity of the image, especially when you have \nspots of high luminances (e.g. the sun or reflections of it) in the \nfield of view. Do you have an fish-eye lens?\nSo the first step is to check compare the calculated illuminance from \nyou fish-eye image with this value to check if you have problems with \npixel overflow/saturation. This would explain big differences between \nimage calculated illuminance and measured. If you don't have a fish-eye \nlens you cannot make this simple check. Then you need to measure with a \nspot luminance meter the highest luminance in the field of view and \ncompare it with the value in the image.\n\n\nIf you have measurements of the Direct and Diffuse Irradiation, then it \nis better to use gendaylit, where you can provide both values.\n\n\nFor your simulated data, there must be an mistake in your workflow. If \nyou calculate the illuminance by \"rtrace -I\"  you should get the same \nvalue for the illuminance than calculated from the image (you can \ncalculate the illuminance with evalglare -V . If you use the -I option \nin evalglare, it is just replacing the internal calculated illuminance \nvalue by the external one, all other algorithms are the same. So if you \nget different values, then you have a problem either with your image or \nwith the illumiance calculation. So check first the difference in the \nilluminance. In case you are simulating a trans-material (e.g. for a \nfabric), pixel sampling, limit weight ect. might play a big role and \ncould cause huge differences between image and rtrace calculations. But \nthere could be many other reasons, depending on you scene you are \nsimulating. Then parameter settings play a big role.\n\n\nAnd another important comment is, that I don't believe that the DGP is a \nmetrics to describe glare in a restaurant. The needs are very much \ndifferent between an office and a restaurant. In a restaurant you are \ndealing mainly with disability glare, I'm not sure if discomfort glare \nis perceived so much for this kind of usage. Of course with the DGP you \ncan compare different variants and judge which variant has more often \nglare than other ones. But I would say you cannot make a distinct glare \nevaluation in a restaurant using DGP.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 11/26/15 um 9:30 AM schrieb urtza.uriarte at upc.edu:\n>\n> Dear experts,\n>\n> I am testing glare at restaurants of Barcelona for my thesis.
