{"body": "Dear Jan,\n\n\nThank you very much for your answer and suggestions.\n\n\nI had illuminance value also at camera level, because I had spots of high\nluminance. I have an fish-eye lens, the specifications said that it gets\n180\u00ba but it catches 160\u00ba. I hope that it can work. Ok, first I will check\nif calculated illuminance is the same as measured.\n\n\nI understand that perhaps DGP is not the best option to describe glare in a\nrestaurant, excuse me. However, we have problems with highly glazed fa\u00e7ade\nthat provides very high luminance values to achieve good concentration on\nthe taste and calm quality atmosphere, as well as, privacy. We have done\nsurveys and usually people tolerate more visual discomfort in this\nactivity, due to the habit probably,\u00a0but when you show atmospheres with\nless out luminance values,\u00a0they prefer. I am not sure if I am ok, but, the\nperception results are quite similar to the DGP results. Anyway, thank you\nagain and I will listen to you and check all variations to demonstrate this\nproblem.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\nUrtza.\u00a0\n\n\nJan Wienold <jan.wienold at epfl.ch> escribi\u00f3:\n\n\n> Dear Urtza,\n>\n> it is not 100% clear to me what you have measured besides your image.

I am using\nEvalglare v 1.11 with real illuminance (-I Ev) data for photographs\nconverted to hdr by WebHDR and for visualizations got by Radiance.\nFurthermore, I am testing glare by DIVA. I have tested with both, Evalglare\nand DIVA\u2019s Evalglare with Clear Sky without Illuminance data and with\nilluminance data.\n\u00a0\n# gensky 7 22 11 +s -a 41 -o -2 -m -15\n\u00a0\n# gensky 7 22 11 +s -a 41 -o -2 -m -15 -B 458.100\n\u00a0\nI have taken photograph\u2019s Daylight Glare Probability index with real\nilluminance data as reference. Therefore, without Ev data, DGP\u2019s with\nClear Sky without illuminance data is more similar than Sky with\nilluminance data (-B):\n\u00a0\ndgp photographs= 71%\ndgp DIVA Sky without illuminance data= 63%\ndgp DIVA Sky with illuminance data (-B)= 100%\ndgp (just Radiance-Evalglare) Clear Sky without illuminance data= 62%\ndgp (just Radiance-Evalglare) Clear Sky with illuminance data (-B)= 100%\n\u00a0\nMy illuminance data has both, direct and diffuse irradiance. Could someone\nconfirm if \u2013B parameter is only for diffuse radiance? I think, that is\nexplained in the program specifications.\nThank you in advance.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________ Radiance-general mailing\nlist\nRadiance-general at radiance-online.orghttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n--  Dr.-Ing.
