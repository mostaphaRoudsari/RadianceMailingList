{"body": "Hi Alex,\n\n\nThe RGB channels can represent any spectral content, so if you have 3 (or fewer) illuminant spectra, and can characterize the reflectances of materials in each of these spectra, probably through measurement, then you can get accurate results from Radiance.  If you have more than 3 spectra you want to try, you can perform sequential runs accordingly.  It's a bit tedious, but people have done it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011370.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 08:52AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011366", "id": "radiance-general_011370"}
