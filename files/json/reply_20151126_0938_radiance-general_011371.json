{"body": "Dear Urtza,\n\n\nthe 160 instead of 180 degree should not be a big problem, of course you \nunderestimate the illuminance a bit, but you can provide the external \nmeasured illuminance value.\n\n\nIn case you have a problem in matching the calculated illuminance of the \ncaptured image (evalglare -V) with the measured illuminance, caused by \npixel overflow, there exist since long time an undocumented option in \nevalglare to adjust the overflow pixels to match the measured \nilluminance. I could help you with that - in that case send me one \nexample image and the related measured illuminance value directly (not \nvia discussion group).\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 11/26/15 um 4:59 PM schrieb urtza.uriarte at upc.edu:\n>\n> Dear Jan,\n>\n> Thank you very much for your answer and suggestions.\n>\n> I had illuminance value also at camera level, because I had spots of \n> high luminance.
