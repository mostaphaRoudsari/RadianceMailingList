{"body": "Well, the general approach to measuring reflectance is to shine a light of the appropriate spectrum on the surface and determine what fraction reflects back.  This is typically accomplished with an integrating sphere if your surface is Lambertian or approximately so.\n\n\nIf you have full spectral reflectance data, you can multiply these measurements against the spectral emission of your different LED illuminants to get the appropriate channel responses.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011374.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 26, 2015 at 09:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011366", "id": "radiance-general_011374"}
