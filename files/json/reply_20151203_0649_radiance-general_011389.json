{"body": "That looks a lot like the technique John M. details here (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/jm_technote_02.pdf), but it seems like you're using the first technique (used to mask arbitrarily shaped, adjacent obstructions) and really want the second one (used to \"peek into\" a space while preserving the geometry for the traced rays.
