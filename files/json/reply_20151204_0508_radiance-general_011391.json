{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nYou should try using a single box, setting it up so that the sides visible from your viewpoint are just inside the wall and ceiling of your space.  That way, your rays will start in the appropriate place.  Your rays are probably starting outside your space with your current box placements.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011391.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 04, 2015 at 05:08AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011390", "id": "radiance-general_011391"}
