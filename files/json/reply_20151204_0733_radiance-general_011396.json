{"body": "Hi Wouter,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n's idea is very clever, but may be more difficult to automate.  You can stick with Andy's original method, yet reduce the file i/o by converting the uncompressed Radiance images produced by rfluxmtx into compressed ones that take much less space.  You just need to run \"ra_rgbe -r orig_image.hdr smaller_image.hdr\" on each image in your dcx/ directory.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011396.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 04, 2015 at 07:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011393", "id": "radiance-general_011396"}
