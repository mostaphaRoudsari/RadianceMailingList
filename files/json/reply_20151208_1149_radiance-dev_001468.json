{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nThis is as you surmised due to inherent limitations in the accuracy of the 8-bit mantissas used in the RGBE format.  Even a value of 0 in one channel will be \"rounded off\" to a value of 1/512 (roughly) times 2^Exponent.  There isn't much you can do to improve the roughly +/- 1% luminance accuracy besides going to an IEEE floating-point representation.  Also, the Y-channel error will get worse for certain colors, mostly blue to magenta (where the green channel is small).\n\n\nSome programs understand the XYZE format, which should maintain slightly better accuracy in the Y channel even with saturated colors.  I haven't done an extensive comparison, however.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-December/001468.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 08, 2015 at 11:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001467", "id": "radiance-dev_001468"}
