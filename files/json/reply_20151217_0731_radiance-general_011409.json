{"body": "Hello all,\n\n\nI have done what I was afraid to do: I updated to OS X \"El Capitan\" a few\ndays ago, and updated my Radiance version to the latest as well. So far I\ncan say that\n\n\n1. multithreading seem to work... it does not freeze, at least. I have not\ndone any timing tests.\n\n\n2. It compiled, even if it gave me the \"there were some errors\" message...\nit has worked fine so far.\n\n\n\n\nI have one concern, though. I THINK I noticed that I need better parameters\nthan before to get the same results. Can that be? This is just visual and\nbased on \"what I remember from before\".\n\n\nI am posting two pictures of results and parameters, so you can judge by\nyourselves.\n\n\nPARAMS\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NfkTSl19hQbmducHZxU3FvOG8/view?usp=sharing>\nWORKPLANE\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NfkTSl19hQcHdOcDhfTzkzem8/view?usp=sharing>\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011409.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 07:31AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011411", "id": "radiance-general_011409"}
