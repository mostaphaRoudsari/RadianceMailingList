{"body": "I'd be concerned about the \"...errors\" message. Something either didn't compile, or wasn't copied to the proper location, are the two most common causes for that message at the end of the makeall script. As for the parameter concern, it's hard to say since we have nothing to compare your results to. Good news about the multithreading, Greg was pretty certain he'd nicked that issue with this commit:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/60faf779695d00406cfd3f5dce2e37ad4fcff826\n\n\n...the more testers we have, the better though!\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/17/15, 8:31 AM, \"Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain\" <germolinal at gmail.com<mailto:germolinal at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHello all,\n\n\nI have done what I was afraid to do: I updated to OS X \"El Capitan\" a few days ago, and updated my Radiance version to the latest as well.
