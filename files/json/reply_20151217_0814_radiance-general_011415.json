{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nThis debate comes up every so often with the solar calculations used in Radiance and related tools.  The main question is, do we stick with the established standard, which provides for easy \"apples to apples\" comparisons, or do we update our formulas to get a more precise answer?  In the case of the original CIE sky models, which this solar calculation is used in primarily, the accuracy is not that great, so getting the sun in exactly the right place is a minor quibble.  If, on the other hand, you need precise sun position for solar shading studies or the like, then it's easy to argue for a better formula.  I don't think computing power was ever the issue with Radiance.  We don't compute the sun position for every ray-traced or anything silly like that.\n\n\nAs Rick points out, the use of 368 is part of the IES standard calculation, but I'm not entirely sure what anomaly it is correcting for.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011415.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 08:14AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011407", "id": "radiance-general_011415"}
