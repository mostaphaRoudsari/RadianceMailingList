{"body": "Given the tool construction, it would be simple enough to introduce a global variable that switches between the de facto solar angle calculation and a more precise version.  I'd like to hear from others that this is worthwhile before I spend too much time on it, though.  Also, whether it should be exposed as an option in all of the calling programs (i.e., IES calculation or more accurate on).\n\n\nIs there a general consensus on which solar calculation is best?  I would just end up googling it, unless you or someone else has a strong recommendation.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011417.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 17, 2015 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011407", "id": "radiance-general_011417"}
