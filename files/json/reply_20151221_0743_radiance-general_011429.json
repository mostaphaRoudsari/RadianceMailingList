{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nYes, basically what Rob said.... Depending on your desire for figuring \nworkflow (eg getting geometry from on format to one suitable for use in \nRadiance), there are lots of ways to go:\n\n\n    Autodesk based products - Autocad, Revit, Max, Maya....\n    Rhino\n    Sketchup\n    Blender\n\n\nThere are probably others I am not thinking of. Probably the safest \nintermediate geometry format is Alias/Wavefront (.obj) as Rob mentioned. \nRadiance has tools (obj2rad and obj2mesh) that can handle translating \nthis format into its native geometry format.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011429.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 07:43AM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011424", "id": "radiance-general_011429"}
