{"body": "Hi Martin,\n\n\nbe aware, that daysim uses interpolated sun positions (default: \ninterpolation between the four nearby calculated sun positions). This \ninterpolation has a much bigger impact than the small deviation of the \nsun position caused by the RADIANCE algorithm. This interpolation could \ncause a big deviation for a single timestep - especially, when you want \nto control your blinds with a cut-off strategy. And it shouldn't be used \nat all if you want to calculate the the amount of time direct radiation \nis falling through small gaps (e.g. fixed blinds).\nyou can reduce this error by invoking the shadow testing option for the \nsun interpolation in the header file.\n\n\nUsually, I don't think that the error in sun position matters so much \nfor the daylight calculations.\nWe also did it once a deviation calculation (between RADIANCE and the \nNREL algorithm) and it was max. 1-2 degrees - which is usually not that \nimportant for daylight calculations.\nYou definitely need a higher accuracy if you have a solar concentrator \nsystem and want to control your mirror - in that case the NREL \ncalculation is reliable.\n\n\nBut of course it would be nice to have a more  accurate sun positions \nimplemented in gensky/gendaylit somewhere in future.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nAm 12/18/15 um 4:40 PM schrieb Martin Gut:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011430.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "December 21, 2015 at 09:08AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011407", "id": "radiance-general_011430"}
