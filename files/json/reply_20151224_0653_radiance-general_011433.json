{"body": "The best single source for links to tutorials and docs is:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials\n\n\nUnfortunately the original rcontrib tutorial is no longer available, but Andy McNeil's 3- and 5-phase tutorials give a good overview of the theory and the process, and are, for the most part, updated to use the newer tools (e.g. rfluxmtx, rmtxop) and options that facilitate these methods. Both of these tutorials are available at the link above.\n\n\nHappy Holidays to everyone here.
