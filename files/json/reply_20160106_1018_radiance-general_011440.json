{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nWhile it may seem confusing, it is the projected solid angle that matters to irradiance, and this corresponds to the visible disc of the light source rather than the total surface area, which is why you get the same answer for a ring as a sphere light source in Radiance.  If you think about it, the emitted radiance of a diffuse source does not change with position or inclination on the emitter, so all that matters is the shape as visible from the point on the surface where you are calculating irradiance.  In either case, that point sees a disk off in the distance -- it can't tell if it's a circle or a sphere.  The light that arrives from either is the same.\n\n\nWhat *is* different is the total light emitted from the two sources.  The sphere will emit 4 times as much light because it will have the same effective brightness in all directions, where the total light from the ring will fall off as the cosine of the angle to its normal, and will be zero for the back-side.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011440.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2016 at 10:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011439", "id": "radiance-general_011440"}
