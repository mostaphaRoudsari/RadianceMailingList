{"body": "Hi Greg,\nThank you for the response!\nIntuitively, I do understand the detector sees the same circular shape and the same subtended solid angle for both a sphere and a ring. My confusion comes from the way the light primitive is applied to the geometry. In both cases I assign a radiance value of 10 W/sr.m^2 to the light source geometry. My misconception was I assumed that the given radiance value is evenly distributed across the entire geometry surface and accompanying solid angle. Apparently, it is not. It appears to me that the assigned radiance value is a constant radiance value assigned to each infinitesimal surface area element on the light source surface, or pixel if viewing with rpict. Does this interpretation sound correct?\n\n\nI appreciate your help,\nAndrei\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011441.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "January 06, 2016 at 12:24PM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011439", "id": "radiance-general_011441"}
