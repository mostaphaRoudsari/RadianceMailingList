{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nThat's correct.  Radiance is not just a nice name for a lighting simulation, it's also a handy unit that doesn't depend on geometry.  Had I used watts (for flux) directly in the specification of light sources, then the values would have to be modified with every change in length units or geometric scale.  Instead, we use watts/steradian/meter^2 (radiance) and the value is constant for a diffuse light source and doesn't change with scale or direction (unless you create a pattern on top of it).\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011442.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2016 at 02:42PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011439", "id": "radiance-general_011442"}
