{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nI worked coupling Thermal and Lighting software. During that time I found\nout that Janak did some very interesting work coupling ESP-r and Radiance,\nand that Wienold and Frontini (et al.) worked with Daysim and ESPr with\nsimilar purpose. After quite a long while after ending my Literature\nreview, I heard that there is a way of coupling both programs using\nDaylight Coefficients... still haven't found the documentation.\n\n\nSorry for the ambiguous answer, but what I am trying to say is that YES,\nthere has been some work on those topics, however, it is not really written\nin many places. *I believe you will get more answers in the ESP-r mailing\nlist than in this one.*\n\n\nIn my case, I ended up coupling EnergyPlus with Radiance mainly because I\nfound much more tutorials and documentation for that program... and because\nE+ was at that time adopting the BSDF format, which was directly related to\nmy work.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2016-01-15 13:06 GMT-03:00 Raghuram Kalyanam <kalyanam at rhrk.uni-kl.de>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011453.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "January 15, 2016 at 12:13PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011452", "id": "radiance-general_011453"}
