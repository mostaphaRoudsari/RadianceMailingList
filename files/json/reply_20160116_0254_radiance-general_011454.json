{"body": "Dear Raghu,\n\n\nin general, this is possible, yes. What is not quite clear to me is what you are actually looking for. You write \u201cexport an ESP-r model\u201d. The simple model export can be done via \u201cvisualization\u201d in ESP-r. This generates a Radiance model and allows for viewing and so on. This makes sense if you have an ESP-r model and are looking for a quick way to generate a Radiance model. Only quite recently this feature was enhanced such that you can easily add \u201coffice clutter\u201d for example to your ESP-r model. Shading obstructions are also exported to the Radiance model.\n\n\nIf you are looking for coupled simulations, this is also possible. You set this up in the \u201ccontrolled casual gains\u201d part of ESP-r. Then, the Radiance model takes over calculation of lighting levels in the ESP-r zones on a time step basis. This generally works well, but of course simulation run times increase.\n\n\nI am not aware of any explicit documentation on this, however, in the ESP-r community (mailing list) there should be some expertise available. Have you looked into Jon Hands very good \u201cCookBook\u201d?\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011454.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "January 16, 2016 at 02:54AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011452", "id": "radiance-general_011454"}
