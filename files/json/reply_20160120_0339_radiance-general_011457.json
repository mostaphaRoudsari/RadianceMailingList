{"body": "Hi Matthias,\n\n\nthe \"sphere of influence\" relates to the resolution of the ambient \ncache, not a picture. -ar defines the initial resolution, -aa gives a \ncriteria when to refine. The ambient cache aims at reducing the \ncalculation of illuminance on surfaces in the diffuse-indirect \ncalculation. It is enabled in rtrace and rpict as a default, but not in \nrcontrib.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011457.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
