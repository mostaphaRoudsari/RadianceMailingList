{"body": "Yes -- just a minor wording correction.  The -ar parameter sets the minimum ambient value spacing for full-accuracy, which is the specified parameter divided into the octree size.  You can determine the octree size using the getinfo -d command on the octree, and it is reported as the fourth number in world distance units.\n\n\nIf you want there to be no limit to the minimum ambient value spacing, you can set -ar 0.\n\n\nIf you set -aa 0, you turn off the ambient cache and get a straight Monte Carlo path tracing method.  This is sometimes preferable if you are computing just a few values in rtrace.  (With -aa 0, the -ar settings has no effect.)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011458.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 20, 2016 at 08:53AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011456", "id": "radiance-general_011458"}
