{"body": "Hi Alireza,\n\n\nThis is an error we hadn't noticed in the genBSDF script that shows up on Windows because it doesn't use single-quoted strings.  I have just checked in a fix, which I can send you separately if you don't want to wait for the installer to be updated.\n\n\nThanks for informing us!\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011472.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 07, 2016 at 04:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011471", "id": "radiance-general_011472"}
