{"body": "Just remember git is a directed cyclical graph and you'll get pretty\nfar.... The Atlasssian tutorials are pretty helpful with diagrams and\npictures to go with descriptions of the commands. Here are some docs to\nhelp you:\n\n\nsynching your dev tree\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing\n\n\nwhat does rebase do?\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase\n\n\nShould I merge or rebase?\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/articles/git-team-workflows-merge-or-rebase/\n\n\nStashing changes in git:\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/no-nb/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing\n\n\nIt is hard to give specified advice on how to sync up your environment with\nthe code line from github without knowing the specifics of everything you\nhave done locally. But, to answer your questions, assuming you have\nun-commited changes on your branch, you *probably* need:\n\n\ngit stash\ngit fetch\ngit rebase\ngit stash pop\n\n\nIf you don't have uncommitted (to your local repository) changes, you can\nskip the stash commands and *probably* just do:\n\n\ngit fetch\ngit rebase\n\n\n\n\nNote the *probably*. This may not be the correct sequence for your\nsituation.\n\n\n\n\nGood luck!\nTim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 8, 2016 at 10:46 PM, Randolph M.
