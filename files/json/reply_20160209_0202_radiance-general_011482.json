{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\ndefault for -b is :5.\ndefault for -t or -T is : Not set (-> no task area detection mode is \ndefault, in that case the average luminance of the scene is used to \ndetect \"glare pixels\", threshold=b*average_luminance. In case b is set \nto a value larger than 100, then the threshold is b only, an absolut \nluminance value, independent on the average luminance or task luminance.)\n\n\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011482.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "February 09, 2016 at 02:02AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011474", "id": "radiance-general_011482"}
