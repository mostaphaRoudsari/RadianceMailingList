{"body": "There are two basic methods for calculating illuminance with Radiance. You\ncan pass one or more points to rtrace, which will return a value(s) for\nthat specific point(s); the other way is to pass in a view to rpict, which\nwill return values for each pixel in the view. By default, both tools\nreturn radiance. If you want illuminance, you need to request irradiance\ninstead of radiance, and then convert that output to illuminance using the\nstandard luminous efficacy function.\n\n\nSpecifically, it sounds like you want to know how to get illuminance from\nthe specific image you attached to your question here. In this case, you'd\nneed to re-render the image as an irradiance image instead of a radiance\nimage, using the -i option to rpict. With that image, you could pass it\nthrough falsecolor, producing a falsecolor illuminance map or flood plot of\nthe illuminance on all the (non-glazed) surfaces in the image. A second\noption pipeline to falsecolor can plot isocontours on the original image\nabove. See the falsecolor manpage (\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/falsecolor.1.html) for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Feb 12, 2016 at 7:02 AM, raghuram kalyanam <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011487.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 14, 2016 at 05:04PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011485", "id": "radiance-general_011487"}
