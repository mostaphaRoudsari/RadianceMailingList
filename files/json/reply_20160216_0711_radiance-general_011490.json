{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThanks for your reply. Could you elaborate on how to get irradiance image and convert that to illuminance using standard luminous efficacy.  I have tried using rpict as you said, but it turned out a radiance(luminance) image.\nI executed the below command.\n\n\nrpict -vf Views/Scene_3.vf -av .5 .5 .5 -i scene.oct | falsecolor | ximage\n\n\n(Basically I generated radiance pictures (previously) directly with rad, I guess rad calls rpict internally. But how could we pass -i argument  to rpict in this case!! So i guess the above command might have some problem) \n\n\nI got false-color image with a contours of luminance.  \n\n\nAny way I wanted Luminance and Illuminance in numerical values for corresponding to the pixels. Could you help me how to approach, or may be with an example. \n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011490.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Raghuram Kalyanam", "created_at": "February 16, 2016 at 07:11AM", "created_by": "Raghuram_Kalyanam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011485", "id": "radiance-general_011490"}
