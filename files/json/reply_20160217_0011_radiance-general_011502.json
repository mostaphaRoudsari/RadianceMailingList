{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nAfter Overlaying should I install once again or leave it. Actually I tried installing then it threw error related to changes in the build environment and failed once again. \n\n\nI am transforming a ESP-r model to Radiance model. All rad,mat & rif files are generated but when octree is made there are errors like 'undefined Modifier'. It seems the materials that are in rad file are not in mat. How could that be missing? Now I suspect there is something missing in my libraries. Where would be material related files in Radiance? Are those in Objects? \n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011502.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Raghuram Kalyanam", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 12:11AM", "created_by": "Raghuram_Kalyanam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011492", "id": "radiance-general_011502"}
