{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nRadiance doesn't come with standard materials.  I don't know what kind of environment the ESP-r modeler expects.  You'll have to ask them.\n\n\nRegarding your issue with rad terminating immediately, this is because you did not remove your earlier output files.  Rad works like the \"make\" command, and assumes there is nothing to do if the targets are up to date.  Remove them and run it again.\n\n\nFollow Axel's advice and educate yourself a bit more about Radiance.  Read the man pages carefully for the commands you are using.  Most can be found at <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/whatis.html>\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011504.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 08:29AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011492", "id": "radiance-general_011504"}
