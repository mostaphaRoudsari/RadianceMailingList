{"body": "Your materials issue may be simply that you are missing the \"materials=\" line in your rad file. That line is where you can list all the rad files that contain material descriptions. This assumes that the translator actually splits the material refs out to separate file(s). You may have some path issues here as well, like your RAYPATH variable may not be set, or it may not have the working directory ('.') in the path.\n\n\nPretty sure Axel's tutorials and others out there include details on these issues.\n\n\nOn 2/17/16, 9:29 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Raghu,\n\n\nRadiance doesn't come with standard materials.  I don't know what kind of environment the ESP-r modeler expects.  You'll have to ask them.\n\n\nRegarding your issue with rad terminating immediately, this is because you did not remove your earlier output files.  Rad works like the \"make\" command, and assumes there is nothing to do if the targets are up to date.  Remove them and run it again.\n\n\nFollow Axel's advice and educate yourself a bit more about Radiance.  Read the man pages carefully for the commands you are using.  Most can be found at <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/whatis.html>\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011505.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 17, 2016 at 08:44AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011492", "id": "radiance-general_011505"}
