{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nIf you read the pvalue man page very carefully, you'll note that the resolution option order matters for this command.  However, it doesn't matter for pcomb, which always produces \"-y +x\" ordering.  So, to reconstruct the image without the header information, you need to adhere to this ordering in pvalue.\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\n_Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-February/001472.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 11:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001471", "id": "radiance-dev_001472"}
