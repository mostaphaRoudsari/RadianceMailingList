{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI did read the pcomb man page several times, but still managed to miss \nthis bit:\n\n\n\"The ordering of the -y and +x options determines whether the scanlines \nare sorted along x or along y\"\n\n\nApologies for this oversight.  I guess it escaped me because I have \nnever come across an 'x y' ordered image.  Didn't even know this was \npossible, to be honest.\n\n\nMany thanks for clarifying.  No bug, then, just me learning new things.\n\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 19/02/16 19:25, Gregory J.
