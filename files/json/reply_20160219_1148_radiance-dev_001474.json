{"body": "Yes, it's a subtlety that rarely gets exposed in Radiance.  Only a few programs, like pvalue, protate, and pflip, do anything with the image orientation.  Some programs work only with the default (-y +x) orientation.  Others just pass along the orientation they are given.  Only a few programs produce non-standard image orientations, like ra_bmp when it converts a BMP file from stdin.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-February/001474.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 19, 2016 at 11:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001471", "id": "radiance-dev_001474"}
