{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nThank you for your response.\nI have checked the orientation of the daylight polygons (exterior window\npane) and it matches the given view direction as 0 -1 0. I changed the view\ndirection to 0 1 0 just to see if the results would be any different. But I\nreceive the same daylight matrix file with all values equal to 0.\n\n\nWould it be convenient for you if I sent you a Google drive link to my\nproject folder with all the files that you need to run the genklemsamp\ncommand and reproduce the error?\nI had also sent a separate post with regards to variations in the commands\nfor generating all-black models in the next steps of the tutorial.\n\n\nThank you,\nAlireza\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 16, 2016 at 7:44 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011517.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza Hashemloo", "created_at": "February 24, 2016 at 10:25AM", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011489", "id": "radiance-general_011517"}
