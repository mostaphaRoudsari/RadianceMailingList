{"body": "Alireza,\n\n\nI think all your questions relate to the use of a hyphen in oconv. The\nhyphen tells oconv to take information from the standard input and treat it\nlike it would any other input file. It's a way of avoiding an intermediary\nfile.\n\n\nWithout a hyphen we can do this:\nxform [transformation parameters] input.rad > transformed.rad\noconv transformed.rad > mymodel.oct\n\n\nWith a hyphen it becomes this:\nxform [transformation parameters] input.rad | oconv - > mymodel.oct\n\n\nNotice the we don't need the intermediary file transformed.rad with the\nhyphen.\n\n\nIf we want other files included in the octree we just add them to the oconv\ncommand. Standard ordering requirements apply (materials before geometry)\nand the location of hyphen indicates where the data from the standard input\nshould be included. Like so:\n\n\nxform [transformation parameters] input.rad | oconv materials.rad\nsomegeometry.rad - othergeometry.rad > mymodel.oct\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011520.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "February 24, 2016 at 11:07AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011511", "id": "radiance-general_011520"}
