{"body": "The PAR package actually wraps an entire copy of the Perl interpreter around each and every Perl script, which is a ridiculous waste of space and a burden on load/run times. If you have Perl and Radiance installed properly you can call perl scripts on Windows (Widows and GitBash shells) just the same as on any other platform. The Radiance-related perl scripts should be installed with all the other Radiance executables, and that location should be in your system PATH. Perl needs to be installed and configured to be the \u201cdefault application\u201d, or whatever the Windows jargon is, for perl scripts. Once these two things are done, you can call the name of the perl script (e.g. genBSDF.pl) and it will work, from any location. \n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011533.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "February 27, 2016 at 04:31PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011532", "id": "radiance-general_011533"}
