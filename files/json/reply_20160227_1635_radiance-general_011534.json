{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\nthanks for such a very good answer. It is quite clear, or will be once it\nsinks in.\n\n\nI have one concern though. Let me elaborate.\n\n\nMy intention was to, actually, not use BSDFs at all. I would like to\naccount for the irradiance caused by the sky and sun, not using the 3-phase\nmethod, but the 2 phase one. Accordingly, I send rays from the walls to the\nbinned sky, not to the window. In such case, I would say that your method\nis impracticable since there is nowhere to send rays from, and with it it\nis impossible to account for inter reflections on the (very weird) exterior\nenvironment.\n\n\nThe idea of using black walls, floor and ceiling surfaces was not to\nconsider inter reflections in the interior space (I understand that energy\nplus will account for that...?). Why do I need -ab 0? I actually want to\naccount for all the optical phenomena on the exterior.\n\n\nAm I being clear? Am I totally wrong?\n\n\nKind regards!\nEl 27 feb. 2016 18:33, \"Andy McNeil\" <mcneil.andrew at gmail.com> escribi\u00f3:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011534.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "February 27, 2016 at 04:35PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011529", "id": "radiance-general_011534"}
