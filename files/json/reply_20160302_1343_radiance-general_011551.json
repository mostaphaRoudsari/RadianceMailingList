{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few months ago, I had done some validation tests with AGI-32 while\nimplementing IES2RAD in Honeybee/Grasshopper. I think you can use the data\nfrom my tests to validate your model in Groundhog. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few details regarding the test model and simulations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.     The model, which was a simple rectangular room, was tested in AGI-32\n(16.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.     The room dimensions are 10m x 10m x 4m(height). The reflectances are\n80%(ceiling), 50%(walls) and 20%(floor). The calculation grid was placed\n0.001 meters above the floor and the points were spaced 2m x 2m with an\noffset of 1 m from walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.     The luminaire was located at (5m,5m,3.5). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.     I designed a crude 2k Factorial study with 3 levels to compare the\nilluminance results from Spin, Tilt and Rotate angles in AGI-32 and\nHoneybee. I also tested aiming according to a specific point as per the\nC0-G0 coordinate system. The side-by-side comparison between the simulation\nresults can be found here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nj5e2nvltf8h1t5/Tests.pdf?dl=0 . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.     I assume that you are using Xform to position the luminaires after\ncreating the luminaires using IES2RAD. You can find the relationship between\n(Spin, Tilt, Rotate) and the Xform-specific (rx,ry,rz) inputs here :\nhttps://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/blob/master/src/Honeybee_IES%20\nLuminaire.py#L775-L784\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.     The luminaire used for the study was Lithonia 2VLTX4 30L LP835.
