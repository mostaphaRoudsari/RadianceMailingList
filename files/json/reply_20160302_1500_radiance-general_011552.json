This can be done\nvia script as part of your testing on a number of IES files with different\ntypes and features.\n\n\nBTW: If you don't want to rely on an existing Radiance installation you can\nstill include select binaries in you SketchUp extension package. That way\nyou don't have to duplicate Radiance C code and can be sure that the output\nis identical to pure Radiance.\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 2, 2016 at 12:52 PM, Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011552.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "March 02, 2016 at 03:00PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011549", "id": "radiance-general_011552"}
