{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI finally managed to have a look at this problem again.\n\n\nTo begin with I was starting with a basic case: just sky and ground.\n\n\n<sky.rad>\nvoid light solar\n0 0 3 5.326e+06 5.326e+06 5.326e+06\n\n\nsolar source sun\n0 0 4 0.463565 0.022184 0.885785 0.533000\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n2 skybright perezlum.cal\n0 10 5.802e+01 4.447e+01 -0.843574 -1.078181 11.876231 -3.091220 0.271617\n0.463565 0.022184 0.885785\n\n\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n0 0 4    1 1 1 0\nsky_glow source sky\n0 0 4    0 0 1 180\n\n\n<ground.rad>\nskyfunc glow groundglow\n0 0 4 .8 1.1 .8  0\ngroundglow source ground\n0 0 4 0 0 -1  180\n\n\nI then generate the scene with\n\n\noconv materials.rad sky.rad ground.rad > test.oct\n\n\nLet's suppose I want to calculate the contributions on the subject from a\ntregenza subdivision I would use\n\n\nrcontrib -c 105 -I+ -f tregenza.cal -m skyglow -m groundglow test.oct <\nsamps.txt > daycoef.mtx\nThis is my understanding of this command.\n\n\n1 - For each of the 105 random points\n2 - create a tregenza dome subdivision\n3 - calculate all the contributions from groundglow and skyglow and add\nthem up (this considers the cosine between the normal of the point and the\npatch vector)\n4 - finally average all the results for the 105 points.\n\n\nDoes this make any sense? How would I obtain the actual matrix?\n\n\nThanks\nRuggiero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 22 Sep 2015 at 05:46 Ruggiero Guida <ruggiero.guida at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011553.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ruggiero Guida", "created_at": "March 03, 2016 at 12:35AM", "created_by": "Ruggiero_Guida", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011239", "id": "radiance-general_011553"}
