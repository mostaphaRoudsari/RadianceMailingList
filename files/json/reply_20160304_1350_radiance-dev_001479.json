Here's my current understanding:\n\n\nA \"pull request\" is a request to the maintainer to merge changes from a\nbranch or a fork into the trunk. Since anyone can easily fork a project,\nthis seems the easiest way to contribute smaller or occasional fixes.\n\n\nNot to confuse with the normal \"pull\" and \"push\" commands.\n\n\n\n\n> I'd love to work on these things but, as usual, not enough time and,\n> in this case, no current Revit license; the thing is appallingly\n> expensive.\n\n\nThat seems to be a common problem. I'm hoping for people with access\nat work or at school. It doesn't necessarily have to be a brand new\nrelease though. I'm not sure when they introduced the \"Custom Exporter\"\nAPI, but I think it was before Revit 2014.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001479.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 04, 2016 at 01:50PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001475", "id": "radiance-dev_001479"}
