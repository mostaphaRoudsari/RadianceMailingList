Pull requests leave a nice paper trail of who did\nwhat, and who requested what, but only work within the sphere of Git.\n\n\nRandolph, you could also just make a diff/patch of your changes on your\nbranch ('git diff > changes.patch') and send to Schorsch, which he can\napply manually ('git apply changes.patch'):\n\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff\n\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply\n\n\n\n\nThis method works across version control systems, and is what I do to get\nmy changes (managed on GitHub) to Greg (who's using CVS).\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001480.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 04, 2016 at 02:03PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001475", "id": "radiance-dev_001480"}
