{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nI'm really only guessing, but I would say you need to increase your -ad value (a lot) to get a good result for your workplane in this situation.  You have the noise of the BSDF on the window to filter, which requires a great many samples.  Setting -ab 12 is probably higher than needed.  What is your -lw setting?  This is important for determining the number of rays actually traced.  Also, -aa gets set forcibly to zero by rcontrib, since it doesn't support the ambient cache.  Try:\n\n\n\t-ad 20000 -lw 2e-5 -ab 5\n\n\nto see if this produces smoother results.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011562.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 04, 2016 at 05:35PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011559", "id": "radiance-general_011562"}
