This helped me quite a bit:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\n\nThe typical situation is to create a \"fork\" first, which will give you\na copy of the project on GitHub. The fork will maintain its connection\nto the original, so it can be merged back later.\nIn contrast, \"cloning\" means to pull something to your local system\nfor editing.\n\n\nOnce you have commited and pushed your changes to the fork, you can\nthen send a pull request to the original project.\nPull requests should really be called \"merge requests\".\n\n\nTechnically, the same effect could be had by creating a branch within\nthe original project. A fork has the advantage that the original author\ndoesn't get involved until changes have been made, hopefully tested,\nand a pull request comes in about them. You can probably best think\nof a fork as an \"external branch\".\n\n\nAnything else we'll just have to experiment with, as soon as the\nopportunity arrives.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001482.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 05, 2016 at 06:09AM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001475", "id": "radiance-dev_001482"}
