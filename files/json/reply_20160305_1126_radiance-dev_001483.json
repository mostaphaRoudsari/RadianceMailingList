Then I use \"git clone\" on my own system, referencing my fork. This\n   downloads the repository to my system\n   3. Commit my changes on my system.\n   4. Use \"push\" on my system to upload my changes to my fork of the\n   project on GitHub\n   5. Then use GitHub's \"New Pull Request\" button on your repository to\n   submit a pull request to you, who will (if you like my changes) incorporate\n   my changes in your repository.\n\n\nGit documents (and perhaps this is true of most free open source\ndocumentation) seem to be written by people who know git for people who\nknow git. This makes the lives of people who don't know git difficult.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001483.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
