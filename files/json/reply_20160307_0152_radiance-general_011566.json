{"body": "Hi Chris, Rob,\n\n\nThere is actually a way to extract BSDFs XMLs from Window, but it requires a bit of a roundabout way.\n\n\nTo extract the BSDF XML file from window:\n\n\n1. Create the window system. Do initial calculation (F9). \n\n\n2. Enable Radiance calculations (under preferences). \n\n\n3. Run radiance calculations. This will not work for all materials, some don't have the right information to generate XMLs. If there is an issue saying Radiance is not installed, follow this solution: https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/7/w7_faq.html#RadianceINI\n\n\n4. Go to this location C:\\Users\\Public\\LBNL\\WINDOW7.3\\BSDFs  (might be slightly different if you use a different version) to retrieve the XML BSDF file. \n\n\n5. Use in Radiance as a BSDF file. \n\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\n\nReinier Zeldenrust\nSenior Environmental Designer / Head of Advanced Building Physics\nAtelier Ten\nEnvironmental Design Consultants + Building Services Engineers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Fri, 4 Mar 2016 21:54:31 +0000\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011566.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Reinier Zeldenrust", "created_at": "March 07, 2016 at 01:52AM", "created_by": "Reinier_Zeldenrust", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011558", "id": "radiance-general_011566"}
