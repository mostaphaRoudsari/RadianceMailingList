{"body": "Hi Randolph,\n\n\nas the question is general, the clear answer is no - this cannot be \nrecommended in general. Just imagine having a 180 degree fish eye \nresolving the sun (or reflection of it)  with 0.5 degree and having only \n500x500 pixels. We made this recommendation of 800x800 10 years ago, \nwhen a) evalglare was in its first version (in the meanwhile I optimized \nthe code which results in average to 30% time saving compared to the \nfirst versions) b) computer power was less. Nowadays I recommend \n1000x1000, especially when dealing with fabrics/translucent materials \nwith a certain peak transmission.\nAnother example: Imagine you want to do a electric lighting analysis \nwith small emitting surfaces (e.g. bunch of single LEDs) of high \nluminances. In that case you really want to resolve the glare sources \nnot only with 1 pixel each.\n\n\nBut on the other hand, there are also many cases, where you are totally \nfine with 500x500, when your potential glare sources are rather large.\n\n\nI'm currently performing a study including images from several groups - \nwe are having more than 1000 images and I would say in average an \nevalglare run was about 7s per image (using 1000x1000). The more glare \nsources are found in the image, the longer it takes (this has to do with \nthe combining the \"glare source pixel\" to glare sources). So for a scene \nwith a large amount of glare sources you might end up with 3-4min per \nimage.\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011570.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "March 08, 2016 at 01:38AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011569", "id": "radiance-general_011570"}
