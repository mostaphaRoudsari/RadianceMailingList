{"body": "Hi Greg and Rob,\n\n\nThank you for your responses:\n\n\n- It does not appear that the single back quotes are the source of the\nproblem as I tested the command following your recommendation without\npassing the `vwrays -vf views/view_A.vf -x 600 -y 600 -d` to \"rcontrib\" and\nthe rtrace \"invalid argument\" error still appears.\n\n\n- I have tested the approach to split the command into two parts as you had\nsuggested:\n\n\npart 1:   vwrays -c 4 -pj 1 -fa -vf views/view_A.vf -x 600 -y 600 | rtrace\n-h -opN -fa -ab 0 model_nosuns.oct > points.txt\npart 2:   rcontrib -x 600 -y 600 -fac -fo -o viewpics_ds/back_%04d.hdr -e\nMF:4 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m solar -c 4 -I -ab 1 -ad 100 -dt\n0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-2 model_suns.oct < points.txt\n\n\nthe part 1 appears to work properly considering that a \"points.txt\" file is\ngenerated. The part 2, however, does not appear to work: although I do not\nreceive any error messages on my command line, the rcontrib call is\ncompleted immediately after it is run and 508 hdr images are generated in\nthe given directory. However, each .hdr file is only 1 KB and the attempt\nto opening any of them is failed. It does not appear that the files have\nactually been written successfully.\n\n\nIn addition, could you elaborate about your suggestion to  *\" Replace the\n\"-x 600 -y 600\" with the output of \"vwrays -vf views/view_A.vf -x 600 -y\n600 -d*\" \" in part 2 of the command?\nFinally,  I was wondering where the definition for the \"solar\" modifier as\nthe target light source passed to the 'rcontrib' call (-m solar) is made in\nthe previous steps of the tutorial?\n\n\nThank you for your help.\nBest Regards,\n\n\nAlireza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 7, 2016 at 8:17 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011572.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza Hashemloo", "created_at": "March 09, 2016 at 12:53AM", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011563", "id": "radiance-general_011572"}
