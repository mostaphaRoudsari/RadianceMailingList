{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nThe default -lw setting for rcontrib is actually just 0.002, which means that at most 500 rays will be sampled in the initial scattering, no matter what -ad is set to.  You really need to adjust these settings in tandem when the irradiance cache is turned off, as it must be for rcontrib.\n\n\nIlluminating the interior via a BSDF material means that you are randomly sampling something that is also randomly sampling, so you have two major contributors to variance.  You can see some of these effects in my 2011 Radiance Workshop talk, \"The Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function as a First-class Citizen in Radiance\":\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day2/GW5_BSDFFirstClass.pdf\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011575.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 09, 2016 at 11:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011559", "id": "radiance-general_011575"}
