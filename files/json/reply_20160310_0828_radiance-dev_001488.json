{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nThanks for all your efforts!  I guess we now have 3 working build systems for Radiance (the old rmake script, cmake, and SCons is back).\n\n\nThe 64-bit coercion warnings are as you say, mostly harmless.  The ones isn bmpfile.c are going to be 8-bit values at most, so no worries there.  However, the one you pointed out in rttree_reduce.c was a potential bug on large arrays, so I changed it to (size_t)1<<(expression).  I hope your compiler accepts this without complaint.  If it gives you another warning, please suggest a better strategy.\n\n\nCheers!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001488.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 08:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001487", "id": "radiance-dev_001488"}
