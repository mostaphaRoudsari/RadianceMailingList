I'm usually way behind the curve in terms of\nhardware, and even I have thrown out the last 32bit box last year.\nI assume it will still build on 32bit anyway, but we don't need to go\nthe extra mile for that.\n\n\n\n\n>> The tifflib included with the NREL binaries didn't work, which\n>> means they used a different compiler.

I've now built my own tifflib, also for\nthe headers, but had the same problem with that one at first.\n\n\n\n\n> Maybe when you have time, you can look at qtrvu and help make it \n> better.\n> The GUI was modeled after your Windows rvu, included with Rayfront.\n\n\nThe old Winrview actually came from LBNL (for Desktop Radiance), and I\njust fixed it to actually work as intended. I don't think that one has\never been published in source. Would that fall under the Radiance \nlicence?\nThen maybe we could at least pick it for ideas. I remember I had to \napply\nsome hacks to be able to stop a running simulation from the UI thread.\n\n\nI also have something called \"winimage\" sitting on a disk, but no idea \nof\nits state of maturity (Rayfront uses an image viewer in Python). It has \nthe\nsame LBNL copyright, so we might be able to play with it as well.\n\n\n\n\nWhat package do I need to fetch for the qt libraries?\nQtrvu looks nice, but playing around with it revealed a few glitches.\nGetting the window size right is probably simple, why it always wants\nyou to hit \"enter\" twice remains to be seen.\n\n\nI have no idea how much time I'll have for those things in the near or\nnot so near future, so don't hold your breath. I just saw an opportunity\nin the past few weeks (starting with temporary access to Revit), so I\njumped on the topic again a bit.\n\n\n\n\n>> Ah... can we standardize on a file name extension for C++ files in\n>> Radiance?

The size and complexity \nof\nthe Radiance sources already makes them confusing enough...\nThe only counter example is src/cv/bsdftrans.cpp, and a (generated?) \nfile\nin CMakeFiles/.\n\n\nSome people apparently do use .cxx, to distinguish the shortcut from \n\"CPP\"\nfor the preprocessor. Out in the wild though, .cpp seems to be about 5\ntimes more popular. I suggest to decide on a standard now (no matter \nwhich),\nwhile the \"problem\" is still not really one. We should expect the number\nof C++ files to grow in the future.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001490.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 10, 2016 at 03:09PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001487", "id": "radiance-dev_001490"}
