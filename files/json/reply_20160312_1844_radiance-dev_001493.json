{"body": "Actually, the release candidate is the \u2018b\u2019 release in Greg\u2019s parlance, which usually exists for a very brief time. If you look at the GitHub releases, we did make a 4.2.b.0, followed a week later by the official 4.2 release. It\u2019s my understanding the HEAD is considered alpha code until right before an official release. Radiance major versions are released when they are released, generally following a brief period where it\u2019s considered \u2018beta\u2019, and then the version goes back to \u2018a\u2019 in the HEAD and stays there until shortly before the next major release, again to \u2018b\u2019, and then, new version number. Twas ever thus. \n\n\nAt NREL we hang an additional identifier after the \u2018a\u2019 on each of our \u201creleases\u201d (which are really just snapshots, or tags), just to keep them in order. It\u2019s not true semantic versioning, but it\u2019s a way for us to keep track of which tag we\u2019re using with which OpenStudio releases and whatnot. It can be confusing because our v5.0.a.5 predates the official release v5.0, which itself predates the latest set of packages we made: v5.0.a.8.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001493.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 12, 2016 at 06:44PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001492", "id": "radiance-dev_001493"}
