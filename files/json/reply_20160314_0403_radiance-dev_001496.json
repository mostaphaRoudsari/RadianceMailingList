{"body": "The SCons build system has had a testing infrastructure for many years,\nunfortunately with only a minimal number of actual test cases.\nAs I have seen, the CMake system has one too, suffering the same \nproblem.\n\n\nIt's just a matter of interested parties contributing test cases.\n\n\nCovering all the existing code is one challenge. But it would be most \nhelpful\nif anyone adding features also provided test cases to demonstrate what \nthey are\nsupposed to do, and even more importantly what they are NOT supposed to \ndo.\n\n\nThose could be just small(!) datasets with a description, and not \nnecessarily\nalready integrated into a test suite. Someone who is familiar with one \nof the\nsuites can then integrate them. In the ideal case, no new feature wold \ngo into\na \"final release\" without a comprehensive set of test cases covering it.\n\n\nBesides that, given the \"organic\" development and limited resources, I'm \nnot\nsure if changing the release cycle would make much of a difference in \nwhen bugs\nare found. There's only a small number of people checking out the HEAD \nversion,\nand those only try it on a very limited data set.\n\n\nThe majority will only download after a new final release has been \nannounced,\nno matter wether the release candidate has been around for a week or a \nmonth.\nAnd only then will the new release be confronted with the \"interesting\" \ndata\nthat actually triggers most bugs.\n\n\nThe important part here is to then create test cases specifically \ntesting for\nthose bugs, to make sure they won't resurface later (regression \ntesting).\nQA is a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it...\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-14 02:20, schrieb Gregory J.
