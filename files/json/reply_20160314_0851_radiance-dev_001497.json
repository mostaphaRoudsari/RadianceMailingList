I've all but abandoned the practice,\nsince MS Outlook makes it very difficult to do (and not get the formatting\nscrewed up), and even when it works, I've actually had people tell me they\nreceived \"blank\" emails from me, because they didn't think to scroll down\npast the first quoted bit =/\n\n\n\n\n>\n>The old Winrview actually came from LBNL (for Desktop Radiance), and I\n>just fixed it to actually work as intended.

I had ASSumed that yours was the only Windows\nversion, and so when we started the GitHub mirror we just rolled our own\nrvu, thinking there were no open source options at the time. I have no\nidea where the source for that Desktop Radiance rvu might be.\n\n\n\n\n>\n>What package do I need to fetch for the qt libraries?\n>Qtrvu looks nice, but playing around with it revealed a few glitches.\n>Getting the window size right is probably simple, why it always wants\n>you to hit \"enter\" twice remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\nWe updated qtrvu to use Qt5 a while back; specifically, we recommend Qt\n5.3.2 for building OpenStudio, and that version seems to work fine for\nqtrvu as well. Yeah it's definitely a little rough around the edges but\nit's useable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\n>I have no idea how much time I'll have for those things in the near or\n>not so near future, so don't hold your breath.

It's sure nice to hear from you again though!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001497.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 14, 2016 at 08:51AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001487", "id": "radiance-dev_001497"}
