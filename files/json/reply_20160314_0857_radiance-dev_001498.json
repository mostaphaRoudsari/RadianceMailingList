I followed what you had in SCons when I\nstarted the CTest stuff. I decided to start with tests on the core\nelements we were using for OpenStudio's Radiance workflows, but never got\nvery far, nor very concrete (it's hard to ensure the correct binaries and\nlibs are being exercised, when you have multiple flavors of Radiance on\nboard). \n\n\nWe are about to build a rigorous testing and continuous integration\ninfrastructure around the OpenStudio and OS measures projects, which I\nhope will pay dividends on the Radiance side of things. But I'm not\nholding my breath on that last bit right now. We'll see.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001498.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 14, 2016 at 08:57AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001492", "id": "radiance-dev_001498"}
