I don't think the DR team changed anything relevant after\nmy fixes.\n\n\nUnfortunately, my old contract with LBNL does not cover\nredistribution in source form. To make this possible, we'd need\nsome statement from them that those programs can be considered a\npart of the normal Radiance distribution and fall under the\n\"Radiance open source license\".\n\n\n@Greg, are you entitled to make such a statement?\n\n\n\n\n> We updated qtrvu to use Qt5 a while back; specifically, we recommend Qt\n> 5.3.2 for building OpenStudio, and that version seems to work fine for\n> qtrvu as well.
