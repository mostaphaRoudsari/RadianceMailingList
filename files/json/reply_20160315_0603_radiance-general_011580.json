{"body": "Dear Urtza,\n\n\ntwo comments on your installation - this should be solved before you \neven start using a complicated combination of commands such as the \nthree-phase method.\n\n\nFirst, with a correct configuration of your system you will not need to \nrun rcontrib as super-user (sudo). Your regular user account just needs \nread-access to the .dat and .cal files in this case, so why would you \nnot grant the proper permissions?\n\n\nSecond, as rcontrib is not found, what makes you think it is installed? \nDid you install Radiance from sources, did the build complete without \nerrors, and did you include the directory containing the binaries in \nyour PATH environment variable? Does any other Radiance command work for \nyou?\n\n\nI would recommend having a look at Axel Jacob's set of tutorials first, \nincluding the unix-introduction. Otherwise you risk messing up a lot of \nyour models with work-arounds, and even risk the integrity of your \nsystem by using sudo where it should definitively not be applied.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011580.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
