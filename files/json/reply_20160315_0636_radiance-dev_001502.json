{"body": "Hi Georg,\n\n\nI vaguely remember winrview as being somewhat buggy.  Did you fix it up?  Does it offer advantages to Windows users over the current qt-based interface?  Similarly, is the winimage program superior to what Windows folks are using now?\n\n\nI don't want to welcome back something that's going to be more trouble than it's worth, now that I've been told *we* developed it....\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001502.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 15, 2016 at 06:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001501", "id": "radiance-dev_001502"}
