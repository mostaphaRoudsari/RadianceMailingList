{"body": "I did fix winrview as well as I could back then. It has a more\ncomplete and smoothely working user interface than the NREL winrvu.\nAll that provided someone gets it to work with the current Radiance\nrelease, of course.\n\n\nAs far as I am aware, there is no other standalone image viewer\navailable on Windows. Winimage will require some fixing though, my old\nbinaries seem to have trouble recognizing the magic scanline header\nin the files. But I'm pretty sure that DR used to include a working\nversion, so that shouldn't be too hard.\n\n\nBoth have a native Windows-GUI, which can be seen as an advantage (no\nthirdparty libraries required) or a disadvantage (not portable to other\nsystems).\n\n\nBoth of them could either find a new life as working programs in the\ndistribution, or later be scrapped again after all the useful parts have\nbeen scavenged for reuse in other solutions. And don't worry, nobody\nwill be blaming you for either possible outcome... ;)\n\n\nFor the moment the repository would just be the most convenient place\nfor interested developers to access and fix the sources.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-15 14:36, schrieb Gregory J.
