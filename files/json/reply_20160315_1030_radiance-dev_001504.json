{"body": "> As far as I am aware, there is no other standalone image viewer\n> available on Windows.\n\n\nI use HDRView.exe under Windows.  It used to be available on Paul\nDebevec's site, but is no longer.  I send him an email a couple of\nyears ago, asking him whether he'd allow me to pass it on, but I did\nnot receive a reply.  HDRView is still available on some rather\nobscure sites.  It's lightning fast, allows you to zoom in and out,\nand to adjust the exposure with the +/- keys.\n\n\nCheers\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001504.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 15, 2016 at 10:30AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001501", "id": "radiance-dev_001504"}
