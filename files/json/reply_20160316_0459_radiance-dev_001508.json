{"body": "Just shows that I've been away from Radiance for too long, and didn't\nfollow closely enough what other people are doing.\nRadDisplay looks very nice and useful! That's the direction I wouldd \nhave\nliked to take the old viever in Rayfront (given the time I didn't have).\n\n\nBut my ignorance was only a minor point in the current discussion.\nThe real question was if it would be interesting to have a native viewer\nfor Windows in the Radiance source repository and distribution.\nEverybody else has ximage, but Windows users need to find an external\nsolution to even just look at a picture. This is about providing the\nmost elementary basics, and not about competing with other people's\nmore advanced tools.\n\n\nWinimage is very simple, and still needs fixing for robustness.\nIt is designed to:\n  * display hdr pictures\n  * offer simple analysis (by calling falsecolor and friends)\n  * store images in a small number of other formats\nAfter I tweaked the sources a bit to conform to the current C++ \nstandards,\nit currently builds with both Visual Studio 2015 and SCons.\nIt has no thirdparty dependencies at all.\n\n\nThe only \"basic\" feature currently missing is displaying luminance \nvalues\nby picking or hovering over the picture. I haven't checked yet how easy\nit would be to add this, but I expect someone would find a solution.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-16 09:18, schrieb Marija Velickovic:\n> Hi,\n> \n> There is our tool RadDisplay, which shows values when mousing over\n> image.\n> On site there is rather old version of tool, but still does basic\n> image exploration http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html\n> [2]\n> \n> We are preparing new version of web site, and have in some plan to\n> release newer version of RadDisplay soon.\n> \n> Marija\n> \n> On Tue, Mar 15, 2016 at 7:26 PM, Randolph M.
