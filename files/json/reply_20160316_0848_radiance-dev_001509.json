{"body": "Hi All,\n\n\nIt would be great if you guys could pool resources and decide which tool to advance as the standard Radiance picture viewer for Windows.

Likewise for rvu, which I would prefer to be a driver connected using the existing call mechanism.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001509.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001501", "id": "radiance-dev_001509"}
