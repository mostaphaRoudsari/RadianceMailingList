{"body": "It could be that the directory is not in your RAYPATH, but it is in the RAYPATH for root. \n\n\nTry:\necho $RAYPATH\nsudo echo $RAYPATH\n\n\nAre there any differences in the output?\n\n\nAlso, it could be that your user doesn't have read permission in the directory containing the files. Try using ls -l on every directory in the path to find out (both lower case L). \n\n\nAs a last resort, I'd copy the files to the working directory, change the owner, permissions, and add \".\" to RAYPATH. I agree with Lars that I'd never use sudo to run user level commands. \n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011589.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 09:46AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011579", "id": "radiance-general_011589"}
