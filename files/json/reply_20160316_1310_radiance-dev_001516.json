{"body": "I see three topics there:\n\n\nImage viewer\nDo we actually have another option for that on Windows?\nWhat does OpenStudio use?\nOn a side note: The next Gimp version (3.10, currently in beta as\n3.9.2) should be able to open HDR files. Though I suspect it will\nnot include the tonemapping algorithms or other analysis\nfunctionality that we need here.\nSecond side note: I just saw that the NREL binary package still\nhas its image files as *.pic instead of *.hdr, is this deliberate?\n\n\nPreview renderer\nFirst I'll have to try and get Winrview running again...\nOnce we know it actually still works, I think Rob will be in the best\nposition to make a judgement on which one (or which combination) fits\nthe purpose best, and will be easier to grow more functionality with\nin the future.\n\n\nI never looked at that \"driver/output device\" mechanism very closely.\nI think that in those cases where the \"device\" is actually a seperate\nprogram, whichever rvu executable got invoked first with that option\nwill just hand over the job to its named sibling (that seems to be\nhow qtrview works on unix right now). Unless I'm missing some detail,\nI don't think that will be a problem, even if there will probably be\nonly one device available on Windows for now.\n\n\nTest suite unification\nI think that one better goes into a seperate thread.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-16 17:00, schrieb Rob Guglielmetti:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001516.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 01:10PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001501", "id": "radiance-dev_001516"}
