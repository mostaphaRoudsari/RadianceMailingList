But when developing and \nmaintaining\ncode, any small thing you need to include from external sources is like\na ball and chain. Even something small and simple like the tifflib has\ncaused a surprising amount of headaches for Radiance.\n\n\nThe standard trade-off for GUIs is OS dependency vs. toolkit dependency.\n\n\nSince we already have a working solution for all other sytems, we can\nfocus on Windows here. Of course it would be *nice* to have something\nplatform-independent. But with our limited resources, the added \nmaintenance\nheadaches may not be worth it in this specific case.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001518.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 01:21PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001501", "id": "radiance-dev_001518"}
