{"body": "While rvu can (and historically has) executed a driver as an independent process, it is supposed to communicate with that driver via a couple of pipes.  I didn't realize that it handed over execution to qtrvu.  There is a \"slave mode\" that reverses operation, permitting the display driver to call rvu as the parent process -- is that what qtrvu is doing, or does it copy all the sources for rendering or call the raycalls.c?  I guess I should familiarize myself with that source tree, but I've just been ignoring it up until now...\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001519.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 16, 2016 at 01:43PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001501", "id": "radiance-dev_001519"}
