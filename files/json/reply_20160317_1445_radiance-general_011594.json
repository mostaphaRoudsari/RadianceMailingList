{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nI don't think rfluxmtx reads large matrices into memory.  It could write a too-large matrix to disk as the output of rcontrib, but neither process holds the matrices in memory.  Maybe you meant rmtxop?  That will hold two double (64-bit) color (x3) matrices in memory at a time, which could be a problem for certain very large matrices.  You might try dctimestep for matrix multiplication.  It uses float (32-bit) color (x3) arrays, so half as much memory is required.  Also, it's more clever about skipping zero rows and columns in your matrix, which is good for daylight calculations that include nighttime hours.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011594.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2016 at 02:45PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011591", "id": "radiance-general_011594"}
