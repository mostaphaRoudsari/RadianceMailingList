{"body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nI've never seen rcontrib run out of memory in this way before.  What are your rendering options for rcontrib?  Do any of your surfaces have greater than 100% reflectance or transmittance?  This could cause the number of rays to increase rather than decrease on multiple bounces, which could lead to exponential memory growth during ray tree evaluation.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011595.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 17, 2016 at 02:49PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011591", "id": "radiance-general_011595"}
