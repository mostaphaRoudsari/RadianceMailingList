{"body": "Dear Andy,\n\n\nThank you very much. Lars's and yours permission suggestions have helped\nme.\nI checked the directories by ls -l :\nEvery files have \"-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root\" permission description except\nGenericTranslucent20.dat and rang.cal files; \"-rwx------ 1 root root.\nI changed the permission by \"sudo chmod 777 file\" and now the two files\nhave the same permission as others.\n(plugins and /usr/local/bin/radiance and /usr/local/bin/radiance have\n\"drwxrwxrwx 3 root root\" description)\n\n\nI have launched and now it works. Thanks.\n(Note that, I put this two files in my folder with padlock and then I run\nwith sudo and it works but with rcontrib no. Now, it seems that I put\neverything ok and I do not need to do that, which could be not good)\n\n\nRegarding dctimestep, I remove -n 8760 parameter but it seems that I have\nproblems with Sky Matrix. The steps have been these:\n\n\nepw2wea ESP_Barcelona.081810_IWEC.epw Barcelona.wea\n  place BARCELONA_ESP\n  latitude 41.28\n  longitude -2.07\n  time_zone -15.00\n  site_elevation 6.0\n  weather_data_file_units 1\n  \u00a0\n  \u00a0\n  gendaymtx -m 4 Barcelona.wea > Barcelona.smx\n  \u00a0\n  \u00a0\n  dctimestep photocells.vmx Film3M_145x1297_9142012_t.xml southest.dmx\nBarcelona.smx > illum.dat\n  fatal - unexpected EOF reading Barcelona.smx\n\n\n\n\nI would be very grateful if you could find the problem. Thank you very much\nin advance.\nBest regards,\nUrtza.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\nAndy McNeil <mcneil.andrew at gmail.com> escribi\u00f3:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011602.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Urtza Uriarte", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 04:56AM", "created_by": "Urtza_Uriarte", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011579", "id": "radiance-general_011602"}
