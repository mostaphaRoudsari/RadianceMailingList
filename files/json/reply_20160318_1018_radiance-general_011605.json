{"body": "Hi Humberto,\nI'm glad the compilation worked. I'm surprised you were able to figure out\nthat you needed to install csh to get makeall to run. The error \"no such\nfile or directory\" doesn't give much clue of what is wrong.\n\n\nI suspect you will have problems with the commands in the three phase\ntutorial. They're not up to date, and some options no longer exist or are\nun-necessary. Also, the rfluxmtx command makes the process a lot simpler.\nI've been working on updating the tutorial, but have made slow progress.\nYou might consider using the 2014 workshop presentation as a guide to the\nnewer methods:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/McNeil_BSDFsandPhases.pdf\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Mar 18, 2016 at 6:55 AM, Humberto Antunes <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011605.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 10:18AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011597", "id": "radiance-general_011605"}
