{"body": "Hi Urtza,\n\n\nglad your materials are finally working.\nThe most common cause of the error you are receiving is not having the\nnumber of rows in your view matrix. You can use getinfo to look at the\nheader of your view matrix like this:\ngetinfo photocells.vmx\n\n\nis there a line starting with NROWS=\n\n\nIf not, then you can use a text editor to add NROWS=10 (replace 10 with\nyour number of sensor points). This can be added in the rcontrib command by\nadding -y 10\n\n\nThis is one of the many changes in radiance that makes the three phase\ntutorial outdated. Sorry.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011606.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 10:24AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011579", "id": "radiance-general_011606"}
