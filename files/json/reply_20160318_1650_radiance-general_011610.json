{"body": "Oh, but I did neglect to mention a critical point, which is that rfluxmtx figures out the hemisphere orientation(s) from the surface or surfaces you specify in your source and receiver files.  So, it's very important that surface normals are directed in a certain way -- specifically, receiver normals point in the direction of the sampled hemisphere, and source normals point *away* from the hemisphere we want to sample.\n\n\nThough this may seem counter-intuitive, it follows naturally from the typical orientation of windows in Radiance, whose normals face the interior.  When the windows are acting as the receivers in a matrix calculation, such as for a view or illuminance value matrix, their normal is looking towards the interior hemisphere being sampled.  When their role changes to make them the source surfaces, as when you calculate the exterior daylight matrix, they are still facing the correct direction to have their opposite-side hemisphere send out samples to the exterior.\n\n\nIn this way, rfluxmtx allows you to re-use your receiver description in one run as the source description in another run.\n\n\nI'm hoping this makes sense, because I mention it in the man page, but it's not quite obvious and I did it the wrong way around the last time I used the tools, myself(!)\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n\n\nrfluxmtx.pdf\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 18, 2016 at 04:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011597", "id": "radiance-general_011610"}
