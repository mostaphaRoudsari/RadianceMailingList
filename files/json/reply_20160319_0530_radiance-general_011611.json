{"body": "Thanks Greg, that definitely helped.\n\n\nSo we really need to be careful about the surface normal, if the objective\nis to get illuminance values on the work plane inside a room the normal of\nthe window should face the interior, is that it?\n\n\nThere is just something i cant't understand, defining the up-direction, in\nthe windows located in vertical surfaces the up-direction is allways \"u=Z\"\nno matter the orientation of the window, while in the ground or sky surface\nin the daylight matrix receiver file up-direction is \"u=Y\", right?\n\n\nIt may be import to say that my model is a simple office room with only a\nwindow, a lot like Axel's model on the rcontrib lesson, and i will have to\nanalyse the illuminance at the work plane for the four different\norientations of the window with different control parameters for the\nshading device applied to that same window.\n\n\nBest regards\nHumberto A.\n\n\n\n\n2016-03-18 23:50 GMT+00:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011611.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Humberto Antunes", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 05:30AM", "created_by": "Humberto_Antunes", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011597", "id": "radiance-general_011611"}
