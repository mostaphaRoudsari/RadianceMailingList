{"body": "Hi Alireza,\n\n\nWhen I was new to Mac, I had similar questions. I wouldn't say mine is a perfect answer but this what I did. I installed Radiance in my Applications folder, implies my bin, lib folders are here. I have several versions of Radiance installed , if I want to use a particular version of Radiance I just change the Path and Raypath in the .bash_profile file in the home folder. Add the bin path of radiance at the end of already existing PATH variable and Create a RAYPATH similarly and add lib folder path there. Mac Terminal is similar to any Linux terminal and I find it better than the later.\n\n\nOnce the Paths were added you need to refresh the .bash_profile file by logout and login or executing( $ .  .bash_profile ) from home folder.\n\n\nInstalling is similar to that of Linux, instructions are provided on Git readme page. Let me know if you have more questions. Others please feel free to correct me.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011619.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Raghuram Kalyanam", "created_at": "March 19, 2016 at 08:29PM", "created_by": "Raghuram_Kalyanam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011614", "id": "radiance-general_011619"}
