{"body": "Andy,\n\n\nThank you for your response. I have migrated to Mac in order to complete\nthis step of the Five phase method tutorial.\nI have pursued the tutorial with the exact scene descriptions and\nsimulation settings.\nI have encountered the following warning/error as follows:\n\n\nafter increasing the limit on the open files in Terminal via the \"ulimit -n\n9999\" command, I have called the following command as shown in the tutorial:\n\n\nFive-phase Method Tutoiral | Example 2 - Rendering | Direct Sun Coefficient\nMatrix (page 19) :\n\n\ncommand:\n\n\n$ vwrays -c 4 -pj 1 -fa -vf views/back.vf -x 500 -y 500 | \\\nrtrace -h- -opn -faa -ab 0 octs/model_nosuns.oct | \\\nrcontrib `vwrays -vf views/back.vf -x 500 -y 500 -d` -n $procs -fac -fo \\\n-o viewpics_ds/back_%04d.hdr -e MF:6 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m\nsolar \\\n-c 4 -I -ab 1 -ad 100 -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-2 octs/model_suns.oct\n\n\nWarnings:\n\n\nrcontrib: warning - BSDF \"bsdf/fullwindow_t45\" has 169.4 % front reflection\nrcontrib: warning - BSDF \"bsdf/fullwindow_t45\" has 218.8% rear reflection\n\n\n\n\nError Description:\n\n\nAlthough the given rcontrib warnings do not terminate the command call, it\ndoes not appear to me that any progress is made leaving the command running\nfor over 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n1- What would be the reason for the tensor-tree BSDF file\n(fullwindow_t45.xml) generated in the previous steps of the tutorial  to\nhave over 100% reflection as shown in the rcontrib warnings?\n2- How can I remedy this problem in this stage of the tutorial to generate\nthe 5185 direct sun coefficient images?\n\n\nBest Regards,\nAlireza\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011622.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza Hashemloo", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 01:54PM", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011563", "id": "radiance-general_011622"}
