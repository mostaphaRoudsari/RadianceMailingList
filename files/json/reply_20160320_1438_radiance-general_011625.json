{"body": "Hi Urtza and Andy,\n\n\nI am having the same issue as you do Urtza, I have already checked the\nheaders of my view matrix, daylight matrix and sky matrix, and that doesn't\nseem to be the problem, my view matrix is a 6X145, the daylight matrix a\n145X2306, and finally, the sky matrix is a 2306X8760, and this info is on\nthe headers of each.\n\n\nI think the problem is in the sky matrix file itself, it's not being\nproperly written.\n\n\nMine looks like this:\n#?RADIANCE\ngendaymtx -m 4 weather/lisboa.wea\nLATLONG= 38.73000000 -9.15000000\nNROWS=2306\nNCOLS=8760\nNCOMP=3\nFORMAT=ascii\n\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0.477 0.477 0.477\n1.85 1.85 1.85\n4.85 4.85 4.85\n11.6 11.6 11.6\n10.5 10.5 10.5\n...\n\n\n\n\nSo it doesn't have the number of columns it should, i think that each row\nhas the RGB value for one patch of one time step and it should have the RGB\nvalues for all time steps of one patch, is that it?\n\n\nBest regards\nHumberto A.\n\n\n2016-03-20 13:42 GMT+00:00 Urtza Uriarte <urtza.uriarte at upc.edu>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011625.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Humberto Antunes", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Humberto_Antunes", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011579", "id": "radiance-general_011625"}
