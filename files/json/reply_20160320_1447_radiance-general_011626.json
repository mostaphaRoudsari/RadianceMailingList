{"body": "Hi Humberto,\n\n\nActually, your header and ASCII data look OK.  Although some tools would put all the columns together in one humungous line with 8760x3, white space has no meaning here and gendaymtx output has a newline for each column entry with an extra empty line between rows.\n\n\nIf you run the \"wc\" command on your file,  you should get something like:\n\n\n\t20202873  60601692  xxxxxxxxxxx  lisboa.smx\n\n\nI don't know what xxxxxxx will be, but some large number corresponding to the number of bytes in your file.  The first two values may not be exactly this, but should be reasonably close.  Otherwise, your file really is missing some data at the end.\n\n\nIf your numbers agree roughly with the above, please send me a gzip'ped copies of your lisboa.wea and the output (*.smx) file in a private e-mail and I will see if I can figure out what is going on.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011626.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 02:47PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011579", "id": "radiance-general_011626"}
