{"body": "You can achieve the same result as averaging output by repeating the points on your input and adding a corresponding -c N for rcontrib.\n\n\nIf you already have the matrices, though, you can average them using rmtxop.  Let's say you have 3 matrices, you can use:\n\n\n\trmtxop -s .33333 res1.mtx + -s .33333 res2.mtx + -s .33333 res3.mtx > avg.mtx\n\n\nNote that you would use a different scaling factor for more or fewer matrices.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011627.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 02:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011597", "id": "radiance-general_011627"}
