{"body": "Hi Alireza,\n\n\nDid you generate the XML files yourself?  The ones I downloaded via the current version of the 5-phase bash script don't report this warning, which I would say indicates a problem.  You can download the XML files using:\n\n\n\tcurl -o bsdf/fullwindow_t45.xml http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/fullwindow_t45.xml\n\tcurl -o bsdf/fullwindow.xml http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/fullwindow.xml\n\n\nI can't speculate what is going wrong with your genBSDF command if you created these yourself, unless you send me the related input files.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011628.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 03:12PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011563", "id": "radiance-general_011628"}
