I received the error : \"No such file or directory\" followed by \"curl:\n(23) Failed writing body (0 != 1460)\". May I ask if you could send me the\ntwo xml files as\nan attachment to my email address?\n\n\n2- The tensor tree xml file (fullwindow_t45.xml) is generated via the\nfollowing command:\n\n\n$ genBSDF +f +b -geom meter -dim 0.5 3.5 1 2 -.3 0 -t4 5\nbsdf/fullwindow.rad > bsdf/fullwindow_t45.xml\n\n\nI can send you the related input files via a Google Drive link to your\nemail address if that works for you in order to diagnose the cause for high\nreflection values.\n\n\n3-  Generating the direct sun coefficient images, how can I generate a BSDF\nfile with Klems' subdivision scheme with  higher resolution (each Klems'\npatch subdivided into four smaller patches) as a replacement to using a\ntensor-tree file?\n\n\nThank you,\nAlireza\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011630.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza Hashemloo", "created_at": "March 20, 2016 at 03:45PM", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011563", "id": "radiance-general_011630"}
