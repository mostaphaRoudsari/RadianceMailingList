{"body": "Dear Andy and Greg,\n\n\n(I am trying to follow Humberto's issue, as well)\nI have added to View Matrix sensor points number (I notice that in Daylight\nMatrix I have not had NROWS data and I have added NROWS=145). To sum up I\nhave;\u00a0Sky Matrix, 2306x8760; Daylight Matrix, 145x2306; and View Matrix,\n552x145.\u00a0I launched dctimestep and it scripts the same error (fatal -\nunexpected EOF reading Barcelona.smx).\n\n\nIn case, I review the Sky Matrix with \"wc\" and I get almost the number that\nGreg suggested:\n\n\nwc Barcelona.smx\n\n\n20202874 \u00a060601692 213155298 Barcelona.smx\n\n\nI do not know what is the problem with Sky Matrix (although it seems a\nlittle estrange 2306x8760 data are in rows).\nThank you in advance,\nUrtza.\n\n\n\"Gregory J.
