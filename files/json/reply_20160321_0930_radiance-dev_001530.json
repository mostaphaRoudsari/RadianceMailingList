{"body": "Schorsch, you're making the rest of us look like slackers!\n\n\nI'm all about this move. When I added some new stuff that was written in\nRuby, it was less than enthusiastically adopted because of yet another\ndependency; Perl had recently been added to the dependency list with the\nnew rtcontrib utilities. Axel Jacobs was his usual awesome self and\nreimplemented my stuff in Perl (he's also responsible for the Perl\nfalsecolor), so we're back to the one dependency. I'm thrilled to see new\ncsh-based utilities now in Python (phisto was on my list of ones to\nconvert as well), and personally don't see the Python requirement a big\ndeal, but it is an additional requirement.\n\n\nI think at this point the critical ones still implemented in Perl are\ngenBSDF and genskyvec, since you just added falsecolor. I would lobby for\nobjview/pict, and the derivatives I started in Ruby and Axel already\nported to Perl, ltview/pict.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/21/16, 10:02 AM, \"Georg Mischler\" <schorsch at schorsch.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001530.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 09:30AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001530"}
