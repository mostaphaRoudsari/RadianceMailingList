{"body": "There is the downside that I don't know Python at all, and learning yet another object-oriented language with completely different syntax isn't high on my list of priorities.  That said, if we can get past the support issues on various platforms, I have no problem with Schorsch and others making contributions they wish to support on an ongoing basis, or ones that are unlikely to require support.\n\n\nFor this reason, I don't have much enthusiasm for converting something as complex as genBSDF to Python, where I couldn't understand or fix any problems that arise in future.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001531.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 12:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001531"}
