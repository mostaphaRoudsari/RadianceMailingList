{"body": "Greg, someone of your capacity will be fluent in the Python syntax \nwithin\nan hour, the object and exception system in a day, and the most \nelementary\nparts of the library within a few days (the included library is so huge\nthat even experienced pythonistas will keep searching the documentation\nfor more arcane modules).\n\n\nPython is \"the language thet doesn't get in the way\", and not another \nPerl.\nYou will very quickly have less problems debugging a Python program by\nsomeone else, compared to a Perl program you have written yourself.\nWhile I definitively understand your reluctance, I also think that in \nthis\nspecific case you will find it to be unjustified.\nAnd if you should still run into trouble, there are enough Radiance \nusers\nout there who are already very fluent and can help out.\n\n\nSo now we need a few more good conversion candidates with test cases.\nDo you by chance still have any of the test cases you used to verify\nthe existing scripts when you created them?\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-21 20:44, schrieb Gregory J.
