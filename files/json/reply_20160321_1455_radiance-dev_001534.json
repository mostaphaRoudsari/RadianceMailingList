{"body": "Hmmm...  Well, I may be a little thicker with respect to learning new languages than you give me credit for.  Lately, I've been trying to pick up Java for one of my client projects and having a lot of trouble, despite (or because of?) its passing similarity to C++.  Perl is relatively easy for me precisely because it doesn't have all the object-oriented stuff or extensive libraries.  I always avoided the C++ STL because I never could understand what they wanted me to do with it.  It's less a matter of language philosophy and more a matter of how much vocabulary/syntax one needs to master, because my mental capacity for \"miscellaneous stuff\" is severely limited.  I never could get the hang of foreign languages because I can't remember vocabulary.\n\n\nSo, I stick by my preference not to rewrite all the existing Perl scripts as Python, except in cases where I am not needed for their future maintenance.  I understand that it is important to move away from C-shell, and that's fine.  Unfortunately, my ability to fix anything more than the way the Radiance tools get called in Python is currently zero, and looking at your new scripts, I don't see that changing anytime soon.\n\n\nAlso, I wish I had some test cases for these scripts, but I was never really good about that.  I generally wrote something when I needed it or had an example ready, but I didn't have the foresight to keep those examples around, so I'm not much help there.  Sorry!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001534.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 02:55PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001534"}
