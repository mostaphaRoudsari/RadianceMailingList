{"body": "You're arguing with some of the most syntactitcally complex aspects\nof current programming languages here. (STL?!?)\nIn contrast, Pythons syntax was specifically designed to be easy to\nunderstand and use (there's a lot of research into that).\n\n\nMaybe you should just invest an hour and play through the tutorial\n  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/  (also in the downloaded docs)\nThen you may see firsthand that Python is really different from\nall the horrible things you've already seen...\n\n\nIf you can't get your head wrapped around object oriented ideas,\nPython won't force them onto you (other than Java). But if you want\nto use them, they're much simpler to implement in Python.\n\n\nPython is \"the language that doesn't get in the way\".\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-21 22:55, schrieb Gregory J.
