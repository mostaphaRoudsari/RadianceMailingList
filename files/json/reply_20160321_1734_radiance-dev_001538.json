{"body": "Getting old?  That, I am!  \n\n\nSeriously, though, what's up with all the double-subscripts on string arrays?  Seems you always need string[0][0] to access a word, when I would expect just one subscript unless you want a character.  And I have absolutely no clue how the quoted line extracts the final file component from a path, assuming that's its purpose.  Python seems to introduce a whole new set of conventions, which if my mind weren't already polluted by the conventions of half a dozen other languages, probably wouldn't give me so much trouble.\n\n\nThe only real benefit I see to your recommendation, other than having just one language to deal with, is that we don't have to mess with different quoting conventions between Windows and Unix shell interpreters.  That does simplify things a bit, but we still need to change options around because Windows doesn't handle binary data transfer reliably.  So, piped commands still are not 100% portable even in Python.  We'd still have to switch between data format (-f*) command options on the two platforms, or suffer significant performance penalties on Unix.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001538.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 05:34PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001538"}
