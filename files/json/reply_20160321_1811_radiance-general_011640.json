The chapter also includes a nice introduction to the software, which is embarrassingly current for having been written in 1998:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/ch1/ch1.pdf\n\n\nAs a short-cut, the tutorial files are also available from:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/ch1/scene0.tar.Z\n\n\nBest of luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011640.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 21, 2016 at 06:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009094", "id": "radiance-general_011640"}
