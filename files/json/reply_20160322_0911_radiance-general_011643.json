{"body": "Hi Abdul,\n\n\nDid you see the two tutorials on this page specifically for new Mac users?\nGiulio and I prepared them 10 years ago when we were training alot of\npeople internally at Arup: http://radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials\n\n\nI know they're dated and sparse, but they still have some useful things.\n\n\nSince you're starting fresh, maybe you could keep a log of important things\nyou've learned and then later write them into a tutorial? No one is paid to\nwrite tutorials for Radiance (okay, i was briefly paid for the genBSDF\ntutorial but ended up spending more time than I was paid for), and the\ncommunity relies on each other to create tutorials. New user tutorials are\nparticularly difficult to write when you have 15 years under your belt\nbecause you can't remember what you didn't know. Maybe you could turn your\nstruggle into gold for a new user?\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011643.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 09:11AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009094", "id": "radiance-general_011643"}
