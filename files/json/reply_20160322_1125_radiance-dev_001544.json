{"body": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as awful as that; Python is a widely-known, widely-used, and well-documented language and freely available.  I worry more about Perl, because it is so easy to create write-only code in Perl and this becomes a maintenance problem.\n\n\nOn the other hand some Unix commands are becoming obsolete. I use awk and csh and wonder how long they will last.  Like languages, computing environments change over time.\n\n\nThe justification for the various interpretive languages is development speed and (mostly) ease of maintenance; one can probably write most things in Python in 1/10th the time it takes to write them in C, and with modern computers so fast, you may never actually have to write the code in C, or at least put that step off for some time.  If your first version is adequate, why fiddle with it?  There is some effort at bridging the productivity gap between compiled and interpreted languages.  Unfortunately that work has not so far reached scientific and engineering computing.  We\u2019re still using FORTRAN for some things!\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001544.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph Fritz", "created_at": "March 22, 2016 at 11:25AM", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001544"}
