I'd be surprised if Windows NTFS has the\nproblem, *but* memory sticks still use a FAT filesystem, so the problem may\nemerge when transporting files on a memory stick. That's a case to test.\n\n\nGreg, I once tried writing all my project scripts in Python. Ultimately I\ngot sick of it and reverted to csh. But for the a-bit-more-than-a-script\nproblems that Schorsh is talking about, Python is an enormous help, making\nthe development process faster and less error-prone. Compared to any shell,\nPython makes it easier to write correct code. Compared to C, python is far\nmore concise, making coding much faster, which is why we don't just use C\ninstead. And, truly, it does not impose the formal requirements that Java\nor C++ does. I wish you would give it another look before deciding it's\nhopeless.\n\n\nAnd back to work with me.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001546.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
