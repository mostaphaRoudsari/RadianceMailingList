{"body": "There absolutely was an issue here, on Windows, when attempting to apply the workflow documented in the 3-phase tutorial Andy wrote, updated with rfluxmtx. For the life of me I cannot recall the specific error, nor can I find my notes on this. But it was related to reading matrices that were output as floats. When using '-faa' (i.e. storing the matrices in ASCII) the problem went away. We punted on this and just standardized on ASCII i/o for all matrix operations, and it's now a real problem with real building models. Would much rather find a solution that allows us to use floats all the time rather than reimplementing an os sniffer to do floats in *nix and ASCII on Windows, for all kinds of reasons. That's about all I have to say on this at the moment but if I can find my notes on this I'll butt-in again.\n\n\n\n\nOn 3/24/16, 10:27 AM, \"Randolph M.

Windows documentation can be amazingly opaque, because MS's technical writers are apparently forbidden from mentioning limitations, and a casual search will get you scads of irrelevant results.\n\u200b\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001551.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 09:44AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001551"}
