I found it very easy to\nslide over to Ruby from Python (and now prefer it), and Ruby's library\nsupport is quite good. I agree it's less well-known, but *because* of\nRails it is indeed far from unknown. Be that as it may, I'm willing to bet\nbig money that this Radiance community has more Python expertise than it\ndoes any other scripting-type language. Python also has a gem of a data\nvisualization library in 'matplotlib'.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001553.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 09:59AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001553"}
