{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nWe should definitely try this again -- as I said, binary matrix files shouldn't be a problem anymore, so long as it has a header with the number of rows and columns in it, so the receiving program knows when to stop reading in data.  You will still have issues with tools like rcalc working on header-less input, so those are the places to look out for in the workflow.  In some cases, we may be able to reformulate things to use rmtxop or add an option to rcalc for number of i/o records.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001554.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 24, 2016 at 10:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001529", "id": "radiance-dev_001554"}
