{"body": "import os\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport tempfile\nimport argparse\nimport subprocess\n\n\n\u200bOn Unix, os, sys, and math are mostly wrappers around libraries familiar\nto you; on Windows, they are often very close in functionality. I don't\nexpect they would be much trouble to your. Tempfile is a little bit more\nconfusing (it is loaded down with security \"features,\" which are mostly\nirrelevant in our work), and argparse and subprocess do require study.\n\n\nThis is, to some extent, the old decision as to use libraries or roll your\nown code. The standard advice is to use libraries for the sake of\nmaintenance, since they are already debugged and documented, but libraries\ncan sometimes load you down with complexities unnecessary to your work.\nOveruse of libraries can weigh your programs down; one can, for instance,\nend up with XML formats when simple text files will do.\n\n\nI am forming some thoughts on the broader issues, but I will wait for them\nto gel before posting them, I think.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001556.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
