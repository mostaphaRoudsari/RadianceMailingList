{"body": "No problems with the gcc binaries on Windows either.\n\n\nI tend to agree with Randolph. This is likely a problem that comes to\nthe surface due to the different memory layout applied by the MS\ncompiler.\n\n\nSo far it only fails when cnt and rcalc are directly connected via\na pipe. When cnt writes to a file, then that file is complete.\nRcalc reading from such a file also procuces correct output.\n\n\nMy previous test cases for cnt only tested very small sequences.\nI've now cranked up those tests (getting the job killed a few times\nby exhausting 6 GB of RAM), and didn't find any problems under those\ntesting conditions.\n\n\nOne of the next steps might be to improvise a \"tee\" program for\nWindows to see what happens to the data in between the two (and\nwhether the problem still persists then).\n\n\nThen I'll have to figure out how I can get the MS debugger to invoke\nsuch a chained pipeline for stepping through the process.\nSo far I could only take a glance when rcalc output was blocked for\nsome reason, so I had time to attach the debugger from the outside.\nBut that only gave me a static picture, which didn't really help.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-25 23:49, schrieb Gregory J.
