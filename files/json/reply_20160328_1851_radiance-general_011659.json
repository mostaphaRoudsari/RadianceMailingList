{"body": "Hi Humberto,\n\n\nAlthough your description of what you are trying to do isn't bad, we really need to see the commands you are using to be of assistance.  In general, a list of commands, and your exact error message are needed.  It also helps if you can make your source files available somewhere, though these may not be needed.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011659.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 28, 2016 at 06:51PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011657", "id": "radiance-general_011659"}
