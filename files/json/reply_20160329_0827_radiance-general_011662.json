{"body": "Galen,\n\n\nHere is something else that might improve the quality of your gridpoint calculations.  I have seen \"-lw 1e-5\" to be inadequate in most daylit spaces.  I usually drop this to around 1e-9 (and using high -ad settings) and get much better results when applying daylight coefficients to sky patches (the results are typically higher).  When using a method where the direct sun is removed from a sky coefficient calculation that includes both sun and sky, to be added in via a third phase, this will generally also avoid the presence of negative numbers in the final results.  You can easily test the -lw setting to see if it makes a difference.  \n\n\nRick Mistrick\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011662.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Richard Mistrick", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "Richard_Mistrick", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011591", "id": "radiance-general_011662"}
