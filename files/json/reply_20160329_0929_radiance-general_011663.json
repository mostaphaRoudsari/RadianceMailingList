{"body": "Hi Greg and Andy,\n\n\nThank you for your responses.\nI have excluded the '-n 8760' argument from the 'dctimestep' call and it\ndoes not raise the \"improper length\" error anymore. However, there is a\ncouple of other errors raised:\n\n\n\n\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.2\nRadiance 5.0.8\nCommand Line Environment: Terminal\n\n\n\n\nCommand:\n\n\n$ dctimestep -if -o hourlypics/back_%04d.hdr viewpics/back_%03d.hdr \\\nbsdf/fullwindow.xml matrices/daylightmatrix.dmx matrices/OakLand.smx\n\n\nError#1\n\n\nfatal - cannot find BSDF file 'bsdf/fullwindow.xml'\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nIn the five-phase method tutorial, there are two BSDF files generated in\n\".xml\" format that are named as \"fullwindow_klems.xml\" and\n\"fullwindow_t45.xml\". There are no BSDF files named \"fullwindow.xml\". So I\nwas wondering which\nBSDF xml file is meant to be in the command?\n\n\nError#2\n\n\ndctimestep: cannot open 'hourlypics/back_0001.hdr' for output.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nI passed \"fullwindow_klems.xml\" instead of \"fullwindow.xml\" just to see if\nthe command would run into any other errors and the given dctimestep error\nabout the hourlypics/ directory is raised. I do not see any directory made\nin any previous steps of the tutorial that is named \"houlrypics\". So I do\nnot understand what the given error is about.\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\nAlireza\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011663.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alireza Hashemloo", "created_at": "March 29, 2016 at 09:29AM", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011653", "id": "radiance-general_011663"}
