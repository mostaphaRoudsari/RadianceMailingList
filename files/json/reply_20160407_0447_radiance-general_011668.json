{"body": "Hi S\u00e9verine,\n\n\nI often use Radiance for performing calculations in the solar range. In\nthat case, I just use grey surfaces (R=G=B=solar reflectance), and ask the\nPerez sky models to give me solar instead of visible Radiance (I think this\nis done using O1 option in the command line).\n\n\nIt is important to notice that these methods will not consider convection\nand far infrared radiation, thus the absorbed-reemited heat will not be\nconsidered.\n\n\nOn the other hand, depending on the geometry of your facade system, it\nmight be worth calculating the BSDF (using genBSDF). Then, the BSDF may be\nimported to Window for estimating solar heat gain coefficient, considering\nconvection and FIR radiation.\n\n\nIf you want to avoid Window, the method used by it to calculate absorption\non each layer is very well documented y two papers by J.H.Klems. Then,\nISO15099 will give you a hint on how to calculate the solar heat gain\ncoefficient from all the information you have at that point.\n\n\nThose three components would allow you, respectively, to:\n\n\n1. Calculate transmission and reflection of each layer (genbsdf)\n2. Calculate absorption on each layer (Klems)\n3. Calculate the inward flowing fraction of the absorbed radiation\n(iso15099)\n\n\nYes... Avoiding windows is hard.\n\n\nBest,\nEl 7 abr. 2016 03:23, \"Achim Geissler\" <achim.geissler at intergga.ch>\nescribi\u00f3:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011668.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "April 07, 2016 at 04:47AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011668"}
