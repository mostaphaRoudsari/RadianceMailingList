{"body": "Yes, there is a -m multiplier option to falsecolor, which defaults to    -m 179    and should equate to lux or cd/m\u00b2. Luminance in cd/m2 is the default label to display luminance unless you give the   -l lux     option for example for illuminance - both related to the 179 lumen/Watt multiplier.\n\n\nHowever for Watts you can use    -m 1    in your options to falsecolor along with    -l W/m2    to change the label to display as W/m2. That is presuming your image is calculated with -i option for irradiance. I don't think people would normally expect to see a Watts based radiance image in W/sr/m2.\n\n\nThis is also presuming the intent of your image takes into account all the shortcomings that Achim noted.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011671.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 07, 2016 at 07:19AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011671"}
