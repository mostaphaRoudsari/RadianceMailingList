{"body": "Achim,\nI would say your answer is an important one to keep in mind, regarding the limitations of any chosen process and how the information will be used. Is the intent for system peak capacity relying on comprehensive energy accounting? Or only relative performance comparison of shading systems where insulation properties would be similar amongst them all?\n\n\nI\u2019m not an expert in the software you listed (ESP-r, EnergyPlus, IDA-ICE, TRNSYS, etc.), but I do suspect some or all of them may have limited accuracy in angular dependent complex fenestration. By my guess they might be able to do reasonably well at comprehensive energy modeling of a simple overhang or external light shelf. But if you have a custom designed louver system you may get more accurate direct radiation calculations using Radiance. However if it\u2019s important for your intentions, you would certainly need some other energy modeling tools to consider the bigger picture of heat transfer (insulation, etc.).\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011674.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 07, 2016 at 08:26AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011674"}
