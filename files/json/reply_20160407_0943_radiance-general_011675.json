{"body": "Christopher,\n\n\nthanks for the \u201cheads up\u201d. I retracted because the original question was towards \u201csolar factor\u201d (I assume SHGC) of facades, not actually \u201cwhat happens in the space behind the facade\u201d as far as my second, somewhat closer reading revealed. As you write, the programs mentioned by me originally are less adept in giving detailed answers to this question (with the possible exception of ESP-r, which can be used as kind of a non-building-focused \u201cphysics toolkit\u201d).\n\n\nSo, to my understanding the goal seems to be a tool to calculate SHGC of facades with (complex) shading systems. However, as SHGC includes secondary heat flux (re-distribution of absorbed solar radiation), I am not quite sure how Radiance can really help, here. Therefore my support of Germ\u00e1n / ISO 15099 (e.g. WIS has been shown to give good agreement with measurement results for ventilated double facades with venetian blinds in the facade gap). Also, e.g. in the U.K. it became increasingly normal a few years ago to include framing / panels in facade-SHGC values. Therefore possibly the Physibel products.\n\n\nI agree that the central question of interest should be clarified in detail first. And I would also hesitate to think it realistic to actually develop a new tool that has any advantage over one of the available ones. But, then, I\u2019m quite out of programming and am not up to date to current development speeds possible.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011675.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "April 07, 2016 at 09:43AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011675"}
