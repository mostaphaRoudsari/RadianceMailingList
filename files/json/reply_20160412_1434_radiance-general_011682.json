{"body": "Thanks. I didn't think to light the screen, duh, despite just having read\nthat piece of the man page multiple times. To save recalculation I will\nprobably start using \"-b 750\" or \"-b 1000\" instead, which is about five\ntimes the brightness of your typical LCD.\n\n\n For the annual glare evaluation using DGP, I've developed another method...\n\n\n\n\nHave you published this method yet?\n\n\nIf you expect, that the contrast between task (e.g. if the 25cd/m2 are\n> \"real\" and people would adapt to this level) and background (e.g.\n> 1000cd/m2) is a problem, then I'm afraid that none of the existing glare\n> metrics will detect that properly\n\n\n\n\nOuch! Yes, that makes sense.\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011682.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
