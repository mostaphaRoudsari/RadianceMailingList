{"body": "I started using Ruby because the SketchUp API is in that language, and I\nthink it is a great language with thousands of freely available modules,\ntutorials, documentation, etc. It also allows multithreading, which is\nawesome.\n\n\nSome people say it is slow, but since I usually mix Ruby with Radiance, the\nslowest parts are always due to the ray-tracing process (increasing\nperformance on the script will reduce the run time very little).\n\n\n\n\nI understand a lot of people uses Python, though... I have not been able to\nget used to that language.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n2016-04-12 22:35 GMT-03:00 Chris Jones <cj at enersave.ca>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011685.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 05:18AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011685"}
