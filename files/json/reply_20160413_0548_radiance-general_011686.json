{"body": "I'm under the impression that people choose programming languages based on\nthe APIs that make them necessary. Projects that allow us to start from\nscratch using any language of our choosing are quite rare once we move past\nthe level of a school homework assignment.\n\n\nI use C# for Rhino/Grasshopper, 3ds Max, and Autocad plug-ins, Ruby for\nSketchUp, C for Radiance programming, and good old DOS and Bash for\nRadiance scripting because those are the languages supported and/or\nlanguages used in others' work that I've adapted. For small projects that I\nreally can start from scratch, I use Java because it's the first language I\nlearned.\n\n\nMy two cents on this thread: Pick the language that is appropriate to your\nproject, not the language that you've heard is \"popular\".\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 13, 2016 at 8:18 AM, Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain <germolinal at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011686.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nathaniel Jones", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 05:48AM", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011686"}
