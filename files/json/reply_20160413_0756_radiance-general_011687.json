SketchUp's API is Ruby, so the OpenStudio team exports the C++ codebase to Ruby too, and that's how our internal scripts or \"measures\" are written. Prior to that though, I used Python, at Schorsch's urging (this goes all the way back to 2003). Still using bash too though. For stats and dataviz, I'm trying to use R and JavaScript libraries, but also fall back on Excel/VBA because I know it. R is great for large datasets though. If I was still doing a lot of Python, I imagine the same could be accomplished with matplotlib/numpy though. Nathaniel said all of this more succinctly. I'm out!\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011687.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 07:56AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011687"}
