{"body": "For a trivial example of transposing a matrix tab delimited data file... which of these is most easily understood, reproducible, and fastest. Also note, I couldn't find a working Ruby example...\n\n\n\n\nperl -anF'\\t|\\n' -e'$n=@F-1if!$n;for(0..$n){push@{$$m[$_]},$F[$_]} END{print map{join\"\\t\",@$_,\"\\n\"}@$m}'\n^^ this takes a quarter of a second on 148K file, and doesn't look particularly clean but I could probably figure it out by researching the documentation\n\n\npython -c \"import sys; print('\\n'.join(' '.join(c) for c in zip(*(l.split() for l in sys.stdin.readlines() if l.strip()))))\"\n^^ this takes half a second on 148K file but looks a bit baffling to me\n\n\nawk '{for (f=1;f<=NF;f++) col[f] = col[f]\":\"$f} END {for (f=1;f<=NF;f++) print col[f]}' | tr ':' ' '\n^^ this takes 2 seconds on 148K file which isn't very good, but probably the easiest to interpret by eye, in my opinion\n\n\nruby -e 'puts readlines.map(&:split).transpose.map{|x|x*\" \"}'\n^^ I couldn't make this or any other Ruby examples I found online work, which might mean I have a basic misunderstand of how to type this in a single line workflow on the terminal. And all the examples I could find look like a black box to me because apparently there are functions built in to do this task.\n\n\necho '' >tmp1;  cat m.txt |while read l ; do paste tmp1 <(echo $l | tr -s ' ' \\\\n)>tmp2; cp tmp2 tmp1; done\n^^ this series of commands is basically disqualified because it takes far too long\n\n\n\n\nTaken from these threads:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1729824/transpose-a-file-in-bash\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3249508/transpose-in-perl\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011690.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 10:01AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011690"}
