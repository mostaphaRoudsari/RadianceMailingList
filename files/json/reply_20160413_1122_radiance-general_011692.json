{"body": "I would agree with a lot that's been said so far. My two cents:\n\n\nPick the language that's best for the project at hand, not one you just\n\"know\".\n\n\nFor me, a quick script is best written in Python (I'm very familiar with\nsyntax/semantics of the language), but if I'm starting a \"real\" project, I\nwould look at the tasks needed to be done and how best to do them (e.g.\navailable data structures, API's, object oriented or not) then look at\ndifferent languages, first the ones I know, then even check out others.\n\n\nSometimes, however, with larger projects where speed is starting to be a\nconcern, you need to pick languages based on computation. For example, C\nand Fortran are much faster than say Matlab for large matrix manipulation.\n\n\nThis is a very DEEP topic, which some EECS/CS people spend their whole\nlives answering.\n\n\nGood luck in your projects!\n\n\n- Alex Mead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 13, 2016 at 9:05 AM, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011692.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alex Mead", "created_at": "April 13, 2016 at 11:22AM", "created_by": "Alex_Mead", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011692"}
