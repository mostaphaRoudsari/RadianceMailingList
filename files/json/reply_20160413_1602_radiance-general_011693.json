{"body": "Oh, my! I wasn't trying to start a \"Which language is best\"\ndiscussion, truly, I wasn't.\n\n\nPersonally, in participating in a large long-standing research,\nengineering, or design community I'm inclined to stick with the common\nlanguages of the community, at least when I can afford them.\n(Autodesk, I'm looking at you.) So that was the basis of my question;\nwhat would fit in in this community? The answer, so far, seems to be\nthat there are multiple communities of Radiance users who use varied\ntools. Hunh. Some tools that aren't being spoken for here: I know\nthere are people using MATLAB with Radiance, for instance, and none of\nthem have spoken up.\n\n\nI'm surprised that higher-level tools aren't getting any play in this\ndiscussion; things NumPy, SciPy, and SciRuby. Why, after all, write\nyour own transpose routine when you can download a tested one, and\nalso get a tested package that includes more difficult operations like\ninversion and calculation of eigenvalues? Perhaps only Greg and Andy\nand a few others need the really fancy math here?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011693.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Randolph M.
