{"body": "Follow up question:\n\n\nUsing gendaylit rather than the gensky sky generator we have additional \n-O options. -O 1 for W/m^2/sr solar radiation.\n\n\n    /From the gendaylit man page:\n    The output can be set to either the radiance of the visible\n    radiation, the solar radiance (full spectrum) or the luminance.\n    //*-O*//[0|1|2] (0=output in W/m^2/sr visible radiation (default),\n    1=output in W/m^2/sr solar radiation, 2=output in lm/m^2/sr luminance)./\n\n\nLooking at the source code it appears the -O 0 option divides \nilluminance by 179 whilst the -O 1 and -O 2 don't. I couldn't see how \nthe units are outputted from gensky (in relation to the 179 multiplier) \nto allow me to compare it to the gendaylit options.\n\n\nOne might assume that the -O 0 option would be set to similar units as \nthe gensky generator.\n\n\n From this confusion what multiplier should be used with the falsecolor \nprogram when using gendaylit options 0, 1 and 2 remembering that \nfalsecolor has the default -m 179?\n\n\n(I all cases I would be using the rpict -i option and looking for units \nin W/m^2)\n\n\nRegards\n*Terrance McMinn*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011695.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Terrance McMinn", "created_at": "April 14, 2016 at 04:21AM", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011695"}
