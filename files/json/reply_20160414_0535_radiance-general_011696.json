{"body": ">From my understanding,\n\n\n   1. -O0 will give you a Perez Sky... similar to the Gensky output, but\n   using a diferent sky model. This model does not need to be told if the sky\n   is overcast or clear. It will figure that out itself.\n   2. -O1 will give you the Perez Sky but with for the solar spectrum (i.e.\n   solar radiation calculation)\n   3. -O2 is something that I wonder why is there.\n\n\nIf you want your output on Watts (or any energy unit), you should use a\nmultiplier of 1. For Lighting units (lux, cd, lumens) you need a multiplier\nof 179.....I do not usually make pictures... but I hope the few I have done\nwere correct.\n\n\nBest.\n\n\n2016-04-14 8:21 GMT-03:00 Terrance McMinn <t.mcminn at ocpms.com.au>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011696.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "April 14, 2016 at 05:35AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011696"}
