{"body": "To further expand on the multiplier question\u2026 here\u2019s my interpretation to be corrected if anyone understands differently\u2026\n-O 0 would give Watts of energy within the visible spectrum in the sky model, and apply the default 179 multiplier to convert to lumens in any outputs.\n-O 1 would give Watts of energy across the full solar spectrum in the sky model, and typically would have to set a multiplier of 1 to keep Watts in any outputs.\n-O 2 would give lumens of energy in the visible spectrum in the sky model, and you would have to set a multiplier of 1 to keep that in any outputs. I agree I\u2019m not sure why to do this instead of the default 179 multiplier.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011697.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 14, 2016 at 11:47AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011666", "id": "radiance-general_011697"}
