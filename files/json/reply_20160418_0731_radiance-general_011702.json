{"body": "Schorsch, Thanks! Precisely the type of response I was trying to poke for. I threw something together in a few minutes from a quick google search just to steer the conversation. I certainly didn't do much quality comparison, and zero thinking about if any of these are really the right way to do it. My primary note is that we can debate the optimal, but the collective mental barriers and user-group predisposition, and size or quality of searchable online resources should be considered. I'm not the best person to consider them since I have very little depth in any language, but just noting to keep novices like me in mind. I honestly don't know if those make a case for any one language, but I felt compelled to add my two cents - since everyone else was talking about APIs which I have no concern for.\n\n\nI always wish that threads like this one gave me more definitive suggestions for putting more effort in any one language (which, of course, is asking too much!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011702.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 18, 2016 at 07:31AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011702"}
