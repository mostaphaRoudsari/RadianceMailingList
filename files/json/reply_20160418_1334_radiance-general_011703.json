{"body": "The \"definitive suggestions\" you're hoping for will always necessarily\nbe highly subjective. If you want help deciding which language to\nlearn next, you'll have to ask more specific questions.\n\n\nMy personal preference is no secret. Now the discussion here (and on\nradiance-dev) has prompted me to finally have a much closer look at\nRuby than before. Unfortunately, that hasn't really improved my\nopinion about it...\n\n\nBut is that relevant to you? Since I don't know what you're actually\nlooking for, I have no idea.\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-04-18 16:31, schrieb Christopher Rush:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011703.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 18, 2016 at 01:34PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011703"}
