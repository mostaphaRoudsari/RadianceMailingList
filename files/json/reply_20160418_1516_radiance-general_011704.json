{"body": "I had recently been assuming python would become our go-to for data manipulation based on popularity, but I'm learning that shouldn't be my assumption within the Radiance community - which I bet was Randolph's original intent in this thread.\n\n\nMaybe I'll attempt Ruby for the next solution I need to sort out.\n\n\nFor me personally, I'll probably never really \"learn\" any of these, I'll just Google search snippets to cobble together whatever I need - but only when bash can't do it well and the internet can present a better solution   : )    I suppose I could say I've \"learned\" bash because I've examined enough snippets and written enough from scratch for multiple years, but unless I attempted to abandon bash and tried to do all of my six-scripts-per-year in python/ruby/etc I'll remain a newbie in each one.\n\n\nSorry - didn't mean to hijack the thread - just throwing in an extra perspective. I don't really need any specific guidance at the moment.\n\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011704.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 18, 2016 at 03:16PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011683", "id": "radiance-general_011704"}
