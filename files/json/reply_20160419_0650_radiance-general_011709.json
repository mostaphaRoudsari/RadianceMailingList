{"body": "Hi\n\n\nIn the framework of an european project done several years ago, I built monthly and annual mean sky models using gensky and some additional home made programs. You may read about this in the report available here (especially chapter 3.2.1):\nhttps://multidoc.eia-fr.ch/record/396?ln=en\n\n\nThe stuff I developed is still working properly but I cannot distribute it because no proper documentation is available. However if you need, I could provide you with such sky models (as radiance scene files) for a few locations.\n\n\nRapha\u00ebl Compagnon\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011709.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Compagnon Rapha\u00ebl", "created_at": "April 19, 2016 at 06:50AM", "created_by": "Compagnon_Rapha\u00ebl", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011706", "id": "radiance-general_011709"}
