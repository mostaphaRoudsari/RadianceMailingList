{"body": "Update:\nIn the report mentioned earlier, the same MS person now said that an \nupdate\nof the universal CRT will probably be rolled out at around the same time\nas the \"anniversary update\" of Windows 10 this summer. After that, I \nexpect\nwe can use VS 2015 without further problems.\n\n\nIn the mean time, I have modified the SCons build system so that you can\nselect the version of Visual Studio to use. The current default is\n   MSVC_VERSION=12.0\nwhich selects VS 2013 (better don't try to understand their numbering).\n\n\nThe binaries created that way pass all the currently available tests,\nincluding the ones I explicitly added to catch the text pipe CRT bug.\nThose tests shove large amounts of data through both text and (all types\nof) binary pipes, and currently do so without a hitch.\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-03-28 02:03, schrieb Gregory J.
