{"body": "I\u2019m not sure about the first one, but your problem about X server :0.0 is possibly because the value for your DISPLAY number in your regular terminal doesn\u2019t match your DISPLAY number in X11. I\u2019ll give you some advice based on how it works on a Mac, but your mileage may vary. Open an X11 terminal window (for Mac I do this from the Applications/Utilities folder) and type:\n\n\necho $DISPLAY\n\n\nCheck what number is returned. If you\u2019re the second user on the machine to start X11 it\u2019s probably :1.0  so go into your regular terminal window and type\n\n\nexport DISLAY=\u201d:1.0\u201d\n\n\nTo make a more permanent solution you could make such an entry in your .profile or .bash_profile shell login/startup file. You might have to change it each time you restart your machine if your users log in by different order each time you restart (the DISPLAY values are assigned sequentially). You\u2019re probably best off googling this or getting more expert advice specific to your system. But I could try help if you don\u2019t find a clear solution.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011715.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 07:15AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011713", "id": "radiance-general_011715"}
