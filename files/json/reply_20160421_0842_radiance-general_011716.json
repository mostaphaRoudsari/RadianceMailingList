{"body": "Interesting. Chris Rush gave a number of things to look at regarding the X11 issue; as for the \"unknown object type\" error, could you post a link to some of these scene files you're trying to look at, so I can try to replicate the problem? Also, what version of the NREL installer did you use?\n\n\nOn 4/21/16, 3:07 AM, \"Paul\u00edna \u0160ujanov\u00e1\" <paulina.sujanova at stuba.sk<mailto:paulina.sujanova at stuba.sk>> wrote:\n\n\nHello,\n\n\nplease I need help. Whenever I run objpict or objview or rvu, I get the same warning each and every time:\nrpict (or rvu accordingly): warning - unknown object type \"ashik2\"\nThis error repeats no matter what I try to preview, a simple chair or a more complex model.\nThe preview than is/is not produced - I was not able to identify the trigger.\n\n\nI am new to Radiance (and Linux). I got aware of this problem since I reinstalled Radiance from the NREL Radiance releases (I did this because I realised I was missing some files).\n\n\nIf I do understand it well, ashik2 should be an anisotropic BRDF model, describing the appearance of a material, and it is a calculation model - so \"something built in\".\n\n\nPlease, how do I fix the problem? Can please someone explain what went wrong?\n\n\nI also get an X11 error.\nXIO: fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server \":0.0\"\n\n\nThis was already once discussed on the mailing list, but was not somehow resolved. I have tried to upgrade the graphic card driver, but with no impact. Please, did someone solve this?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nPaul\u00edna\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011716.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "April 21, 2016 at 08:42AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011713", "id": "radiance-general_011716"}
