{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nThe Ashikhmin-Shirley reflectance model is a kind of anisotropic Phong model made physically plausible.  It's main advantage over the standard anisotropic model in Radiance is that it includes a Fresnel modifier, which I use for perfectly smooth surfaces.  Best to read their original paper:\n\n\n\twww.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/papers/jgtbrdf.pdf\n\n\nI added this model to Radiance a few years back with help from Nicolas Bonneel, as we were trying to run some comparisons.  Peter Apian-Bennewitz also had requested it, so it seemed worthwhile to add.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011719.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 22, 2016 at 08:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011713", "id": "radiance-general_011719"}
