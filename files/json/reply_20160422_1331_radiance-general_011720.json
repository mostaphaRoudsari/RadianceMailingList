{"body": "Very interesting, thanks.\n\n\nMy conclusions go like this:\n\n\n* The useful range of the exponents seems to be between 0 (fully\n   diffuse and 10000 (mirror-like). Between 5 and 100 looks like the\n   most interesting range.\n\n\n* To create a plastic-like appearance, the specular reflection should\n   be desaturated.\n\n\n* For a metallic appearance, the specular and diffuse reflections\n   should have a similar tint.\n\n\nRemaining questions:\n\n\n* What happens when specular and diffuse colors are vastly different?\n   I'm expecting something rather psychedelic... Do actual materials\n   like that exist?\n\n\n* Do the diffuse and specular color values depend on each other?\n   Eg. should their sum be less than 1?\n\n\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-04-22 17:10, schrieb Greg Ward:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011720.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Georg Mischler", "created_at": "April 22, 2016 at 01:31PM", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011713", "id": "radiance-general_011720"}
