{"body": "Yes, unlike the other Radiance materials, you need to consider the sum of specular and diffuse components to determine whether you are within physical limits.  The standard \"plastic\" and \"metal\" (likewise \"plastic2\" and metal2\") simply make a binary choice between colored and uncolored highlights.  The \"ashik2\" type allows you full control.  I don't know what materials this is useful, however.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011721.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 22, 2016 at 02:15PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011713", "id": "radiance-general_011721"}
