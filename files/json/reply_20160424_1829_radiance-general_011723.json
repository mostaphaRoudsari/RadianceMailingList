{"body": "Hmmm...  I guess it reflects about 22% more light, because of the way the specular reflectance reduces the effective diffuse reflectance in plastic2.  The total reflectance is about (1-.26)*.56+.26 for plastic2, and simply 0.56+0.26 for ashik2.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011723.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 24, 2016 at 06:29PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011713", "id": "radiance-general_011723"}
