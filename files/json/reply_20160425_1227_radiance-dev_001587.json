It was probably calibrated decades ago\nwith a much less powerfull graphics system (despite me trying it on an\nonboard graphics module with Mesa in software mode).\nThe mouse wheel moves the view back, no matter which way it is turned.\n\n\nWhy isn't this used more often?\nFor one, all the tutorials instruct new users to use rvu (not sure\nif glrad is actually ever mentioned). So many people probably don't even\nknow it exists.\n\n\nThe user interaction is also a bit limited in comparison.\nWith smoother motion, more motion options (eg. lateral and vertical),\nand configurable speed, it probably could be quite popular.\nOf course, those things might be somewhat fiddly to implement.\n\n\nBut the good news for now: it *does* work on Linux!\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-04-25 04:05, schrieb Gregory J.
