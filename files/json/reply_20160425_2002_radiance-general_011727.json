{"body": "You will need to use a spreadsheet or custom program to add together illuminance values rather than pcomb, which is for images.  As for computing the dimming levels to achieve the desired illuminance on the work plane, that's a linear optimization problem that shouldn't be too hard to solve using least-squares or similar, but I don't have a ready-made tool to help with that.  Again, Excel or Matlab might be useful for that.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011727.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 25, 2016 at 08:02PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011725", "id": "radiance-general_011727"}
