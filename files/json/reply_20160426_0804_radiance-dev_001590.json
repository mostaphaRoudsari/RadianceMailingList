{"body": "I don't know how to get to the mouse wheel events from X11, so I'm not using that information.  The '+' and '-' keys affect zoom as stated in the man page, but the arrow controls are also not standards in X11 as far as I know, so I'm not listening for those.  If you have some insight on how to handle such events, I can try, but we might confirm first that people use this utility or have a desire for it.  The controls were designed to mimic those in rholo, which I and perhaps a handful of others still use.\n\n\nI don't remember how I light the objects -- I think it tries to use the light sources, specular and diffuse materials, etc.  You would have to look in the src/common/rgl* routines.  There are no cast shadows (or interreflections, obviously).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-April/001590.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 26, 2016 at 08:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001585", "id": "radiance-dev_001590"}
