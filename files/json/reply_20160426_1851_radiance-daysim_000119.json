{"body": "Picking this thread back up on the mailing list to present the solution:\n\n\nFirst of all: Please check https://github.com/tbleicher/su2rad/releases for\nupdates to the su2rad exporter. The current release is 2014.0.0.\n\n\nThe problem is not with su2rad but with DAYSIM and its limited\nunderstanding of the Radiance scene file format. The errors messages\n\n\n\u201cCannot find files:\n\n\n\u2026\\radiance\\medium\n\n\n\u2026\\radiance\\ambfiles\\untitled1.amb\n\n\n\u2026\\1)\u201d\n\n\n\n\nshow that DAYSIM interprets instructions for 'rad' like AMBFILE etc as\nscene files. Some documentation on how to import Radiance files\nsuccessfully would be useful.\n\n\nThe way how I managed to do it in the end is this:\n\n\n\n\n   - Open Daysim and create or open a project\n   - Use the geometry import option to import **.mat, *.rad, *.sky* files\n   - Select the *'materials.rad'* file from the su2rad export folder and\n   click the *'Add'* button. (The file will be listed in the box).\n   - Select the scene files from the* 'objects'* directory one by one and\n   click the *'Add'* button each time.\n   - When all files are added to the list, continue with the import. Daysim\n   will now convert the materials and geometry.\n\n\n\n\nThis will only work if the scene has been exported 'by material' or 'by\nlayer'. A nested export of SU groups and components will not work. IIRC the\n'daysim' option in su2rad was created to provide a 'flat' single file\nexport option that simplifies the import into Daysim but I have to check\nthe source again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 15, 2016 at 4:40 AM, Marzena Husser <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-April/000119.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "April 26, 2016 at 06:51PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000118", "id": "radiance-daysim_000119"}
