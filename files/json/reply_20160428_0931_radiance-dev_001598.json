{"body": "Yes, agreed 100%.  If you are serious about geometry preview, you are certainly better off with rshow.  I wrote glrad only because it was low-hanging fruit at the time, having written all this OpenGL stuff to support rholo.\n\n\nThat said, I have added listening for the mouse wheel, and glrad will now zoom in response.  The rholo drivers will ignore it, rather than responding inappropriately, since zooming doesn't really make sense in that tool.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-April/001598.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 28, 2016 at 09:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001597", "id": "radiance-dev_001598"}
