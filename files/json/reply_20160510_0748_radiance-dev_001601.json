{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nYes, \"MLIB\" was probably not the best choice of environment variable, and there are more standardized vector graphics formats around these days.  The reason behind these choices is mostly historical.  When I developed this format circa 1984, there wasn't much else around other than the plot package, which wasn't very capable and wasn't portable across architectures.  At the time, I was relying on CP/M as well as Unix, and dot matrix printers for most of my output, so I rolled my own solution.\n\n\nIf you have a good, cross-platform alternative that wouldn't require much work or additional dependencies, we could certainly look into replacing this, but I've found it difficult to come up with something easier than just maintaining what we have.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-May/001601.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 10, 2016 at 07:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001599", "id": "radiance-dev_001601"}
