So far the only executable that depends upon X11 support we've attempted to support is rvu. Since the main benefit of you going through all the trouble to move csh scripts to Python is the Windows support, perhaps we should sort this out. =)  I think this is one more reason to look at a standard vector format.\n\n\nOn 5/10/16, 1:18 PM, \"Sarith Subramaniam\" <sarith at psu.edu<mailto:sarith at psu.edu>> wrote:\n\n\nHi Rob,\n\n\n\n\nI am using the win64 version of 5.0.a.10 that I found here: https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases.
