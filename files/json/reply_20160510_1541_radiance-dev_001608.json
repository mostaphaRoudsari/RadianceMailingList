{"body": "Ah, I didn't remember that the history of meta files goes that far back.\n\n\nIf I understand it right, the primary purpose of the package is to\ncreate diagrams from tabular numerical data. Its functionality is almost\ncompletely independent from the rest of Radiance, with mgf2meta as the\nlonely exception that actually processes Radiance specific data.\n\n\nCompared to more \"friendly\" ways to create diagrams (spreadsheets,\nstatistical software), the current approach has the following\nadvantages:\n\n\n- simple implementation\n- included in the distribution\n- scriptable within pipelines\n- no thirdparty dependencies\n\n\nThe disadvantages:\n\n\n- limited output connectivity (conversion is currently only possible\n   into Windows bitmaps, targa, and postscript).\n- limited graphics resolution (2^14 units), possibly not accurate\n   enough for large format high resolution output\n- limited graphics capabilities (no curves, only 5 colors)\n\n\nSo what we're looking for would be a diagramming toolkit with more\nflexibility on the output side, and not too many other disadvantages.\n\n\nThe least invasive solution would be to simply add a few converters,\neg. meta2svg or meta2pdf. This would at least widen the path to\ndownstream processing.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if we ignore mgf2meta, we could use pretty much any\nopen source diagramming tool out there that we like. There will be\nnothing that is \"preinstalled everywhere\" though, the topic is simply\ntoo diverse for that.\n\n\nIn between, using eg. SVG as an internal format might be an option.\nWriting is easy, since we have very simple content. Reading is slightly\nmore involved, even when we're restricting it to our self-generated \nfiles.\nBut then we already have ezxml in the distribution, so it might actually\nbe manageable.\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-05-10 16:48, schrieb Gregory J.
