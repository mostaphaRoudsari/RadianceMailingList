{"body": "Indeed, the metafile tools were dragged into Radiance at some point I wanted to be able to script things like plots and diagrams when doing data analysis, and it was just more convenient.  They have very little in common with the rest of Radiance, though they were the first appearance of the .cal language in tools like bgraph.\n\n\nWe can pipe the output of psmeta to ps2pdf or similar.\n\n\nHow is SVG supported on different systems?  I hadn't heard of it before.  Can you just send output to a web browser, or ??\n\n\nAs I said, these tools have been no effort for me to maintain for many decades, so unless we really need better vector output for some reason, it's not that big a deal to write a converter to SVG or PDF if that's all we're talking about.  On the other hand, it wouldn't be that difficult to replace it as far as Radiance is concerned -- I would still use it for automating plot generation, since I've no way to pipe data to Excel.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-May/001609.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 10, 2016 at 04:00PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001599", "id": "radiance-dev_001609"}
