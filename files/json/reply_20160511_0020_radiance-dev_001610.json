Now, my internship ends soon, that's why I'm writing to you; I would be grateful if you have any suggestion about what is wrong with my batch file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\n\nSeverine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-May/001610.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S\u00e9verine HUET", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 12:20AM", "created_by": "S\u00e9verine_HUET", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001698", "id": "radiance-dev_001610"}
