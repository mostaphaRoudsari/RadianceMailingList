{"body": "So the plot files are really cal files?\nOr just a very similar, but subtly incompatible variation thereof?\nThe documentation sometimes talks about \"plot files\", and sometimes\nabout \"graph files\". Are those the same?\n\n\n\n\nSVG has pretty much become the standard for vector graphics on the web\n(and elsewhere, such as scalable icons in Linux GUIs). All modern\nbrowsers can render it. As an XML format it may even be embedded \ndirectly\nin the HTML of a web page. Pretty much all other relevant and up-to-date\nvector graphics software understands the format. The most popular free\ntool for editing seems to be Inkscape.\n\n\nThe format has several advanced capabilities that most people rarely\nuse, if at all, and would probably be irrelevant to us (eg. styling with\nexternal css, animation with Javascript). A file containing a diagram\nwith some lines, fills, and text can actually be very straightforward\nand simple. There are also defined subsets of the format (eg. \"SVG \nTiny\"),\nprimarily intended for mobile use.\n\n\n\n\nAs long as nobody complains eg. about output resolution, it's clearly\neasier to keep working with meta files internally for the moment.\nBut then, it would still be nice if we could simplify things a bit.\nIs there really still a need for pexpand? And I'm not quite sure\nwhat psort is good for to begin with.\n\n\nSince those tools are not used anywhere else, wouldn't it make sense to\nditch $MLIB, and simply use $RAYPATH/meta instead?\n\n\nThe documentation also mentions (usually under \"see also\") a number of\nmanpages that either never existed or have been removed:  graph(1G),\nplot(1), plot(5), plotout(1), primout(3), t4014(1), mx80(1), impress(1).\n\n\nAnd last (for the moment): Looking at the manpage, it appears that\nplotin(1) has a very similar if not identical purpose as bgraph(1).\nWhat am I missing there?\n\n\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-05-11 01:00, schrieb Gregory J.
