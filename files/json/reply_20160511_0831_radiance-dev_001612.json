My sense is that your system is not set up to execute .exe files without explicitly calling them as such. The genBSDF script calls xform on line 150 (note the lack of the '.exe' or any kind of operating system-specific conditional), and if it fails to run the script generates the error you are seeing.\n\n\nI think there's something you can set up in Windows to automatically try appending \".exe\" (and \".bat\" and .com) to any program calls on the command line, but it has to be set up, I guess.\n\n\nOn 5/11/16, 1:20 AM, \"S\u00e9verine HUET\" <S.HUET at vs-a.eu<mailto:S.HUET at vs-a.eu>> wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING: At least one of the links in the message below goes to an .exe file,\nwhich could be malicious.

Now, my internship ends soon, that's why I'm writing to you; I would be grateful if you have any suggestion about what is wrong with my batch file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\n\nSeverine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-May/001612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "May 11, 2016 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001698", "id": "radiance-dev_001612"}
