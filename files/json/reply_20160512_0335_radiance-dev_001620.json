I wrote the entire directory path just to compare...\nSo, I rewrote the batch file as following :\n\n\nSET PATH=.;C:\\Radiance\\lib;C:\\Radiance\\bin;$RAYPATH;$PATH \nSET RAYPATH=.;C:\\Radiance\\lib;C:\\Radiance\\bin;$RAYPATH \nc:\ncd C:\\VSA_SolarFactor\\test160428_01\\\n\n\n\n\nobjview  blind1.rad\npause\ngetbbox  blind1.rad\npause\nxform -e blind1.rad > blind2.rad\npause\ngenBSDF +f +b -c 500 -geom inch blind1.rad > blind1.xml\npause\n\n\n\n\nEvery program work well, except genBSDF.\nAs you mentioned it, Robert Guglielmetti, something wrong is going under the hood with xform. That is why I have tried to run xform, as written in genBSDF.pl file line 149, and it works well providing blind2.rad. \n\n\nWould you advise me to run genBSDF.pl file instead of genBSDF.exe ? I am quite beginner and tried to but I guess I didn't enter the right command line...\n\n\nIs there something wrong in my files ? They are located in C:\\VSA_SolarFactor\\test160428_01\\\nMy files are :\n\n\n---------blind1.rad ------\n\n\n### blind1.rad\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5 0.7 0.7 0.7 0 0\n\n\n!genblinds white blind1 1 3 4 4 20 | xform -rz\n\n\n----- And blind2.rad provided by xform -------\n\n\n# xform -e\n### blind1.rad\n\n\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5                0.7                0.7                0.7                  0                  0\n# xform -rz -90 -rx -90 -t 0 0 -0.939693\n# genblinds white blind1 1 3 4 4 20\n\n\nwhite polygon blind1.1.0\n0\n0\n12\n                  0                0.5          -0.939693\n                  3                0.5          -0.939693\n                  3     0.842020143326 -3.79214000201e-007\n 5.75395780114e-017     0.842020143326 -3.79213999979e-007\n\n\nwhite polygon blind1.2.0\n0\n0\n12\n                  0                1.5          -0.939693\n                  3                1.5          -0.939693\n                  3      1.84202014333 -3.7921400009e-007\n 5.75395780114e-017      1.84202014333 -3.79213999868e-007\n\n\nwhite polygon blind1.3.0\n0\n0\n12\n                  0                2.5          -0.939693\n                  3                2.5          -0.939693\n                  3      2.84202014333 -3.79213999979e-007\n 5.75395780114e-017      2.84202014333 -3.79213999757e-007\n\n\nwhite polygon blind1.4.0\n0\n0\n12\n                  0                3.5          -0.939693\n                  3                3.5          -0.939693\n                  3      3.84202014333 -3.79213999979e-007\n 5.75395780114e-017      3.84202014333 -3.79213999757e-007\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance,\nSeverine\n\n\n-----Message d'origine-----\nDe\u00a0: radiance-dev-request at radiance-online.org [mailto:radiance-dev-request at radiance-online.org] \nEnvoy\u00e9\u00a0: jeudi 12 mai 2016 10:10\n\u00c0\u00a0: radiance-dev at radiance-online.org\nObjet\u00a0: Radiance-dev Digest, Vol 110, Issue 5\n\n\nSend Radiance-dev mailing list submissions to\n\tradiance-dev at radiance-online.org\n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-dev\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n\tradiance-dev-request at radiance-online.org\n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\n\tradiance-dev-owner at radiance-online.org\n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of Radiance-dev digest...\"\n\n\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n   1.
