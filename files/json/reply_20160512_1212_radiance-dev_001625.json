{"body": "Just checked the SuSe installation DVD:\nBesides gnuplot there's also a gnu plotutils package containing\n\"libplot\" and commands like \"plot\", \"graph\", etc.\nNot installed by default, but with a deeply nested package\nproductivity/graphics/visualization/graph.\n\n\nSo it evidently still exists in some form or other.\nWhich probably also means we should keep \"plotin\" and the related\nmanpage references around for another while. There's even a\n\"plotout\" still sitting in the attic...\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nAm 2016-05-12 19:37, schrieb Randolph M.
