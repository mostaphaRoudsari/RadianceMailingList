{"body": "Hi Prudhvitej,\n\n\nThe rcontrib calculation proceeds differently from rtrace, since it cannot use the indirect irradiance cache.  Therefore, the -aa setting is overridden in rcontrib to \"-aa 0\" and the rest of your parameters should change to compensate.  Try the following settings instead of the -a* settings you have for rcontrib:\n\n\n\t-ab 2 -ad 50000 -lw 1e-5\n\n\nThe -lw setting is important to change so that all the initial samples get sent.  Your results may still change a little from run to run, but they should resemble the rtrace results more closely.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011733.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 16, 2016 at 11:13AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011725", "id": "radiance-general_011733"}
