{"body": "Hi Paola,\n\n\nYou can save a falsecolor representation from Photosphere by unchecking the \"Save in HDR\" box in the dialog that comes up.  It doesn't save the scale, however, so it is not very useful.  It is better to download Radiance and use the falsecolor tool.\n\n\nI don't know the answer to your hdrscope question.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2016-May/000575.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 16, 2016 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000574", "id": "hdri_000575"}
