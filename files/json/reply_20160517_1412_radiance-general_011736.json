{"body": "Thanks Greg,\n\n\nbsdf2klems is doing what I wanted perfectly but bsdf2ttree is doing\nsomething a little weird.  I used t4 just so I could view the output with\nAndy's BSDF viewer and when I run it with the defaults the \"front\" in the\nBSDF viewer (which i think is made from +backward with bsdf2ttree) looks\ngood, but when I include +forward the \"back\" transmission is too high.\nThis does not happen with the klems bsdf.\n\n\nThe hemispherical transmission for a normal ray is 75% for both klems\ndirections and ttree front, but ttree back is 91.6.  Any idea whats going\non?  I can probably get around this by paying attention to surface normals,\nbut I am looking at a multi layered assembly where I expect backface\nreflection and transmission to matter.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nStephen\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011736.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stephen Wasilewski", "created_at": "May 17, 2016 at 02:12PM", "created_by": "Stephen_Wasilewski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011734", "id": "radiance-general_011736"}
