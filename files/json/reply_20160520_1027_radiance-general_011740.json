{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nin the mean time, I have been experimenting quite a bit and the problem seems to have been that my approaches weren\u2019t actually really identical (the stupid part). This is what I did:\n\n\n\n\nSetting up:\n\n\n# Assemble gendaylit command line components\nmonth='6'\nday='21'\ntime=\"12\"\ndatetime=\"$month $day $time\"\nlat='47.5'\nlon='-7.6'     # west +, east -\nmeridian='-1'  # \"hours diff from UTC\", west +, east -\ndiffhor='334'\ndirnorm='541'\nmer=$(echo $meridian |rcalc -e '$1=$1*15')\nradiation=\"$dirnorm $diffhor\"\n\n\n# Build command lines ...\n# ... for gendaylit / -O 1 is solar spectrum, -O 0 is visual spectrum\ngdlcmd=\"$datetime -a $lat -o $lon -m $mer -W $radiation -O 1\"\n\n\n# ... for gensky\ngskcmd=\"$datetime -a $lat -o $lon -m $mer -B $diffhor\"\n\n\n# and for genskyvec\n#gsvcmd=\" \"\ngsvcmd=\"-c 1 1 1\"\n\n\n\n\nNow use:\n\n\n# Generate sky description with gendaylit and generate sky views\nskyvec=$(gendaylit $gdlcmd | genskyvec $gsvcmd -m 1)\necho $skyvec > gendaylit_vec.skv\n\n\n# Now generate sky with gensky and repeat view generation\ngensky $gskcmd | genskyvec $gsvcmd -m 1 > gensky_vec.skv\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 that was were I wrote below initial post. Now, if I either do\n\n\ngendaylit $gdlcmd | genskyvec $gsvcmd -m 1 > gendaylit_vec.skv\n\n\ndirectly or \u201cindirectly\u201d write the gensky-based output via \u201cskyvec=$(\u2026\u201d both approaches behave the same, after all. However, with the \u201cindirect\u201d procedure, I end up with a single line. Luckily, I have found a way to re-order the data via sed (long live the net!).\n\n\nIs there a logical explanation, why the \u201cEOLs\u201d get lost for the \u201cindirect\u201d procedure?\n\n\nThanks.\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011740.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "May 20, 2016 at 10:27AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011738", "id": "radiance-general_011740"}
