The issue arose due to my trying to use a perl script from Wouter (found it in the archive from last December) and this script required the vector data to come in the \u201ctriplet lines\u201d format.\n\n\nwhile ( <$fh> ) {\n  my @a = split /\\s+/;\n  push @sky_patches, ($a[0]*0.265+$a[1]*0.67+$a[2]*0.065);\n}\n\n\nBy and by, I got the script up and running (thanks, Wouter).\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011742.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "May 20, 2016 at 11:56AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011738", "id": "radiance-general_011742"}
