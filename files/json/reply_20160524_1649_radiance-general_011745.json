{"body": "Stefan,\n\n\nThe only major change to rcontrib I know of was the addition of extra\ndetails in the header, but you're not writing the header so that can't be\nthe problem. The only thing I can think of is that there are some\ndifferences in shell tools between BSD and Linux, so perhaps test seq and\ntr independently to make sure they are doing what you expect. Other than\nthat I don't know what could be happening.\n\n\nNow that you're using a recent version of Radiance instead of the for loop\nyou could use a single inline rmtxop command like this:\n\n\ncat $sensors | rcontrib -I -fo @scene.opt -ab 4 -ad 100000 -lw 0.000004 -y\n$numsensors -e MF:1 -f reinhart.cal \\\n    -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m sky_glow -w scene.oct | rmtxop -c 0.265 0.67 0.065\n- > $sensors_vec\n\n\njust make sure you define $numsensors as your number of sensors.\n\n\nAs for settings to consider, if you're interested in specular reflections\nyou probably want to set -st 0. And you'll probably need to reduce -lw\nfurther to something lower than your facade reflectance divided by ad\nsetting. For example, if your facade VLT is 5% it would have to be less\nthan 0.05/100000=0.0000005 or 5e-7 (you currently have 4e-6).\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, May 23, 2016 at 5:32 AM, Stefan Bohren <stefan.bohren at stud.unibas.ch\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011745.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "May 24, 2016 at 04:49PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011744", "id": "radiance-general_011745"}
