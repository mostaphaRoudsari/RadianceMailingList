{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nsorry to be somehow seemingly rubbing you the wrong way - I can't remember\nyou ever telling anybody else simply to \"give up\" :o( . It is definitely not\nintentional (and I may note here that I am not a native English\nspeaker/writer).\n\n\nThe formatting was O.K. with html mail format. Whatever.\n\n\nThe Photosphere stuff was simply to try to give some information on the HDR\nin respond to your statements in regard to same (kind of \"prove\" that it is\nactually a Radiance readable HDR ...).\n\n\nThe comments on orienting the HDR are noted. I accept that if I do it right,\nit should be correct  ;o)\n\n\nI wasn't planning to rewrite genskyvec.pl, but you have me confused on how I\nshould \"prepare a sky file it will accept\" - which is clearly my goal -\nwithout understanding at least partially how it works / what the data flow\nis / what it needs.\n\n\nActually, the number of the warnings increased significantly and no result\nwas obtained. With skyfunc_hdr a (not very useful) result was generated with\n\"some\" identical warning messages.\n\n\n@Andy: Incidentally, this is in regard to one step before tackling genskyvec\nagain, I am trying to generate a view of a scene via \"sky_glow source sky\"\nbased on the HDR ... the scene has a ground plane, but does have a \"hole\"\nbetween this and the sky (which works with \"normal\" skies). I'll try your\nsuggestion for the sky definition, thanks!\n\n\nSkymap.cal is\n\n\nu = 1 - (0.5 + DDx *r);\nv = 0.5 + DDy *r;\n\n\nr = if(DD, 0.707106781*(sin(acos(DDz)/2))/DD,0);\n\n\nDD = sqrt(DDx*DDx + DDy*DDy);\n\n\nDDy = Py*norm;\nDDx = Px*norm;\nDDz = Pz*norm;\n\n\nnorm = 1/sqrt(Py*Py + Px*Px + Pz*Pz);\n\n\n\n\nI'll go back to RWR again and see what I can learn.\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\nVon: Greg Ward [mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com] \nGesendet: Mittwoch, 1.
