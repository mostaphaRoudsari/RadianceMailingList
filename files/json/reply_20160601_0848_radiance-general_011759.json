{"body": "Hi Andy,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat worked like a charm, thanks! The .cal file I was using originated from a source using \u201cspecific\u201d fisheye lenses \u2026 hmm.

I'll try your\nsuggestion for the sky definition, thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, I didn't realize it was a cal file issue. Have you considered using fisheye.cal? It is distributed with the radiance auxiliary files (get them here:http://radiance-online.org/download-install/radiance-source-code/un-official-head-version look in here: ray/lib/fisheye.cal). Here's how I use it, which I found somewhere else along the way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid colorpict skypict\n\n\n11 red green blue sky_image.hdr fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 180\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskypict glow skyglow\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n4 1 1 1 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskyglow source sky\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011759.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "June 01, 2016 at 08:48AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011747", "id": "radiance-general_011759"}
