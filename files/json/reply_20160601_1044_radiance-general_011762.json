{"body": "Hi Achim,\n\n\nI apologize for being snippy in my response.  It must be because I am feeling a little out of depth on this topic, myself.  I am glad that Andy and others are willing to help, as they know more about it than I do.\n\n\nIt does help when you provide example inputs, commands you have run, and what was unexpected about your results.  Too many questions without specifics can be overwhelming.  If your mail was sent as HTML, it got stripped before getting to me.  I think our mailing list manager may be to blame.  Best just to compose in standard text format.\n\n\nTo create a sky that genskyvec will accept, it should be sufficient to take the output of gensky and replace the skyfunc definition with your colorpict modifier.  I don't think it cares about the primitive type (i.e., \"brightfunc\" versus \"colorpict\").\n\n\nI agree that you should not use skymap.cal, which assumes local geometry.  A hemispherical source will not set the Px, Py, and Pz variables properly.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011762.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 01, 2016 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011747", "id": "radiance-general_011762"}
