{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nall clear, thanks.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m rolling. The basic problem was that I had tried to be too smart and combined the angmap.cal from Paul Debevec with the one from Coralie Cauwerts and ended up with the Px, Py and Pz that, as you write, are not set for a \u201csource\u201d (a fact that I will try to understand, by and by). Now genskyvec has no problem with my HDR skies both with \u201cfisheye.cal\u201d and a corrected \u201cmap_sky.cal\u201d. Perfect. Now the actual work can begin ;o)\n\n\nThanks for your time, Greg and Andy!\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\nP.S: I assume I will be back at some point, though \u2026\n\n\nP.P.S.: @Andy: terrestriallight looks very interesting!!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011763.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "June 01, 2016 at 01:00PM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011747", "id": "radiance-general_011763"}
