{"body": "Hi Santiago,\n\n\nGiulio kindly shared his tutorials and I haven't gotten around to putting them onto radiance-online.org, mostly because I don't know how to modify the website anymore since it was updated.  However, I have uploaded this particular tutorial for you to:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/giulio_mirror.tar.gz\n\n\nHowever, this is really a situation that didn't occur to me, where you have indirect rays coming from the opposite side.  I see now that I should modify a test in the m_mirror.c routine to account for this case.  I will send you a modified version of this file in hopes that you can rebuild and test it for me.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011771.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 03, 2016 at 01:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011769", "id": "radiance-general_011771"}
