{"body": "Hi Kynthia,\n\n\nThe corrected version of this command sequence is:\n\n\n\t(getinfo < capture.hdr  | sed 1a\\\nEXPOSURE=$ecorr ; getinfo - < capture.hdr) > calibrated.hdr\n\n\nIt's important to put the backslash immediately after the 'a' with no spaces for this to work.  This puts the EXPOSURE= line on the second line of the header, instead of after it.\n\n\nThe following will create a \"slighly wrong\" header that will still work -- this is what I usually do:\n\n\n\techo EXPOSURE=$ecorr  > calibrated.hdr\n\tcat capture.hdr >> calibrated.hdr\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011777.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 07, 2016 at 08:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011749", "id": "radiance-general_011777"}
