{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for proposing a solution so quickly - much better than my clumsy attempts at grep!\n\n\nHowever, my calibrated image still has very low luminance values (< 1.0L) This makes sense: as I read from the File Format document in the Radiance references, the EXPOSURE variables in the header are cumulative, so I am essentially dividing all my values by 178 (which is my $ecorr). Am I doing the conversion (set ecorr=`ev \"179*$img_val/$meas\"`) incorrectly? :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your help once again,\n\n\nKynthia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011778.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chamilothori Kynthia", "created_at": "June 08, 2016 at 04:41AM", "created_by": "Chamilothori_Kynthia", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011749", "id": "radiance-general_011778"}
