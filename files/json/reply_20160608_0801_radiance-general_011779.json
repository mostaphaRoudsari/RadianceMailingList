{"body": "Hi Kynthia,\n\n\nI suppose it depends on how you obtained your $img_val.  If you read it using pcomb (without -o option), then your exposure correction is correct.  If you read it from ximage using the 'l' command or similar, then it was already multiplied by 179 and you should leave this factor off.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011779.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 08, 2016 at 08:01AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011749", "id": "radiance-general_011779"}
