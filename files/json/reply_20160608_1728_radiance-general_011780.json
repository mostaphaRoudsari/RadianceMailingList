{"body": "To continue this conversation, I found a demonstration\n<http://nljones.scripts.mit.edu/hdr/> I made a while back of the same\nsource jpegs used to create HDR files with three different softwares for\nWindows (Photosphere, Bracket, and Picturenaut). The page is made using a\nneat little javascript export from Picturenaut. As you can see from the\nhistograms, the three images are nearly (but not quite) identical. As I\nrecall, the Photosphere image looked the smoothest in falsecolor.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Mon, May 30, 2016 at 9:09 AM, Chamilothori Kynthia <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011780.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nathaniel Jones", "created_at": "June 08, 2016 at 05:28PM", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011749", "id": "radiance-general_011780"}
