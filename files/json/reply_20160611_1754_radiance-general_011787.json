{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nIt's difficult to tell from your e-mail which program is failing and why.  Can you send me a private message with your input file, and the list of commands that isn't working for you?  There's no built-in assumption about the number of records in gendaymtx, but maybe the workflow you're using has such an assumption.  Either that, or we have a bug to fix.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011787.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 11, 2016 at 05:54PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011786", "id": "radiance-general_011787"}
