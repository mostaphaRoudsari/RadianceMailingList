{"body": "Hi Rioboo,\n\n\nIt helps when you give a specific example.  What is your material definition, and what is it doing that disagrees with your expectations?\n\n\nThe mirror material will ignore its modifiers in the case when you have given an alternate material type.  This will be called instead when viewed directly.  The modifiers to the mirror itself will only be used for calculating the virtual source contributions.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011790.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 12, 2016 at 04:30PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011789", "id": "radiance-general_011790"}
