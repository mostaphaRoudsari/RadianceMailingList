{"body": "Hi Rioboo,\n\n\nYour bat file only creates a single rendering with a single solar position.  In fact, I don't understand the output, which looks much darker than it should be for direct solar illumination.  Are you rendering different solar angles?  Can you do it with a simpler test case, like a single piece of glass with your mirror parallel to a diffuse surface that does not face the sun?  If you ran that at different solar incident angles, the value divided by the cosine of the incident angle (to account for grazing sunlight) should follow the Fresnel approximation you are using.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011794.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 13, 2016 at 12:44PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011789", "id": "radiance-general_011794"}
