{"body": "Randolph,\n\n\nThat was my suspicion, and I was also guessing that applying the modifier\nto the alias could perhaps work, but I had not tested it. It is great that\nyou can confirm it! It now makes sense, but I wonder if it would just be\neasier if aliases could inherit modifiers, unless Greg thinks it is not\nappropriate. I would personally think it would be more intuitive.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nRioboo\n\n\nI believe you need to apply the \"inherit\" modifier to the alias, otherwise,\nindeed, the alias will not inherit the original material's modifier.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011797.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "goodriver laurus", "created_at": "June 14, 2016 at 06:45AM", "created_by": "goodriver_laurus", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011789", "id": "radiance-general_011797"}
