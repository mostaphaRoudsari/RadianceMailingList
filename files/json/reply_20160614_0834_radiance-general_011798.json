{"body": "You are both correct.  Applying the original modifier to the alias works, as does using the \"inherit\" tag.  One of the purposes of alias'es is to \"pull out\" a material (or modifier) definition to use with (or within) a different modifier chain.  The \"inherit\" tag was added later on to simplify alias management when all you wanted to do was essentially reassign materials.  If that's what you want alias'es for, then just get in the habit of using \"inherit\" in your work.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011798.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 14, 2016 at 08:34AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011789", "id": "radiance-general_011798"}
