{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nWhile it's generally a bad idea to have reflectances (or transmittances) greater than 1 or less than 0, Radiance does not restrict you to this range.  In fact, if you are rendering colors from another (wider gamut) color space, such coefficients are sometimes necessary.  However, the Y sum (expressed by your R*0.265 + 0.67*G + 0.065*B equation) should stay between 0 and 1.  If you have an eyedropper that yields values outside this range, then it is not producing usable colors.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011805.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 04:43AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011803", "id": "radiance-general_011805"}
