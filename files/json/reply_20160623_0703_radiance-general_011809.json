{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for your answer. I am already forcing the \"Y sum restriction\", which\ncan be easily done by scaling everything... I assume that rendering colours\nfrom \"a wider gamut\" does not make any physical sense? (i.e. a 60%\nreflective black surface?). What would not be a \"wider gamut\", though? any\ncolor within the RGB triangle in the chromaticity diagram?\n\n\n..... I have very little idea of what I am talking about..... sorry if I am\nspeaking nonsense\n\n\n2016-06-23 8:43 GMT-03:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011809.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "June 23, 2016 at 07:03AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011803", "id": "radiance-general_011809"}
