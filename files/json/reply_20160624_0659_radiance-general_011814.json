{"body": "Thanks, Greg and Mark for your answers!\n\n\nI studied this more, and decided not to follow Mark's procedure. Groundhog\nis meant to be a Lighting tool, thus I do not really want to offer \"very\nunscientific\" methods... I guess I will keep the eyedropper and colorpick\njust for SketchUp representation. By default, the Radiance material will be\ngray (based on just the reflectance), unless the user decides otherwise.\n\n\nWould it be a problem if I mixed gray and non-gray materials in the same\nmodel? I mean... I might know the RGB transmittances of a glass, but only\nthe reflectance of my carpet. Will that induce errors?\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2016-06-23 13:35 GMT-03:00 Mark Stock <mstock at umich.edu>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011814.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "June 24, 2016 at 06:59AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011803", "id": "radiance-general_011814"}
