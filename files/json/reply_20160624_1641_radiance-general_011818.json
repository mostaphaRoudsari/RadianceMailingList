{"body": "Hi Jiajie,\n\n\nAll Radiance materials that have a purely diffuse component send diffuse sampling rays.  This is true as well for the \"rough specular\" components of \"plastic\" and \"metal.\"  In addition, rays are sent to sample light sources for their contributions for diffuse and rough specular components.  The \"glass\" and \"mirror\" types do not have any diffuse or rough specular component, however.  They send a single ray in the reflected (and another transmitted for glass) directions, paying no special attention to sources.  This is true of the \"dielectric\" type as well, and there are others that would require individual answers.\n\n\nThe ultimate reference is of course the C code provided, but there is also a PDF describing the basic material behaviors:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\n\nUnfortunately, some of the math formatting is messed up and may be difficult to read or print.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011818.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 24, 2016 at 04:41PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011815", "id": "radiance-general_011818"}
