{"body": "Dear Andy,\n\n\nI have one more question about this part of your reply:\n\n\n*The relative weight of specular vs. diffuse rays is a result of the\nmaterial applied to the surface. if you use a plastic material such as\nbelow (with 15% diffuse reflectance, 35% specular reflectance, and 0.05\nroughness):*\n\n\nHow do you get the value: '*5% diffuse reflectance, 35% specular\nreflectance, and 0.05 roughness' *from the setting of 'specular weight 30%\nand diffuse weight 70% after reflection'.\n\n\n*void plastic test70-30*\n*0*\n*0*\n*5 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.35 0.05*\n\n\n*then the specular rays will account for 30% of the final ray value and the\ndiffuse rays will account for 70% of the final ray value.*\n\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n\nCheers,\nMengdi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011821.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mengdi Guo", "created_at": "June 27, 2016 at 07:21AM", "created_by": "Mengdi_Guo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011801", "id": "radiance-general_011821"}
