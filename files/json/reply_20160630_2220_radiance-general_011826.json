{"body": "Hi Violeta,\n\n\nUnfortunately, the command-line tools in Radiance are difficult to use if you are not used to them.  I am not sure what options Axel Jacobs uses for WebHDR, but you can try the following:\n\n\n\tfalsecolor -s auto -i input.hdr | ra_tiff - falsec.tif\n\n\nThis will result in a linear luminance scale.  If you want a log scale with 1000:1 range (10^3:1), use:\n\n\n\tfalsecolor -log 3 -s auto -i input.hdr | ra_tiff - falsecl.tif\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, you can download Photosphere, which has a more familiar application GUI from:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011826.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 30, 2016 at 10:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011823", "id": "radiance-general_011826"}
