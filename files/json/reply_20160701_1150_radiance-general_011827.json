{"body": "Hi Andrei,\n\n\nThis probably belongs on the radiance-general list, since it's not really a code issue.  I am cross-posting there.\n\n\nThere may be something amiss with your Mockup_Lamp_BeamPattern.dat file to brightdata.  How did you create this file, and what values are in it?\n\n\nI don't know why this would affect the colors, unless there is clipping going on in your rendered images.  This could just be a magnitude issue.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011827.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 01, 2016 at 11:50AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011828", "id": "radiance-general_011827"}
