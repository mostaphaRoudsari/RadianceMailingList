{"body": "Mark! That is awesome!\n\n\nI've been playing around with 360 stereo renderings in Radiance too. I use\ngoogle cardboard and created an rcalc command for generating view rays\nbased on this:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/jump/rendering-ods-content.pdf\nI was planning to present some of my renderings at the workshop in August.\nBut your video puts my renderings to shame!\n\n\nEarlier this week I was looking at image.c to see what it would take to add\nnative support for equirectangular view types, including both mono and\nover-under stereo. I think the awkward part would be specifying the pupil\nspacing for stereo renderings. I think we could use the length of the\ndirection vector for pupil spacing, but this would prevent adding depth of\nfield blur.\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011830.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 01, 2016 at 01:51PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011824", "id": "radiance-general_011830"}
