It'd be great if you shared your method to the list!\n\n\nNote that the Samsung Internet movie player (for playing YouTube\nmovies on GearVR) expects your movie data to fill the 16:9 frame,\notherwise it won't map correctly. The Oculus player (for movies\ndownloaded to your phone+GearVR) is a little smarter, though, and will\nplay both 3840x1920 (2:1) or 3840x2160 (16:9) just fine.\n\n\nMark\n\n\nOn 7/1/16, Andy McNeil <mcneil.andrew at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011832.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "July 01, 2016 at 02:21PM", "created_by": "Mark_Stock", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011824", "id": "radiance-general_011832"}
