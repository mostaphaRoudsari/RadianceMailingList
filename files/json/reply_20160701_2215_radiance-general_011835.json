{"body": "Hi Ruggiero,\n\n\nIf you have ground surfaces in your model (which you should - it's good\npractice) you should still use the first value in gendaymtx. The\ncontribution from your ground surface will be included as reflected light\nfrom sky patches. But, the gap between your ground surface and the horizon\nis filled in with the ground patch luminance from gendaymtx. This is\nillustrated by figure 7 & 8 in the three phase tutorial (though the advice\nis also relevant for daylight coefficient simulations):\nhttp://radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jul 1, 2016 at 9:52 PM, Ruggiero Guida <ruggiero.guida at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011835.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 01, 2016 at 10:15PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011834", "id": "radiance-general_011835"}
