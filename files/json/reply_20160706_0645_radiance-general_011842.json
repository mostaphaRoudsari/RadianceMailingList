{"body": "Julien,\n\n\nA while ago I saw THESE SLIDES\n<https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day2/Mardaljevic-Electrochromic.pdf/view>by\nJohn Mardaljevic... maybe they can help you.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the method I would choose for simulating electrochromic\nglass would be using Daylight Coefficients. It may take longer (depending\non the number of windows and states you want to simulate), but it will\nconsider the true specularity of the glass (BSDFs used in the 3-phase\nmethod will not allow that).\n\n\nWhat I often do is to perform a DC simulation for every state of the office\n(I usually work with simple offices with a small amount of windows), and\nthen use a script or spreadsheet to select what is the state at each hour.\nThe calculation of the state of the window at each hour will depend on the\ncontrol strategy...\n\n\nI hope this helps\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2016-07-06 7:03 GMT-03:00 Julien Boutillier <boutillier at estia.ch>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011842.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "July 06, 2016 at 06:45AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011841", "id": "radiance-general_011842"}
