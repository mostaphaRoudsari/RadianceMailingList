{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nIn one of my simulations, I got Max_Lum as 8047776.5. I expected  Max_Lum to be maximum of the luminance of all the pixels in the image, on a brightest sunny it could be 120000 lux, but how is this value higher than the later? Let me know if this variable  means some thing different. I am using version 1.17\n\n\nFrom Yesterdays questions, What does Indirect vertical Illuminance  mean(Is this the effect of Background Luminance)? does this satisfy the equation E_vert=E_dir+E_indir ? where E_indir is Indirect vertical Illuminance.\n\n\nI could find some docs which explains Lveil_cie but i am not clear. What does its value signifies? Similarly with Eglare_cie\n\n\n\n\nThanks & Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011843.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Raghuram Kalyanam", "created_at": "July 06, 2016 at 06:59AM", "created_by": "Raghuram_Kalyanam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011837", "id": "radiance-general_011843"}
