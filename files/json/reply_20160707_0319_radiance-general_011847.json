{"body": "Hi Mark,\n\n\nthis is absolutely fascinating, thank you very much for joining the video and also your procedure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI just tested it with a current project (no video just a rendering) and it is amazing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOne thing that came up. My rendering seems to be mirrored about the vertical axes. That means left and right is switched. Pflip does the job, no problem. But I am just curious, maybe I did something wrong.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis is my command:\n\n\ncnt 3000 3000 | rcalc -f 3d360.cal -e \"XD=3000;YD=3000;X=62.854;Y=29.687;Z=7.1;IPD=0.02;EX=0;EZ=0\" | rtrace -ab 3 -x 3000 -y 3000 -n 12 -af pano_ambs_ol -fac T1_ol.oct > Pano1_ol.hdr\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nX, Y an Z is the Position of the Head. And I did not change anything in the 3d360.cal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the iPhone I use the Mobile VR Station and there I use the 3D Spherical Top/Bottom Playback Type.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany thanks and best regards\n\n\nMartin Klingler\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011847.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Martin Klingler", "created_at": "July 07, 2016 at 03:19AM", "created_by": "Martin_Klingler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011824", "id": "radiance-general_011847"}
