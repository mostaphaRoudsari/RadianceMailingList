{"body": "Hi Giuseppe,\n\n\nI've had mixed feedback with the linux version of BSDFViewer. And since I\ndon't have the hardware of knowledge, I can't debug and fix whatever is\ncausing mixed results. I'm sorry, but I don't think I can offer any help\nbeyond what has already been posted. It seems like your libraries installed\nproperly and something is going wrong after the values are returned for the\nBSDF query.\n\n\nFor this reason I'm planning to remove support for tensor tree in the Linux\nversion when I get around to the next update. Tensor Tree support may be a\nMac only feature in upcoming releases.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 14, 2016 at 5:07 AM, Giuseppe De Michele <giudm.87 at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011855.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "July 16, 2016 at 04:38AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011850", "id": "radiance-general_011855"}
