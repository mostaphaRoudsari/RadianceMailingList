I have been playing a bit with RFLUXMTX with the purpose of implementing multi-phase methods for Tubular Daylight Devices,  but I am getting the error shown in the title of this e-mail.\n\n\n\"RCONTRIB: Warning - partial accumulation in final record\"\n\n\nI am using the command:\n\n\nrfluxmtx -ab 3 -ad 512 -lw 1e-3 ./TDDs/4-TDD.top ./Skies/white_sky.rad ./Materials/materials.mat ./scene.rad ./Windows/windows.rad > ./DC/4-TDD-sky.mtx\n\n\nThe content of the files is specified below my signature.\n\n\nAny idea what might be happening? I have seen that this happens \"sometimes\" (even for the same command)... is it a memory issue? user error? should this be in the developers list?\n\n\nI AM USING NREL's x64 WINDOWS BINARIES\n\n\nThanks in advance to all!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere  4-TDD.top file is\n\n\n#@rfluxmtx h=kf u=Y\nvoid light lens_mat 0 0 3 1 1 1\n\n\n lens_mat     polygon    4370_4\n0\n0\n72    1.45    1.3414213562373087    3.34\n    1.49    1.373205080756887    3.34\n    1.54    1.3    3.34\n    1.59    1.39    3.34\n...\n\n\nand white_sky.rad is\n\n\n#@rfluxmtx h=u u=Y\nvoid glow ground_glow\n0 0 4     1 1 1 0\n\n\nground_glow source ground\n0 0 4     0 0 -1 180\n\n\n#@rfluxmtx h=r1 u=Y\nvoid glow sky_glow\n0 0 4     1 1 1 0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0 0 4     0 0 1 180\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-August/011867.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 05, 2016 at 08:03AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011866", "id": "radiance-general_011867"}
