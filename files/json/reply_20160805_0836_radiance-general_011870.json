{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nAs you can see, rcontrib is passed binary data from rfluxmtx (-fda), and we have seen issues with this on Windows in the past, but I've been told it's no longer a problem.  The best way to test is to temporarily replace the rcontrib command with something that captures the input to a file, so we can check that it's the right length.  In Unix, you would do this with an executable shell script like the following and call it \"rcontrib\":\n\n\n:\ncat > /tmp/saved_data.bin\n\n\nOn Windows, you might need to write a Perl program.  Just make sure it's something that correctly captures binary data without doing anything to it.  Then, make sure the file contains 145*10000*6*8 bytes in it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-August/011870.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 05, 2016 at 08:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011866", "id": "radiance-general_011870"}
