{"body": "Hi Daniel,\n\n\nI'll leave aside the question of why you are using rtrace in a 3-phase calculation, and just address the error you are seeing.\n\n\nAlthough the ambient cache code has changed substantially since version 4.2, this particular error does not seem related to those changes.  I would guess that this is either a problem with the system you are running on not maintaining good local file locks, or it was just a hiccup in the system that if you remove the ambient file and start again will simply go away.  So, that's what I would try first, and if you get the error again, remove the ambient file once more and run with cores=1.  I can't imagine a circumstance where you would see the error after that, but if you had to take it to -n 1 to get the problem to go away, that means your NFS lock manager is broken on your operating system.\n\n\nLet us know how it goes!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-August/011875.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 08, 2016 at 09:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011874", "id": "radiance-general_011875"}
