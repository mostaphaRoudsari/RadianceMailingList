Forward raytracing is done  \nwith the mkpmap utility as a prerequisite to using the usual  \nrpict/tracte/rvu, supplying the photon map file with the -ap option.\n\n\nGood luck,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"END OF LINE\" [MCP, 1982]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-August/011876.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "August 08, 2016 at 09:22AM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011872", "id": "radiance-general_011876"}
