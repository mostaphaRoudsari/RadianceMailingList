{"body": "Hi Abigail,\n\n\n-for the solar transmissivity you can use the same equation.\n\n\n-the pts-file does not contain the information about the sensor type. If \nyou want to change that manually, you have to do that in the header \nfile. Syntax please see here: \nhttp://daysim.ning.com/page/keyword-output-units . If you have hundreds \nof points, I recommend to write a script generating for you this entry \nin the header-file.\n\n\n-I haven't used the new version of DIVA yet, so maybe someone else can \nanswer this question more detailed. I know you can go two approaches, \neither you define a node in W/m*m and run an annual simulation with \ndaysim OR you run an irradiation map with /gencumulativesky /,but I'm \nnot sure where to invoke the latter one in the new version.\n\n\ngood luck!\nJan/\n/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-August/000129.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "August 11, 2016 at 04:06AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000128", "id": "radiance-daysim_000129"}
