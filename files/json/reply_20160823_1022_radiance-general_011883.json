{"body": "Hi Terrance,\n\n\nGlad you sorted it out.  Another trick that works and is slightly more efficient is to create a \"partial octree\" containing your scene except building, then add to it, i.e.:\n\n\n\toconv -f materials.rad Scene1.rad > octrees/frozen-site.oct\n\toconv -f -i octrees/frozen-site.oct Building1.rad > octrees/building1-site.oct\n\t(make a second version of building)\n\toconv -f -i octrees/frozen-site.oct Building2.rad > octrees/building2-site.oct\n\n\nThe above will work without the -f option, also, if you want your octree files to be a little smaller and you don't plan to move them about.  Adding geometry to an existing octree can be much faster than rebuilding the whole thing from scratch.  The one caveat is that your new geometry must fit entirely within the bounding box of the original geometry.  If it will not, you can use the -b option in the first oconv to specify a bounding volume that encompasses everything.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-August/011883.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 23, 2016 at 10:22AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011881", "id": "radiance-general_011883"}
