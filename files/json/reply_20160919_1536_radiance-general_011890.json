{"body": "Hi Wouter,\n\n\nDid you create a Klems or a tensor tree representation of your perforated material?  Are the perforations on a rectangular or hexagonal grid?\n\n\nIn either case, I suspect you want your \"up\" vector as specified by the 3rd-5th string arguments of your \"BSDF\" primitive to be the Z-axis (0 0 1) rather than the Y-axis (0 1 0).  The latter is more appropriate when the surface is aligned in the X-Z or Y-Z plane.  Although your lamellas curve, so long as they do not curve to a vertical orientation, and +Z up vector should work for you.\n\n\nThe main problem, however, is that you should set your thickness to 0 and don't give front & back surfaces.  Front and back surfaces are only appropriate when you are creating \"proxy geometry\" for the BSDF.  Here, you are intending the BSDF to substitute for the real geometry, not just serve as a proxy for it.\n\n\nYou could of course create a full model with perforated lamellas and run it through genBSDF without this extra step.  That might even be more accurate, though I appreciate the challenges with creating perforated, curved geometry using commonly available tools.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-September/011890.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 19, 2016 at 03:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011889", "id": "radiance-general_011890"}
