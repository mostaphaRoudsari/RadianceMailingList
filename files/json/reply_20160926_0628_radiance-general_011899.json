{"body": "Dear Andy,\n\n\nI've got two more questions about Radiance.\n1) I'm using only 'light' type of source for rtrace operation, the output\nof which contains a lot of rays that didn't hit the source in the end.\nLoading the ray information of such output takes a long time. I'm curious\nif it's possible to export only valid rays that connects receivers with\nsources through radiance operation?\n\n\n2) Another question is about the specular rays and diffuse rays. Is it\npossible to specify specular ray from diffuse ones via Radiance operation?\nOr have you already counted the energy distribution of these two types of\nrays via cosine law in Radiance?\n\n\nThank you very much for your help.\n\n\nCheers,\nMengdi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-September/011899.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mengdi Guo", "created_at": "September 26, 2016 at 06:28AM", "created_by": "Mengdi_Guo", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011801", "id": "radiance-general_011899"}
