{"body": "Hi Wen-Hsin,\n\n\nWhat is a \"shadow range image?\"  Can you send a URL with some examples?  As near as I can tell from a Google search, it is just an average image, which is similar to the sum of images you would get from pcomb with multiple HDR inputs and no special arguments.  You could also generate an image of minimum values, where anyplace a shadow fell at any time would appear dark.\n\n\nThe pcomb tool can combine HDR images in many different ways.  You have not shown how you are currently using this tool (the exact command) or what output you are expecting versus what you are getting.  This is essential information for anyone to help you with your problem.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-September/011901.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 30, 2016 at 11:33AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011900", "id": "radiance-general_011901"}
