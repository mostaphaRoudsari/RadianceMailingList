You can try\npcond with a linear response function (pcond -l input.hdr > output.hdr) to\nbring the bright values back into a range where you can identify details in\nthe shadow.\n\n\nA more advanced setup for this type of image is to create images with hard\nshadows (low -ab values and -av of 0 0 0). You can extract the shadow\nportion of these images as a difference to a base image. Then you add up\nall the shadow-only images and overlay that as a last step over a rendering\nwith soft shadows to show the geometry. In this last step you can also\napply a color tint to the shadow image to make it stand out against the\nbackground.\n\n\nI don't know if there is a ready-to-use script out there to do all of these\nsteps. I expect it will take a bit of tinkering to find the right\ncombination of commands and command line arguments for your purpose.\n\n\nHth,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011903.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 01, 2016 at 05:52AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011900", "id": "radiance-general_011903"}
