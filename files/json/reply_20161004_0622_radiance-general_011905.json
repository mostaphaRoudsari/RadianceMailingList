Open a terminal and type\n\n\nwhich rpict\n\n\n\n\nIf it comes back with a path like /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/radiance/bin\nyou are already set to use Radiance. The RAYPATH variable is not strictly\nnecessary but some scene setups expect it to be available.\n\n\nA general discussion about setting environment variables in Mac OS (or the\nprevious versions) is here:\n\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/603785/environment-variables-in-mac-os-x/4567308#4567308\n\n\nIt's a few years old by now but I think most of this still applies. If you\nare new to the Unix shell environment you can use this introduction to\nsetting variables:\n\n\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2015/07/28/set-enviornment-variables-mac-os-x/\n\n\nPlease note that you can damage your user profile with these changes, which\ncould make it impossible to the terminal to clean up the mess. If you are\nnew to this you should ask around if someone has experience with Mac OS or\nLinux and ask them to assist you. You can set up a second user and try your\nmodifications in that profile first. If it get's damaged you can just\ndelete it. In any case, make a backup!\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011905.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 04, 2016 at 06:22AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_009094", "id": "radiance-general_011905"}
