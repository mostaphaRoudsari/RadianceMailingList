{"body": "The NREL (Mac) installer does not set them for you, sorry.  Andy McNeil used to have a YouTube video that showed exactly how to set these env vars, specifically for Radiance, but I can't find it. There are definitely links in the radiance-general archives.\n\n\nI would definitely recommend setting the RAYPATH env var. Some of the Radiance internals rely upon it too, I believe \u2014 it's not just certain scenes.\n\n\nHere is what I put in my .bash_profile for Radiance to work; if you install Radiance with the NREL installer and don't change the default install location, these are the paths you want. :\n\n\n## Radiance path crap\nexport PATH=$PATH:.:/usr/local/radiance/bin\nexport RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib\nexport MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/radiance/man\nexport MDIR=/usr/local/radiance/lib/\n\n\nI forget what \"MDIR\" is for. You may not need that one. The MANPATH line adds the Radiance \"man pages\" (i.e., documentation) to your system's man page search path. That way you can simply type \"man rcontrib\" at the command to pull up the man page for rcontrib, for example.\n\n\nNote that this .bash_profile is hidden, because the filename begins with a dot (\".\"). File lives in your home directory (\"~\"), aka /Users/[your_user_name]/.bash_profile. Very easy to create/edit this file from the command line using vi, or pico.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 10/4/16, 7:22 AM, \"Thomas Bleicher\" <tbleicher at gmail.com<mailto:tbleicher at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nAbdul\n\n\nI am not familiar with the internals of the NREL installer. Perhaps it already has done the job for you. Open a terminal and type\n\n\nwhich rpict\n\n\nIf it comes back with a path like /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/radiance/bin you are already set to use Radiance. The RAYPATH variable is not strictly necessary but some scene setups expect it to be available.\n\n\nA general discussion about setting environment variables in Mac OS (or the previous versions) is here:\n\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/603785/environment-variables-in-mac-os-x/4567308#4567308\n\n\nIt's a few years old by now but I think most of this still applies. If you are new to the Unix shell environment you can use this introduction to setting variables:\n\n\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2015/07/28/set-enviornment-variables-mac-os-x/\n\n\nPlease note that you can damage your user profile with these changes, which could make it impossible to the terminal to clean up the mess. If you are new to this you should ask around if someone has experience with Mac OS or Linux and ask them to assist you. You can set up a second user and try your modifications in that profile first. If it get's damaged you can just delete it. In any case, make a backup!\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 4, 2016 at 5:34 AM, A.M.
