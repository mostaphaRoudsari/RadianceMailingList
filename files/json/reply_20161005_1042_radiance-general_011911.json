{"body": "Hi Stephen,\n\n\nGenerally speaking, I would expect an increase in the -c option to improve CPU utilization.  As you note, you are seeing more of a linear relationship, which implies that the utilization is staying the same.  Did you check this in your process monitor?  You can run the \"Sample Process\" option to see further where the program is spending most of its time, though I'm not sure what we might learn from this in terms of i/o bottlenecks. \n\n\nIf your materials are purely specular (zero roughness), then your ability to parallelize may be fundamentally limited by the low ray branching.  All the same, the run-times should be acceptable, so I'm not too concerned about optimizing for such cases.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011911.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 05, 2016 at 10:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011907", "id": "radiance-general_011911"}
