{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nIf you would use -ps 1 on the command line of rpiece because you are doing specular sampling or setting -dj .7 (or whatever) to calculate penumbras, then your rtrace command will be just as fast as rpiece.  The main advantage of rpiece on large images is the image plane sampling it does.  Setting -ps 4 (the default) samples only 1 in 16 pixels to start, then subsamples in areas where it detects something going on.  This can be a big time-saver, especially in scenes with a lot of smoothly shaded areas.\n\n\nThe rad command will run rpiece for you if you set the -N option to the number of processes and the -v option to specify a single view you want rendered.  This is a much easier way to operate, and should be entirely reliable under Mac OS X and most versions of Linux.  You can run your own comparison against rtrace with vwrays and report back.  I'd be interested to hear what you find.\n\n\nOne more thing about rtrace is that it doesn't put your view in the header of the output, so if you want to use that output with programs that need the view, you will have to re-insert it.  The latest version of getinfo makes this a little easier, e.g.:\n\n\n\tvwrays ... | rtrace ... | getinfo -a \"VIEW= $view\" > view1.hdr\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011914.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 06, 2016 at 09:32AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011913", "id": "radiance-general_011914"}
