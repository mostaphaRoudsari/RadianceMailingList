{"body": "Hello Giulio:\nThank you very much for your reply. I downloaded exiftool and it works\nwell. Just another question if you could help me out.\nSince I am taking images of sunny sky using two aperture, f/4 and f/16, it\nis hard to change the aperture without any information. No matter I take\nimages using the camera or from EOS in my laptop, the aperture shows F00 on\nboth the camera and EOS. My current solution is to set the right aperture\nand then put ND 3 in to take images, and then take the filter out to set\nthe other aperture. However, this procedure clearly prolongs the\nimage-taking time and results in inaccurate sky images. I borrowed a Nikon\nbefore without such issue. Do you suggestion any better solution rather\nthan taking the filter out in order to set an aperture?\n\n\nThank you very much,\nZhe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2016-October/000579.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zhe Kong", "created_at": "October 10, 2016 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Zhe_Kong", "parent_id": "hdri_000577", "id": "hdri_000579"}
