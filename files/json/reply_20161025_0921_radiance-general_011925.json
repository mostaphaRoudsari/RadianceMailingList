{"body": "Hi Paulina,\nFirst, libBSDF is only needed for tensor tree BSDFs. If you only need to\nview klems BSDFs let me know and I can send you a version that doesn't\nsupport tensortree and will save all this extra hassle.\n\n\nDid you try adding the -fPIC flag to the g++ command for compiling the\nlibrary? I've added and removed this flag a few times. It seems that some\nsystems need it while other systems can't have it. I'm not a linux expert\nso I'm not sure why the difference, or how to spot the difference.\n\n\nHave you tried running as root?\nsudo bash /install.sh\nYou'll might root permission to put the shared object in the /usr/lib\n(though I wouldn't expect it to be necessary).\n\n\nCan you check to see if /usr/lib even exists on your system? And that it\ncontains libBSDF.so?\n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 25, 2016 at 4:06 AM, Paulina Sujanova <xsujanova at stuba.sk>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011925.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 25, 2016 at 09:21AM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011924", "id": "radiance-general_011925"}
