The falsecolor scale for tensor tree isn't percent of\nincident light but instead the raw BSDF value. When the patches are all\ndifferent sizes you might have a large patch with relatively low intensity\nthat would have a large portion of the outgoing flux because of it's size.\nUsing raw BSDF value was the simplest way that I could come up with to\nrender the tensor tree BSDF. The raw BSDF value is kinda meaningless, so I\ndecided not to display anything.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011927.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andy McNeil", "created_at": "October 26, 2016 at 06:05PM", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011924", "id": "radiance-general_011927"}
