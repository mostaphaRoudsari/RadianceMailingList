{"body": "Dear Paulina,\n\n\nI did not follow all the answers, so maybe my thoughts are redundant:\na) did you always \"make clean\" after changing a compile switch? Usually it\nis necessary to remove all old .o files to get a clean result\nb) is the path \"/usr/lib/\" in your general search path for the linker or\nincluded via -L in the link call?\n\n\nFWIW.\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n\n\n-----Urspr\u00fcngliche Nachricht-----\nVon: Paul\u00edna \u0160ujanov\u00e1 [mailto:paulina.sujanova at stuba.sk] \nGesendet: Donnerstag, 27. Oktober 2016 14:18\nAn: radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nBetreff: Re: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general Digest, Vol 152, Issue 13\n\n\nDear all, and most of all Andy McNeil,\n\n\nI did everything as written - no changes so far. I would like to use the\ntensor tree preview, but however I am not sure whether it is worth the\ncollective effort. So maybe, please, if you could send me the version only\nwith klems, I would be thankful.\n\n\nOtherwise to answer:\n\n\n1. I did check the /usr/lib/liBSDF.so - its there.\n\n\n2. I have added the -fPIC flags (that is also what Andre has written), but\nno changes.\n\n\n3. I do run everything as root.\n\n\n4. I have tried to install it on a different computer just to be sure (same\nsystem Ubuntu, java development environment installed, with and without\n-fPIC), but with the same outcome - g++: error: libBSDF.so: No such file or\ndirectory\n\n\nHmm, I do not know what more to do. So if you have any other ideas I would\nbe thankful.\nThanks for all the help.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\nPaul\u00edna\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011929.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Achim Geissler", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 05:45AM", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011928", "id": "radiance-general_011929"}
