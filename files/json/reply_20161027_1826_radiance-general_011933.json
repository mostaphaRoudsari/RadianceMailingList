{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your reply.\nBelow is the command I tried to run for rpict.\nrpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ap caustic 200 -ab 1 -vf view.vf model.oct\n\n\nFollowing your advice, I changed the command to add output redirection as below.\nrpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ap caustic 200 -ab 1 -vf view.vf model.oct >test.result\n\n\nIt seems that I could run command but it does not report any progress. Are there any specific format I should specify for output file?\n\n\nThank you!\nRegards,\nKatsuya\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011933.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Katsuya Obara", "created_at": "October 27, 2016 at 06:26PM", "created_by": "Katsuya_Obara", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011931", "id": "radiance-general_011933"}
