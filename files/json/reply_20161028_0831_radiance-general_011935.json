{"body": "Hi Katsuya,\n\n\nWith the -t 60 option, you should at least get a \"0% done\" message after initialization.  Is that message even showing up?  You might not see reports every 60 seconds if the scanline writes take longer than that, but you should at least get the initialization output.  If you are not seeing that, then something else must be wrong with your command, or the photon map(s) are not loading correctly.  I don't know how to verify this, other than regenerating the maps and trying again.\n\n\nWhat happens when you run the same command without the photon maps?  What happens when you run with the photon maps and -ab -1?\n\n\nDoes anyone else have experience/suggestions to offer?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011935.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 08:31AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011931", "id": "radiance-general_011935"}
