{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nYou are working in the right place.  Besides adding a macro for your view type to view.h, you need to implement the correct operations and checks in viewray() and viewloc() in image.c.  For full support, you should also look at util/rad.c and insert your view type in some switch statements therein.  Similarly, there is some code you need to write to split up your view for rpiece in util/rpiece.c.\n\n\nCan you be more specific when you say that your compilation is not working?  Do you get compile errors, or is something going wrong at run-time?\n\n\nOut of curiosity, what type are you adding?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011936.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 28, 2016 at 09:36AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011934", "id": "radiance-general_011936"}
