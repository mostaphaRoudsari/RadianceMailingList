{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nThanks for your questions.  Some of this has been discussed before, such as policy regarding attachments.  While it's OK to include a small JPEG or graph in the body of e-mails, large files (i.e., HDR pictures, etc.) should be linked to a URL that has some reasonable longevity.  Generally, I like to keep e-mail sizes to under 250K, as people are often careless in replying, and attachments may tag along.\n\n\nRegarding reply subjects, you should *never* reply to a digest e-mail, for those who are getting those.  Reply to the original e-mail instead, or change the subject to correspond to it at least, and don't include the whole digest with your reply(!)  I actually don't know what happens if you include multiple topics in your subject line -- I'm not sure how smart Mailman (our list software) is about that.  You could try it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011938.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 30, 2016 at 08:34AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011937", "id": "radiance-general_011938"}
