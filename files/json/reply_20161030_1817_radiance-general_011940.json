{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI even don't get \"0% done\".\nFollowings are the result when I tested your suggestion.\n1.What happens when you run the same command without the photon maps?\nI tried rpict -t 60 -ab 1 -vf view.vf model.oct >test.result. Even in this case, I couldn't get \"0% done\".\n2. What happens when you run with the photon maps and -ab -1?\nI tried rpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ab -1 -vf view.vf model.oct >test.result. Also in this case, I couldn't get \"0% done\".\n\n\nDoes this mean that I have problem in rpict command not in photon maps?\n\n\nThank you for your help.\nRegards,\nKatsuya\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011940.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Katsuya Obara", "created_at": "October 30, 2016 at 06:17PM", "created_by": "Katsuya_Obara", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011931", "id": "radiance-general_011940"}
