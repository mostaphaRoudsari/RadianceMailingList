{"body": "OK, since you verified that rpict can at least run, but you are seeing no initialization message with -t 60 and no photon map or ambient file, this seems to imply that rpict is getting stuck trying to read the octree.  I have not seen this problem before.  Usually, if there is a problem with the octree, it will report an error an exit.  How was the octree generated?  Did you try re-generating it and running rpict again?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011943.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 08:12AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011931", "id": "radiance-general_011943"}
