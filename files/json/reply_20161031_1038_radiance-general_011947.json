{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nI'm glad you got this working.  I don't know why you are getting a compile error from rad.c.  If you defined the VT_EQR type in view.h, that file gets included in rad.c and therefore should be defined.  Did you check your spelling?\n\n\nIf pfilt and pcond are missing, it could be because the TIFF library is not compiling properly.  Try removing \"ra_tiff\" and \"normtiff\" from the targets in src/px/Rmakefile and see if it builds then.  I don't know how to fix the TIFF compiles on all systems at this point.\n\n\nAre you using the equirectangular view to generate HDR texture maps, or ??  It's also relatively straightforward to create such custom views using rcalc and rtrace, without modifying the source.  The trouble with modifying the source of course is that you have to do it again with each new release.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011947.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 10:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011934", "id": "radiance-general_011947"}
