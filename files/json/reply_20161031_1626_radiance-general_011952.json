{"body": "Hi Stephen,\n\n\nA texfunc perturbs the surface normal, which should be visible at least in directly lit areas with -ab 0.  Are you saying that you have directly lit surfaces that look flat with a texfunc applied?  That would be unexpected.\n\n\nIn the shadows, there is nothing for a perturbation in the surface normal to affect, so everything looks the same as it would without the texfunc.  With -ab 1, you see variation again, as the surface normal influences the shading of the indirect component.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011952.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 04:26PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011951", "id": "radiance-general_011952"}
