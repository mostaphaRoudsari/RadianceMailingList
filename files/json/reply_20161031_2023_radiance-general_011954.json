{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI have tried regenerating octree and run rpict again as following command.\noconv -f materials.mat Balcony.rad glass.rad inside.rad Volume.rad lightshelf.rad sky_M6D10T13.rad >model.oct\nmkpmap -apg global.pmap 50000 -t 60 model.oct\nI could run successfully until mkpmap and got global.pmap. But when I tried to run rpict as following, I get test.txt file just repeating following command.\nrpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ab -1 -vf view.vf model.oct >> test.txt\n\n\nAre there any way to confirm whether calculated photon map file( in this case global.pmap) is correct or not?\n\n\nRegards,\nKatsuya\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011954.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Katsuya Obara", "created_at": "October 31, 2016 at 08:23PM", "created_by": "Katsuya_Obara", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011931", "id": "radiance-general_011954"}
