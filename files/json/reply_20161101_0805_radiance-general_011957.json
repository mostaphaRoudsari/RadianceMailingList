{"body": "Hi Katsuya,\n\n\nI am still not sure exactly what you are doing when you get this error.  What is the test.txt file, if not one you created using the rpict command?  Why are you outputting an image to a \".txt\" file?  What actually command are you running on the command-line?  Or, if it is some other program/script running rpict, can you share that script with us?  The circumstances of this error are very important if you want others' help debugging it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-November/011957.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 01, 2016 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011931", "id": "radiance-general_011957"}
