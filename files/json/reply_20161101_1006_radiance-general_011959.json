{"body": "Hi Stephen,\n\n\nI only now realize that I misread your initial post, thinking you were talking about the -ab setting rather than -aa.  Mea culpa.\n\n\nAre you sure the texture isn't just being masked by all the noise you get with -aa 0?  Is it indeed a texture rather than a pattern you have applied?  In either case, it should have some effect whatever your -aa setting.  If you increase the -ad setting and decrease the -lw setting to 1/(ad) accordingly, the noise should go down to where you may be able to discern the texture again.  Can you share what texture you are using, exactly?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-November/011959.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 01, 2016 at 10:06AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011951", "id": "radiance-general_011959"}
