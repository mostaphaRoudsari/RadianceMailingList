{"body": "Yeah, the latest Windows Radiance installer we have posted at github/NREL was created on Oct 3 -- about ten days ahead of that fix, unfortunately. I'm not super motivated to release another installer until the photon map stuff is all working again on the Windows side.\n\n\nIn the meantime I'm taking this opportunity to publicly wish Roland well as we recovers from surgery! Come on back, mon!\n\n\n- Googs\n\n\n\n\nOn 11/9/16, 3:48 PM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com<mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com>> wrote:\n\n\nYes, this affects the Windows version of genBSDF (actually wrapBSDF, which it calls) as well.  I don't believe there has been an update to the Windows installers since the fix, which went in mid-October.  We were hoping to make a new 5.1 release, but have been delayed by some fixes we need to make to the photon-mapping code.  Roland is recovering from surgery.  Please take the opportunity to wish him well!\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-November/011982.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "November 10, 2016 at 08:24AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011965", "id": "radiance-general_011982"}
