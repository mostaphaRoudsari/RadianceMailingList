{"body": "Hi Iason,\n\n\nCan you send the output of \"getinfo\" for the picture that you are feeding to pcomb?  My suspicion is that you performed the cropping operation caused the view parameters are being shifted or modified and are not being recognized by pcomb.  This will generate the domain error you are seeing.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2016-November/000585.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 12, 2016 at 06:26PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000584", "id": "hdri_000585"}
