{"body": "Thanks, Chris! I believe this question is meant to be answer based on\nopinions.\n\n\nI agree that people need to know what they are doing... metrics ALWAYS\nshould be carefuly chosen, even if they have been validated (that is why I\nhave intentions of writing a good documentation). That being said, I am not\nquite sure (just because of my own ignorance) if Evalglare and DGP, for\nexample, are ready for design use. I mean, *Will it produce useful\ninformation in all or most or enough design cases, provided that all the\nparameters are set correctly? Or is it limited to certain positions and\nroom configurations? How about the other metrics?* I personally usually\ndesign using illuminance-based metrics and am not quite sure when would I\nuse luminance-based ones.\n\n\nI am very new at glare, but I have heard people I respect say that we still\ndo not know much about it, thus my question. Is it worth including such\nfeatures in Groundhog? I want to keep this tool at the state-of-the-art,\nbut only if state-of-the-art methods are ready for use.\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016-12-02 11:10 GMT-03:00 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/011992.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "December 05, 2016 at 05:09AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011989", "id": "radiance-general_011992"}
