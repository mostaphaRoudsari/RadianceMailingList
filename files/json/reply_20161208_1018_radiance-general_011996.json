{"body": "Hi Rob,\n\n\nLooks like an issue with the way #define's are handled in devtable.c:\n\n\n#if !defined(HAS_X11) && !defined(HAS_QT) && !defined(WIN_RVIEW)\n/* weird logic ... */\n#define HAS_X11\n#endif\n\n\nIf you compile with -DHAS_QT, then you need to add -DHAS_X11 if you want that driver to compile as well.  I'm not sure why it was set up this way, as I wasn't really involved with the changes supporting QT.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/011996.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 08, 2016 at 10:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011993", "id": "radiance-general_011996"}
