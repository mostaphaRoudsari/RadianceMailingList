{"body": "Yep, thanks Greg! I just got back to this crap. I just rebuilt clean, now\nthat Qt AND x11 are on here, and it worked. Yes the def logic should be\nre-written, and sorry that got jacked up like that, but that will affect\nvery few people so I\u00b9m going to not worry about it for now.\n\n\nAlso I think I should have my head examined because I went through all\nthis because I actually *prefer* the x11 interface of rvu to the more\nGUI-ish Qt one. Maybe that makes me some sort of hardcore Radiance dude.\nMore likely, just old. Dunno. =)\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 12/8/16, 11:18 AM, \"Greg Ward\" <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/011997.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 08, 2016 at 02:31PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011993", "id": "radiance-general_011997"}
