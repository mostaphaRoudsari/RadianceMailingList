{"body": "Hi Parisa,\n\n\nYour command should be:\n\n\n\tpvalue \u2013o \u2013d \u2013h \u2013b \u2013H masked.hdr | rcalc \u2013e \u2019cond=$1-5;$1=$1\u2019 | total \u2013m\n\n\nYou had an extra 'if' in there, which was concatenated with the \"cond\" variable to turn it into \"ifcond\", which rcalc ignored.  The variable needs to be \"cond\" for it to work.  This will include all values greater than 5.0 in the average.  You may wish to adjust this value downwards if you don't want to miss small details.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/011999.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 09, 2016 at 08:27AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011998", "id": "radiance-general_011999"}
