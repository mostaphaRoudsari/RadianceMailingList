{"body": "Hi Parisa,\nI was just about to answer but Greg was faster... (and his command is also more elegant than the one I would have suggested...)\n\n\nOne short comment to the method: if you compare this value with the output of evalglare in masking mode, then you might get a different value. The reason for this is that with your command you calculate the average luminance of the masked pixels and not the average luminance of the masking area... evalglare weights the luminance by the solid angle of each pixel to get the average in an area. Depending on your projection method you get therefore  then different results. I can remember there were also some posts before how to weight by solid angle using radiance commands.\nbest\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/012000.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "December 09, 2016 at 11:39AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011998", "id": "radiance-general_012000"}
