{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nThanks for the reply! I realized that evalglare for averaging luminance takes the solid angle of each pixel into account, that is why I looked for a basic way of using masks and calculating average luminance for now and I will get back to the evalglare later. The new features are very interesting! \n\n\nCheers,\nParisa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/012002.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "parisa khademagha", "created_at": "December 09, 2016 at 02:48PM", "created_by": "parisa_khademagha", "parent_id": "radiance-general_011998", "id": "radiance-general_012002"}
