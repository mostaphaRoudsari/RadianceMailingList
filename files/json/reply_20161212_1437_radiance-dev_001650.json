{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nLooks like we need to fix these up a bit. I am in the process of getting\nthose packages up to scratch in anticipation of creating tar balls for all\nthree platforms, for inclusion in the upcoming OpenStudio 2.0 release\npackages. I was not going to make a new release tag, since the current\ncode does not compile for Windows; however we should absolutely buff up\nthe Cmake files to include the new fisheye_corr.cal, and see what else\nI\u00b9ve missed. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 12/12/16, 3:22 PM, \"Axel Jacobs\" <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-December/001650.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 12, 2016 at 02:37PM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001649", "id": "radiance-dev_001650"}
