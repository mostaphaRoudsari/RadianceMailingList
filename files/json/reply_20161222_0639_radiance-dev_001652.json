{"body": "What\u00b9s the vintage of the source code? There were a couple of minor\npatches to the 5.0 official release (Mid-September), and the last tag that\nbuilds for Windows for me is the 'NREL 5.0.a.12\u00b9 tag:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.12\n\n\n\n\nYou could try the Windows installers we have, which seem to be working:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0.a.6/radiance-5.0.a.6\n-win64.exe\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0.a.6/radiance-5.0.a.6\n-win32.exe\n\n\nI also \u0152get\u00b9 wanting to roll your own, though. Again you\u00b9d need to make\nsure your source aligns with this commit, or earlier:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/0c842736bf2b0908ba0ea42963ea8f4680c\nd1fc5\n\n\nAnd for the record, that NREL Windows build used Cmake 3.3.2, MSVC 12\n2013, a libtiff I rolled myself with 4.0.4-beta, and Qt5.3.\n\n\nThe NREL packages aren\u00b9t bulletproof, I\u00b9m finding, but xform and oconv\nseem to work fine. It\u00b9d be potentially mutually beneficial for you to try\nthe NREL package on your input and see what happens. Or, send me your test\ninput and we can go from there.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 12/22/16, 5:15 AM, \"Victor LRG\" <rioboo at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-December/001652.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "December 22, 2016 at 06:39AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001652"}
