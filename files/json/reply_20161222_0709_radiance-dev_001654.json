{"body": "Rob,\n\n\nI have tried the last official release, so just 5.0. I'll try 5.0.a.12 to\nsee what happens. I have used the NREL Windows installers before and I had\nno issues.\n\n\nThe reason I wanted to compile Radiance myself is that I was playing around\nwith the source code and I wanted to try the changes. So far I have\nincorporated an equirectangular view to rpict (see Radiance General October\n2016 Creating new view types for Radiance) and an additional option for\npextrem. They do seem to work fine in Linux, but unfortunately I not always\nhave access to a Linux machine. Therefore, it would be great to be able to\ncompile it for Windows.\n\n\nI'll have a look at the link to the commit. For now a was using the\nCMakeLists.txt that came with the source code package with the following\nmodifications:\n\n\ncmake_policy(SET CMP0045 OLD)\nSET(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH \u201cC:/Qt/5.7/msvc2015_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Widgets\u201d)\nSET(TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR \u201cC:/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/include\u201d)\n\n\nI'll try using the CMake/MSVC/libtiff/Qt versions you suggest to see if\nthat makes a difference.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nVictor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 22 December 2016 at 14:39, Guglielmetti, Robert <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-December/001654.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor LRG", "created_at": "December 22, 2016 at 07:09AM", "created_by": "Victor_LRG", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001654"}
