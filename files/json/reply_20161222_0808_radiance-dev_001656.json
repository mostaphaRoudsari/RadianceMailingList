{"body": "Nathaniel/Robert,\n\n\nI've tried compiling 5.0.a.12 and I also get the same C4005 'fseeko' macro\ndefinition warning (no more erf/erfc warnings though). Annoyingly,\nxform/oconv are still giving me the same problems, but I'am not sure if\nthat is related to these warnings.\n\n\nFor now I am still using MVSC2015 and Cmake 3.7.1. I wonder if it is worth\ntrying the older versions you are using. It is a bit of work to remove and\nreinstall MVSC...\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nOn 22 December 2016 at 15:11, Nathaniel Jones <nathanieljon at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-December/001656.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor LRG", "created_at": "December 22, 2016 at 08:08AM", "created_by": "Victor_LRG", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001656"}
