{"body": "Greg,\n\n\nI've tried xform and oconv and they do seem to work on their own. However,\nthe problem is still happening when I try to oconv a scene file with xform,\nwhich I always use for convenience:\n\n\n!xform materials\\mat.rad\n!xform objects\\cage_sphere.rad\n\n\nI never had problems with that before, so I'm quite puzzled. I get bad\narguments for polygon... and then it looks like sometimes I get a random\npolygon and sometimes the same one.\n\n\nI have tried the same oconv and xform files in another computer and it says\nVCRUNTIME140D.dll is missing...\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nVictor\n\n\nOn 22 December 2016 at 17:15, Gregory J.
