{"body": "If you use the \u201cglass\u201d material type, you would get varying reflection/transmission at certain angles based on Snell\u2019s law, refractive index, critical angle, etc. \u2013 on both sides of the glass, which might not be representative of your system. You could consider one surface/layer to represent the glass (\u201cglass\u201d material type might be good enough approximation) and another layer to represent the screen (maybe \u201ctrans\u201d material type unless you want to specify angular-dependent properties). If you want to combine the effect of glass with screen into one surface/layer then you probably need to consider something more complex if the different reflective properties on each side of the system are important. There are also more accurate ways to model glass if it has specific coatings, etc. that are important to the results.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012007.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "January 04, 2017 at 06:40AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012006", "id": "radiance-general_012007"}
