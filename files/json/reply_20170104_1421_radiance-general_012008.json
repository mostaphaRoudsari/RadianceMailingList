{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nThe Radiance \"BRTDfunc\" material offers the most control over these parameters, and can be done with a single surface.  The \"glaze\" script can get you pretty close to what you want by simulating your system as a single-pane fritted glazing.  I generated the following using a 95% coverage (corresponding roughly to a 4% visibility factor):\n\n\n% glaze\n###\n### NOTE: Using internal demo database!\n###\n\n\nEnter the number of panes in the system: 1\n\n\nWindow normal faces interior\n\n\n  | |\n  | |\n  | |\n  | |-->\n  | |\n  | |\n  | |\n s1 s2\n\n\nSupported surface types are:\n   1 - clear glass\n   2 - VE1-2M low-E coating\n   3 - PVB laminated\n   4 - V-175 white frit\n   5 - V-933 warm gray frit\n\n\nWhat is the type of s1? 5\nWhat is the type of s2? 1\nEnter fraction coverage for s1 (0-1): .95\n\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision: 2.8 $\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 1\n# Exterior surface s1 type: V-933 warm gray frit\n# s1 coating coverage: .95\n# Interior surface s2 type: clear glass\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.20331675\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.14631675\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.129616\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed\n10\n\tsr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\n\tst_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n\t0 0 0\n\tglaze1.cal\n0\n11\n0.0722\n0.06935\n0.06745\n0.1995\n0.1995\n0.1995\n0.0855\n0.0855\n0.0855\n\t1\t.95\n\n\n\n\nBased on the output above, the gray frit I used (V-933) is not dark enough to simulate your system, since the tranmission is about twice too high (0.129616 instead of 0.06).  This is mostly in the diffuse transmitted part, so you can probably adjust the 0.0855 values above to something like 0.02 (three times) to get close to your 6% total transmission.  I have no idea what the diffuse reflection values should be, since you didn't give us those measurements.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012008.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 04, 2017 at 02:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012006", "id": "radiance-general_012008"}
