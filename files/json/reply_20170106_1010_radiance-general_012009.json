{"body": "HI Per,\n\n\nI changed the subject back to the original, but I see that you sent this reply to me alone.\n\n\nThe BRTDfunc type is a material in Radiance, so it should modify a surface directly, not another material.  Therefore, you should apply your \"glaze1_unnamed\" material directly to the polygon of your window.\n\n\nYour changes to the arguments are as I suggested to get the desired total transmission.  If light reflection is 76% and our frit coverage is 95%, that means that the \"back side\" diffuse reflection should be much higher -- around 78% or so.  I would suggest changing the specification as follows:\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed\n10\n    sr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\n    st_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n    0 0 0\n    glaze1.cal\n0\n11 0.0722 0.06935 0.06745 0.78 0.78 0.78 0.02 0.02 0.02 1    .95\n\n\nThe actual reflection on the exterior of the building will matter more to outside views than inside views and illumination.  Do they give any information about interior reflection for the shading system?  This would affect what we specify for the first three arguments.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012009.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 10:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012006", "id": "radiance-general_012009"}
