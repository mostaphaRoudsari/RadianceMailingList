{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\nYou may be confusing your options.  The -ds option subdivides light sources, and -ds 1 is a rather large value to apply.  Better to use a smaller-than-default value if you want better soft shadows.  The default is \"-ds 0.25\" and you could try \"-ds 0.1\".  You should also try setting the \"-dj\" option to randomly sample your light sources.  Setting \"-dj 1\" should sample the full source area, which is why I think you may be confusing your options based on what you said.\n\n\nThis is not the reason you are seeing stuff in the reflections, however.  You are seeing them there because the reflections are maybe 4% as bright as the non-reflected portions, and the latter are clipped so as not to be visible.  If you reduced your exposure, I expect the pattern would look the same.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012011.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 06, 2017 at 02:58PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012010", "id": "radiance-general_012011"}
