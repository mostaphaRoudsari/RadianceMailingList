{"body": "Hi Per,\n\n\nI am re-editing your subject line again.  Please, when responding to the mailing list especially, make sure that your subject line stays consistent for searches, and it is best *not* to include the entire digest, as it often contains different threads (though not in this case).  The instructions regarding the subject line are repeated below, so no excuses.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot glean much useful information based on the material composition.  I'm not a material scientist, but presumably they could put any number of dyes and pigments in their PVC/fiberglass mix.  If the exterior reflectance is 76%, however, I would expect the interior reflectance to be similar unless there is something unusual about the construction.  The glass will reduce this slightly (88% squared), so it is probably reasonable to set the interior diffuse reflectance to something like 0.66 for the first three values:\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed\n10\n    sr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\n    st_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n    0 0 0\n    glaze1.cal\n0\n11 0.66 0.66 0.66 0.78 0.78 0.78 0.02 0.02 0.02 1    .95\n\n\nThe above is a reasonable guess, I believe.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012014.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 07, 2017 at 07:35AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012006", "id": "radiance-general_012014"}
