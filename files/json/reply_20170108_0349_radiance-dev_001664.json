{"body": "Nathaniel,\n\n\nSo far my implementation the equirectangular view seems to work. The only\npart that I have not touched for full support is util/rpiece.c because I\ndon't use it very often. You can also create an equirectangular view\nthrough other routes, but I find having it inside the code faster and more\nconvenient.\n\n\nI'm happy to share it. Personally, I think it would be useful to\nincorporate it into the main distribution, but that's a question for Greg.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nVictor Lopez-Rioboo Gil\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-January/001664.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor LRG", "created_at": "January 08, 2017 at 03:49AM", "created_by": "Victor_LRG", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001664"}
