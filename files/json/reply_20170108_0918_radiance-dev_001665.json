{"body": "Hi Victor (& Nathaniel),\n\n\nI am happy to take a look at the code and see how much effort it would be to integrate.  I have a question first, however.  \n\n\nIs the \"equirectangular\" view useful for anything less than a full panorama?  Would people want to use it for smaller/different views, or do you always set vertical to 180\u00b0 and horizontal to 360\u00b0 in every application?\n\n\nIf you only use this view for one purpose, then I wonder if it is really worth having a view implemented in Radiance, which needs to handle every possible setting correctly.  Also, I wonder in such a case if you have tested every possible (legal) setting?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-January/001665.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 08, 2017 at 09:18AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001665"}
