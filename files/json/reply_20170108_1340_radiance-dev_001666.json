{"body": "I guess I'd generally be in favor of having equirectangular view as an\noption, although I can see how it does only cater to a few applications.\nThe fact that it would probably always be used with the same parameters\ndoesn't bother me much more than cylindrical or angular fisheye views,\nwhich I suspect are also almost always used the same way. I also expect\nthat the ability to \"zoom in\" on the image would be \"legal\", if not\npopular. Going beyond 180 degrees in the vertical direction is\nmathematically definable, though it would look odd and be inefficient to\nsample. The bigger issue might be that equirectangular view begs having a\nstereo offset parameter as a convenience feature, which doesn't exist in\nRadiance.\n\n\nHowever, as I've been looking at this problem a bit more, it seems that\neven equirectangular view doesn't meet all of my needs. I may need to\nimplement something like ODS\n<https://developers.google.com/vr/jump/rendering-ods-content.pdf> view for\nwhat I have in mind.\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Sun, Jan 8, 2017 at 12:18 PM, Gregory J.
