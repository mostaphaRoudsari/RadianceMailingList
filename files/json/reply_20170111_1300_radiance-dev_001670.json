{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThe viewpoint, or ray origin, is different for each column of pixels in a\nstereo ODS rendering. If you start with a viewpoint, and draw a circle with\ndiameter that is the distance between one's pupils, then the origin for\neach ray should be at a point where the ray is tangent to the circle (on\nthe left side of the circle for left eye and right side for right eye).\nIt's explained & illustrated well here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/jump/rendering-ods-content.pdf\n\n\nI don't see how clipping planes could be used to modify the ray origin, but\nI could be wrong.\n\n\nAnd this goes a ways back in the thread, but one instance where smaller\nthan 180\u00b0 x 360\u00b0 sized equirectangular views would be necessary is if a\nuser wanted to use rpiece to render the full view.\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 10, 2017 at 10:38 AM, Gregory J.
