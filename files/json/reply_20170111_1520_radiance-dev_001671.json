{"body": "Thanks, Andy.\n\n\nHave you already created a .cal file to generate the appropriate ray origins and directions for this?  If not, I could take a crack at it.  Seems like an easier method than adding a new view type, especially since we would need a new parameter for the stereo offset to get it to do what we want.\n\n\nRegarding rpiece, you can always use the rtrace -n option to get an equivalent speed-up.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-January/001671.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 11, 2017 at 03:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001671"}
