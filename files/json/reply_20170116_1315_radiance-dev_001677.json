{"body": "I just ran the view360stereo.cal file on a model that I've been working\nwith. The image that's generated is mirrored left-to-right from what I'd\nexpect. Other than that, the ODS projection works decently well in my\ncardboard viewer.\n\n\nA few other notes: The .cal file name in the example in comments doesn't\nmatch the new name of the .cal file. Also, this is perhaps unnecessary, but\nI'd like to be able to specify the forward direction to appear in the\ncenter of the image.\n\n\nFor my own work, I've gone ahead and implemented the ODS view in source\ncode. I've called it VT_ODS (-vto) and added a new parameter -vi for\ninter-pupillary distance. I haven't bothered with the EX and EZ parameters\nfor neck rotation yet. Also, the implementation isn't complete (I'm not\nsure what viewloc() does, for example), but it's working for my purposes.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Fri, Jan 13, 2017 at 9:31 PM, Gregory J.
