{"body": "Hello Xiaoming,\n\n\nIf I understand the Materials documentation\n<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf> correctly, I would\nsay that the Red, Green and Blue are total reflection. If specularity is\nnon-zero, the diffuse reflection is reduced by this amount:\n\n\nrho_d = p*C*(1-specularity)\n\n\nAt least, that would be my guess.\n\n\nBest!\n\n\n2017-01-20 16:28 GMT-03:00 Xiaoming Yang <xiyang at fosterandpartners.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012020.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "January 20, 2017 at 12:49PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012019", "id": "radiance-general_012020"}
