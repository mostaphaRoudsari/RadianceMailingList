{"body": "Hi Xiaoming,\n\n\nmmm... I would say you are looking for a 60% reflective material (10%\nspecular, 50% diffuse).\n\n\nIn that case, I would choose a1, a2, a3 = 60% and the specularity would be\n(C-rho_d)/C = 16,666%. (16.6666%*60% = 10%).\n\n\nIt seems that I have the same issue as you, though.... my calculation of\ntotal reflectance is not correct when comparing to Lighting Materials\nwebsite.\n\n\nAnyone actually know these things?\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\n2017-01-23 8:24 GMT-03:00 Xiaoming Yang <xiyang at fosterandpartners.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012022.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 05:20AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012019", "id": "radiance-general_012022"}
