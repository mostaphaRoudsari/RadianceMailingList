{"body": "Xiaoming -- the calculation you performed based on the correct formula Germ\u00e1n gave you should yield a material with 50% diffuse and 10% specular reflectance.\n\n\nThe reason the Radiance material parameters are defined as they are, and \"trans\" is much more confusing than \"plastic\" or \"metal\", is so that there are clearly physical and non-physical ranges for each value.  As long as you are between 0 and 1 in the first four parameters for \"plastic\" or \"metal,\" you know your material will not reflect more light than reaches it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012023.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 23, 2017 at 07:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012019", "id": "radiance-general_012023"}
