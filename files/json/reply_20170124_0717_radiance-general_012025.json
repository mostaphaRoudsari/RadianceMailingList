{"body": "Hello All,\n\n\nThank you for sharing a link to the http://www.lighting-materials.com/ database. This is a useful reference to have.\n\n\nI want to understand how R_reflectance, G_reflectance, B_reflectance are calculated, as defined for a material in the online database. Can someone please explain how these were calculated? Is the Radiance RGB triplet (as obtained from xyz_rgb.cal) simply scaled by total reflectance to obtain these?\n\n\nRadiance 5.0 official release contains a script, colorcal.csh, does this script convert spectral reflectance straight to a RGB material primitive definition, or does the resulting RGB triplet need to be scaled by total or diffuse reflectance?\n\n\nAs I understand from previous posts for the red channel, R_material definition = (R_website - Specularity_website) / (1 - Specularity_website). Can someone please clarify how R_website was determined.\n\n\nI want to clearly understand how a Radiance material definition is generated from spectral reflectance.\n\n\nThank you for the help,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012025.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "January 24, 2017 at 07:17AM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012019", "id": "radiance-general_012025"}
