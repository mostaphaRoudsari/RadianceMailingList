{"body": "Hello everyone,\n\n\nI am happy to report that the lighting materials website \n<http://lighting-materials.com/> is back up, and specular plastics now \nreflect the correct diffuse values. Thank you to everyone for the \nhelpful discussion, and I will also be uploading some new materials soon!\n\n\nPicking a random, highly specular measurement (Greg's stainless steel \nsink in 1995 <http://lighting-materials.com/materials/1444>) should show \nthat the diffuse characteristics are now correct.\n\n\n    R_diffuse = (0.3937*0.265 + 0.3734*0.670 + 0.3281*0.065)*(1-0.0821)\n    = 0.345\n    R_specular = 0.0821\n    R_total = R_diffuse + R_specular = 0.4271\n\n\nBest wishes,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012027.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "January 24, 2017 at 09:31PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012019", "id": "radiance-general_012027"}
