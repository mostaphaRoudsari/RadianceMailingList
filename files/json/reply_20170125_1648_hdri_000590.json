{"body": "Hi Zhe,\n\n\nYou should be able to apply the fisheye_corr.cal file I gave you earlier to correct the distortion and make it an angular fisheye image that pinterp works with.  (Why you need pinterp, I am not sure.)  The command is as suggested in the fisheye_corr.cal file itself:\n\n\n\tpcomb -f fisheye_corr.cal -o fisheye.hdr \\\n\t\t| getinfo -a \"VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180\" \\\n\t\t> corrected.hdr\n\n\nThis will also crop the area outside of 180\u00b0 to black, assuming that is what you want.  It assumes that you have already cropped the image to a minimum square area.  You should apply vignetting correction and absolute calibration first.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000590.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 04:48PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000589", "id": "hdri_000590"}
