{"body": "Hi Zhe,\n\n\nAs far as I am aware, the Sigma 8mm f/3.5 is an equi-angular (-vta) \nlens, and the Sigma 4.5mm f/2.8 is an equi-solid angle (-???) lens. I am \nhaving trouble finding a source from Sigma right now, but Cauwerts, \nBodart and Deneyer's paper \n<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1582/LEUKOS.2012.08.03.002> says so.\n\n\nThat said, if you do end up with an equi-solidangle image, I have a \npython script that converts equi-solid angle to equi-angle for each \nsource jpeg while maintaining the EXIF data. I used this to convert \nequi-solidangle images from my Canon 8-15mm fisheye lenses.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000591.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "January 25, 2017 at 09:57PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "hdri_000589", "id": "hdri_000591"}
