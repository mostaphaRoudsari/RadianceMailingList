{"body": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nSome years ago I tested my Sigma 8mm lens, f3.5.\n\n\nAt the time I found several sources online claiming it to be equi-solid angle (-vth), but it didn\u2019t match my personal experiences with the lens, so I tested it.\n\n\nMy tests showed it to be equidistant (-vta), i.e. identical to the angular fish eye projection in RADIANCE.\n\n\nSo, in my experience, the 8mm Sigma lens is equidistant.\n\n\nCheers,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaus B.
