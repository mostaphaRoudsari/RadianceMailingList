{"body": "Hi all,\nThank you for raising this topic and sharing your views. I\u00b9m using the\noutput of a Sigma f=4.5mm F/2.8 for several analysis including DGP via\nEvalglare that should require a -vth or -vta view, so this is critical\ninformation for me.\nMay I ask why people refer to -vth as equi-solid angle and not hemispherical\nas it is defined in Radiance\u00b9s rpict man page?\nMy understanding from that page and from Axel Jacobs' presentation sent via\nthe link just before is that there isn't a Radiance description for the\nequi-solid angle view.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaquel Viula\n\n\nPhD Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTU Delft | Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment |\n\n\nArchitectural Engineering and Technology\n\n\nJulianalaan 134, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands | P.O.
