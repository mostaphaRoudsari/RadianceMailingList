{"body": "Raquel points out an important error in this discussion's terminology.  The \"equidistant\" fisheye does indeed correspond to the \"-vta\" view type in Radiance.  However, the \"-vth\" type corresponds to a hemispherical projection, which very few commercial fisheye lenses realize.  In particular, the equisolidangle projection is much closer to \"-vta\" than it is to \"-vth\".  If your lens is equisolidangle, then you need to use the fisheye_corr.cal script or similar to convert it to an equidistant projection.\n\n\nI have not implemented the equisolidangle projection, though there is a third fisheye type (-vts) which is called \"stereographic\", although we prefer the term \"planisphere\" projection to avoid confusion with stereo views.  This does not correspond to any commercial lenses to my knowledge, but I'd be interested to hear of one.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000599.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 27, 2017 at 08:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000589", "id": "hdri_000599"}
