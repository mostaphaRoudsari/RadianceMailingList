{"body": "Hi Seyedeh,\n\n\nThe \"-s\" option to pvalue skips the specified number of bytes in the input for non-standard headers.  I don't think this is the option you want.\n\n\nYou probably want the \"-di\" option (or \"+di\" if you want the pixels positions).  The \"-o\" option removes any exposure that has been applied to the image, so the output will be 255 for 1.0 watts/sr/m^2.  If your picture was created using the rpict \"-i\" or \"-I\" option, then the output will be irradiance rather than radiance, and 255 will correspond to 1.0 watts/m^2.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  I had to manually pass your e-mail through the system.  Next time, make sure you write from the address you signed up for on the HDRI list, or add this one.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000601.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 27, 2017 at 03:09PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000600", "id": "hdri_000601"}
