{"body": "The whole point of HDR is that it doesn't fit in an 8-bit range.  The pvalue program will give you integers if you ask for it, and 256 will correspond to 1.0 in the file, but it doesn't stop at that point, and is happy to give you integer values up to some very large limit (31 bits, I think).\n\n\nIf that's not what you want, you can use rcalc to clip the output values over 255 to 255, like so:\n\n\n\tpvalue -o -h -di $HDR | rcalc -e 'clip(i):if(i-255,255,i);$1=clip($1);$2=clip($2);$3=clip($3)'\n\n\nOr, if you are trying to squeeze everything in a 0-255 range, making 255 the maximum and everything else darker, there are ways to do that as well.  It's probably not a good move, though, as you'll usually end up with just a few white areas around the light sources, with everything else clipped to 0 (or nearly).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000605.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 31, 2017 at 12:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000604", "id": "hdri_000605"}
