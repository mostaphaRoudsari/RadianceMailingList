Greg already pointed out some options in his reply. Is it something that the pcond command might help with? I'm not familiar enough with the code and what the \"numbers\" are that come out of pcond, but I do know it's intended to allow compression of an image into a lower dynamic range for image representation, even if it would still require further number manipulation to get you 0-255 integers.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000606.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "January 31, 2017 at 12:31PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "hdri_000604", "id": "hdri_000606"}
