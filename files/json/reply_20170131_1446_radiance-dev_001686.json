{"body": "Hi Nathaniel,\n\n\nThis sounds like an issue with the Windows Perl interpreter you are using.  This bit of code is unusual, but I copied off the net as a way to unbuffer an output file:\n\n\n# Open unbuffered progress file\nopen(MYPH, \">> $td/phase.txt\");\n{\n\tmy $ofh = select MYPH;\n\t$| = 1;\n\tselect $ofh;\n}\n\n\nIt may be causing this issue on your system, but I've no idea why.  Without the phase.txt file working, you won't be able to recover from a dead process, but you should be OK, otherwise.  I could change my code to open the file each time it is needed, which should behave more normally (I think).\n\n\nDoes anyone have any insights about the above syntax or why it might not be working under Windows?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-January/001686.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 31, 2017 at 02:46PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001685", "id": "radiance-dev_001686"}
