{"body": "Hi Seyedeh,\n\n\nIf your LED light sources are of the RGB type, then you should not rely on a digital camera to determine the correlated color temperature.  The reason is that the RGB spectra are fairly saturated, and most cameras do not measure saturated colors accurately.\n\n\nIf your LED light source uses white LEDs, then you *might* get a reasonable CCT result if you convert the images using the dcraw freeware tool to a linear output format such as 16-bit TIFF.  For example, I would use:\n\n\n\tdcraw -w -4 -t 0 -T input.raw\n\n\nThe dcraw program has a much better notion of the correct color space for most cameras than Photoshop or the camera itself.  Since Photosphere and hdrgen take the JPEG from the camera, their color results are not as reliable.  Also, you don't need HDR to measure a light source, as you don't care about light/dark detail.  You just have to make sure your exposure is not clipped.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-February/000609.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2017 at 02:38PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000608", "id": "hdri_000609"}
