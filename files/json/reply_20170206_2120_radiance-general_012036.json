{"body": "Actually, Stephanie is correct -- genBSDF is one of the few Radiance programs that takes MGF input directly.  I supported this feature because the XML format can incorporate the MGF description as a supplement to the computed BSDF.  However, the MGF is also converted to Radiance before computing the actual BSDF, so ultimately, that is the description that matters.\n\n\nIn this case, both MGF and Radiance are equally capable of representing your geometry, which is to say, neither one can do it exactly right.  The NURBs must first be converted to polygons before it can be used, since Radiance does not have a NURBs primitive.  For this operation, you should probably prefer to export in .OBJ format and obj2rad, which will preserve the vertex normals.  Use a fine enough subdivision size that the individual polygons don't undermine your geometric accuracy.  Think in terms of equalling manufacturing tolerances.  You will want to re-describe your materials in native Radiance, however.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-February/012036.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2017 at 09:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012034", "id": "radiance-general_012036"}
