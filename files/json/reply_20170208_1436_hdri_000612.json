{"body": "Thank you. So it means that I need to convert HDR images to TIFF format using dcraw? I was trying to run this code but it is giving me \"command not found\" error. Do I need to install dcraw software?\nI also took raw images from the light source during photography. I know it is possible to convert them to HDR format. So which result would be more accurate for my porpuse ? using dcraw or raw2hdr ? Thanks\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-February/000612.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Seyedeh Farzaneh Mahlab", "created_at": "February 08, 2017 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "Seyedeh_Farzaneh_Mahlab", "parent_id": "hdri_000608", "id": "hdri_000612"}
