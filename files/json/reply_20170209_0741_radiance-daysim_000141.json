{"body": "Dear Jan & Christoph,\nThank you for your fast response. To answer both of your questions:\n\n\n-        I'm using the gen_dc and ds_illum in the DDS option. This was chosen due to the \"most accurate\" solution. Christoph, can you explain why you recommend the regular mode instead of the DDS option?\n\n\n-        I'm hundred percent certain that the measurement data is from the correct year. It was measured last year, January 2016 till December 2016, and I'm still getting the data.\n\n\n-        The data I get from the weather station is DNI, DHI, DiffHI and GHI. I built two weather files (DHI file and DNI file) and simulated with both of them. The first file is built from DHI & DiffHI and the second from DNI & DiffHI. One would expect similar results, but there was a strong deviation between the two results. The weather file based on DNI and DiffHI gave the best results.\n\n\n-        There is an obstruction in reality, but this object was placed and designed in such a way that 99% of the time there is no obstruction from this object. Several researches before showed that this obstruction could be neglected.\n\n\n-        The system is placed on a flat roof, so there is no other obstruction or strange pattern that I know of.\nWhat I find particularly strange is the sudden change in behavior from September on. It would be strange if this was due to an obstruction or something, because this should also show in March/April (due to similar solar elevation and azimuth).\nWith kind regards,\nStefan Koenders\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-February/000141.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S.J.M.
