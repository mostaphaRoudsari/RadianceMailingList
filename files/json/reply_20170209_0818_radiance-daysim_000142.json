{"body": "Hi Stefan,\n\n\nI don't think it is necessary to use DDS - the sun-resolution is not \nthat much higher than in the standard version and the diffuse patches \nfor the sky it does not matter so much. So I would try the \"standard\" \nversion. I also encountered sever problems (core-dumps on the linux \nversion) once with the DDS option, because I wanted to use another \nsun-interpolation mode. This was initially included in all daysim modes, \nbut it \"disappeared\" once for the standard.\n\n\nThat's why I was asking about external obstructions with a pattern - in \nthat case you can run into problems with the sun-discretisation. But \nthis seems not the case here - I think the DDS-option might have caused \nthis \"September-problem\".\n\n\nFor the difference in DHI and DNI-files - are you sure you set the the \nright parameter in the header-file (and weather-file). It should be\n\n\n/weather_data_file_units//1 /for Direct Normal, Diffuse Horizontal \nIrradiance[W/m\u00b2]\n\n\n/weather_data_file_units//2/ for Direct Horizontal, Diffuse Horizontal \nIrradiance[W/m\u00b2]\n\n\nHave you checked, that DHI+DIFFHI=GHI ? Sometimes the measurements are \nalso not that reliable.\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-February/000142.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 08:18AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000138", "id": "radiance-daysim_000142"}
