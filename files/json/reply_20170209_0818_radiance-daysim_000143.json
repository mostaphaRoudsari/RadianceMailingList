{"body": "Hi Stefan,\n\n\ncan you test the monitored data against other data sources? For many locations, you can get (at least interpolated) irradiance data from other weather stations. If you find e.g. good accordance between your data and that of others until Sep, but not afterwards, you would have to check the instruments rather than the simulation.\n\n\nOne point to remember is that the approach to reconstruct the sky luminance distribution from the two measured irradiance integrals works well for perfectly clear or perfectly covered skys. If you have a sky with distinguishable clouds, the distribution can not be reconstructed. So while you had a highly non-uniform sky distribution in real world, your sky model would average all couds/sky directions other than the sun. With annual simulations, the assumption is that this does not make a big difference. For point-in-time simulations, this may not apply. In such cases, monitoring of cloud coverage makes sense.\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-February/000143.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
