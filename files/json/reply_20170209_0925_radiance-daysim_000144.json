{"body": "Hi Stefan,\nHave you done any graphical or numerical checks of the weather data values to see if there's something not right in the data, that could give incorrect results in both the measured and the EPW weather file? If you can view the data visually you might see a pattern that points out any flaws in the data. I'd recommend Dview as one example to check for these things.  https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView\nI can't remember which one, but in the past I've seen EPW files with one whole month of illuminance values roughly 1/100th of what they should be. It looked like somehow the data file probably had the irradiance values incorrectly copied into the illuminance columns.\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-February/000144.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 09:25AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000138", "id": "radiance-daysim_000144"}
