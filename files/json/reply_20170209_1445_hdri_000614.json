{"body": "Hello Clotilde,\n\n\nI'd like to follow up with some other potential things to look out for \nin addition to what Alex suggested and questions based on your \ndescription. We dealt a lot with this via the papers on HDR we published \nlast year.\n\n\n  * Full fisheye HDR images should always be cropped to a bounding\n    square and the view edited or input inline via Evalglare when doing\n    analysis. Are you cropping the images in all cases?\n  * Where is your 1.39 calibration factor derived from? It is useful to\n    measure luminance for every HDR photo taken from an easy to identify\n    (and nearly-neutral) surface for use in calibrating images rather\n    than a constant. Typically the discrepancies I find when I\n    /don't///measure luminance this aren't as high as what you found\n    however.\n  * You should look up the recent discussion, \"[HDRI] Convert\n    equisolidangular to equiangular projection\" which strongly suggests\n    the Sigma 8mm f/3.5 to be a -vta / equidistant / equi-angle lens.\n    Reprojecting the image could add some error in this case.\n\n\nBest,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-February/000614.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "February 09, 2017 at 02:45PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "hdri_000610", "id": "hdri_000614"}
