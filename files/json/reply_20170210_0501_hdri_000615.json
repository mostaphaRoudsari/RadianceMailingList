{"body": "Dear Alex,\nDear Alstan,\n\n\n> Are you sure your low dynamic range pictures are properly exposed from \n> which you construct the HDRI?\n>\n> Meaning, the fastest shutter speed picture has no saturation (i.e. all \n> white pixels) and your slowest shutter speed picture has some black \n> pixels?

I always check that the fastest shutter speed is almost all black pixels (no white pixels) and the slowest shutter speed is almost all white pixels (no black pixels). If I have too high luminance in my field of view, then I use a neutral density filter so that my darkest image does not have any white pixel.\n\n\n> I'd like to follow up with some other potential things to look out for in addition to what Alex suggested and questions based on your description.

Are you cropping the images in all cases?\n\n\nYes, all images are cropped at the end (after hdrgen and vignetting calibration) to a 1000x1000 square (with pcompos and pfilt) and the VIEW line in the header is modified to a -vta -vh 180 -vv 180.\n\n\n>  * Where is your 1.39 calibration factor derived from?

Typically the discrepancies I find when I\n>    /don't///measure luminance this aren't as high as what you found\n>    however.\n\n\nI derived my calibration factor when doing the vignetting calibration process. I did the vignetting calibration according to the method suggested in Cauwerts et al. (2013) paper. Therefore I have a calibration factor for each aperture:\n\tf/3.5 --> 1.32\n\tf/5.6 --> 1.38\n\tf/11  --> 1.48\n\tf/16  --> 1.59\n\tf/22  --> 1.84\n\n\nThe reason why the f/3.5 calibration factor is not 1.39 anymore, is because I noticed that using hdrgen command with -e and -a options when creating my HDR images, gave me better results. It changes the exposure of the generated HDR images and I thus only got differences between measured and HDR-derived values of max 30% (it was 50% before). Therefore, I recalculated my calibration factors with the last generated HDR images.\n\n\n>  * You should look up the recent discussion, \"[HDRI] Convert\n>    equisolidangular to equiangular projection\" which strongly suggests\n>    the Sigma 8mm f/3.5 to be a -vta / equidistant / equi-angle lens.\n>    Reprojecting the image could add some error in this case.\n\n\nWell, I think this is not the case. The SIGMA 8mm f/3.5 has an equisolid projection.\nI am quite sure as I received this information from Sigma UK. Moreover, I checked the information Sigma gave me by measuring myself the projection of the lens. I did it following David Geisler-Moroder method, that he presented at the 15th International Radiance Workshop in 2016. And I also got an equisolid projection. I could send you more info if you want.\nThe images have thus to be reprojected from equisolid to equidistant.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nClotilde\n\n\n-----Message d'origine-----\nDe\u00a0: hdri-request at radiance-online.org [mailto:hdri-request at radiance-online.org] \nEnvoy\u00e9\u00a0: jeudi 9 f\u00e9vrier 2017 23:47\n\u00c0\u00a0: hdri at radiance-online.org\nObjet\u00a0: HDRI Digest, Vol 88, Issue 7\n\n\nSend HDRI mailing list submissions to\n\thdri at radiance-online.org\n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/hdri\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n\thdri-request at radiance-online.org\n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\n\thdri-owner at radiance-online.org\n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific than \"Re: Contents of HDRI digest...\"\n\n\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n   1.
