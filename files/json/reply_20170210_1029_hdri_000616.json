{"body": "Hi Clotilde,\n\n\nHave you tried using the raw2hdr script, which calls dcraw and exiftool as well as hdrgen?  I have found this to be a more reliable method than using hdrgen alone.  However, you will need to download and install dcraw.c and exiftool to get it working.  These tools and the raw2hdr script are included in the Mac OS X command-line HDR image builder available from www.anyhere.com.\n\n\nIf you are on Linux, you can download and install the other tools from the web and use the attached script.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-February/000616.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 10, 2017 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000610", "id": "hdri_000616"}
