{"body": "Hi Farzaneh,\n\n\nYou need to be a little more specific with your question.\n\n\nIf you use the \"-c xyz\" option to raw2hdr, and output to a \".hdr\" file, it will write out XYZE pixel values.  I have not found this to be terribly accurate, however.\n\n\nAlso, this will not \"discount the illuminant\" if you have your camera's white balance fixed to daylight, as you should.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-February/000619.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 13, 2017 at 09:26AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000618", "id": "hdri_000619"}
