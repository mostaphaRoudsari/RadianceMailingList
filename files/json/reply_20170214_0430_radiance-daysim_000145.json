{"body": "Dear all,\nThank you for the fast response and the given information.\nI\u2019ve checked my weather files both visually and manually (data-wise) and no strange things showed. After this check I changed from DDS to the regular calculation option . Jan was indeed correct, the DDS-option caused the problem. I ran the simulation again and there is now a much better fit with the measurement results (very high correlation) and the \u201cSeptember-problem\u201d does not occur anymore.\nFor now it seems that this was the problem, so thank you all for helping me!\nWith kind regards,\nStefan Koenders\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-February/000145.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "S.J.M.
