{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthank you so much for solving this riddle.  I have to admit I have\nbeen blissfully unaware of the drawbacks of using RTMs. We use them as\nmuch as possible now, since I have come to appreciate the fast compile\ntimes and small octree sizes this can give us.  However, there have\nbeen quite a few projects where RTMs would take hours to compile,\ngenerating octrees many GB in size.  In such instances, we convert the\nOBJs into polygon, but without the normals.  Occasionally, we also\nneed to go via obj2rad, simply because obj2mesh fails to generate the\nRTMs.\n\n\nLooks as if we need to take a fresh look at our workflow.\n\n\nThank you for adding the limit on the source obstruction code.  I'll\ntry this out in the next few days, and re-run the project\n\n\nThanks again\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 20 February 2017 at 18:00, Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-February/012045.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "February 22, 2017 at 01:55AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012038", "id": "radiance-general_012045"}
