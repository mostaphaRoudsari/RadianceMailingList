{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nhttps://giauk.sharefile.com/d-s0cd3657a8b54fa9b\n\n\nHere is the first scene.  This one does actually compile, but takes\nforever with RTMs.\nCompiling from obj2rad output takes just over a minute and creates an\noctree of 136MB.  Compiling from RTMs (with some polygon files) takes\n200 minutes, resulting in an octree 37GB in size.  What we normally do\nin such a situation is to either reduce the number of RTMs to one per\nmaterial, or to go via obj2rad.\n\n\nI also noticed on a project I worked on a couple of years ago that the\norder in which the RTMs are listed in our master xform file matters.\nI was able back then to compile by listing the largest object\n(terrain) first.  Trying to replicating this behaviour today did not\nget the intended result.  The octree would compile either way.\n\n\nSo let me hunt down some more examples for you.\n\n\nLet me know if you need the OBJs for your testing.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 22 February 2017 at 17:11, Axel Jacobs <jacobs.axel at gmail.com> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012048.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 01, 2017 at 02:36AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012038", "id": "radiance-general_012048"}
