{"body": "Hi Axel,\n\n\nI thought you said that the actual obj2mesh call was taking forever, not the oconv operation afterwards.  If it's oconv, this is due to having many overlapping volumes, which oconv attempts to resolve.  If you didn't have so many RTM's (instanced octrees are also an issue), this would not be a problem.\n\n\nThe rules of thumb on RTMs and instanced octrees is that if you don't have multiple occurrences of something, don't use either.  And if you do, then still avoid them unless you can packaged together at least 10,000 surfaces or so per octree/RTM.  Finally, it's best if your octree or RTM fills are more-or-less cubic volume, or is well-separated from other instanced volumes.  Overlapping volumes cause issues for oconv.\n\n\nIf I understood correctly the first time, and it is obj2mesh that is taking a long time, let me know which files to check out.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012049.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 01, 2017 at 10:34AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012038", "id": "radiance-general_012049"}
