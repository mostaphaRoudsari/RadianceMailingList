{"body": "No worries, Axel.\n\n\nLarge models are a challenge, no matter what you do.  And it *can* be advantageous to use a Radiance triangle mesh for extremely complex geometry, even if it appears just once.  (Not true of octree instances, however.)  The intended use in such cases might be for a library object, such as a sculpture or highly detailed furnishing, which would be put in a mesh in a library.  Some objects like this from the CSAIL databased are provided in the Radiance library.\n\n\nWhen obj2mesh fails, this can sometimes be remedied by changing the -r and/or -n options, but not always.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012051.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 01, 2017 at 11:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012038", "id": "radiance-general_012051"}
