In this case, it is safe to assume that the lights flicker \n(simply because most do, particularly LEDs), and are not accurately \nrepresented in the HDR.  If HDR glare measurement is what you want to \ndo, this is obviously a problem.\n\n\nYou probably won't have the equipment to measure flicker.  What you can \ndo is take 5 to 10 photographs with the shortest exposure time you need \nfor your sequence.  Keep all camera settings the same.  If all \nphotographs look identical in their brightness, the light source is \nflicker free, or flickers at such high frequency or with such a low \namplitude that you can ignore it.\n\n\nHope this helps\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-March/000625.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "March 01, 2017 at 11:42AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "hdri_000623", "id": "hdri_000625"}
