{"body": "Many thanks for the prompt reply Greg,\n\n\nI appreciate the glass material perhaps describes the glazing more\naccurately.\n\n\nbf trans Glass1\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\n\nSo defining trans material as above means only the specular transmittance\nis left and diffuse part(transmittance/reflectance) is zero[?] This seems\nto be what I am looking for, but I am not sure what I've done wrong\nas the values don't agree(Radiance gives 3.20, CIE report(and our software)\n3.77). Modifying bf function to return 1 treats the material just as an\nopening(no coefficient applied) which is expected I guess.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAli Fatoorechi\nMBS Survey Software Ltd\n\n\n*62 High Street*\n\n\n\n\n*SteyningWest SussexBN44 3RD*\n\n\n*T +44 (0)1903 879323M +44(0)7830751409 <+44%207830%20751409>*\nali at surveymbs.com\nwww.surveymbs.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012060.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ali Fatoorechi", "created_at": "March 07, 2017 at 06:20AM", "created_by": "Ali_Fatoorechi", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012057", "id": "radiance-general_012060"}
