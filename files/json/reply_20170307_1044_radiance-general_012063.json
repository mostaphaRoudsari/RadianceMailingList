{"body": "Hi Ali,\n\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, this had me stumped as well.  I thought that Rdot was guaranteed to be positive for the trans material, forgetting that I had changed this behavior long ago to make behavior more consistent.  A better fix to the problem is to set:\n\n\n\tcosine = abs(Rdot);\n\n\nin your gtrans.cal file.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012063.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 07, 2017 at 10:44AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012057", "id": "radiance-general_012063"}
