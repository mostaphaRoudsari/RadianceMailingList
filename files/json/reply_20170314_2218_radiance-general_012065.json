{"body": "Hi Raquel,\n\n\nI would say yes. Just make sure that the view in the HDR header is \nappropriate or you specify it inline: evalglare -vta -vv 172 -vh 172 \nimage.hdr\n\n\nThis may slightly underestimate vertical eye illuminance calculated by \nthe software, skewing your results a bit; however, 172 is close enough \nto 180 in terms of view angle that the error is likely minimal. Still, \nif you have vertical eye illuminance measurements, supply them inline \nwith the -i flag as well.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012065.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "March 14, 2017 at 10:18PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012064", "id": "radiance-general_012065"}
