Would you please help me to find a way?\n\n\nRegards,\nNavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-March/000627.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "navid hatefnia", "created_at": "March 17, 2017 at 11:51PM", "created_by": "navid_hatefnia", "parent_id": "hdri_000629", "id": "hdri_000627"}
