{"body": "Hi Erika,\n\n\nI believe that the \"trans\" material is a reasonable start for this panel as far as you have described it.\n\n\nYour material will come out a little low on transmission, since the transmitted fraction of 0.706 multiplied by the color (0.9 or so) comes out to 64% transmission rather than your target of 71%.  This does not explain why your values are so low, but it may have to do with your sampling parameters.  Diffuse scattering from your trans surface implies that an additional \"ambient bounce\" is needed to account for this light.  Did you try increasing your -ab parameter?\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012077.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 30, 2017 at 11:15AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012076", "id": "radiance-general_012077"}
