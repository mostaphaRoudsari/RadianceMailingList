{"body": "Erika,\nHave you seen a sample of the material? I see you note a Haze value of 66%, which is somewhat telling but not directly transferrable into a radiance definition. Is the material almost completely translucent with almost no specular transmission, or is it partially clear that you can see objects through it? Your trans parameter #7 (you have 0.344) I think implies that the material is transmitting roughly one-third of its transmission as direct and non-diffused transmission (direct view through the material).\n\n\nI don't think that comment would solve your transmission loss problem, but would be worth a test rendering to see if the light transmission directionality \"looks\" the way you'd expect.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012078.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "March 30, 2017 at 12:09PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012076", "id": "radiance-general_012078"}
