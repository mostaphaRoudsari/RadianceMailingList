{"body": "Hi Charlie,\nI think you might be right in theory, but I\u2019ve never been convinced that Haze Factor is particularly accurate based on various haze factor values I\u2019ve seen on product data sheets (but I can\u2019t recall specific examples to substantiate that, so I might be projecting unnecessary skepticism). I would be quite happy to be informed of its reliability by someone with greater familiarity with the ASTM standard.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking of it the same way that EN testing for woven shade fabrics gives more accurate results than the ASTM testing. I think a Tv(n-n) value from EN testing would give you a more accurate idea of specular transmission than the Haze Factor from ASTM D-1003. There might be different degrees of rigor dictated by the two different testing standards (required measurement angles, etc.), or the calculation methods prescribed to translate that measured data to a single % value.\n\n\nI\u2019m not an expert on either standard, but in any case I think checking expected results v. simulated results is a good idea.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012080.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "March 31, 2017 at 07:11AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012076", "id": "radiance-general_012080"}
