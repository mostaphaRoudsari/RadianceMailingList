{"body": "Hi Charlie,\nThanks for the note of confidence in haze factor. I guess if I see a third-party lab ASTM D1003 report for a material, I might consider it for developing an approximate a radiance material definition.\n\n\nAt what thickness do you think haze factor (if reported) might not be reliable for a radiance definition? 5mm acrylic? 10mm laminated glass with diffusing interlayer? Multi-pane IGU maybe 30mm with diffusion applied to on one or more faces or interlayers?\n\n\nMy ASTM / EN comparison with fabric testing was not related to spectral data, but visible transmittance values given according to EN14501 with Tv,n-n & Tv,n-h (maybe the ASTM equivalent is E903 which I believe might be less accurate). Apologies I didn\u2019t think to include those in my previous message, and may have been misleading since not directly related to glazing.\n\n\nThanks,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012084.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "April 04, 2017 at 12:35PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012076", "id": "radiance-general_012084"}
