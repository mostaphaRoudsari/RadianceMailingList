{"body": "Hi Ali,\n\n\nMultiprocessing is not supported under Windows using rtrace, unfortunately.\n\n\nMkillum is not advisable if you are just computing illuminance points.\n\n\nTurning interpolation off with rtrace (-aa 0) is a reasonable thing to do for point calculations, especially if you have only a handful of values you are computing.  The payoff for the ambient cache is when you have many bounces and/or many calculation points.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012092.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 11, 2017 at 01:04PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012091", "id": "radiance-general_012092"}
