{"body": "Hello Ali,\n\n\nI think you are missing the \"order of magnitude\" (i.e. the eXXXX value\nafter the number) of the scientific notation. In \"normal math\", the numbers\nyou are getting are:\n\n\n-b 1:       0.09245390\n-b 10:     0.9045287\n-b 100:   9.023538e\n-b 1000: 90.39278\n\n\nwhich are different in one order of magnitude, just as your -b input.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2017-04-21 8:56 GMT-03:00 Ali Fatoorechi <ali at surveymbs.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012099.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 06:05AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012098", "id": "radiance-general_012099"}
