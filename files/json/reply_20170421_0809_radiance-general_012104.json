{"body": "Hi Ali,\n\n\nI agree that this is an interesting and unexpected result.  I've looked over the code, and I suspect the cause is having so many ambient samples for a small starting radiance is causing the ambient super-sampling code to hit the 1e-7 (FTINY) threshold for ignoring differences between adjacent ambient divisions.\n\n\nWhat happens to your series when you use -as 0.  I would expect the errors to go up for all brightnesses, but hopefully you will at least get the same errors for all gensky -b settings at that point.  This would confirm my suspicion, and allow me to implement a fix.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012104.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "April 21, 2017 at 08:09AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012098", "id": "radiance-general_012104"}
