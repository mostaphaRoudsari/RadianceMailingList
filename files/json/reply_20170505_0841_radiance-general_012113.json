{"body": "Hi Michael,\n\n\nAdding back original message, which somehow got lost in my spam folder...\n\n\nWhich version of Radiance are you using?  (I.e., what does \"rpict -version\" say?)  I found a couple of minor sampling issues in the interreflection code, though I'm not sure if they could cause this effect.  The last fix was a couple of weeks ago, so pretty recent by Radiance standards.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  If you send me your scene in a private e-mail, I'll have a closer look when I get a chance.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012113.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 05, 2017 at 08:41AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012110", "id": "radiance-general_012113"}
