{"body": "I've gotten this error on multiple projects, It's visible in rvu, rpict\nresults and images made with rtrace.  It is most apparent on -ab 1 so it\ncomes from either the light through the skylight direct from skyglow (with\na clear material) or the first ray through the trans material from a direct\nsource.  Small openings have more pronounced patterning compared with\nlarger openings (large opening at top small opening at bottom:\nhttps://goo.gl/photos/stsFoix8s4cE3wk46).  It looks like a diffraction\npattern and kind of behaves like one (smaller opening, more prominent),\ndoes something in the ray sampling explain why the apertures act like\ndiffraction slits?  would it go away with a really high -ad?  is it also\nthere with ambient caching, but the interpolation smooths it out?\n\n\nStephen Wasilewski\n*LOISOS *+* UBBELOHDE*\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwww.coolshadow.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012114.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stephen Wasilewski", "created_at": "May 05, 2017 at 10:02AM", "created_by": "Stephen_Wasilewski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012110", "id": "radiance-general_012114"}
