{"body": "This artifact appears to be fixed in the CVS head.  It must have been related to sample collision avoidance, which I was doing in a rather ham-fisted way in the first Hessian implementation.  (And yes, it affected results with -aa 0 more noticeably.)  The newer version of ambcomp.c uses a more subtle and successful rejection sampling method, which doesn't bias the original samples.\n\n\nI put this fix in back in October, but we've been waiting on some unrelated code changes before building the changes into the latest Windows distro.  So, if you're working from that, or you haven't installed the more recent binaries for Linux or Mac, you should do that first.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012115.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 05, 2017 at 10:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012110", "id": "radiance-general_012115"}
