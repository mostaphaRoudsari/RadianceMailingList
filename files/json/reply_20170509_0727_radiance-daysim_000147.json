{"body": "Hi Kerger,\n\n\nYou will not receive any diffuse contributions in your model, because \nthe ambient bounce setting (ab) is 0. Only direct sunlight values will \nbe returned--static_system.dir.dc will show some results when sensors \ncan directly see the direct solar sources. Try increasing ab to \nsomething larger. 2 is a good testing value, and 6 is a good value for \nhigh quality results. An -lr of setting of 0 means no limit; therefore, \nit should not influence your results.\n\n\n > When I changed my limit reflections parameter (-lr) to >/= 1. This \nreturned both direct and diffuse coefficients.\n\n\nI'm not sure how this could be with an ab setting of 0.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-May/000147.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "May 09, 2017 at 07:27AM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "radiance-daysim_000146", "id": "radiance-daysim_000147"}
