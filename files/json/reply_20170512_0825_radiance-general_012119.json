{"body": "Hi Eleonora,\n\n\nThe gendaymtx command and gendaylit are separate implementations based on the Perez model with no code in common.  The gendaylit program was developed first, long ago by Jean-Jacques Delaunay, then more recently expanded, updated and improved by Jan Wienold and Wendelin Sprenger.  In contrast, the gendaymtx program was derived a few years ago from C code provided by Ian Ashdown.  The two programs have been spot-checked against each other, but as far as I know, no one has done a thorough comparison of either the methods or the outputs to ensure they behave the same.  In fact, there is some room for interpretation in Perez's model, and numerous places where exceptional values must be caught and dealt with.  Finally, I don't think all the options of gendaylit are included in gendaymtx.\n\n\nIf you can be more specific by checking when, where and by how much your output vectors differ, this would help.  Or at the least, attach the relevant part(s) of your London weather file so we can check ourselves.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012119.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 12, 2017 at 08:25AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012118", "id": "radiance-general_012119"}
