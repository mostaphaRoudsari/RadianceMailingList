{"body": "Thanks Greg and thanks Jan.\n\n\nJan, I had a look at your presentation and tried a comparison with the -i 60 option in gendaylit, but that did not improve much the correlation with gendaymtx.\n\n\nOver the whole year the differences are really not that big, the coefficient of correlation for the London wea file is 0.97. Only cause I was expecting identical results, I was worried I had left something out in the gendaylit command options, that might have been important.\n\n\nI attached a scatter plot with the results for the whole year, and a temporal map with the R coefficient over the sky patches for each hour. Some of the \u2018worst' correlations (still minor) are for high sun angles.\n\n\nThe wea I used was derived from the epw available from the Energy Plus website, using epw2wea (https://energyplus.net/weather-location/europe_wmo_region_6/GBR/GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC).\n\n\nThanks again\nEleonora\n\n\n[cid:d219e77c-265c-4a1f-a811-42725a6893e9 at eurprd04.prod.outlook.com]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012121.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eleonora Brembilla", "created_at": "May 13, 2017 at 09:16AM", "created_by": "Eleonora_Brembilla", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012118", "id": "radiance-general_012121"}
