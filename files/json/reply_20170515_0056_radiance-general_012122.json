{"body": "Hi Eleonora,\n\n\nthanks for evaluating this!\n\n\nAre you sure about the units? 2000W/m2/sr would mean more than 350000 \ncd/m2. On the other hand, if the graph would show luminance, then this \nmust be just one patch looking to the north? Already for the timestep \nyou sent (with low irradiation data) it gives me more than 30000 cd/m2 \nclose to the sun position (using gendaylit).\n\n\nBesides the units (I assume you plot cd/m2 for one patch towards the \nnorth), looking at the graph I think it is necessary to look into that \ndeeper to find out the reasons for the deviations. As far as I can see \nthis is not caused by the routines we added to gendaylit in order \nprevent problems around sunset/sunrise.\n\n\nA high r2 does not mean there is no problem- looking at the figure you \ncan see a systematic behavior: at high values, gendaymtx delivers higher \nvalues than gendaylit, for lower ones it is the opposite. The vertical \nline for low gendaylit values could be caused by the sunrise/sunset \ncorrections. Especially for the lower values around 2000 there seems \nlike a deviation around 40-50% between the two implementations - this is \ndefinitely too much. Actually the implementation should really deliver \nthe same values (except for the sunrise/sunset) - of course \nrounding/variable types and so on could lead to some small deviations, \nbut not like this and also not as systematic like this.\n\n\ncheers\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012122.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "May 15, 2017 at 12:56AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012118", "id": "radiance-general_012122"}
