{"body": "Hi Jan\n\n\nMmm\u2026 I used the units as specified in the man page for gendaylit, it says the default output is in W/m2/sr. All the 146 patches are plotted in the graph, at all time steps during daylight time (there are 146 x 4586 points).\n\n\nRunning exactly the same analysis without the sun in the sky description (-s option in both gendaylit and gendaymtx) led to a more symmetric correlation (attached).\n\n\nMaybe the assignment of the sun contribution to the three nearest sky patches is done slightly differently in genskyvec and in gendaymtx?\n\n\nCheers\nEleonora\n\n\n[cid:0DB25B1A-8D87-40C1-A0D6-612C23FCC5B2 at lboro.ac.uk]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012123.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Eleonora Brembilla", "created_at": "May 15, 2017 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "Eleonora_Brembilla", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012118", "id": "radiance-general_012123"}
