{"body": "Hi Eleonora,\n\n\nYes - if you include the sun then you get that high values for some \npatches. To compare the Perez-sky implementations, you should leave out \nthe sun as you did now.\n\n\nThe graph looks better now- even though the spread cannot be explained \nby rounding etc. Now the deviation looks like randomly distributed \n(except the very low values, which is the sunset/sunrise issue).\nOne possible explanation for the spread would be that one of the tools \ngendaymtx or genskyvec is using the value in the middle of the patch \nwhere the other one is using an average of the patch. Since the Perez \ndistribution is non-linear, those values could differ slightly in both \ndirections. But I'm not deep enough into that, maybe someone else can \nexplain it. If both tools are doing the same, then I have no idea at the \nmoment where this deviation (rough guess: up to 10% ) is coming from. \nFor a systematic error (like a mistake in one of the implementations) it \nlooks too randomly distributed.\n\n\ncheers\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012125.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "May 16, 2017 at 08:55AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012118", "id": "radiance-general_012125"}
