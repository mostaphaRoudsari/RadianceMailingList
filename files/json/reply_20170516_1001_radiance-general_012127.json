{"body": "Hi David,\n\n\nIt's difficult to say for certain, but you should know that altering your .bashrc file only affects the next open Terminal window.  It doesn't change the RAYPATH setting in the shell you already have running.\n\n\nYou should open a new Terminal window and enter \"echo $RAYPATH\" to make sure your environment setting is in effect.  If it is, and you can read the associated directory, then something else must be wrong.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012127.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "May 16, 2017 at 10:01AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012126", "id": "radiance-general_012127"}
