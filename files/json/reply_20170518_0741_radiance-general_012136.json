{"body": "Hi Andrea,\n\n\nI don't think trans material is the right way to model fabrics, since \nfabrics change their behavior depending on the angle of incidence. And \nsince you don't have an option to model an angular behavior with trans \nit is better to use another material type. One option doing it is using \nBRTDfunc and \"control\" the direct transmitted part via a cal file. \nTypical fabrics have a very constant total transmission until 75\u00b0 and \nthen a drop similar as a glass. This can be modelled with an additional \nglass layer with a very low refraction index. The direct transmission \ndepends on the fabric type and weaving process - typically you have \ncut-off angles for the direct transmission between 60-75\u00b0. This behavior \nyou can model with a cal file. I've done that recently for a big \nsimulation study as basis for the new European daylight standard and you \ncan come close to the real behavior of the fabrics with this modeling \napproach. We compared BTDF measurements with the model.\n\n\ngood luck\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012136.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "May 18, 2017 at 07:41AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012135", "id": "radiance-general_012136"}
