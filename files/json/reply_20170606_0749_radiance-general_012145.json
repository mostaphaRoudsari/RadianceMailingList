{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nI am not sure there is a way to do what you are asking with rcalc.  You can use input fields rather than separators with an input format, e.g.:\n\n\n\trcalc -i '${n1},${n2},$(s3),${n4}'\n\n\nThis loads the first two comma-separated values as numbers, the third as a string, and the fourth as a number again.  (This is the difference between using curly braces and parentheses in rcalc format fields.)  However, there is not much you can do with string fields other than repeat them in the output.  They cannot be the arguments or results of any expressions or formulas.  Generally, they are simply used as place-holders or a means to repeat the input in the output using a similarly constructed output format (-o option).\n\n\nYou could use the \"cond\" variable to decide whether to output a record or not in your example, like so:\n\n\n\trcalc -i '${n1},${n2},$(s3),${n4}' -e 'cond=n2-n1' -o '$(s3)'\n\n\nThis would only output the third field when the second is greater than the first.  It would not output \"0\" otherwise, but no line at all.\n\n\nI don't know if this helps.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-June/012145.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 06, 2017 at 07:49AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012144", "id": "radiance-general_012145"}
