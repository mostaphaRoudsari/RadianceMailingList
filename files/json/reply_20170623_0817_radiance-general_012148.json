{"body": "Hi Marouane,\n\n\nYour fabric has very thin lines in it, which may be difficult to integrate with the normal sampling density.  Since the pattern seems to repeat, I recommend that you restrict your sampling area using the genBSDF -dim option to set a bounding box.  Looking at your file, the pattern appears to repeat every 42 mm.  You can set a square area near the middle of your fabric with this diameter like so:\n\n\n\tgenBSDF +f +b -geom millimeter -dim 1500 1542 1500 1542 -1 0 0.rad > 0.xml\n\n\nThis seems to produce something reasonably symmetric when I try it.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-June/012148.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 23, 2017 at 08:17AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012147", "id": "radiance-general_012148"}
