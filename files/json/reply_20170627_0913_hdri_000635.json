{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nWhat is the resolution of your image, and how many pixels does the sun cover?  Could this be simply due to quantization error?  The function moves pixels around, not changing their magnitude, and the accuracy can never be better than +/- 1/(number of pixels in sun).\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000635.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 27, 2017 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000633", "id": "hdri_000635"}
