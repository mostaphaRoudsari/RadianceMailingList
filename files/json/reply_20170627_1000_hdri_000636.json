{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthe image is 5000x5000 pixels.\n\n\nThe sun is 225 pixels for the original and the corrected for the 5\u00b0 \nposition. I also tested other positions - the results are in the table \nbelow.\n\n\nangle [\u00b0] \tPix-Sun-org \tPix-Sun-corr \tPixel-Ratio \tsolid angle vta \nsolid angle equi-dist. \tSolid-Angle-Ratio\n5 \t225 \t225 \t1.00 \t2.654E-07 \t3.20E-07 \t0.83\n15 \t204 \t204 \t1.00 \t2.915E-07 \t3.20E-07 \t0.91\n25 \t189 \t187 \t1.01 \t3.157E-07 \t3.20E-07 \t0.99\n45 \t167 \t159 \t1.05 \t3.548E-07 \t3.20E-07 \t1.11\n75 \t151 \t138 \t1.09 \t3.902E-07 \t3.20E-07 \t1.22\n\n\nAccording to this, the ratio of the \"sun\" pixels change after 25\u00b0, which \nis the angle when the solid-angle for vta gets larger than the \nsolid-angle of the equi-solid-angle projection.\n\n\nIn the table the column two and three are the amount of pixels for the \nsun for the two images, column 4 is a ratio for those two, the last \ncolumn is the ratio of the two solid angles.\n\n\nFYI, these are the scripts for producing the files:\n\n\nfor i in 5 15 25 45 75; do gensky -ang $i 0 +s >sk_$i.rad; oconv  -f \nsk_$i.rad >sk_$i.oct; rpict -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 -1 0 -vta -vv 180 \n-vh 180 -x 5000 -y 5000 -dc 0 -dj 0 -ps 0 sk_$i.oct >sk_$i.hdr & done\nfor i in 5 15 25 45 75; do pcomb -f \n/usr/local/radiance/lib/fisheye_corr.cal -o sk_$i.hdr | getinfo2 -a \n\"VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180\" >sk_$i\"corr.hdr\"; done\n\n\nThe solid angles I calculated with pcomb (and checked also with \nevalglare). The amount of pixels I calculated with  pvalue -H -h -o -b  \nimage.hdr |awk '{if ($3>1) print $0}'|wc -l and checked also with \nevalglare.\n\n\ncheers\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000636.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "June 27, 2017 at 10:00AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000633", "id": "hdri_000636"}
