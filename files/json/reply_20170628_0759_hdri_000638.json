{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthanks for this - it helps a bit, but I think I'm still doing sth wrong.\n\n\nOriginally I wanted to know the influence of mapping, if there is a high \nintense glare source at the border. I wanted to know, how much the error \nis, when a equidsolid-angle image is treated as vta without mapping. \nUsing gensky was just an easy way to create a \"patch\" at the border of \nan image. If the sun disk is represented correctly or not, does not \nmatter to me, I just want to see how this patch is mapped.\n\n\nThen in the next step I realized that the number of pixels (between \noriginal and mapped) did not change for the 5\u00b0 position and then I \nwanted to investigate a bit more - that's where I'm still stuck.\n\n\nNow I have re-run my script generating 15000x15000 images.\n\n\nWhat I do now:\n\n\n1. Original image (assumed as equisolidangle): I calculate the solid \nangle per pixel simply by 2*pi/no_pixel_hemisphere (for a 15000x15000 \nthis is 176714668). Then I count the pixels in that image for the patch \nand multiply by this value. So I get as result the solid angle of the \npatch in the original image.\n\n\n2. Mapped image: I calculate the solid angle of the patch by your pcomb \ncommand (I also verified it by evalglare and got the same value +-0.2%, \nit was just 10min slower per image using evalglare;-)). The mapped image \nhas a valid -vta view heady entry.\n\n\n\n\nActually I expected them to be the same, but in my results they are not. \nI really don't know what I'm doing wrong. For the remapping, what does \npcomb \"expect\" for the view entry in the header in the original image \n(which is equisolid)? I used -vta -vv 180 -vh 180. Maybe this is a mistake?\n\n\n\n\nBelow you see the result of the calculations in 5\u00b0 steps (the angle is \ncounted from the border to the center):\n\n\nangle \tNo of Pixels of patch before remapping \tNo of Pixels of patch \nafter remapping \tsolid_angle_before_remapping (equisolidangle) \nsolid_angle_after_remapping (equidistant) \tDeviation of solid angle\n[\u00b0] \t\t\t[sr] \t[sr] \t[%]\n5 \t2028 \t2028 \t7.21E-05 \t6.00E-05 \t17%\n10 \t1864 \t1928 \t6.63E-05 \t5.79E-05 \t13%\n15 \t1778 \t1850 \t6.32E-05 \t5.77E-05 \t9%\n20 \t1695 \t1772 \t6.03E-05 \t5.74E-05 \t5%\n25 \t1622 \t1700 \t5.77E-05 \t5.69E-05 \t1%\n30 \t1562 \t1652 \t5.55E-05 \t5.69E-05 \t-2%\n35 \t1485 \t1590 \t5.28E-05 \t5.58E-05 \t-6%\n40 \t1431 \t1548 \t5.09E-05 \t5.51E-05 \t-8%\n45 \t1402 \t1524 \t4.98E-05 \t5.54E-05 \t-11%\n50 \t1358 \t1484 \t4.83E-05 \t5.49E-05 \t-14%\n55 \t1321 \t1448 \t4.70E-05 \t5.46E-05 \t-16%\n60 \t1310 \t1436 \t4.66E-05 \t5.50E-05 \t-18%\n65 \t1271 \t1402 \t4.52E-05 \t5.40E-05 \t-20%\n70 \t1259 \t1388 \t4.48E-05 \t5.41E-05 \t-21%\n75 \t1254 \t1384 \t4.46E-05 \t5.44E-05 \t-22%\n80 \t1239 \t1366 \t4.41E-05 \t5.41E-05 \t-23%\n85 \t1237 \t1364 \t4.40E-05 \t5.43E-05 \t-23%\n\n\n\n\nGraphically it looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nIn my opinion the curves should more or less match, the \"dropping\" is \njust related to my \"lazy\" generation of the patch by gensky, but this is \nnot important.\n\n\nThx for the help.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000638.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "June 28, 2017 at 07:59AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000633", "id": "hdri_000638"}
