{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthank you so much - you solved the paradoxon of the solid angle ;-):-)! \nI was already doubting the first law of thermodynamics...  I'm glad it \nis just a too small buffer setting in the pcomb-code.\n\n\n\n\nSince several people experience actually discrepancies between measured \nilluminance and calculated from the image (and actually all of them have \nfull frame cameras with a large resolution), it would be good to know \nWHEN you updated pcomb to the WINSIZ to 63. This might be an partial \nexplanation for the problems they experienced. Many people work on \nwindows and probably still use an old pcomb version and just downloaded \nthe fisheye_corr.cal.\n\n\nAlso it would be good to know until which image size the current version \nworks properly.\nFor the 15000 image, it was not just at the border where the deviation \noccurred - also in the centre there was a deviation of the solid angle \nof more than 20%.\n\n\nI will do a new test with several resolutions and different WINSIZ \nsettings, as soon as I'm back from my mandatory safety training... and \nsure 2% deviation is totally fine.\n\n\nThanks again for the help!\n\n\nCheers\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000641.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "June 29, 2017 at 03:50AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000633", "id": "hdri_000641"}
