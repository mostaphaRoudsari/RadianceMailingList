{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI tested now again for 5000x5000 and 15000x15000 two WINSIZ setting (127 \nand 1027):\n\n\nfor 127 I get a max deviation of the patch solid angle of 11% for the \n5000x5000 and 18% for the 15000x15000.\n\n\nfor the 1027 : 8% for the 5000x5000 and 5% 15000x15000. The memory usage \nwas in both case not really big - never more than 900kB (compared to \nevalglare this is nothing... the 15000x15000 resulted in 14GB..)\n\n\nI think this is fine now... for many angles the error is also much \nsmaller. I'm glad we solved this problem - thanks again!\n\n\nI have to say that my previous table was generated with a pcomb version \nfrom the 5.0 release, using a setting of 64 for WINSIZ...\n\n\nI was not aware of the needed update of pcomb when using the \nfisheye_corr.cal. I'm usually running the official release on our server \nfor \"production\" for all users and not the head release - but maybe I \nshould change this philosophy.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000642.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "June 29, 2017 at 11:53AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000633", "id": "hdri_000642"}
