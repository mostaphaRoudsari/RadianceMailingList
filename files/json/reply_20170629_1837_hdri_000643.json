{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nThanks for the excellent follow-up on this.  I should have thought about the pcomb buffer issue earlier, as David Geisler-Moroder and I did identify it early on as a potential source of error late last July.  I believe I updated the buffer size at that time, though I can't check because I am blocked from radiance-online.org from where I am in Myanmar, or else the site is down at the moment.\n\n\nAs to watching for important changes in Radiance, I usually put them in the ReleaseNotes document, though I didn't mention this one it seems.  You can save the link below and check it periodically, or I can put you on the list of e-mails to get CVS check-in notices if you really want to hear what's going on.\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/doc/notes/ReleaseNotes\n\n\nAs for pcomb, I am thinking about redesigning it so I don't have this buffer limitation.  I could borrow the LRU scanline replacement code I developed for findglare and avoid this issue altogether.  Simply increasing the buffer size isn't a full solution, as we would need to increase it to the full image size to avoid all such bugs, which would be prohibitive if you were to give pcomb a large number of images....\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000643.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 29, 2017 at 06:37PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000633", "id": "hdri_000643"}
