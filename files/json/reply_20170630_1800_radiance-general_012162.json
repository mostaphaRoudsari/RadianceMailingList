{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nI had a look at your files.  Thanks for providing a link.\n\n\nLine 48 of the file Components/Group_1.rad has a duplicate real argument count, which causes this file not be be included:\n\n\n\t## guessed Material\n\n\n\tvoid    glass   glass1_Group_1\n\t0\n\t0\n\t3       3       0.75 0.75 0.75\n\n\nDeleting the second '3' above fixes the issue.  If this file was generated automatically, you should talk to the people who wrote that software.  It's also apparent that they aren't putting the proper dependencies into the \"scene.rif\" file.  This should include lines like:\n\n\n\tobjects= Materials/[Color_M06].mat Materials/[Color_M05].mat Materials/glass3.mat Materials/glass1.mat Materials/Default_Material.mat\n\tobjects= Materials/[Color_M00].mat Materials/Lisanne_Boots.mat Materials/[Color_M04].mat Materials/Color_M1.mat\n\n\n...and so on.\n\n\nAlso, the \"guessed\" materials are terrible.  Most of them have 50% specular reflectance, which makes them metallic.  This is probably the main cause of noise in your images.  If you put in more reasonable material values, preferably with specularity less than 0.04 or so, your results will improve substantially.  Reserve specularities above 0.05 for metallic materials.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-June/012162.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "June 30, 2017 at 06:00PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012149", "id": "radiance-general_012162"}
