{"body": "Thaks Greg,  I ended up trying something like this (correct syntax for\nanyone who is curious, the -u 10 allows for a standard input read within\nthe loop):\n\n\nwhile read -u 10 p;\ndo\nrsensor -vp $p -h -rd 100000 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -n 8 -w -ab 0 uniform.dat\ntest.oct\ndone 10<vpts.txt\n\n\nbut it is very slow (since it is making lots of successive calls to rsensor\nand has to load the octree into memory each time).  Ultimately, I realized\nthat for my purposes I could just correct the source with 1/cos and then\nuse rtrace normally.\n\n\nStephen Wasilewski\n*LOISOS *+* UBBELOHDE*\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwww.coolshadow.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012164.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Stephen Wasilewski", "created_at": "July 03, 2017 at 09:44AM", "created_by": "Stephen_Wasilewski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012154", "id": "radiance-general_012164"}
