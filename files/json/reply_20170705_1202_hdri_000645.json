{"body": "Hi Farzaneh,\n\n\nthe integral of the entire image, if it covers one hemisphere, would \nequal to the illuminance at the entrance pupil of your lens. However, I \nguess that you are more interested in relating pixel values to the \nilluminance at the corresponding locations on the reflective surfaces. \nFor that, you could approximate the illuminance from luminance (what is \nwhat you camera measures, if it is properly calibrated), as long as you \ncan assume the surface to be perfectly diffuse. This introduces errors, \nbut may give some reasonable idea at least if you pick only appropriate \nsurfaces without strong specular / glossy reflection.\n\n\nYou may want to go through John's slides from last year's Radiance \nworkshop: \nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2016-padua/presentations/202-Mardaljevic-DaylightInHeritageSpaces.pdf\n\n\nWe also presented a method employing markers some time ago: \nhttps://zenodo.org/record/545809#.WV03j4qkJUM\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-July/000645.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
