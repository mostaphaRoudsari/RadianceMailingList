{"body": "Hi Andrea,\n\n\nIf I understood your question correctly, I would say it is definitely\npossible to get all that data from a Radiance Model and, after\nunderstanding how the command line and Radiance programs work, should not\nreally be that hard.\n\n\nThe programs GENSKY allows you define CIE clear and overcast skies, and\neven control the color of the sky and ignore the sun. You can always delete\nthe sky as well, and use a black (i.e. 0% reflection) model for calculating\nthe direct sunlight.\n\n\nIf you are going to perform static simulations (i.e. choosing a certain\ndate and time of the year), I would just use RTRACE program (I think Axel's\nRadiance Cookbook has all the info you need to start doing all this). HINT:\nYou can use the XFORM \"-m\" option for transforming your model into a\ncompletely black world.\n\n\nIf you are going to perform climate-based daylight simulations, well...\neverything gets messier and requires a longer explanation. I would start by\ngoing through the first couple of tutorials in the website in order to\nunderstand how Radiance works.\n\n\nFinal comment + disclaimer: I am the developer of Groundhog, so I would use\nthat tool in order to create the model within SketchUp and export it to\nRadiance. *However, I have not ever used another tool, so there may be\nbetter ones out there.*\n\n\nKind regards\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n2017-07-08 11:56 GMT-04:00 Andrea Laenens <\nandrea.laenens at student.kuleuven.be>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012169.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "July 13, 2017 at 01:37PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012167", "id": "radiance-general_012169"}
