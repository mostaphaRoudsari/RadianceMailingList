{"body": "Hi John,\n\n\nIf I understand your query, you just want to \"see\" what is within a certain distance from a point -- it that right?\n\n\nTo generate an image from the light source's perspective to some maximum distance, just use an rpict or rvu view with a fisheye view and aft clipping distance:\n\n\n\t-vta -vp Lx Ly Lz -vh 360 -vv 360 -va Dmax\n\n\nWhere (Lx,Ly,Lz) is the position of your light source (or just in front of it) and Dmax is how far you want to look.  You may also need the -vd and -vu specs to specify the central view direction and distance.  The above will generate a 360\u00b0 fisheye view, which may be larger than you want, so adjust accordingly.\n\n\nIf instead you want to illuminate your scene, but only for points within some distance of a source, you can use the \"glow\" type:\n\n\nvoid glow limited_light\n0\n0\n4 1000 1000 1000 Dmax\n\n\nlimited_light sphere limited_bulb\n0\n0\n5 Lx Ly Lz 1\n\n\nAgain, you'll need to insert the appropriate values for your source position, and this light will still have a 1/r^2 fall-off.  Also, make sure to set \"-ab 0\" in your rendering, so it doesn't try to count the glow source in the indirect calculation.\n\n\nIf you want to eliminate the fall-off, you can use a compensating pattern like so:\n\n\nvoid brightfunc square_riseup\n2 T*T .\n0\n0\n\n\nsquare_riseup glow limited_light\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 Dmax\n\n\nlimited_light sphere limited_bulb\n0\n0\n5 Lx Ly Lz 1\n\n\nThis will still have a cosine-orientation effect on your surfaces, but no fall-off.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012172.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 16, 2017 at 05:11PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012170", "id": "radiance-general_012172"}
