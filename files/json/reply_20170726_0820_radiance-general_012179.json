{"body": "Hi Kars. Just a friendly tip that there is another mailing list dedicated to HDR image capture/manipulation. See last row of the table on this page: https://radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists\nThere's a lot of cross-subscribers between lists, so you may still get a response without re-posting. If your interests lie particularly in HDR imaging, you also might want to subscribe to the HDRI list to keep up with future topics.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012179.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "July 26, 2017 at 08:20AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012177", "id": "radiance-general_012179"}
