{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your quick response!\n\n\nThe formula you provided works for me with a single LDR image and thus a single exposure time, but I'm stuck in how I should insert the multiple exposure times (of the 7 LDR images to form the HDR image) in exposure_secs and get the correct EXPOSURE, could you maybe explain this further?\n\n\nMaking use of the equal-energy illuminant E, is it assumed that the white point remains constant (1/3, 1/3)? I'm asking this since I'm taking outdoor photographs, where the CCT (and thereby the white point) changes constantly, assuming a constant white point would therefore affect the accuracy of the conversion to luminance values.\n\n\nKind regards,\nKars\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012185.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Morsink, K.", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 08:22AM", "created_by": "Morsink,_K.", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012177", "id": "radiance-general_012185"}
