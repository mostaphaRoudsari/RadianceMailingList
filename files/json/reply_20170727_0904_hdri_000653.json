{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI'm using hdrgen to create the hdr images. I'm asking to understand how the EXPOSURE value of the hdr image can be linked back to the different exposure times of the original images. This to better understand the origin of this value and how it is used to compute the luminance values. I'm not using any other software. But from your answer I understand that this is not so straightforward to check?\n\n\nThank you for your time and clarification.\n\n\nKind regards,\nKars\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: Re: [HDRI] [Radiance-general] How does Pvalue determine CCT in HDR images and how is the EV of a HDR image determined?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-July/000653.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Morsink, K.", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 09:04AM", "created_by": "Morsink,_K.", "parent_id": "hdri_000649", "id": "hdri_000653"}
