{"body": "OK, but I'm still not clear what you are hoping to check.  Do you want to check values in each original image against the output of hdrgen?  The easiest way to do that would be to feed hdrgen a single image along with the response curve (using the -r option).  That's not really a check on hdrgen, though, since you would only be comparing it to itself for consistency.\n\n\nYou can use the output of ra_xyze piped into pvalue as we discussed earlier, then pull up individual pixel values in the image in Photoshop or your favorite tool.  The luminance should approximately equal this:\n\n\n\tluminance = sample_to_nits * (lin(R)*0.213 + lin(G)*0.715 + lin(B)*0.072)\n\n\n\tlin(p) = ((p+.5)/256)^2.2\n\n\n\tR,G,B = pixel components in 0-255 range\n\n\nThe linearization function above doesn't do a perfect job, since each camera has its own response function, and this is one of the things hdrgen figures out for you.  In particular, I would expect larger errors in the shadow regions of each exposure.\n\n\nDoes this help?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-July/000654.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 27, 2017 at 09:19AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000649", "id": "hdri_000654"}
