{"body": "Hello Greg,\n\n\nthank you very much for your quick response and the good answers.\nAbbout reflectivity / reflectance, I just found this\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance#Reflectivity\n\n\nI am also using SolTrace, also from NREL, maybe you know it. It's a\nmore technical raytracer (path tracing, starting at the light source),\nnot considering colors, only energy.\n\n\nNow I would like to make a rendering of a concentrating solar tower\nplant. But since I have only very little experience with rendering so\nfar I can't get the materials right, or I am missing something else.\n\n\nA solar tower plant consists of thousands of tracking mirrors reflection \nsolar radiation\nonto a receiver at the top of a tower.\n\n\nTower and receiver:\nhttp://cspworld.org/sites/default/files/map/images/eSolarBabcockWilkoxReceiver.jpg\n\n\nHeliostats scattered around the tower\nhttp://www.solartowersystems.com/mediapool/99/994662/resources/big_21459290_0_350-279.jpg\n\n\nThis is what I have so far\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Vgf6Zuz\n\n\nBut I was not able to see a light spot of the heliostat on the receiver \n(large black cylinder with lid).\nI would have expected it at the spot marked in blue.\n\n\nThe scene is illuminated by a sun disk in zenith (0, 0, 1, from \ngendaylit) and a downward\npointing spot (red) directly above the heliostat (green). Heliostat \ndiameter is 10 m.\n\n\nThis is the sun I am using at the moment\n\n\nvoid light sun\n0\n0\n3 7.131e+004, 7.131e+004, 7.131e+004\n\n\ngendaylit originally returned\n\n\nvoid light sun\n0\n0\n3 7.131e+006, 7.131e+006, 7.131e+006\n\n\nbut this oversaturates my scene completely and it looks like a \nwhite-out.\n\n\nI tried several materials for the heliostat (glossy colors, glass with \nno transmittance, mirror).\n\n\nSo far I tried a red plastic material for the receiver and played a bit \nwith the specularity\nand roughness but could not get it to reflect anything towards the \ncamera.\n\n\nDo you have some ideas how I could get this to work?\n\n\nKind regards,\nJoe\n\n\nAm 27.07.2017 19:37 schrieb Greg Ward:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012188.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe", "created_at": "July 28, 2017 at 02:18AM", "created_by": "Joe", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012183", "id": "radiance-general_012188"}
