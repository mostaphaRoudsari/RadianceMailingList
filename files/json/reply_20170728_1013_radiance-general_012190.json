{"body": "Hi Joe,\n\n\nRegarding reflectivity, I suppose you could say that for any opaque material, reflectivity==reflectance.  Since Radiance materials (with the possible exceptions of \"dielectric,\" \"interface\" and \"mist\") don't really consider volumes, this equality generally applies.\n\n\nI don't really know anything about SolTrace, but from your brief description, it sounds like it might be the right tool for your purpose.\n\n\nThe basic problem with Radiance is that as a light-backwards ray-tracer, it needs to know where to look for light sources, particularly tiny ones like the sun.  There is a trick you can use, which is the \"mirror\" material light, which enables a virtual light source search.  That brings other issue, especially once you go to a full array.  By the way, it employs the \"spotlight\" mechanism internally to avoid unnecessary source tests, so you had a good idea with that.\n\n\nI remember clearly that someone covered this in a Radiance workshop presentation.  Can someone post the link for me?  I haven't managed to locate it with any of my searches.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012190.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 28, 2017 at 10:13AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012183", "id": "radiance-general_012190"}
