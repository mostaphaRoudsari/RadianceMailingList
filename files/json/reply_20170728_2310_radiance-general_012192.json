{"body": "Hello Greg,\n\n\nso, as defined in Radiance, is specularity == reflectivity == reflectance?\n\n\nI guess you mean this presentation:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2008-fribourg/Content/Augsburger/GermainAugsburgerPresentation.pdf\n\n\nHe was using Radiance like SolTrace, to calculate the flux distribution \non the receiver.\n\n\nHe calculated the surface normals at the receiver panels sent them\ninto the scene using rtrace.\n\n\nI am not sure if I understood that correctly:\nThe material \"mirror\" uses sort of mimics the spotlight, so only\nshooting rays within a fixed cone angle towards the light sources\nor other illumination surfaces?\n\n\nI will also look into the photon mapping, have never used that before.\n\n\nWell, I would like to create realistic renderings of these power plands \nat different values of solar irradiance, e.g. 500 and 1000 W / m^2.\n\n\nImages like\n\n\nhttp://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/Portaldata/1/Resources/bilder/portal/portal_2011_7/turmkraftwerk.jpg\n\n\nhttp://www.bine.info/fileadmin/content/Publikationen/Themen-Infos/II_2013/themen_0213_29.jpg\n\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2b/b8/fb/2bb8fb6e9d4194bb87d32a5b0855182b.jpg\n\n\nBut instead of \"cheating\" myself into a glowing receiver, I would\nrather have it to be illuminated by the heliostats.\n\n\nMaybe also with some mist:\n\n\nhttps://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme812/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.eme812/files/Lesson07/7.2solucarps10.png\n\n\nDo you think it is possible to create images like that at all?\n\n\nKind regards and thanks for your patience :)\n\n\nJoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 28.07.2017 um 19:24 schrieb Greg Ward:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012192.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe", "created_at": "July 28, 2017 at 11:10PM", "created_by": "Joe", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012183", "id": "radiance-general_012192"}
