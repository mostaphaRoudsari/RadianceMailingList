{"body": "Hi Joe,\n\n\nThe only time specularity == reflectance is when you have a plastic material whose first three (RGB) arguments are all zero.  Otherwise, there is a diffuse component that gets added to the specular in the following manner:\n\n\n\tR_total_refl = (1 - A4)*A1 + A4\n\tG_total_refl = (1 - A4)*A2 + A4\n\tB_total_refl = (1 - A4)*A3 + A4\n\n\nThis is explained (more or less) in the following document:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf\n\n\nGood -- you found the presentation from Germain.  That's the one I was looking for.\n\n\nYour understanding of the \"mirror\" material is correct.  For every light source in the scene, a virtual spotlight is created that encompasses the surface modified by \"mirror\", \"prism\", or \"prism2\".  The number of reflections searched is set by the \"-dr\" option, which should be set to 1 in this case because you neither care about nor wish to burden the calculation searching for secondary reflections.\n\n\nYou should be able to create images using the virtual light source calculation Germain used.  The photon-mapping approach ought to work as well.  You don't need to \"cheat,\" although getting a reasonable tone-mapped exposure might be challenging.  You can play around with pcond, especially the veiling glare simulation, to give you the kind of flare effect you are looking for in a post-process.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012194.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 29, 2017 at 07:42AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012183", "id": "radiance-general_012194"}
