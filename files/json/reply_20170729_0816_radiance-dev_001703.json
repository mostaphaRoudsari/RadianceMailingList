{"body": "Dear All,\n\n\nAs you can see, I recently cleared a bunch of e-mails that had been backed up in the radinace-dev list since October(!)  (Apologies for the last one -- I passed it by mistake based on the subject.)  I was only recently made moderator of this list, so I had no idea it was backed up until this morning.  I just thought it was quiet...\n\n\nI shall respond to a few of the messages that are still relevant.  If any of you would like to rescind your question(s), or had them answered elsewhere, let me know.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-July/001703.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 29, 2017 at 08:16AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001702", "id": "radiance-dev_001703"}
