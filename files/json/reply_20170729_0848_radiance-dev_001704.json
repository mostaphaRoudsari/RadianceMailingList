{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nI suppose it depends on which compiler and set of libraries you are using whether you need to include erf.c or not in your src/common/CMakeLists.txt file or not.  I don't know which compiler NREL is currently using -- I thought it was MFC, but I've no idea which version.\n\n\nI don't think this would cause the error you are getting from xform, which is suspicious.  Perhaps you could send me your file in a private message, and I could check if there is anything funny in there.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.
