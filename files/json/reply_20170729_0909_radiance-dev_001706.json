{"body": "Hi Victor,\n\n\nI think this conversation is resurrected from old news, but if you're\ninterested, I implemented equirectangular projection in my fork:\nhttps://github.com/nljones/Accelerad. The only difference is that it's\nomni-directional stereo (i.e. up-down dual equirectangular projection). But\nit's probably similar to what you're doing.\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Sat, Jul 29, 2017 at 8:50 AM, Gregory J.
