{"body": "I've been using Robert's recipe for a while with no issues. I get many\nwarnings when compiling, but not critical ones any more. Most warnings have\nto do with potential loss of accuracy when converting numbers. I'm now\nusing a more recent version of MSVC with no problems either. I think I was\nrecently having issues with the TIFF library, but I'm not compiling pieces\nwith those dependences any more. I'm currently using Radiance 5 more like a\nlibrary, so I haven't tested the latest releases.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nVictor LRG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-August/001708.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Victor LRG", "created_at": "August 01, 2017 at 09:30AM", "created_by": "Victor_LRG", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001701", "id": "radiance-dev_001708"}
