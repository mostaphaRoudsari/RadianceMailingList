{"body": "Hello Valerie and welcome,\n\n\nRadiance defaults to RGB-type calculations, but these are just values and you are free to choose different units or interpretations as fit your needs.  The math does not change.  Just think of these as three radiation channels that correspond to the reflectances and lighting values you have used them for.  There is nothing special in the simulation that says these have to correspond to visible wavelengths.\n\n\nFor your purposes, the photon map extension might indeed be useful.  However, the \"classic\" version will also be able to account for interreflections between surfaces, with certain limitations handling reflections from curved, specular surfaces.\n\n\nIt would help to frame your problem to define exactly what you mean by \"light arriving at a point.\"  We usually specify an incident normal direction and compute a cosine-weighted average to arrive at irradiance or illuminance, but you may be after either a uniform spherical weighting or something similar.  I suggest looking into the \"rsensor\" program <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rsensor.1.html> as a possible calculation engine for your task.  However, I have not tried integrating this tool with the photon map, and I am not sure if this part is working.  (I would have to check.)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012206.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 02, 2017 at 11:34AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012205", "id": "radiance-general_012206"}
