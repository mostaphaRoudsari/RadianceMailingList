{"body": "Hi Valerie,\nAre you primarily doing electric lighting calculations (rather than daylight) for real manufactured light fixtures? Do the manufacturers provide IES photometric data in human vision lumens and candela?\n\n\nThe radiance tool ies2rad converts IES files into radiance data and geometry. There is a multiplier option for that command that could create the radiance light source definition in photosynthesis units rather than visible light units. For example if your source provides 0.003 Watts PAR per lumen (*), and you\u2019re using an IES data file that\u2019s based on visual lighting units, you could apply -m 0.003 to the ies2rad command and then work in Radiance as usual from there as if it were any other light source. Any results you have that would typically report lux (if you had not used the multiplier) would instead be reported in W/m\u00b2 PAR since you provided the conversion in the front end in setting up the light source definition.\n\n\nHowever you should take more care if you can\u2019t work with equal spectrum material definitions. If you need reflective or transmitting materials that have colored reflectance and varying PAR properties across the spectrum, you might need something more complicated than above.\n\n\n* disclaimer: I hope I\u2019m conveying the concept here correctly, but I don\u2019t know if this is a realistic conversion factor \u2013 just tried to make something up roughly based from Wikipedia\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012207.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "August 02, 2017 at 12:13PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012205", "id": "radiance-general_012207"}
