{"body": "Thanks Greg, and sorry for the late reply.\nIt's a pity for displacement maps, but completely understandable :)\u00a0\nFor normal maps there's nothing wrong with doing the data conversion, just wondering if there was something built in now to skip this step :)\u00a0\nSounds good to hear the occlusion maps really shouldn't be a thing. Still curious why they are so popular - yes, they are cheaper to compute, but is that it? Maybe other rendering engines aren't that good at occlusion?\u00a0\nThanks for the diffuse tip. I assume that I should also try to match the average rgb reflectance values if they are known? Or why did you just focus on brightness?\nHaven't tried the UV mapping yet, will let you know how it goes :)\u00a0\n-------- Original message --------\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012210.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dion Moult", "created_at": "August 06, 2017 at 03:59PM", "created_by": "Dion_Moult", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012198", "id": "radiance-general_012210"}
