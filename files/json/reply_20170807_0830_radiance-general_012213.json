{"body": "Hi Dion,\n\n\nAs I said, occlusion maps 'look OK' as well as being cheaper to compute.  You can also store them with the object as opposed to recalculating them for each new scene, which makes them fit conveniently into the same category as texture, bump, and displacement maps.  I don't know if anyone has worked on this, but there might be a way to fit some kind of \"near field\" interreflection information with occlusion maps to make them a little more realistic.  You will still have the existing problems with contact shadows and the like, however.\n\n\nI mentioned brightness assuming that luminance is what you can conveniently measure.  If you can measure RGB somehow, then by all means calibrate to that.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012213.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 07, 2017 at 08:30AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012198", "id": "radiance-general_012213"}
