{"body": "Good morning Ryan,\u00a0\nLooks like a great tool - I'll be sure to try it out and give you my comments.\nI have used ODS Studio in the past (https://www.ods-engineering.com) which is a similar offering that integrates Blender 3D with the range of building physics software. Do you mind contrasting the two projects?\u00a0\nAlso, it may be worthwhile to do a post about your software on the blenderartists.org forum, or submitted to blendernation.com, so that the community can pick up on it a bit more :)\u00a0\nKind regards,\u00a0Dion\n-------- Original message --------\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012218.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Dion Moult", "created_at": "August 07, 2017 at 02:54PM", "created_by": "Dion_Moult", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012215", "id": "radiance-general_012218"}
