{"body": "Hi Joe,\n\n\nwhy do you think it is too bright? Is the luminance to high? I guess you \njust have to adapt your exposure setting for the image.\n\n\nThe physics for gendaylit and your parameters is correct:\n\n\n1. test of luminance of the sun (ray in sun direction):\n\n\ngendaylit -ang 90 0 -W 900 200 >sky.rad\noconv -f sky.rad >sky.oct\n\n\necho  0 0 0 -0.000000 -0.052336 0.998630 |rtrace -h sky.oct | rcalc -e \n'$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'\nresult: 1.356104e+09 cd/m2\n\n\nThis value looks reasonable - the max is about 1.6 e9 cd/m2\n\n\n2. test of irradiance (sensor also looks towards sun):\n\n\ngendaylit -ang 90 0 -O 1  -W 900 200 >sky_irr.rad\noconv -f sky_irr.rad >sky_irr.oct\necho  0 0 0 -0.000000 -0.052336 0.998630 |rtrace -h -I+ sky_irr.oct\nresult : 8.998834e+02   W/m2\n\n\nEquals the direct irradiance which was \"put\" into the model (the sky is \nignored, as in your example).\n\n\ncheers\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nOn 08.08.17 09:17, Joe wrote:\n> Hello,\n>\n> when I use gendaylit to create a sun my images are too bright.\n>\n> The command used is\n>\n> gendaylit -ang 90 0 -W 900 200\n>\n>\n> void light solar\n> 0\n> 0\n> 3 7.576e+006 7.576e+006 7.576e+006\n>\n> solar source sun\n> 0\n> 0\n> 4 -0.000000 -0.052336 0.998630 0.533000\n>\n> This will put the sun to the zenith with reasonable values\n> for direct normal and diffuse irradiance in W/m^2.\n>\n> Correct so far?\n>\n> I removed the skyfunc, just the sun source is active.\n>\n> I put together a simple scene:\n> - plastic cylinders as coordinate origin,\n> - large brown ground plate\n> - dielectric spheres (I just love those :)\n>\n> Here is an image with renderings of different sun settings:\n>\n> http://imgur.com/hOqCpmY\n>\n> When I use the sun as stated above the image on the right\n> side is rendered.
