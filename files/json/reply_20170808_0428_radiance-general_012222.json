{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nI am quite new to Radiance and have not used the exposure setting so \nfar.\nSo far I had expected to get a \"well illuminated\" scene with some \nshadows\ncast.\nI have to read a bit on how exposure works.\n\n\nDoes it work like an ambient light to sort of adjust the overall \nbrightness\nof the image?\n\n\n From what I understand so far exposure only affects\nthe view of the rendered image, not the actual physical properties\nlike illuminance, radiance and irradiance.\nAnd if rtrace is used to \"view\" the image instead of rvu the\nillumination would be consistent.\n\n\nIs that correct?\n\n\nKind regards,\nJoe\n\n\n\n\nAm 08.08.2017 10:01 schrieb Jan Wienold:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012222.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Joe", "created_at": "August 08, 2017 at 04:28AM", "created_by": "Joe", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012220", "id": "radiance-general_012222"}
