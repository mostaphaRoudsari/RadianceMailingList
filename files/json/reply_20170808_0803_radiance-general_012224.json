{"body": "Yes; exposure affects the appearance of the image but not the underlying\nphoto/radiometric values, or pixel data if you will. A Radiance image is\nthis amazing collection of spot meter data, basically. I\u2019m not sure I\nunderstand your last statement there, about the \u201cillumination [being]\nconsistent\u201d. \n\n\nYou can take a Radiance luminance image and run it through pcond to\n'tonemap' the image and create all kinds of valuable effects. The simplest\nis the '-h' option, which will map the pixel luminance according to human\nvision capability. Thus, creating an image that conveys the appearance of\nthe scene as viewed by a human observer in that scene.\n\n\nThe main takeaway is that the raw Radiance images are physically accurate,\nyet you are viewing them on dynamic range-limited devices, so they will be\nhard-pressed to \u201clook right\u201d.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 8/8/17, 5:28 AM, \"Joe\" <solarjoe at posteo.org> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012224.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "August 08, 2017 at 08:03AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012220", "id": "radiance-general_012224"}
