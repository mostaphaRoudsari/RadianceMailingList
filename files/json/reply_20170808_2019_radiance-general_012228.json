{"body": "OK, thanks.  It does (usually) help to tell us what error you are getting, rather than simply saying \"it doesn't work.\"\n\n\nIn this case, I don't understand why you would be getting such an error.  Your command *looks* alright as you have shared it.  Are you certain there are no special characters or newlines where there shouldn't be one?\n\n\nTry cutting and pasting the command from your e-mail.  If it still isn't working, you may have to send me your files in a private message so I can try to reproduce the error, which makes no sense.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012228.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 08, 2017 at 08:19PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012225", "id": "radiance-general_012228"}
