{"body": "Hi Kristen,\n\n\nIf I understand your question, you essentially want to have 6 log divisions with a maximum of 10000 cd/m^2.  I think the following will work with falsecolor:\n\n\n\tfalsecolor -log 6 -s 10000 -i image.hdr > image_fc.hdr\n\n\nI guess you are not asking about the color scale itself, which should be the same as the default palette in falsecolor.  (Running \"falsecolor -palettes > pal.hdr\" will show you the standard palattes you may choose from.)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012232.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 10, 2017 at 12:50PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012231", "id": "radiance-general_012232"}
