{"body": "While it's true that the minimum is always zero if you are using the default linear scale, setting a log scale allows you to (indirectly) specify the minimum as the scale setting divided by 10^N specified using the \"-log N\" option.  (And \"N\" can be any positive value.)\n\n\nI checked, and the setting I recommended works for your example.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012236.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 10, 2017 at 01:13PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012231", "id": "radiance-general_012236"}
