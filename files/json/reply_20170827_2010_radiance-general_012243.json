{"body": "Glassner\u2019s *Principles of Digital Image Synthesis*. (2 vols. San\nFrancisco, CA: Morgann Kaufmann Publishers, Inc., 1995) is the\nreference I used, back when; anyone know if there has been a\nsubsequent book which covers the same ground? The physics, I would\nsay, is basically simple, *but* presents computational problems which\nremain difficult, even with modern computing hardware.\n\n\nFor Radiance specifically, the mathematical specifics of the basic\nsystem are covered in *Rendering with Radiance* part III. Newer\ncomponents are covered in various Radiance Workshop presentations.\n\n\nRandolph M.
