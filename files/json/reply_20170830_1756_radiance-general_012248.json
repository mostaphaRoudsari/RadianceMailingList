{"body": "I tested this on 10.9.5:\nUsing a rtrace process running for 10 minutes as a benchmark, the run with\napp nap disabled calculated the same general number of points as the run\nwhere app nap kicked in after a minute or two.\n\n\nActivity Monitor shows app nap in effect for terminal, but not any of its\nchild processes (bash, rtrace, etc), so it's possible it has no effect on\nthese, to be safe I will be leaving app nap disabled for terminal.\n\n\nYou cannot disable app nap for terminal per the instructions in the article\ngreg linked, so you need to either use the system wide command (in\nterminal):\n\n\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES\n\n\nOR, to just disable for terminal:\n\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES\n\n\nto undo either of these replace YES with NO in the command.  Global changes\nrequires a restart to take effect, terminal specific changes requires\nquitting and reopening terminal.\n\n\n\n\nStephen Wasilewski\n*LOISOS *+* UBBELOHDE*\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwww.coolshadow.com\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 29, 2017 at 2:05 PM, Gregory J.
