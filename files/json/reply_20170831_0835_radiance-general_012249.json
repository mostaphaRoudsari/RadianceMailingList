{"body": "Hi Stephen,\n\n\nThanks for doing a little investigation of this.  Sounds like it's not too big a problem, at least with the latest releases of OS X.  I can't remember exactly when I noticed it was an issue -- it must have been 10.8, and they fixed it since then.  Anyway, I was looking up some tips on speeding up Mac's and ran across this, so thought I would pass it along.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012249.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 31, 2017 at 08:35AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012247", "id": "radiance-general_012249"}
