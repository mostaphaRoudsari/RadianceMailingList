{"body": "Hi Raha,\n\n\nI am sure that there are many options, but I would recommend to look at the gphoto2 project. It offers you command-line tools to set the capture properties, acquire images and transfer them to an attached computer. If these are called e.g. by crond you have a nice automated monitoring system.\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-September/000658.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
