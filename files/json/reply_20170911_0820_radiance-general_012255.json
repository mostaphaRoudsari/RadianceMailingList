{"body": "Hi Chris,\n\n\nThe reason roughness is defined as the RMS surface \"slope\" is because you need to know the surface height deviation over the average correlation distance.  Both values would be measured in distance units, which cancel out to give you RMS roughness.  (This assumes a Gaussian surface profile.)  You may have measured the height deviation, but without an estimate of correlation distance, you can't get to roughness.  It's often best to adjust the roughness until it looks similar to the surface you are modeling, since these parameters are difficult to measure even with a good profilometer.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-September/012255.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 11, 2017 at 08:20AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012254", "id": "radiance-general_012255"}
