{"body": "Hi Germ\u00e1n,\n\n\nAs I said, you can pipe the materials and geometry to the oconv command, something like:\n\n\n\tFILE *outfp = popen(\"oconv - > /tmp/myfile.oct\", \"w\");\n\t/* tons of stuff to outfp */\n\tpclose(outfp);\n\tray_init(\"/tmp/myfile.oct\");\n\t/* lots of calls to ray_trace() */\n\tray_done();\n\n\nLots of other things to do as well, such as setting rendering options and error-checking.  This should give you the basic idea, though.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-September/001717.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 14, 2017 at 08:43AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001713", "id": "radiance-dev_001717"}
