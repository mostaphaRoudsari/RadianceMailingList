{"body": "Hi Darragh,\n\n\nHere is the man page, which you should have downloaded with the binary.  Was it not in there?\n\n\nSorry the binary is giving you troubles.  I've not found a way to compile for all Linux machines.  They generally expect you to compile things yourself, and I'm not distributing source code in this case.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-September/000660.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 20, 2017 at 10:24AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000659", "id": "hdri_000660"}
