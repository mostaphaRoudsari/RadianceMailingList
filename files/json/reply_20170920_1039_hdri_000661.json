{"body": "Hi,\n\n\nwe also had trouble - the problem was libstdc++.so.5 which is an older \nversion not available on our newer system. I made a dirty hack and \ninstalled in a VM an old version of ubuntu including this library and \ncopied this then to our server. Finally it works. With /ldd hdrgen/ you \ncan see, which libraries are needed and versions.\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-September/000661.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "September 20, 2017 at 10:39AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000659", "id": "hdri_000661"}
