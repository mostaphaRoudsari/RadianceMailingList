{"body": "Dear Sarith, Greg,\n\n\nThank you for your replies. In this case I am running the annual calculation of an image, and each time-step (daytime) is taking 3-4 minutes to run, so the total calculation takes more than 9 days. And I would like to increase the resolution to reduce noise\u2026\n\n\nSo I thought if I run 10 dctimestep processes in parallel, it should take less than a day. I hope this makes sense. I will try it out and let you know if I find problems.\n\n\nThank you,\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-September/012262.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Santiago Torres", "created_at": "September 22, 2017 at 09:13AM", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012259", "id": "radiance-general_012262"}
