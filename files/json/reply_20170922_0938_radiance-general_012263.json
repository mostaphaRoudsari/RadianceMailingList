{"body": "Ah, that's a different problem!  \n\n\nHow much memory is on your machine?  If there is less RAM than the combined size of the component images, then you won't see the benefit of disk caching.  You can try decreasing the memory required for caching by compacting your pictures (e.g., running \"ra_rgbe -r\" on each of them).\n\n\nIf you don't have as much free RAM as you have images and you're running off a hard disk rather than an SSD, that is the worst case for dctimestep and image processing.  Running in parallel may help you a bit, but you still need to think about the i/o requirements.  Having a bunch of processes fighting to access the same disk information might not do that much.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-September/012263.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "September 22, 2017 at 09:38AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012259", "id": "radiance-general_012263"}
