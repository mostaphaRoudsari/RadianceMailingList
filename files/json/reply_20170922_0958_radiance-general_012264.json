{"body": "Hi Santiago and Greg,\n\n\n\n\nTo add to my original reply, I ran my simulations using the standard \nversion of dctimestep. I use a fairly souped-up Microsoft Azure \ncloud-based VM which has\u00a0 250GB of RAM. If you are parallelizing \nimage-based simulations, you'd want to explicitly specify the \nmonth-name, or number, in the string formatting option( something like \n-o results/Jan%03d.hdr). If not, there is a chance that the results from \none instance of dctimestep might get overwritten by the other (I learnt \nthis the hard way).\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-September/012264.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "September 22, 2017 at 09:58AM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012259", "id": "radiance-general_012264"}
