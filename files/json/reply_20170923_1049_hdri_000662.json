{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for the reply. Unfortunately I can't see the manual page for hdrgen,\nmight it have got lost in the post to the mailing list?\n\n\nWith regards to the getting the man file with the download of the binaries,\nI extracted the download with: tar -xzf and received a folder titled \"bin\"\ncontaining 4 binaries. There was no seperate man page files. When I attempt\nto view the man page with: \"man hdrgen\" I get the following message:\n\"No manual entry for hdrgen\"\n\"See 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDarragh\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-September/000662.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Darragh Gleeson", "created_at": "September 23, 2017 at 10:49AM", "created_by": "Darragh_Gleeson", "parent_id": "hdri_000659", "id": "hdri_000662"}
