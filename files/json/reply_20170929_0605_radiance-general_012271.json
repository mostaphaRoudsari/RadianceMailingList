{"body": "Hello Raghu,\n\n\nIt has been a while since the last time I played with the 3-phase method,\nso I forgot what error message appears when. However, you might want to\ncheck two things:\n\n\n   - That your Sky Matrix and your Daylight matrix were created with the\n   same number of patches in the sky. Your Daylight Matrix was created using\n   MF-4, so your skymatrix should be created using --> gendaymtx -m 4\n   WEATHER.wea > mannheim.smx\n   - Check that your weather tape has, indeed, 8760 lines.... I am not sure\n   the -n 8760 options is still needed in dctimestep, though.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n2017-09-29 6:28 GMT-03:00 raghuram kalyanam <kalyanam at rhrk.uni-kl.de>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-September/012271.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "September 29, 2017 at 06:05AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012270", "id": "radiance-general_012271"}
