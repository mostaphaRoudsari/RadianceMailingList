{"body": "Hi Belal,\n\n\nI am not familiar with hdrscope, but you might inform the author that it's not a good idea to remove the tabs when reporting the header, since they are very important to the interpretation of the image.\n\n\nSince all of the views are indented in your header, you will at minimum need to add back a valid VIEW= line to the header, using the getinfo \"-a\" option we discussed earlier, e.g.:\n\n\n\tgetinfo -a \"VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180\" < processed.hdr > final.hdr\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000668.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 01, 2017 at 02:36PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "hdri_000666", "id": "hdri_000668"}
