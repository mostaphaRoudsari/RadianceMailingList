{"body": "Hi Belal,\n\n\nYou could use the ra_xyze command to insert the exposure into the pixels value right after creating the HDR image.\n\n\nra_xyze \u2013r \u2013o input.hdr > output.hdr\n\n\nThis way, the exposure line is removed from the header in Radiance and you can do manipulations on your HDR image with pcomb/pcompos.\n\n\nAt the end, you can insert back the exposure line in the header with a value of 1 using getinfo \u2013a as Greg mentioned.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nClotilde\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000672.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Clotilde Pierson", "created_at": "October 01, 2017 at 11:34PM", "created_by": "Clotilde_Pierson", "parent_id": "hdri_000666", "id": "hdri_000672"}
