{"body": "Hi,\nThank you Clotilde and Jan. The ra_xyze command solved the problem. I am\nactually using a fish eye lens (the -vh 49.0537 -vv 49.0537 was in the\noriginal image created by hdrgen) but I am passing view info in the\nevalglare line). I have few follow up questions to make sure I understand\nwhat you mentioned regarding view type.\n\n\n1. Assuming I have an angular projection, I converted that to hemispherical\nprojection using pinterp, and used that for Ev calculations and absolute\ncalibration, and then for evalglare. My question is: Is a\nhemispherical projection a requirement for calculating vertical illuminance\nin Radiance? If yes, should I convert back to angular after calculating Ev?\n\n\n2. Is there a way to tell if projection is Angular or hemispherical by\nlooking at images? I am using a low-cost Opteka 0.2x fish eye.. there's no\nmention by manufacturer on projection type.\n\n\nThank you for your help,\nBelal\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000674.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Belal Abboushi", "created_at": "October 02, 2017 at 03:12PM", "created_by": "Belal_Abboushi", "parent_id": "hdri_000666", "id": "hdri_000674"}
