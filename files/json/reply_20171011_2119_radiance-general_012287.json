{"body": "Hi Clarence,\n\n\nThis should be correct.  What version of Radiance do you have?  (I.e., what does \"rpict -version\" return?)\n\n\nDoes it report any error at all?  Is the output file completely empty?\n\n\nIt works when I run it using 5.1, and I'm pretty sure it will work for anything later than the 4.1 release, which was in 2011.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012287.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 11, 2017 at 09:19PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012285", "id": "radiance-general_012287"}
