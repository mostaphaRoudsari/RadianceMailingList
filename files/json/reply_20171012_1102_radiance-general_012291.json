{"body": "Hi Antoine,\n\n\nYour plastic is completely black, so it won't reflect any light. You need\nto set the red, green, and blue values to be positive numbers. For\ninstance, if you want a 50% reflective wall:\n\n\nvoid plastic M_Spec\n0\n0\n5 0.5 0.5 0.5 1 0\n\n\nBut is there a reason you're using plastic? Plastic that is 100% specular\nisn't realistic, and more to the point for your use, it won't give you very\ngood reflections of small sources like the sun; for this, you will need to\nuse a mirror material.\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 12, 2017 at 10:22 AM, Antoine Bugeat <bugeatantoine at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012291.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nathaniel Jones", "created_at": "October 12, 2017 at 11:02AM", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012291"}
