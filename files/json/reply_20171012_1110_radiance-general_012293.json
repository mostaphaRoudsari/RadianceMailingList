{"body": "Hi Antoine,\n\n\nIt seems you are running up against the limitation of ray-tracing to find small sources such as the sun in specular surfaces.\n\n\nThere is a specific fix for this problem for flat surface in Radiance, which is the \"virtual source\" calculation.  However, you need to use a special \"mirror\" type rather than \"plastic\" to enable this:\n\n\nvoid mirror M_Spec\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nIf you use this as your material, I think you will get the results you expect.  \n\n\nI should point out that a 100% specular material is not realistic.  Polished metallic surfaces may reflect as much as 99% of light, but 100% is difficult to achieve without resorting to a prismatic dielectric film or similar.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012293.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 12, 2017 at 11:10AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012293"}
