{"body": "Hi Antoine,\nspecular reflections are not traced at all to light sources in the ambient calculation (which you invoke by -I). Only to glow material. Thats why also the reflections of the sun on glass-material is not captured by rtrace -I.\nSo either you use mirror material and a -dr >2 or you calculate a 180degree fisheye on you point and calculate the illuminace from the image. The view rays for the image are traced via specular surfaces towards light sources.\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012294.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "October 12, 2017 at 01:45PM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012294"}
