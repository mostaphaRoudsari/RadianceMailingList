{"body": "Hello all,\n\n\nFirst, thank you very much for your quick answers.\n\n\nIf I understand correctly, among the possible options for solving my\nproblem, the simplest is to replace the perfect specular \"plastic\" by a\n\"mirror\" material to have a \"virtual source\" calculation (I agree that 100%\nof reflection is totally not real but it's just for this case to understand\nthe calculation).\n\n\nvoid mirror M_Spec\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nBut I still get 0...\n\n\nAs a reminder, I use these radiance parameters (the same as DAYSIM except\nthat I increase the -dr):\n-I -aa 0.1 -ab 5 -ad 1000 -ar 300 -as 20 -dj 0 -dr 5 -ds 0.2 -dp 512 -lr 6\n-lw 0.004 -st 0.1 -oov\n\n\nIn parallel, I found a paper written by Roland Schregle (Lucerne University\n2015) with an extension of Radiance about photon mapping for caustics\nreflection. It looks pretty complex and I think (and I hope) that I can\nsolve my problem without using this.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nAntoine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017-10-12 22:45 GMT+02:00 Jan Wienold <jan.wienold at epfl.ch>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012295.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antoine Bugeat", "created_at": "October 13, 2017 at 08:02AM", "created_by": "Antoine_Bugeat", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012295"}
