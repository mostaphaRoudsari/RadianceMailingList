{"body": "Hi Antoine,\n\n\nUsing the mirror material should work, but I forgot to mention that it's a one-sided effect.  You need to be looking at the front of your surface rather than the backside, which means the vertices need to be ordered counter-clockwise from the side you're looking at.\n\n\nI didn't check initially, but the surface is the wrong way around from your selected evaluation point.  Your sun is also on the wrong side.  If you reverse the order of your polygon vertices, then it should work as expected.\n\n\nThe photon-mapping approach, which is now built into Radiance, should also work.  It is a more complex solution, but necessary when the reflecting surfaces are curved.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012296.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "October 13, 2017 at 10:04AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012296"}
