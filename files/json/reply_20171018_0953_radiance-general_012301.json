{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\n\n\nA similar example is discussed in Section 7.4 of this document: \nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/matrix-based-methods\n\n\nThe example files for that document can be found here:\n\n\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/radTutorialFiles-master.zip\n\n\n\n\nIf you are just interested in the commands, try this link: \nhttps://github.com/sariths/radTutorialFiles/blob/master/room/commands/3PM_VarShad.sh\n(This shell file is also included in the document mentioned above)\n\n\nThe idea is to create separate view and daylight matrices for individual \nwindows, use dctimestep to calculate those individual results and \nfinally combine the results using pcomb(images) or rmtxop(illuminance). \nYou can study the contribution from individual windows by changing the \ntransmission matrix in dctimestep.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nSarith\n\n\nOn 10/18/2017 11:34 AM, raghuram kalyanam wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012301.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "October 18, 2017 at 09:53AM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012300", "id": "radiance-general_012301"}
