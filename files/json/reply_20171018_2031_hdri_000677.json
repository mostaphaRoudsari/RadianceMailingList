{"body": "Hi Steph,\n\n\nA couple of things to look out for from my experience:\n\n\n  * Try to purchase a camera with a full-frame sensor. This is a\n    requirement for fisheye lenses used in glare analysis.\n  * The range of shutter speeds can make a difference as well for the\n    measure of very high luminances (1/4000s vs 1/8000s).\n\n\nBeyond those two use cases, any camera with a manual mode that can \nadjust the shutter speed quickly will work fine. I recommend to adjust \nthe shutter speed by hand or computer control rather than to rely on \nauto-bracketing. Still, if you want to go the auto-bracketing route, you \nmay consider a camera that supports a firmware hack like Magic Lantern \nwhich gives better bracketing capacity to cheaper DSLR cameras. \nOtherwise you'll end up needing to buy an EOS 5D or something in a \nsimilar price range for a good bracketing functionality.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000677.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Alstan Jakubiec", "created_at": "October 18, 2017 at 08:31PM", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec", "parent_id": "hdri_000676", "id": "hdri_000677"}
