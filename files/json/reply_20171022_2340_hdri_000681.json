But lot of artificial light source (e.g. fluorescent, high or low pressure natrium sodium lamps of course LED) does have this issue.\n If so, that suggests that is not that helpful to get a camera that can reach even 1/8000s, or that in order to take advantage of such speed,\n\n\n\u00e8    On the other hand, if you are not struggling with Modulation effects, you have to consider reproducible speed of mechanical shutter at short exposure time. The speed has direct impact on relation between luminance and generated sensor signal.\nthe use of the ND filter would be really necessary to achieve good results, is that right?\n\n\n\u00e8    All in all one can summarize that using ND filter has some benefits when used correctly.\n\n\nThank you again for your help...\n\n\nSt.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000681.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Tobias Porsch", "created_at": "October 22, 2017 at 11:40PM", "created_by": "Tobias_Porsch", "parent_id": "hdri_000680", "id": "hdri_000681"}
