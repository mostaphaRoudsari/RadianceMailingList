{"body": "Hi Rob\n\n\nIf you are already on Mac OS 10.12.x (\"Sierra\") you should have no problems\nupgrading to \"High Sierra\". It's more a \"polish\" than a \"feature\" upgrade.\nYou should check compatibility with X11 first, though. I don't think it's\nconsidered a core component by Apple. You can find an in-depth review here:\n\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/macos-10-13-high-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/\n\n\nI skipped the \"Sierra\" release and thought it would be a good time to\nupgrade now but then I found out that the new file system does not work\nwell on spinning rust disk (which I still use in my iMac). To me the new\nfile system was the only interesting feature. I'll wait at least for the\n10.13.1 release before I upgrade to give others a chance to find the juicy\nproblems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 24, 2017 at 8:46 AM, Shakespeare, Robert A. <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012307.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "October 24, 2017 at 09:05AM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012304", "id": "radiance-general_012307"}
