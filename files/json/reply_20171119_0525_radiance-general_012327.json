{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nAh, a trip down memory lane -- I think I first came across this in 2002.  Gensky applies a mixing function around the horizon to `blend' the brightness of the sky and whatever might be below, e.g. usually the glowing ground but it's still applied if there's nothing below the horizon.  I guess this was for purely visual appearance. A small change to skybright.cal should get rid of the blending at the horizon:\n\n\nChange:\n\n\nskybr = wmean((Dz+1.01)^10,\n\t\tselect(A1, sunnysky, cloudysky, unifsky, intersky),\n\t\t(Dz+1.01)^-10, A3);\n\n\nto:\n\n\nskybr = if( Dz, select(A1, sunnysky, cloudysky, unifsky, intersky), A3);\n\n\nThat should fix it.\n\n\nI didn't want to alter how skybright.cal is used, so I created another file (imaginatively) called skybright_nomix.cal.  At the time, I'm sure Greg must have nudged me in the right direction.\n\n\nCheers\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic PhD FSLL FIBPSA\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Architecture, Building & Civil Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\n\n\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/abce/staff/john-mardaljevic\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012327.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "John Mardaljevic", "created_at": "November 19, 2017 at 05:25AM", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012326", "id": "radiance-general_012327"}
