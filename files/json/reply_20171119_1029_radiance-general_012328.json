{"body": "Hi Jan,\n\n\nJohn is on spot with the reason for the non-uniformity near the horizon as well as the \"fix.\"  For the record, the blending is not just for visual appearance; it's there to avoid sampling artifacts caused by unnatural discontinuities.  This can result in noisy as well as erroneous output.\n\n\nYou should still get a uniform sky using \"-u\" without \"-b\", but for your given date and time, the sun is likely below the horizon, so the sky would naturally be zero.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012328.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 19, 2017 at 10:29AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012326", "id": "radiance-general_012328"}
