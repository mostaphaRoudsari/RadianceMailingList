{"body": "Hi Clarence,\n\n\n\n\nIf by null you are implying zeros, then the generated files are fine. \nYour first gendaymtx command (-m 1 -d) will generate a sky matrix that \nis almost entirely zeros except for radiation values in 3-4 patches per \nhour during day-time.  The second gendaymtx command (-m 2 -5 0.533 -d) \nwill generate a file that contains radiation values only in a single \npatch per hour. If the direct-normal radiation data for a particular \nhour is zero, then the radiation values in all the patches for that hour \nin direct-sky matrix and sun-matrix will be zero as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012335.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "November 26, 2017 at 09:50PM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012334", "id": "radiance-general_012335"}
