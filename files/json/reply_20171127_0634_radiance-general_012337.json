{"body": "Hello Clarence,\n\n\nI am not sure if I completely understood your question, but I think I can\nhelp a bit understand what changed between  3 and 5 phases.\n\n\nThe three-phase method factorizes the DC matrix into three matrices ( DC =\nVxTxD ), where T is the BSDF of a shading device. This helps changing T\nwithout having to re-ray-trace, which is the slow process we want to avoid.\nDespite being fast,, the Daylight Matrix (the D part in VTD) assumes the\nsun to be spread in three or four patches of the sky (thus, Sarith's\ncomment regarding most values exept 3-4 being zeros for each hour), which\nis unrealistic. The sun is not diffuse and big, but direct and small (0.533\ndegrees, which explains the \"-5 0.533\" part on the gendaymtx command),\nwhich is why you substract this \"big diffuse sun\" and replace it by a\n\"small direct\" sun.\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n2017-11-27 11:12 GMT-03:00 Wang Clarence <wangjuncwz at hotmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012337.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "November 27, 2017 at 06:34AM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012336", "id": "radiance-general_012337"}
