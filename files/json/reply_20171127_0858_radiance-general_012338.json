{"body": "Hello\n\n\nThanks again for your help Greg\n\n\nI still have not been able to solve my problem ...\n\n\nTo summarize my case, I have an environment composed only of surface\n\"mirror\" and a light source \"glow\" (the sky). I want to get only the\nradiation that comes directly from the source without any reflection.\nIt seems that even with the parameters -ab 1 -dr 0 -lr 0 (-ab 1 because the\nsky is modeled with \"glow\") the radiation coming from the sky produces\nreflections in the scene.\n\n\nI modeled the environment with the material \"plastic\" and it works\nperfectly. I'm almost sure that the problem comes from the material \"glow\"\ncombined with materials \"mirror\" but I want to keep this configuration.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAntoine\n\n\n2017-10-24 20:46 GMT+02:00 Greg Ward <gregoryjward at gmail.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012338.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Antoine Bugeat", "created_at": "November 27, 2017 at 08:58AM", "created_by": "Antoine_Bugeat", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012338"}
