{"body": "Hi Antoine,\n\n\nThe \"-lr 0\" doesn't mean \"zero reflections,\" but \"no limit on reflections,\" so that's part of your problem.  Setting \"-dr 0\" has no effect if you don't have any non-glow light sources.  Offhand, I don't know how to compute what you're after other than temporarily replacing your mirror with a completely black surface.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012339.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 27, 2017 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012290", "id": "radiance-general_012339"}
