The basic radius is derived from the cube root of the  \nphoton cloud's bounding box volume divided by the number of dumped  \nspheres.  In this case it would a imply a zero volume. What's the pmap's  \nbbox reported by getinfo?\n\n\n--Roland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012351.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "December 05, 2017 at 08:19AM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012349", "id": "radiance-general_012351"}
