{"body": "Katsuya,\n\n\nAnother way to view rad file in Rhinoceros is to use two Grasshopper3d's\nobject.\n1) Honeybee_import Rad (you need to install Honeybee). This object give you\ntwo separate output: Rad Material and RAD surfaces (these are grouped per\nmaterial type)\n2) Next, if you want visualize the geometries without grasshopper3d you\nneed to bake the geometries by means of Human plugging (\nhttp://www.food4rhino.com/).\nI suggest you to set the Layer name as well as the geometry name equal to\nRAD material name\n\n\nSee image\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/f92l2dfqt8qmjsd/RAD_2_RHINO.JPG?dl=0\n\n\nCheers\nGiorgio B.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012354.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "giorgio butturini", "created_at": "December 06, 2017 at 06:27AM", "created_by": "giorgio_butturini", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012341", "id": "radiance-general_012354"}
