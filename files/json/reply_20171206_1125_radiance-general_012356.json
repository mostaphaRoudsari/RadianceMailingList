{"body": "Thank you, Roland,\n\n\nmy scene is a simple light pipe with a planar diffusor at the end.  I \nmanaged to change the zero radii to something non-zero and visualise the \nphoton map.  As you say--all red (caustic) spheres are on the diffusor.\n\n\nThank you for fixing this.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/12/17 18:19, Roland Schregle wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012356.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Axel Jacobs", "created_at": "December 06, 2017 at 11:25AM", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012349", "id": "radiance-general_012356"}
