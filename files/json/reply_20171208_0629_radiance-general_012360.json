In these examples, the sky and sun are both represented through \nthe \"glow\" primitive and the ray-tracing is stochastic. The additional \nsteps in the Five Phase \n<https://github.com/sariths/radTutorialFiles/blob/master/room/commands/5PM.sh> \nexample subtract out the direct component of the results from the \nglow-based oversized sun patches and replace them with replace them with \naccurately calculated direct sun-results. In this case, the sun is \nrepresented using the \"light\" primitive (implying a deterministic \ncalculation) and is also more appropriately sized (0.533 degrees).\n\n\nThe exercise files also contain an improved version \n<https://github.com/sariths/radTutorialFiles/blob/master/room/commands/2PM_DDS.sh> \nof the Daylight Coefficient Method that features the direct-sun \ncorrection. I think the results from that calculation and the Five Phase \ncalculation will be similar as they both involve the direct-sun correction.\n\n\nThe final part of the Five-Phase method requires Tensor-Tree BSDFs. The \nmethodology for creating BSDFs from Radiance primitives is discussed in \nthe genBSDF tutorial \n<https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-genBSDF_v1.0.1.pdf>. \nIf your glazing system is just a simple glazing comprised of something \nlike \"glass\" or \"trans\", you can incorporate the glazing geometry \ndirectly. This process would be similar to what is discussed for the \nimproved Daylight Coefficient calculation \n<https://github.com/sariths/radTutorialFiles/blob/master/room/commands/2PM_DDS.sh#L55-L73>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012360.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sarith Subramaniam", "created_at": "December 08, 2017 at 06:29AM", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012359", "id": "radiance-general_012360"}
