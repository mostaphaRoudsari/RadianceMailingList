I just updated pmapdump.c in the CVS. Try that with your original  \n(coplanar) caustic pmap.\n\n\nThe automatic sphere radius is a pretty rudimentary guess and often needs  \nsome manual tweaking. Usually it's too small, but on the upside that  \nreduces sphere overlap, which would otherwise slow oconv down. Pmapdump is  \nstill pretty rough around the edges, even after over a decade... ;^)\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n--Roland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012367.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Roland Schregle", "created_at": "December 09, 2017 at 10:51AM", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012349", "id": "radiance-general_012367"}
