{"body": "Hi Sandi,\nAre you entering the tutorial commands into a script and running it, copying and pasting them onto the command line, or typing them by hand onto the command line? I'm asking to help rule out any issues with character recognition by the terminal interface from various text formats. Also are you operating on Windows, Mac, or other? And is there anything notable about your system setup - or just a standalone computer with physical keyboard and no remote or virtual interfaces?\n\n\nIf you were copying and pasting anything, can you try typing the commands by hand into the terminal in case any whitespace or newline characters weren't being copied correctly? Does that make any difference?\n\n\nIt doesn't sound like the radiance installation, because it looks like the executables are being recognized through the terminal. Just in case anyone else thinks of something though, what installation package did you use to install Radiance?\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012373.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "December 15, 2017 at 06:29AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012372", "id": "radiance-general_012373"}
