{"body": "Hi Sandi,\n\n\nAny message like \"rfluxmtx: cannot load '-option'\" is due to an error in argument processing, which is probably due to using an m-dash instead of a hyphen ('-') for the preceding option.\n\n\nRadiance commands, as is true of most Unix tools, only understand the basic ASCII character set, not the extended characters supported on modern systems.  Cutting and pasting from a document is therefore hazardous, as you can pick up these extended characters, which the command-line tools won't know what to do with.\n\n\nI do recommend retyping the commands from the tutorial to avoid this problem, also as a better way to get comfortable with them.  It might also be worth picking up a reference book about the Unix environment to help you get started.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012374.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2017 at 07:54AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012372", "id": "radiance-general_012374"}
