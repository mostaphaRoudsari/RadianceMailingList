{"body": "Hi Tommy,\n\n\nLooks like no one responded to your question.  I'm not sure what the correct response is, as the 5-phase method only applies to annual calculations.  There is a \"-d\" option to genskyvec that outputs zero values except for the sun, but that sun is spread over 3 adjacent patches, which is what the \"-5\" option in genskymtx avoids.\n\n\nIf you really want to reproduce the 5-phase calculation at a single time point for some reason, why don't you edit the input file to gendaymtx to contain only that time point?  You can run the rest of the calculation as you would for an annual simulation, I think.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012376.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 15, 2017 at 05:26PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012366", "id": "radiance-general_012376"}
