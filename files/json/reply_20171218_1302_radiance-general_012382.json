{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nHere is a link to a blog on use of the glaze script (originally authored \nby Greg Ward for Visarc) and\u00a0 optics2glazedb (authored by me to ease \ngeneration of custom glazing libraries to be used by glaze).\n\n\nhttps://modsimvis.blogspot.com/2014/12/glass-in-radiance.html\n\n\nThe glaze script requires a clear glass material to serve as the base \nsubstrate. This is why the built in library (eg running glaze without \nthe -f option) has a default clear glass material. This is also why if \nyou use a custom library and want to have a different clear substrate \nyou must supply it as the first entry. I believe there is a check in the \nglaze script to confirm that the first glass description is in fact \nclear, that is, with the same reflectance for the front and back \nsurfaces. So if the check fails then a default clear glass description \nis created.\n\n\nAs Charudatta noted the use of spaces and underscores in the material \nname field of the material descriptions causes problems, so the \ncorrections that he suggests should do the trick.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012382.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "December 18, 2017 at 01:02PM", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012378", "id": "radiance-general_012382"}
