{"body": "Hi Dennis,\n\n\nDirect horizontal illuminance relates to illumination direct from the sun, not from the rest of the sky. To get a non-zero direct horizontal illuminance, you need to have a sun in your model. The sky description you provided included the sky, but no sun. Is your sun defined separately to sky.rad?\n\n\nRegards,\nPhil.\n\n\nDr Phillip Greenup\nSenior Designer | Lighting\n\n\nArup\nLevel 17 1 Nicholson Street East Melbourne Vic 3001\nd: +61 3 9668 5669\nwww.arup.com <http://www.arup.com/>\n\n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=21592292&trk=hp-identity-name>\n[cid:image001.jpg at 01D30624.20463E20]<https://www.arup.com/publications/promotional-materials/section/lighting-design>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012390.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Phillip Greenup", "created_at": "December 21, 2017 at 12:39PM", "created_by": "Phillip_Greenup", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012385", "id": "radiance-general_012390"}
