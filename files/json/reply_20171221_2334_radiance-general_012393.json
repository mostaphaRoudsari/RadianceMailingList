{"body": "Dear Dr. Greenup,\n\n\nI am a bit confused by the steps.\n\n\n\n\nIn step 3, the horizontal global illuminance is needed to calculate the ground reflectivity. So, should I go to the step 11 to get the HGI? However, if I want to complete the step 11, a completed sky.rad is required, so I have to assume some numbers (solar brightness, ground brightness and arbitrary zenith radiance) in the sky.rad?\n\n\nHow should I assume those numbers? Thank you.\n\n\nBest regards,\nDennis Tsang\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012393.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "TSANG Kai Kwong", "created_at": "December 21, 2017 at 11:34PM", "created_by": "TSANG_Kai_Kwong", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012385", "id": "radiance-general_012393"}
