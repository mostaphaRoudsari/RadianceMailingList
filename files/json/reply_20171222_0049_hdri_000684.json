{"body": "Hi Belal,\n\n\nactually evalglare uses only 6 colors and distributes them according to \nthe occurrence, which means somehow random and the same color can appear \nseveral times, although it is a different glare source. If the peak \nextraction happens (above 50000cd, you probably have a second glare \nsource totally surrounded by another one).\n\n\nIn fact the coloring is meant to be just a testing-function to see if \nthe glare sources are detected correctly or if the detecting parameters \nhave to be adapted.\n\n\nYou can identify the center of each glare source by the x any y \ncoordinates (column 3 and 4 of the output).\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-December/000684.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "December 22, 2017 at 12:49AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000683", "id": "hdri_000684"}
