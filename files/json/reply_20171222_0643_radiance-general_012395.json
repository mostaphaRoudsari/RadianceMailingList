{"body": "Hi Dennis,\nHave you started with the output from the command gensky or gendaylit? I see they are both mentioned in step 2 of the tutorial you referred to, and probably would have given you an output with sun that you would have started with. These are standard Radiance commands for generating sun and sky brightness functions for particular parameters (latitude, longitude, cloud cover, time, etc.). Gensky creates closer to standard CIE sky definitions, while gendaylit can create skies more tailored to measured weather conditions. The manual page for either command might help:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gensky.pdf\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/gendaylit.pdf\n\n\n-Chris\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for viruses and acceptability of content\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012395.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "December 22, 2017 at 06:43AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012385", "id": "radiance-general_012395"}
