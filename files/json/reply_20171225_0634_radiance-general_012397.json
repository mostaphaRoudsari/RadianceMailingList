{"body": "Hi Davood,\n\n\nI am afraid that this is not going to work. You can model a lens with \ndielectric, if you ensure sufficiently high resolution of your mesh. \nThat will work if you \"look through it\" in Radiance. But if you want it \nto use it e.g. in illuminance calculations below your light pipe or see \nthe redistributed light on a diffuse surface, you would have to use the \nphoton map. You find an example here, where I tried to avoid tesselated \nsurfaces to create \"perfect\" spherical lenses:\n\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.2852.4321\n\n\nThe BSDF modifier will not help you here. The BSDF in Radiance describes \nan average over the surface you apply it to. A lens works different, it \nmatters wether your ray hits it in the center or on the edge, otherwise \nit will not work.\n\n\nAbout the light-pipe, you may do that with rfluxmtx. But maybe this is \njust one more reason to look into the photon map.\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012397.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
