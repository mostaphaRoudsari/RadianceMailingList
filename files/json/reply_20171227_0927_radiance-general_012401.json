{"body": "Hi Lars,\n\n\nIt's difficult to say for certain without your scene and knowing the rest of your options.  (Were they the defaults?)  I guess you aren't sharing your ambient cache file between rpiece processes as recommended.\n\n\nMy first guess is that you are only computing a single bounce with -aa 0.  This would explain why the values are on the low side.  If you set -ad 4096 then use an -lw setting of 1/4096 as you have, the weight test fails after the first bounce because the weight used is the first surface reflection divided by 4096.  Without Russian roulette on (-lr negative), no interreflection rays will be traced past the first bounce.  In general, I like to make sure my -lw setting is maybe 1/10th of the 1/N value for -ad N.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  If this doesn't solve the problem, please send me your scene and commands off-list and I'll take a closer look.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012401.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 27, 2017 at 09:27AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012399", "id": "radiance-general_012401"}
