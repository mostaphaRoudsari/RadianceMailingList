{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nthank you, that was in fact the reason for the mismatch. I had increased \n-ab without changing -lw.... In fact, this is also a problem with the \n\"rules of thumb\". I had initially set -ab 1 and -lw=1/ad (which often \nmakes sense), and did not review this setting at a later point...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012402.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.
