{"body": "Hi Valerie,\n\n\nIf you just want irradiance at specific points, you should use rtrace with the -I+ (capital 'i') option.  Rsensor is not needed unless you have a custom sensitivity distribution you are integrating.  If you give rtrace a list of coordinates and hemisphere (surface normal) orientations, you will get out a list of RGB irradiance values (watts/sr/m^2):\n\n\npositions.txt:\n\t10\t15\t3\t0\t0\t1\n\t10\t20\t3\t0\t0\t1\n\t15\t15\t3\t0\t0\t1\n\t15\t20\t3\t0\t0\t1\n\n\ncommand:\trtrace -h- -I+ -ab 1 scene.oct < positions.txt > results.txt\n\n\nThe output file will contain 3 values per line, corresponding to RGB irradiance at each point in the order given.\n\n\nThe \"-ab 1\" option is needed to turn on interreflections.  A more accurate calculation will result from \"-ab 2\" or \"-ab 3\".  You can also employ multiple processors using the \"-n\" option, but be sure to add a \"-af scene.amb\" option to share cached values for a more efficient calculation if you do that.\n\n\nThere are many other options you may consider changing to improve the speed/accuracy trade-off.  If you have only a few points, I might suggest something like this:\n\n\n\trtrace -h- -I+ -ab 3 -aa 0 -ad 4096 -lw 1e-5 -n 8 scene.oct < positions.txt > results.txt\n\n\nThe \"-n 8\" is appropriate for an 8-core machine, but if you only have a few points, the calculation will take just seconds in any case.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012405.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 28, 2017 at 09:48AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012403", "id": "radiance-general_012405"}
