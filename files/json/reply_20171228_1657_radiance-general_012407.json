{"body": "Hi Valerie,\n\n\nYou are correct about irradiance units, which are watts/meter^2.  That was my mistake.\n\n\nIf you wish to add up irradiance, I would still recommend doing this with rtrace rather than rsensor, unless you have a specific spherical sensitivity in mind.  You can give rtrace any hemisphere orientations you like and average the results using \"total\" or your own program.\n\n\nHowever, the light arriving on a plane *is* irradiance, which is a sum over the hemisphere of incoming directions with a cosine weighting.  If you were to give rtrace a set of different directions for irradiance, then you would arrive at something more like total incident radiation at a point, which is an unusual quantity.  What do you need this value for, exactly?\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012407.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 28, 2017 at 04:57PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012406", "id": "radiance-general_012407"}
