{"body": "Hi Georg! Long time. We are about done with a re-write of the Cmake build system as well, which allows us to do automated build/test/CI on our GitHub mirror of the Radiance CVS repo. Exciting times! \n\n\nThere was some shuffling around of the pmap includes. It\u2019s been building for us on Windows since late summer 2017, I\u2019ll have to look and see what we are doing, unless Roland/Greg know offhand. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 1/8/18, 6:44 AM, \"Georg Mischler\" <schorsch at schorsch.com> wrote:\n\n\n    Hello everybody,\n\n\n    As it is starting to turn into a new year's tradition, I've just\n    updated the SCons build system once again.\n\n\n    Good news 1:\n    With Scons 3.1 (probably since 3.0), despite what the documentation\n    says, it works very nicely with Python 3.x (3.6 in my case).\n    After some adaptions from my side, this means that all the Python\n    code in the Radiance distribution is now compatible with both\n    Python 2.7 and 3.x.\n\n\n    Good news 2:\n    Microsoft has fixed their Universal CRT (didn't check in which version).\n    This means that the line-end-eating bug in pipes is gone, and we can\n    reliably build Radiance with the current Visual Studio tools again.\n    I have now completely switched to VS 2017 myself.\n\n\n    Open Issue:\n    There's a buch of code relating to \"out of core octree\" building\n    for Pmap. Most of this compiles fine, except for pmapooc.c, which\n    is missing some header file includes. Unfortunately, that seems to\n    be the central cornerstone binding all the others together...\n    @Roland:\n      Can you share some insight whether this is supposed to be working,\n      or still a work in progress that I should ignore for the moment?\n      Or alternatively, am I doing anything wrong for making it work?\n\n\n\n\n    Cheers\n    -schorsc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Georg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n    +schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.schorsch.com%2F&data=02%7C01%7Crobert.guglielmetti%40nrel.gov%7C1a1e1bdd09444585300608d5569dee6e%7Ca0f29d7e28cd4f5484427885aee7c080%7C0%7C0%7C636510158689605858&sdata=J%2FOY2UqprWww8V0qGdXHRiZ6SurpnVIwzQqHYzc5x1E%3D&reserved=0\n\n\n    _______________________________________________\n    Radiance-dev mailing list\n    Radiance-dev at radiance-online.org\n    https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiance-online.org%2Fmailman%2Flistinfo%2Fradiance-dev&data=02%7C01%7Crobert.guglielmetti%40nrel.gov%7C1a1e1bdd09444585300608d5569dee6e%7Ca0f29d7e28cd4f5484427885aee7c080%7C0%7C0%7C636510158689605858&sdata=UcMlmf4VOdZ%2FP3anQu%2F%2BJ7BY%2Bts7%2FYZYwdk0vmmbo78%3D&reserved=0\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2018-January/001735.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Rob Guglielmetti", "created_at": "January 08, 2018 at 07:03AM", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001734", "id": "radiance-dev_001735"}
