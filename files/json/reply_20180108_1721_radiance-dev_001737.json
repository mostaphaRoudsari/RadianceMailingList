{"body": "Hi Schorsch,\n\n\nMany thanks for working on this.\n\n\nMy memory is that a Windows version of the out-of-core photon-mapping code is on Roland's back-burner, and likely to remain there for the indefinite future.  The code relies heavily on memory sharing and the Unix fork() function in its current configuration, and changing that is not an insignificant amount of work.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2018-January/001737.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 08, 2018 at 05:21PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-dev_001734", "id": "radiance-dev_001737"}
