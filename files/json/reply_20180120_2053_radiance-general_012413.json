{"body": "Koji\n\n\nThe latest release is su2rad 2014. I have tested it with occasionally with\nnew SketchUp released up to 2017 and didn't find significant issues that\nrequired updates. There may be new issues with specific models that did not\nmanifest itself before. You can try and downgrade your model and use an\nolder version of SketchUp to do the export. Also open the Ruby console\nbefore you run the export script. You will see some logging and potential\nerror messages from the export.\n\n\nYou can find the latest version of su2rad here:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/tbleicher/su2rad/releases\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\nOn Sat, Jan 20, 2018 at 10:13 PM, Koji Takemasa <koji_takemasa at me.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012413.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "January 20, 2018 at 08:53PM", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012412", "id": "radiance-general_012413"}
