{"body": "P.S.  Forgot to answer your final question.  You can place your receiver surface slightly in front of your window -- you are right that you don't want it in the same plane as another surface with a different material.  This would definitely mess things up.  You can re-use the same inward-facing surface as used for the view matrix receiver as a sender in the rfluxmtx command, and the material type will be ignored.  Having this surface a little inside the window will include the window in the daylight matrix.  If you want its influence in the view matrix, you can put your glow/light surface just outside the window, still with its surface normal facing into the room.  This would be appropriate if you wanted to use a BTDF for an exterior shading system, for example.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012417.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 22, 2018 at 07:20PM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012415", "id": "radiance-general_012417"}
