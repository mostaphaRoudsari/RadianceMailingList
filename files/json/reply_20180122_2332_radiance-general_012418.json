{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am using 5.2, I will try with \u201cklems_full.cal\u201d and the windows are defined as \u201cglow\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will definitely give the multiplication and addition a good go myself first but thank you for letting me know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, I am going between Sarith\u2019s tutorial and Andy\u2019s gitbook tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour explanation to my final questions is incredibly helpful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to the multiplication of matrices, I am just testing with one window at the moment and I have an error that says \u201cunexpected column count in header\u201d.\n\n\nThe view matrix has 13 rows and 145 columns\n\n\nThe daylight matrix has 145 rows and 2306 columns\n\n\nThe sky matrix has 146 rows and 8760 columns (but there is only 3 columns (RGB) and many many rows)\n\n\nAnd the BTDF is in its own different format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould the sky matrix say 146? Or 145? My command to create a smx is: \u201cgendaymtx albany.wea > albany.smx\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\nSandi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012418.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Sandi Sirikhanchai", "created_at": "January 22, 2018 at 11:32PM", "created_by": "Sandi_Sirikhanchai", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012415", "id": "radiance-general_012418"}
