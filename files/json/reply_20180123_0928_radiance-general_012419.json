{"body": "Hi Sandi,\n\n\nThe output of gendaymtx has 146 columns because the first column corresponds to the ground plane, and this is needed for a full calculation.  However, you need to create your daylight matrix in the right way to make use of this.  I believe this is explained in Sarith's tutorial, and also in my 2013 rfluxmtx introduction, below.  Pay special attention to slide 42:\n\n\n\thttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co/Ward-RadianceImprovements.pdf\n\n\nIt can also help to give a -y option in your view matrix calculation, corresponding to the number of sensor points (-y 13).  I don't think it's required the way you are doing things, but rmtxop (for example) requires the number of rows and columns to be spelled out in the header.  Note that this overrides the actual line breaks in the file, making files like the output of gendaymtx a little more readable.  (8760x3 columns are a bit much for some line-based editors.)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012419.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "January 23, 2018 at 09:28AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012415", "id": "radiance-general_012419"}
