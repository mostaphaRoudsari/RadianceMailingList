{"body": "Actually, you need the sun to produce the initial light, to be bounced around for the diffuse. So the basic idea is (props to Andy McNeill) you do a \"normal\" simulation with a full sun and sky, and then a second one with JUST the sun, and then subtract the latter from the former, to get the diffuse-only.
