{"body": "How did you generate your sky definition? If it's from gensky you could just generate it using the -c, -i, -s, or -u options. The -c is the only one of these that is a representation of a somewhat realistic scene - completely overcast sky (inherently without direct sun). From the gensky manual page:\n\n\n-s Sunny sky without sun. The sky distribution will correspond to a standard CIE clear day.\n+s Sunny sky with sun. In addition to the sky distribution function, a source description of the sun is generated.\n-c Cloudy sky. The sky distribution will correspond to a standard CIE overcast day.\n-i Intermediate sky without sun. The sky will correspond to a standard CIE intermediate day.\n+i Intermediate sky with sun. In addition to the sky distribution, a (somewhat subdued) sun is generated.\n-u Uniform cloudy sky. The sky distribution will be completely uniform.\n\n\n-Chris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012424.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "January 26, 2018 at 09:50AM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012422", "id": "radiance-general_012424"}
