{"body": "Hello Dennis,\n\n\nIf you want to calculate the \"illuminance generated by the Skie's diffuse\nilluminance\", you can do what Christopher is suggesting. However, if you\nwant to also include the diffuse illuminance generated by, for example,\ndirect sun reflected on surface, the task is somehow harder.\n\n\nIn that case, I would calculate total illuminance (i.e. rtrace < points.pt\n> -I+ -ab 4 -ad 5000 ... octree.oct > total_illuminance.txt); and then\nsubstract the direct one (rtrace < points.pt > I+ -*ab 0 octree.oct *>\ndirect_illuminance ) and then substract (diffuse = total_illumiannce-\ndirect_illuminance)\n\n\nI hope that helps!\n\n\nGerman\n\n\n2018-01-26 14:50 GMT-03:00 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012425.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Germ\u00e1n Molina Larrain", "created_at": "January 26, 2018 at 12:13PM", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012422", "id": "radiance-general_012425"}
