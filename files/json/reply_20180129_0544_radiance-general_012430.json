{"body": "Hello,\n\n\nI agree with Lars in everything, but I also want to add some things:\n\n\n   1. I believe that, for scientific use of daylight simulations, you need\n   extensive numerical validation. Some renders are not focused on that, but\n   only on speed and generating \"photorealistic images\", which are different\n   from \"photometrically correct images\"... Does that make sense? I think this\n   is the most important difference between Radiance and other renderers out\n   there.\n   2. In 2012 I asked this in the PBRT google group, and they advice me to\n   keep using Radiance (LINK\n   <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pbrt/xQlfQnPYPB0>)\n   3. The irradiance Cache seem to be pretty unique for Radiance.... ?\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018-01-29 9:23 GMT-03:00 Lars O.
