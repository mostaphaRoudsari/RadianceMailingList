{"body": "What you're seeing makes sense to me, that the quality of rendering relies more on ambient calculation parameters when the calculation is 100% diffuse/ambient light, without a direct light source.\n\n\nYou also seem to be moving the parameters in the direction of higher accuracy and longer rendering time so shouldn't be detracting from validity.\n\n\nAs for reading materials, I'm sure lots of people could make suggestions. The book Rendering with Radiance is likely a top suggestion. Also, here's a presentation that I recently re-discovered from a past annual workshop:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/JM_AmbientCalculation.pdf\n\n\nActually you could browse all the past workshop presentations for relevant materials, although I'm not sure how easy it will be to judge them by the titles.\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nChris\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012436.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Christopher Rush", "created_at": "January 30, 2018 at 01:04PM", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012435", "id": "radiance-general_012436"}
