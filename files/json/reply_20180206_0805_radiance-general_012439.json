{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nIt looks like your HDR image header is missing the necessary view information.  Typically, this might be something like:\n\n\nVIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180\n\n\nfor a perspective such as yours.  You should be sure that your fisheye mapping corresponds to one of the standard Radiance types.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012439.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2018 at 08:05AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012438", "id": "radiance-general_012439"}
