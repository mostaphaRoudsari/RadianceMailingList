{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nI added these options while passing to evalglare like below.\n\n\nevalglare -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 <hdr file>, and it worked but it always gives 1.0 as DGP (even other parameters are out of bounds).\n\n\nWith out those options evalglare throws an error.\n\n\nApart from that\n\n\nAre all the LDR\u2019s provided, valid to combine into HDR?\n\n\nI doubt if one or more of the LDR\u2019s is the culprit (especially something to do with over or under exposure).\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012440.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "raghuram kalyanam", "created_at": "February 06, 2018 at 09:05AM", "created_by": "raghuram_kalyanam", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012438", "id": "radiance-general_012440"}
