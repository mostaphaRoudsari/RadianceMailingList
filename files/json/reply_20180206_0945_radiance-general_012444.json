{"body": "Ha.  Jan is right -- the HDR values are way off.  I should have looked at the result more closely and noticed that everything was too bright.\n\n\nI can take your JPEGs and give them to Photosphere or hdrgen, combining them using a generic response function.  I cannot solve for the camera response with these inputs, which likely means that the camera is playing around with the tone curve on the different exposures.  This is a no-no, and indicates that the camera is probably not suitable for HDR capture.  Nevertheless, hdrgen can create something usable that does not agree at all with your result.\n\n\nBy the way, your shortest exposure is still clipping the sun, which means that your DGP won't be accurate for this scene, even if you can get your HDR builder to work unless you can get a shorter exposure.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012444.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 06, 2018 at 09:45AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012438", "id": "radiance-general_012444"}
