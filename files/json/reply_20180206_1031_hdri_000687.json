{"body": "Hi Raghu,\n\n\nThe spot luminance measurements should ideally be done for several \nranges for each HDR capturing (e.g. one reference area with 100cd/m2, \nanother one with several thousands) and finally you compare the \nilluminance of the image with the measured one and you should reject any \nimage with a deviation larger than 25% deviation of the illuminance. \nWith a proper calibration you can be also within 10%.\n\n\nDefinitely the luminances of your image are totally off (=physically \nimpossible, at least factor\u00a0 50 for the blue sky) - it has nothing to do \nwith evalglare.\n\n\nBTW. evalglare calculates the illuminance also for that image (617414.88 \nlux) - there is no limit or \"out of bounds\". Just that your image has \nmuch too high luminances, so you get also an unrealistic illuminance...\n\n\nIt is hard to tell where the problem lies exactly, but definitely it is \ncaused by your applied\u00a0 hdr generation process.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2018-February/000687.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jan Wienold", "created_at": "February 06, 2018 at 10:31AM", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold", "parent_id": "hdri_000685", "id": "hdri_000687"}
