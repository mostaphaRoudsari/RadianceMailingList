{"body": "Hi Greg,\n\n\nThanks for answering!\nI thought of the same thing (after reading the corresponding Rendering for Radiance chapter) - but the wall looks white to me under daylight (and mixed daylight/artificial light). When using the values I got from xyz_rgb.cal (indeed, divided by 100, I forgot to add that! :)), the result is way too blue for my liking... (http://oi63.tinypic.com/2u7u60y.jpg).\n\n\nIf I understand correctly, the difference between the resulting RGB values when using xyz_rgb.cal/the new Colour Picker conversion and easyrgb.com/the older Colour Picker conversion is caused because of the illuminant assumptions (EE vs D65)? Do you think I can assume that the easyrgb.com conversion -where I can specify D65 as the illuminant- is then correct for my measurements?\n\n\nCheers - and thanks again for your help!\nKynthia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012451.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chamilothori Kynthia", "created_at": "February 08, 2018 at 10:52AM", "created_by": "Chamilothori_Kynthia", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012449", "id": "radiance-general_012451"}
