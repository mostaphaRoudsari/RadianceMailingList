{"body": "Hi Kynthia,\n\n\nI'm not sure how easyrgb.com does its calculations, but there is a known problem when converting between white points.  One method uses a von Kries transform to attempt to match white appearances via a color adaptation space, and another just gives you what you would measure with a colorimeter.  The xyz_rgb.cal program follows the colorimetric method, so if you took your measurements under bluish light, it will stay bluish even if your new color space has a warmer illuminant.\n\n\nAs I said, you would ideally set your Minolta to give you XYZ under EE illumination rather than D65.  However, one way to trick xyz_rgb.cal into doing a cheap white point adaptation is to tell it to give you the Radiance RGB's assuming a D65 white point rather than EE white.  To do so, you can run:\n\n\nrcalc -f xyz_rgb.cal -e 'CIE_pri(i) = select(i, 0.640,0.330, 0.290,0.600, 0.150,0.060,0.3127,0.3290)' \\\n\t-e '$1=R($1,$2,$3)/100;$2=G($1,$2,$3)/100;$3=B($1,$2,$3)/100'\n\n\nYou then give it your XYZ values on the input side, separated by spaces or tabs, one XYZ per line.  The output will be the RGB values.  For your wall, I get:\n\n\n\tRadiance RGB = 0.876 0.857 0.734\n\n\nNote that the Radiance RGB primary chromaticities don't match the standard (sRGB) ones.  This is unfortunate, but historical as Radiance's color system predates even sRGB.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012452.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 08, 2018 at 11:57AM", "created_by": "Greg_Ward", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012449", "id": "radiance-general_012452"}
