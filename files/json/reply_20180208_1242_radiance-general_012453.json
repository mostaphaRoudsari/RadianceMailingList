{"body": "Hi Kynthia & Greg,\n\n\nI read your posts and I'm also curious about white point adaptation and how it applies to Radiance.\n\n\n>From Greg's last comment, you recommended replacing the input white point chromaticity of equal energy white with chromaticity of D65 (x=0.3127,y=0.3290) in the xyz_rgb.cal calculation of the r,g,b components. What impact does this have, that you are not using the equal energy white point? As I understand Radiance computes luminance using equation: Luminance = 179 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B), where 179 lumen/Watt is the standard luminous efficacy of equal energy white light. So does the r,g,b material definition needs to be defined for an equal energy white point in order to have correct luminance/illuminance estimations?\n\n\nSo given a reflectance spectrum under a D65 illuminant is a white point balancing transformation necessary to correctly define the Radiance material primitive?\nCan the output of xyz_rgb.cal be safely used for the r,g,b material definition?\n\n\nThank you for the interesting and helpful discussion.\n\n\nKind Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012453.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Andrei Kolomenski", "created_at": "February 08, 2018 at 12:42PM", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012449", "id": "radiance-general_012453"}
