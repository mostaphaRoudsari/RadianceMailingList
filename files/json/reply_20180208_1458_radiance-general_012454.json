{"body": "Hi Greg, hi Andrei,\n\n\n\n\nAndrei - very interesting points, I'm curious to see what the community has to say.\n\n\nFor your last question, I understood from Greg's comments that the output of xyz_rgb.cal is correct for measurements taken under equal energy illumination (so the assumed white point is indeed the one used for the measurement).\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, from what I see in the manual, there is no equal energy illuminant setting (E) for the Konica Minolta CM-600d,  unless I'm missing something; I see only A/C/D/F variants. It seems to me that your clever trick with the white adaptation is the best way to go, Greg. Thank you both for the discussion and help!\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nKynthia\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012454.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chamilothori Kynthia", "created_at": "February 08, 2018 at 02:58PM", "created_by": "Chamilothori_Kynthia", "parent_id": "radiance-general_012449", "id": "radiance-general_012454"}
