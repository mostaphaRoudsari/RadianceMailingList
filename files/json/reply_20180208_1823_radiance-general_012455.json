{"body": "Well, the problem with XYZ measurements of reflectance is that they require an illuminant, so that sort of forces your hand.  If you were measuring a light source, then setting an illuminant would make no sense, and I think this is why chroma meters (in contrast to reflectometers) don't have a white point setting.\n\n\nThe coefficients used for computing lumens from Radiance RGB values won't be affected much by your choice of illuminant, but if you want to get into the gory details of correct color rendering, you can start here:\n\n\n\tWard, Greg, Elena Eydelberg-Vileshin, \"Picture Perfect RGB Rendering Using Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries,\" Thirteenth Eurographics Workshop on Rendering (2002), P.
