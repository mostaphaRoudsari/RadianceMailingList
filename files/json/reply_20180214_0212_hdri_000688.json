{"body": "Hi Jan and Greg,\n\n\nThank you very much  for your  suggestions. Finally the issue seems to be solved. It is true that the problem is  in HDR generation process. We divided each of the pixel values by 179, then HDR seems to be in  radiance compatible format. Now the results of these HDR images from Evalglare are more meaningful.\n\n\nOnce again I thank you for your effort. \n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2018-February/000688.html).</sup>", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "raghuram kalyanam", "created_at": "February 14, 2018 at 02:12AM", "created_by": "raghuram_kalyanam", "parent_id": "hdri_000685", "id": "hdri_000688"}
