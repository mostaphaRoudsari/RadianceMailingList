Radiance uses this routine in the context\nof an attempt at saving some memory when the ambient data\ngrows beyond a certain margin. If you have lots of RAM, then\nyou don't really need this, and you can set the margin to\na very big size with the following compilation option:\n\n\n -DSORT_THRESH=0x7fffffffffffffff\n\n\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000014.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000014", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
