Or are there some Sparc/Alpha/PowerPC-users here?\n\n\nIn fact, I have never been interested too much in cpu-performance,\nbenchmarks\netc... I only wanted my machine to run stable ;-) But as I have access\nto wider\nrange of platforms at the moment (sparc and ultrasparc, alpha, powerpc)\nI\nwould like to hear if there is the ultimate platform for radiance, or at\nleast\nif these non-x86 are used by radiance-users.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-July/000006.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000006", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
