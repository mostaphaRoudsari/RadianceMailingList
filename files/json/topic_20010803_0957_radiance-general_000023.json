If you add the -s switch in gensurf you can get\na smooth shaded surface. Is there any way I can insert this smoothing to a surface\nthat I have imported from AutoCAD? I do not want to increase the polygon count but\ni do want to smooth out the faceted glare on the surface.\n\n\nAny ideas about this?\n\n\nOn a side note I am also looking at modelling light redirection systems (horizantal/vertical\nglazing) and refractive systems. I have looked at some of the designs on www.schorsch.com\nand attempted to model them using AutoCAD or a gen program then assigning a dielectric\nmaterial. Does any else have experience with creating these and would it be possible\nto use a different modifier? I am looking for the most accurate calculation.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nRussell Maunder\n\n\nBBSc (hons)\nVictoria University of Wellington\nSchool of Architecture and Design\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nAdvertise with ZFREE - to find out more click below\nhttp://www.zfree.co.nz/about-us/advert.html\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-August/000023.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000023", "created_by": "Russell_Maunder"}
