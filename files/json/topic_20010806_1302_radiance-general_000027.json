It is possible to measure glass sheets and then fit the \nparameters to the data but I guess somebody has already made this.\n\n\nDo you know and can you recommend any material libraries for transparent \nand translucent materials? How could they be obtained (links, contact \ninformation etc.)?\n\n\nBest regards,\nMarkku Norvasuo\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\nMarkku Norvasuo, Senior Research Scientist (MArch, MScTech)\nTechnical Research Centre of Finland\nP.O.Box 1804, FIN-02044 VTT, Finland\nTel. +358 9 456 6269 (office), +358 40 515 1100 (mobile)\nFax  +358 9 456 2408, e-mail: markku.norvasuo@vtt.fi\n* * * N.B. address and fax changed from June 15. * * *\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-August/000027.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000027", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
