I want\nto use \nthese fotos to get an idea about color. So I wanted to use gray levels to\ndetermine \nthe reflectance and fotos to get rgb values (in fact I wanted to do this as\ndescribed \nin \"Renderin with Radiance\").\n\n\nNow I have problems getting the Macbeth Target. We us Kodak targets here,\nbut \nthose are not supported in the radiance \"color management\".\n\n\nSo, is it possible to use Kodak targets with radiance, or do you know where\nI get \nMacbeth colorchecker in Germany?\n\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nGMX - Die Kommunikationsplattform im Internet.\nhttp://www.gmx.net\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-September/000043.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000043", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
