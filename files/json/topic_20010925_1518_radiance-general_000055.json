In this context, I have to convert cartesian coordinates in \npolar coordinates.\nFor a surface (i.e. rectangle) the normal is determined by the right-\nhand rule. So far - so good. Unfortunately, I am not sure how the \nlocal coordinate system for the rectangle is defined?! How are the x-\naxis, y-axis and z-axis are oriented? The source ray direction \n(x,y,z) and the transmitted ray direction (Dx,Dy,Dz) are referring to \nthis local coordinate system, aren't they?\n\n\nCould anybody give a hint to solve my problems?\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nFrank\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-September/000055.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000055", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
