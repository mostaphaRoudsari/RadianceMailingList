In other words, I want to trace the\ninitial ray cast for each pixel, and find the surface normal of the first\nsurface that ray hits.  I figured out that I could do this using rtrace\n-on, if I feed rtrace the rays corresponding to each pixel in my\nimage.  Is there an easy way to compute all of these rays automatically\nusing an existing Radiance program, or will I need to write a special .cal\nfile for rcalc?  I have the feeling that some Radiance gurus could\naccomplish this task in one or two lines.\n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice,\n\n\nRon\n\n\nPhD student, MIT AI Lab\nhttp://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rondror/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-October/000060.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000060", "created_by": "Ron_O._Dror"}
