With the help of 'rtrace', I will verify the \nresults. Is it possible to compute luminance values with 'rtrace'? \n\n\n2) In the Radiance Digest I have found a formula for the metdata \nmaterial:\n\n\nradiance (watts/sr/m^2) Lo = spec * cos(theta_i) * omega_i * Li * f\n\n\nwhere:\n        f = BTDF in 1/sr\nmega_i = solid angle of source in sr\n       Li = avg. radiance of source in watts/sr/m^2\ntheta_i = angle between surface normal and source direction\n   spec = multiplier for specular component from material arguments\n\n\nI would like to calculate the luminance values back to the \nmeasured BTDF's using the transdata formula. How can I get the \ntransdata formula?\n\n\n3) Another question concerns the diffuse sky component. How will \nRadiance compute this component with the transdata material?\n\n\nCould anybody answer my questions or give me reference how I \ncan solve these problems?\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nFrank\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-November/000068.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000068", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
