E.g. if\nI want to map onto a cylinder, I know that there is a cal-file, but I\ndon't really understand this. Now, maybe I should try, but I just found\na set of tools called panotools (www.panotools.org), which is able to\nconvert bitmap-files from different projections. Would it be possible to\nuse it to create imagefiles that could be mapped onto e.g. a radiance\ncylinder without any further calculations, just like mapping iot onto a\nplane? I would really like to have pic-files that don't need any further\ncalculations.\n\n\nSo, maybe someone tried something like this before? Or am I completely\nwrong with this?\n\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-November/000070.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000070", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
