I usually use sunny sky and so never came across this\nproblem before.\n\n\nThus far I have changed the skylight material around several times to\nmake\nsure that I didn't create a really bad example of a trans, I am running\nmkillum\nand surface normals are correct, and I have also increased the rendering\n\n\nquality (to see if more light can be found) but nothing is working.\n\n\nAny help for this would be great.\nthanks,\n\n\njudy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-December/000077.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000077", "created_by": "judy_lai"}
