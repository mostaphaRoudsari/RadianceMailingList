Images > 12000x12000 pixels worked well\non machines with <256MB main memory.\n\n\n> Also, some of the *wonderful* textures such as the finer woodgrains\n> have very odd effects on time to compute.

So the more elaborate the functions, the longer it\ntakes.\n\n\n> Also Also wik: I did a kitchen with a mix of off-white and brushed steel\n> aluminimum surfaces.
