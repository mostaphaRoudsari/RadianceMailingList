I'm assuming\nthat efficacy is for light energy and not power consumed.  Is this the same\nfor all lamps?  Most of the time the efficacy of a lamp refers to the power\nconsumed, a typical T8 having an efficacy of 2900lumens/32W or 90lumens/W.\n\n\nAlso, I agree that the luminous surface is 0.0979m2 (I had missed a length of\n4' in my calc).  Then you calculated the radiance with\n\n\n  16.2W / (0.0979m2 * Pi) = 52.7 W/m2/sr\n\n\nThis is the total radiant output per steradian per area.  However, it seems\nlike the total steradians you should be dividing by is the entire sphere that\nthe 16.2W of radiant energy is filling, a sphere being 4*pi steradians.  This\ngives;\n\n\n 16.2W / (0.0979m2 * 4 * Pi) = 13.17 W/m2/sr\n\n\nSo, I'm still a little confused with the math here, and the efficacy used to\nconvert lumens to light energy(W).\n\n\nBTW, I too get those values when I run lampcolor, I was just looking at the\nexample in the Rendering with Radiance book, which I guess might have a typo.\n\n\nThanks for the help,\nZack\n\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-December/000101.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000101", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers"}
