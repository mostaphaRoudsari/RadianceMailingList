I will try compiling\nit on my alpha this weekend and post my results :-)\n\n\nRegarding a Radiance workshop, I am somewhat interested.  Approximately\nwhere and when would such a workshop be held?  I am guessing the\nworkshop would be held in the Berkeley or SF area, but could you be more\nspecific about the time: september, october, november?  Also, how\naccessible would this workshop be for newbies?  Raytracing is my hobby,\nso I am more interested in just creating images than architectural\nlighting (I am currently working my way through your book RENDERING WITH\nRADIANCE).\n\n\nOnce again, thanks for updating Radiance.\n\n\nDaniel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2001-December/000104.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000104", "created_by": "Joycelyn_Maddux"}
