We believe it has to\ndo with the newer X server xfree86 4.1.0.  Has anyone else run into this\nproblem or know how we can fix it?  It is a real pain, I've been having\nto take my Linux Radiance images over to Windows NT to view them.\n\n\nThanks,\nZack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000109.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000109", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers"}
