Or I use \nthe same way as in CAD, take a quite simple geometry and create the hole by \nmapping with colorpict onto a quite simple transparent surface. In fact, I \ndon't have much experience with textures and patterns in radiance (\"Rendering \nwith Radiance\" is next to my keyboard, I wouldn't know what to do here \nwithout this ;-).\n\n\nWhat do you think that I should prefer? I ask as I need to know which way is \nmore efficient as I have got a very large model to place my treed in, and I \nwant to be still able to let radiance compute on my machine in reasonable \ntimes.\n\n\nIn any way, I am using instances here.\n\n\nThank You, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000114.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000114", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
