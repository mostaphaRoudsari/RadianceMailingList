Available online is\na nifty widget program that can create 3d trees in varying complexity and\nshapes in their file format .dw that's exportable to .dxf. There might even\nbe a straight forward way from .dw to .rad but I think you have to buy\nDesignWorkshop Pro to have that functionality...\n\n\nAnyway, at http://www.artifice.com/machines/tree.html  is the tree machine.\nAt http://www.artifice.com/dw.html  is where you can get the free download\nof DesignWorkshop Lite.\n\n\nAfter customizing a tree using the online form, click to download the tree.dw,\nthen open up tree file using DesignWorkshop Lite, export tree into dxf format\nand then into your CAD program.  Quite a few steps, but I think these trees\nlook pretty good...\n\n\njudy\n\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000116.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000116", "created_by": "judy_lai"}
