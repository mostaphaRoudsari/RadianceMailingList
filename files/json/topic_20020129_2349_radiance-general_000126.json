I'm spending quite a lot of time with radiance at the moment ;-)\n\n\nI want to print some renderings on a large format printer. If I simply print \na tiff (generated with ra_tiff), I get very bad colors (not enough \nsaturation, everything appears grey).\n\n\nNo I tried the macbethcal. I printed the macbeth-pic from the distribution \n(using the same print chain as I will do with the rendering), scanned it with \nan xrite 41, calculated xyY from x-rite's xyz-data (is there a converter / \nscript to do this out there???), made a cal-file (with some warning \nconcerning gamut of intermediate colors). But pcond says \"cannot grok \nmacbethcal file\", and something about inp-flags 077. What does it mean?\n\n\nMaybe someone may help? So long, I must use photoshop ;-)\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000126.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000126", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
