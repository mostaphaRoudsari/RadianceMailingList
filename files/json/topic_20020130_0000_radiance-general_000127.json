I have been using 3r2 on alpha with compaq c for \nlinux before.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000127.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000127", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
