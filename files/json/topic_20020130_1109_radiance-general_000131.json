I recently attempted to model a indoor Tropical Rain Forest.  For this I had 20 or so different types of trees.  I made octrees for each type and inserted\nthem into my model using instances, some of the octrees as large as 9.7MB.  Without using instances the resulting model octree would have been gigantic.  Using\ninstances the resulting octree was about 5.9MB, still pretty large but much more reasonable.  To confirm what Judy has said, with the backwards ray-tracing technique\nused by Radiance, ridiculously complex geometry does not necessarily mean ridiculously long rendering times.  I did not exclude the trees from the ambient\ncalculation and a single image of this rainforest, using medium rendering quality and 2 ambient bounces, rendered in several hours on my 950MHz computer.  Radiance\nis amazing!  These images can be seen at:\n\n\nhttp://www.archenergy.com/sda/designtools/radiance.html  ---> Phipps\n\n\nAs far as modeling water, I recently tried to tackle this for a glare study on an indoor pool.  I modeled the water using the ripple.cal function, as follows;\n\n\nvoid texfunc water_1\n6 riple_x riple_y riple_z ripple.cal -s 1\n0\n4 .13 .13 0 .13\n\n\nwater_1  BRTDfunc Water\n10      rrho    grho    brho\n          rtau     gtau    btau\n          0 0 0\n          water.cal\n0\n18      0       0       0\n          0       0       0\n          0       0       0\n          1 1 1\n          1 1 1\n          .7 .90 .90\n\n\nWhere water.cal is just a slightly modified glazing.cal function.  I was attempting to better model the transmittance and reflectance vs. incidence angle\ncharacteristics of water.  This is not the most accurate way to model water and I would not use this if any underwater calculations are needed.  I think the most\naccurate way to model water is to use a diaelectric.  I have not tried this but have heard it makes for long simulation times.  The images of the pool can also be\nseen at;\n\n\nhttp://www.archenergy.com/sda/designtools/radiance.html  ---> Chilson\n\n\nHope this helps!\nZack\n\n\nradiance-general-request@radiance-online.org wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000131.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000131", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers"}
