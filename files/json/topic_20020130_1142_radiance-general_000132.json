I don't know how portable \ndynamically-linked binaries are across Linux systems, but you're welcome \nto try.  Certainly, the executables (and download size) is much smaller!\n\n\nI did not verify that every aspect of the system is working correctly, \nbut I ran through a standard rendering and it seemed to work.  Please \nlet me know of any problems you encounter.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-January/000132.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000132", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
