But nevertheless\nI'd  like to know whether somebody already did this before\nI waste time on re-doing it.\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nVolker\n\n\n\n\nVolker Hilsenstein                      phone: +49 6221 546542\nInstitute for Environmental Physics                     546628\nUniversity of Heidelberg\nINF 229 Room 116\n69120 Heidelberg\nGermany                 vhilsens@freitag.iup.uni-heidelberg.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-February/000137.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000137", "created_by": "Volker_Hilsenstein"}
