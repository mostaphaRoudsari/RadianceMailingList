{"topic": "Radiance and sRGB (continued)", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "February 15, 2002 at 08:12AM", "body": "Sorry Markku -- I didn't really finish answering your question....\n\n\nThe RGB color space used by all version of Radiance for the last 5 years \nat least should be the same, namely those given in src/common/color.h.  \nThe latest 3.4 release handles the transformation into other spaces \ndifferently, so using the -p option of pcond, ra_tiff, or ra_xyze will \ngive you a different result, and this different will be significant for \nlarge white point changes.  (If you stick with an equal-energy white, as \nyou are encouraged to do by the outdated documentation, there will be no \nchange in your results.)\n\n\nThe ra_tiff program does not normally report the Radiance primaries to \nthe appropriate chromaticity tags in the TIFF output.  It only does this \nif you use the ra_tiff -p option or a PRIMARIES= line appears in the \nRadiance header. The latter only happens when one of the other programs \n(pcond or ra_xyze) puts it there when it gets a -p option.  All very \nconfusing, but I'm sure I must have had a good reason for doing it this \nway.  I just can't recall what it was.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S. to Mischler -- good find on the replmarks bug.  Sure enough, it's \nin 3.4 as well.  I've put in a fix for the next release.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-February/000153.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000153", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
