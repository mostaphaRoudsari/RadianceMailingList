On large, high quality simulations, I get this error;\n\n\nrtrace: consistency - address not found in avlmemi\n\n\nI know I was experiencing this same error with Rayfront, and Georg, you said\nit had something to do with a bug in the qsort routine.  Anyways, you fixed\nit and sent me new rpict/rview/rtrace binaries.  However, as you all probably\nknow and I believe due to the different directory structures between\nprograms, these fixed Rayfront binaries do not work with the new Radiance 3.4\nrelease(eg. can't find rayinit.cal etc.).  I believe this is just the same\nbug in the Radiance 3.4 release.  So...in the meantime, does anybody know of\na workaround solution?  And is anybody else getting this or similar errors or\nis something wrong with the wau my models are set up that cause this to\nhappen?  The exact same model works fine on both my windows installation and\nmy rayfront installation (with new 3 updated binaries).\n\n\nThanks!\n~Zack\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating 20 Years of Improving Building Energy Performance\n\n\nZack Rogers\nDaylighting Designer/Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nwww.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000165.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000165", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers"}
