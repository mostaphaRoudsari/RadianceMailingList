Clearly shadows areas are not black, the output of pextrem is like \nthat:\n469 73  5.702972e-04 5.702972e-04 5.702972e-04\n311 652 7.402344e-01 7.402344e-01 7.402344e-01\n\n\nI can do it with linear mapping, but my purpose is really to use\nthe histogram method!!\n\n\nThis problem seems to be relevant to almost any scene.\n\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\n\nFrederic Drago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the world\u2019s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000169.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000169", "created_by": "frederic_drago"}
