What are my other \noptions, from the rview command line?  I looked in the \nhtml formatted man pages on the CD-ROM that came with \nthe book, but it does not go into it there. \n\n\nWhicl leads me to question #3.  How can I get the man \npages working from the command line if I loaded the pre-\ncompiled binaries?  Are they there, and I just need to set \na link or something?  Or do I need to compile from source \nfor that stuff to get installed?  I've been using the CD-\nROM stuff, but I'd like to have commandline access to it \nand also read up on the holodeck (assuming there's a \nman page for it).  \n\n\nSorry for this sudden barrage of newbie questions.  I \nhope to have more challenging ones for you all later on...\n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti <rpg777@earthlink.net>\n    http://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000172.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000172", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
