In 3D space, you need two\nnon-parallel vectors to define a local carthesian coordinate\nsystem (the third vector is deducted by the right hand rule).\nIf the two vectors given are not orthogonal, then Radiance will\ninternally recalculate the up-vector to the orthogonal direction,\nwhich isn't very complicated to do. If you imagine the vertical\nplane that includes both your view direction and the orthogonal\nup direction (cutting the imaginative camera in a right and left\nhalf), then the up vector that you give must lie within the upper\nhalf of that plane, resp. the view will be arranged so that it\ndoes.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000180.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000180", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
