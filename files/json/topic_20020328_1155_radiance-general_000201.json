If you use the\nvariables \"tile_u\" and \"tile_v\" instead, then the\npicture will get repeated in both directions.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-March/000201.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000201", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
