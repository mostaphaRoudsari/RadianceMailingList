When I export a\nbunch of these to OBJ format, I end up with a 5MB file.  When I\nconvert that file to .rad format, it's 38 MB!\n\n\nSomehow, I don't think that's going to work.  It is not a complex\nform--the hardest parts to model are the bends in the bar--but I would\nprefer not to write code to do so.  Anyone have any thoughts?  Or\nwould it be better to start writing?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-April/000205.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000205", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz"}
