Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. (Apart from that, the text part of the email had been MIME encoded too, which, in the view of purists, increased size\nunnecessarily)\nMeanwhile this has been raised to 100KB. Still somewhat conservative, but with jpeg images as attachements it should be feasible. Chaps with a low bandwidth modem and no look-ahead selection for mail downloads from the provider generally appreciate single foreseable email volumes.\nIn case of larger images (e.g. comparisons of Radiance pics) I'd be happy to put them directly on the web server, when mailed directly to me.\nLet me know any suggestions\n\n\ncheers\nPeter, (aka radiance-online list admin)\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-April/000214.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000214", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
