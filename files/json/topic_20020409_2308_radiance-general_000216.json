Can you resend just the text portion of the message -- not \nas an attachment?  In general, it's not a good idea to send attachments \nto a mailing list.  If someone wants to look at your file and you can't \nput it on a website, you can mail it to people who request it \nspecifically.  That way, it doesn't get sent automatically to the entire \nlist.\n\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-April/000216.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000216", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
