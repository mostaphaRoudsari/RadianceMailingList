I appreciate it.  I'd like to follow up with \nsome of you separately, time permitting.  \n\n\nReplmarks look interesting, I will look at the manpage in \nmore detail.  I can see how that truly could be a disaster \nin terms of version tracking, etc, but it's worth a shot.  \n\n\nI must be a glutton for punishment, because now I'm off \non a new tangent -- thinking of installing Linux on the \nPowerBook.
