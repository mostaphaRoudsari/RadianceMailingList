Space and performance\nrequirements are minimal, and the whole operation should be\nover within less than an hour per ssh. A functioning C\ncomplier is mandatory (gcc is fine), a working installation\nof Python 1.5.2 would be helpful, but isn't critical.\nI could also live with a commercial service, as long as I\ncan afford the price...\n\n\nIf anyone knows of an installation where this would be possible,\nor has one available, please e-mail me directly, so we don't\npollute this list any further.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for any pointers!\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000257.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000257", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
