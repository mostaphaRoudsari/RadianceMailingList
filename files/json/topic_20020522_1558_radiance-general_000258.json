I have a couple of test scenes I'm \nexperimenting with, and I'd now like to use rtrace et. al. \nto automate the extraction of illuminance levels to a file.  \n\n\n>From a Radiance digest:\n> As an example of producing illuminance values at regularly\n> spaced points on a 4x5 workplane, you might use the\n> following command:\n> \n>  % cnt 3 4 | rcalc -e\n>  '$1=$1+.5;$2=$2+.5;$3=1;$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' \\\n>   | rtrace -h -I [options] octree \\\n>   | rcalc -e '$1=179*(.3*$1+.59*$2+.11*$3)' > outfile\n\n\nCould you decipher this a little bit?  I don't see where you \nfeed it the 4x5 grid.  Also, looking at the manpage, it \nlooks like rtrace with the -I switch takes the input origin & \ndirection and interprets it as \"measurement point and \norientation\".\n\n\nI tried something like:\nrtrace -h -I 60 60 30 0 0 1 scene.oct \n\n\nI thought this would give me the irradiance at a point 60\" \nover(+x), 60\" up (+y), and 30\" off the floor (+z), whth the \n\"light meter\" facing up along the z axis.  But this gave me \nan error at the command line.  WHat is the proper syntax? \n I was hoping to fill a text file with measurement points \nand feed it to rtrace, and use something like your script \nabove to produce a table of measurement points and \ncorresponding illuminance values...\n\n\n\n\n Rob Guglielmetti <rpg777@earthlink.net>\n    http://home.earthlink.net/~rpg777\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000258.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000258", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
