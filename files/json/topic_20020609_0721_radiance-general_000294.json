The main thing is to \nmaintain good communication between developers and users of the \nsoftware, as I believe that keeping this open line was Radiance's key to \nsuccess in the first place.  A consortium web site with a proper set of \nFAQs and links to distributions and sublists for Desktop and UNIX users \nwould be great.  Contribution from consortium members could take the \nform of time and a good host server on a fast connection.  We'd probably \nwant a mirror site in the U.S. and Europe, and could probably continue \nto use the LBNL and ISE sites for this for the time being.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000294.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000294", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
