The weather station data are 20.5 W/m^2 diffuse horizontal and 200.5 W/m^2 for the \"beam\" component (towards the sun). Both irradiance data are in the visible range only. \n\n\nI expect 46.8 W/m^2 from the sun, measured on the horizontal plane, since the sine of the sun altitude angle multiplied by 200.5 gives 46.8\n\n\nWhat I get is 21 W/m^2. Does the gendaylit -W option require W/m^2 measured over the full spectrum? The gendaylit man page says it uses data based on the visible spectrum. \n\n\nI asked someone who used gendaylit previously and this is what he wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\"Martin,\n\n\n> try this with gendaylit:\n> \n> gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5\n\n\nI did.  Here's what I got -\n\n\ngendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5\n# gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5\nsky clearness or sky brightness out of range 1.029410    0.620136\n\n\nHmmm...  It appears we are using different versions.\nAre you using, as I am, UNIX or some PC version?\n\n\nThe header for my gendaylit.c is:\n\n\n/*        Copyright (c) 1994    *Fraunhofer Institut for Solar Energy Systems\n *                              Oltmannstr 5, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany\n *                              *Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de\nl'Energie\n *                              Centre de Valbonne, 500 route des Lucioles,\n06565 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France\n *                              *BOUYGUES\n *                              1 Avenue Eugene Freyssinet,\nSaint-Quentin-Yvelines, France\n*/\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the cal file:\n\n\n{ SCCSid \"@(#)perezlum.cal 2.5 15/02/94 ISE\" }\n\n\nI haven't used gendaylit for ages, I tend to stick with the sky\nblends described in the thesis chapter.
