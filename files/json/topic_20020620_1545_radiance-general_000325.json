We are \ninterested in comparing the appearance based on available performance \ndata of a variety of fritted glazing systems on the exterior of a \nbuilding system under daylight conditions. The fundamental challenge it \nseems to me is how to use the data that is readily available (from \nsoftware such as LBL's Optics5 as well as from manufacturers themselves) \nto make an appropriate material in Radiance and whether the readily \navailable data is in fact sufficient to describe the material behavior.\n\n\nAll the frit systems that we are looking at use the same basic \ninsulating glass with the following makeup:\n\n\n    * (exterior) 6mm clear glass with low-e coating on the second surface\n    * (airspace) 13.2mm\n    * (interior) 6mm clear glass\n\n\nA Radiance material description (brtdfunc) for this makeup can be \ngenerated by the LBL Optics5 program. Note that Optics5 outputs material \ndescriptions for the glass primitive as well as interior and exterior \ndescriptions based on the BRTDfunc. In this case I believe that the \n\"front\" version of the BRTDfunc represents the exterior and is the \nappropriate description to use for this study.\n\n\nvoid  glass       ve1-2m_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.712     0.791     0.719\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    ve1-2m_front\n10\n      0.111     0.114     0.116\n      0.653     0.726     0.659\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    ve1-2m_back\n10\n      0.112     0.125     0.122\n      0.653     0.726     0.659\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nThe information that we do know is as follows:\n\n\n    * measured photopic transmittance, and exterior and interior\n      reflectance of base insulating glass system (70%, 11% and 12%)\n    * radiance material description of  base insulating glass system\n    * measured photopic transmittance, and exterior and interior\n      reflectance of selected composite frit glass systems (ie the\n      composition of the frit silkscreen [white] onto the 2nd or 3rd\n      surface of  the base insulating glass system, for example 45%,\n      22%, and 24% based on a 50% frit on the 2nd surface) , note that\n      as far as I can tell it is not possible to build up such as system\n      in a program like Optics5 (unless additional baseline measured\n      data can be obtained from the manufacturer)\n\n\nIs it sufficient to figure out the percentage variations for the \ntransmittance and reflectance values between the original glass and the \ncomposite frit glass and then modify the brtdfunc material description \naccordingly? I know that this will not completely account for the change \nin color of the glass due to the white silkscreen on the 2nd or 3rd \nsurface. But is this a reasonable approximation to start with.\n\n\nAnother thing to consider is the 'modeling' of the actual frit pattern \non the glass. My thinking is that this is only important for cases where \nthe glass is very close to the viewer. Typically a lot of the frit \npatterns (such as dot and lines) tend to disappear the the farther away \nfrom the building you are. Now in the cases where the view is close to \nthe glass, what is a good way to build a composite material in Radiance \n(a mixfunc is probably a good starting point)? We know the data for the \nbase insulating glass but what is a good way to figure out the \nreflectance of the frit silkscreen as seen through the glass?\n\n\nI will look forward to your suggestions and comments.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000325.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000325", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
