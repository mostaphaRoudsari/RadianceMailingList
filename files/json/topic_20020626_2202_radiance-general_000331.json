Now I would like to be able to take data and \nplace the output onto a *.pic of the same area in the grid they were \ntaken.  If the readings were taken on 4' centers, I would like to feed \nthe data back into Radiance to produce a picture containing those values \nat their actual locations in a grid.\n\n\nSome ideas:\n\n\n1.    Pipe the output from lam contining x/y/val into psign and pcompos \nto produce the composited image.  With this idea, the grid dimensions \nwould have to be a known pixel spacing.  I'm also not sure if pcompos \nwill allow for the translating of the input.\n2.     Pipe the output into a new rad file as brightext and use the x/y \nto locate in the scene, the value to act as input into the text field, \nand excluding the mat from the calculation.\n\n\nAny ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Of course if anyone \nhas already done this...\n\n\nOne last note, short of rewriting my shell script in perl, is there a \nway to round the rcalc output to two decimal points?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nRobert Westling\nsteinerwestling\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000331.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000331", "created_by": "Robert_Westling"}
