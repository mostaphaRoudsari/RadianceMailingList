We cannot take any \nregistrations after August 31st, and if possible, we would like to \nreceive registrations as early as possible, as we have made commitments \nwith the local hotels that will cost us money to get out of if we find \nit necessary to cancel the workshop due to lack of attendance.  So far, \nwe have received only 4 confirmed registrations, though we have at least \n18 speakers and about as many again who have said they will come.\n\n\nThe tentative agenda and registration forms are available at the \nfollowing website:\n\n\n\thttp://www.eif.ch/~compag/rw/\n\n\nIf you are a speaker, we also need a final abstract and any materials \nyou would like to include on the CD-ROM by August 31 as well.  Please \nregister before that if you can.\n\n\nThanks!\n-Greg & Raphael\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000342.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000342", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
