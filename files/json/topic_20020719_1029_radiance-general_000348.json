BUT i m not sure..\n\n\nif anybody does know anything about .....\n\n\nor he has some trick to analyze glare with radiance....\n\n\ni need your help,\n\n\ntanks\n\n\npillo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000348.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000348", "created_by": "Annalisa_Simonella"}
