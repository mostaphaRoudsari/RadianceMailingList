This seams to be quite an interesting development but AFAIK only a very\nold version of rpict has been modified to make use of mpi. Are there any new\nversions of this, or is there anybody working on a \"parallel-radiance\"? (I ask\nthis after having rendered some pictures on a sun 880, an 4xultrasparc - what\nstill took days... ;-).\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nGMX - Die Kommunikationsplattform im Internet.\nhttp://www.gmx.net\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000365.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000365", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
