(or if this has been discussed \nin a previous digest)\n\n\nI suppose one way to do it would be to have a metal \nplane and array a series of antimatter spheres which \nwould subtract holes in the metal.  Seems like this \nwould work, but is perhaps not the most efficient way \nto do this.\n\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-July/000367.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000367", "created_by": "dela"}
