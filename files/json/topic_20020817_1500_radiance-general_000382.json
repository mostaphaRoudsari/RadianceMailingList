But I found \nthat Simon Crone has implemented a  texpict modifier for an old version of \nradiance. Is there anybody out there  working with this and current radiance \nreleases? And why has this not been added  to the official radiance code \nbranch?\n\n\nI need some kind of bump-mapping, as I have a large model of a church with  \nsome more detailed elements. There are reliefs on parts of the building which \nexist in  their geometry, but I don't want to model the relief ;-) BTW, this \nwould make the model too large, too.\n\n\nSo I will have to use colorpict for now... but I don't really like this... We \nhave all those nice bumpmap features in our modeling software, and now I have \nto tell the others that I work with mapped images... ;-)\n\n\nBTW, any hints regarding black/white-images as colorpict-maps?\n\n\nThank you, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000382.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000382", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
