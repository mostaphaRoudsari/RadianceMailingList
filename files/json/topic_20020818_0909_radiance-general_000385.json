This is a new program that comes with 3.4 and uses the same mouse \ninterface as the holodeck program rholo but just draws the scene \ncosine-shaded using OpenGL primitives.  Doesn't work too well for large \nmodels, but if the model's reasonably small, OpenGL handles it OK.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000385.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000385", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
