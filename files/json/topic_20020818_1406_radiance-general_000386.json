As a path of least resistance, I could offer to\nstart a section for Radiance related links in the Lighting Wiki.\nSince everybody can edit any page in the Wiki, this might give\nus the most complete collection with the least effort. if you\nknow about a link, just add it yourself: http://lightingwiki.com/\n\n\nAn alternative location would be radiance-online.org, but for\nthe moment it would involve a significantly larger administrative\noverhead to do it there (unless Peter wants to install a wiki too).\nIn any case, I'm crossposting this to the radiance-general list\nthere, as the topic is not exclusively related to DR.\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000386.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000386", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
