The material worked great, but I had to do a \nlot of tedious manual labor getting it to work right \non a 3D arch due to the changes in surface normal of \neach section of the arch.\n\n\nSo, I've been wondering if there is a better way to \nhandle adding orientation specific materials to mesh \ngeometry.  (practically all the \"advanced\" materials \nin radiance seem to be orientation specific)  So, is \nthere a tool that will facilitate this process?  \nSeems like it would need to read a rad file, \ncalculate the surface normals for the polygons, and \nthen write out a corresponding material file & \npossibly new rad file to go with the material file.  \nMy guess is that's how it would need to work.\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nThanks!
