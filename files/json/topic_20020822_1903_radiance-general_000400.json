It is not merely to speed up the \nfinal rendering calculation -- the time spent in the overture \ncalculation is greater than the time saved in the final one.  The real \nreason rad does this is to minimize interpolation artifacts as explained \nat the top of page 551 in the \"Rendering with Radiance\" chapter 12 on \nthe indirect calculation.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-August/000400.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000400", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
