I am completely new to UNIX, so my question may \nbe simplistic.  Please bare with me.  If this question is \ninappropriate, then please let me know, and I will not fill your \ninboxes.\n\n\nI read Greg Ward's response to Galen Burrell, and tried following the \ndirection.\n\n\nWhen I try running the ./makeall install script, I always come up with \nerrors.\nWhen I try copying the files manually, I also run into problems\n\n\nI'm trying to install into /usr/local/radiance\n\n\nWith the cp -rp lib /usr/local/radiance/lib/ray command, I get a \nmessage saying that the file is identical.\nWith the cp -p src/*.cal /usr/local/radiance/lib/ray command, I get a \nmessage saying that there was no match.\n\n\nI'm sure it's my ignorance that's causing the problem.\n\n\nAgain, I'm a complete newbie, so I really don't know what I'm doing, \nbut am willing to learn and experiment.\n\n\nCan you point me to a resource that will help me understand the install \nprocess?  I understand that my question is really remedial, but I know \nI'll understand better the installation process under UNIX through this \ntask of having to install Radiance.\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your time and patience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn An\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-September/000412.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000412", "created_by": "John_An"}
