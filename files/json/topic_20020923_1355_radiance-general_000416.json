I am\nscanning color negatives with Linocolor, which does the colour inversion for me.\n\n\nSome of my scans give good results by simply applying the\nmacbethcal-correction to them. Others are too bad to produce a good .cal-file. E.g. some have\nevidently too much blue. I found that doing a \"auto correction\" in photoshop\nbefore using macbethcal gives better results. But is this ok (I do the color\ncorrection on the area of the picture containing the colour checker as well as\non the material / texture I want to get, of course)? Or is it \"forbidden\" to\ndo anything besides the pcomb-correction?\n\n\nThank you, CU, Lars.\n\n\n\n\nWerden Sie mit uns zum \"OnlineStar 2002\"!
