Unfortunately, I\ndon't really know how to do this.  Which rmake file do I put this command\nin?  Where do I need to put it?\n\n\nI'm new to UNIX so I have been using the precompiled binaries that I\ndownloaded from the website.  I have now downloaded the source code but I\ndon't want to ruin my existing files by compiling them incorrectly.  As I\nunderstand it, I should compile a new version of rpict_random by:\n\n\n(1) adding the -Dtracktime=0 command to the Rmakefile script that is in\nray/src/rt [although I don't know where to put it]\n(2) and then running that Rmakefile script.\n\n\nI'm guessing that this will produce new executables for the ray-tracing\nprograms, which I can then place in my ray/radbin_lnx directory.  Is this\ncorrect?\n\n\nSorry for the rather basic level of these questions.  Radiance is\nbrilliant, I use it for generating realistic stimuli for my psychology\nexperiments!\n\n\nBest wishes,\nRoland\n\n\n\n\nr o l a n d   f l e m i n g\nm i t   p e r c e p t u a l   s c i e n c e   g r o u p\nr o o m   n e 2 0   4 5 1 e\nt e l ::  6 1 7   2 5 8   9 6 7 5\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-September/000417.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000417", "created_by": "Roland_William_Fleming"}
