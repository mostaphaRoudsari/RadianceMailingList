Could you\nplease give me some suggestion on how to transform from pixel value to\nthe value that PPM file needs?\n\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\n\nQing Xu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000421.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000421", "created_by": "Qing_Xu"}
