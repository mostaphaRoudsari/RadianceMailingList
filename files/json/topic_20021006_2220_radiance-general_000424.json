The story should \nshow up on the main page (www.cgarchitect.com) in an hour or so, but \nthe direct link will take you there now:\n\n\nhttp://www.cgarchitect.com/news/Reviews/Review013_1.asp\n\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to say that I had a great time there, \nand learned a lot.  It was great to meet some folks I have known \nelectronically for many years!  I wanted to send the editor a copy of \nthe picture Greg took of all of us, but my email for the last 24 hours \nhas been fairly well screwed up.  I seem to be able to send, but cannot \nreceive.  This, as you may expect, is causing me a great deal of \nfrustration.  Raphael, keep trying.  I hope to have my email back up by \ntomorrow, or I look for another host!!\n\n\nAs an aside, I am deeply depressed over the early exit of the New York \nYankees from baseball's post season.  But I am enjoying watching the \nAtlanta Braves get spanked by the Giants this evening.  (I'm fully \naware that the majority of the workshop attendees could not care less \nabout the whims of a band of jocks swinging a wooden stick at a hurled \nball, but I feel the need to vent.)\n\n\nI hope you all had a good return trip from the workshop.  When's the \nnext one? ;-)\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000424.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000424", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
