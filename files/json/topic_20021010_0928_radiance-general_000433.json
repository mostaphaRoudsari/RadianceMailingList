You may use the -fac option of rtrace to get a \nRadiance RGBE image on the output, which you may then pass to any of \nthe Radiance picture filters and converters provided (e.g., pfilt, \npcomb, ra_ppm, etc.).  You have not given me enough specifics about \nyour project for me to determine whether or not rpict could generate \nthe views directly, but in most cases, it can.  Rpict has options for \nfore and aft clipping planes, parallel and fisheye views, and view \ncamera features.  Anyway, if you need to use rtrace, we have given you \nat least three methods for doing so.\n\n\nOne other thing you might investigate is the code in \nray/src/common/process.c, which provides routines for communicating \nwith a separate rtrace process from a controlling program.  For an \nexample of how you might do this, you can look at the code in \nray/src/px/pinterp.c.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000433.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000433", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
