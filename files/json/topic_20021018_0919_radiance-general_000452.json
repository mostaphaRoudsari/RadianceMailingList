If it is defined in a separate \nmaterial file included with the scene containing the instance, the \ntransformation will not be applied the same way.\n\n\nYou really should follow Schorsch's advice also about when to use the \ninstance primitive.  There really needs to be a help file or something \non instances, and I seem to remember writing something like this \nsomewhere, but now I can't even find it...  The rule of thumb I use is \nthat there have to be at least 200 geometric primitives in an object \nbefore it's worth making an instance.  Otherwise, the overhead of \ntracing rays through instanced octrees negates the memory savings.\n\n\nReplmarks replaces the markers with transformed scene files (or \ninstances), and as long as you put the related colorpict's in the \ntransformed scene files (or instances), and not in the replmarks input, \nyou should be OK.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000452.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000452", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
