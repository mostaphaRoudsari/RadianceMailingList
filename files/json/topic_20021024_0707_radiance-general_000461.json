Illum is only\nignored/replaced for direct view rays, but participates normally\nin both the direct and indirect calculation for all other rays.\n\n\nIf I understand the original question correctly, then illum is\nthe solution.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch.com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000461.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000461", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
