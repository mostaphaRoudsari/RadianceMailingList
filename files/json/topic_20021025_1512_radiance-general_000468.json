This text file would be used as \na data file for rtrace, to keep this somewhat on topic.\n\n\nWondering if anyone had any code snippets or references for such an \nadventure?  Sorry for the off-topic question.  Email me privately if you \nwant to.\n\n\n\n\nRPG\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000468.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000468", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
