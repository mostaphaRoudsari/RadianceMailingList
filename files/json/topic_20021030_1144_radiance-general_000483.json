There is currently no way of\nrepresenting such materials in Radiance.  However, as I'm sure many of you\nare aware, Henrik Wann Jensen has developed a technique, called\nphoton-mapping, which makes it possible to represent sub-surface scatter\n(and other effects such as caustics and \"bleed\") efficiently.  For those of\nyou who haven't seen the stunning results, I recommend a quick look at\nhttp://www.cgarchitect.com/upclose/article1_HWJ.asp.\n\n\nTranslucency is a really important property of many real-world materials\nand adds considerable realism to scenes.  Here are my questions: Is there\nany way that we can implement photon-mapping within Radiance?  Is there any\nalternative method that can be implemented in Radiance which permits\nparametric control over sub-surface scatter, and produces physically\nrealistic results?  Is anyone interested in collaborating in implementing\nthese techniques?  Jensen has a book on the topic\n(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568811470/cgarchitect-20/002-4144829-47\n30441) and has given a number of tutorials at SIGGRAPH on the technique.\nBut I'm not a graphics specialist, so I can't implement this on my own.\nAny ideas?\n\n\nCheers,\nRoland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-October/000483.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000483", "created_by": "Roland_Fleming"}
