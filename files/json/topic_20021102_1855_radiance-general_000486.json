While I finally \nknow how to do the transformations of my image maps, I have some problems \nwith the different types of modifiers radiance offers.\n\n\nFirst, I have a limited set of photographs that are to become imagemaps. I \nhave some of rather good quality in black/whithe, showing the complete \nobjetcs' surfaces. I would like to map these onto the objects in my scene.\n\n\nThan, I have some pictures which give me color values (they are \ncolor-corrected), but which don't show the complete surfaces. So I cannot use \nthem as patterns.\n\n\nSo which modifier should I use? If I use colorpict, I get grey surfaces (as \nthe gray colorpict is mapped ON the material?). I would like to use \nbrightdata, but how do I convert my grayscale image into the data-format I \nwould need? Is this possibile at least?\n\n\nOne last possibility might be to use the color information from the color \ncorrected pictures and apply this color to the greyscale-images. Is this \npossible with the radiance tools (e.g. pcomb)?\n\n\nThank you, have a nice weekend, CU,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-November/000486.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000486", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
