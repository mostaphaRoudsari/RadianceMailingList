If that material has color, then \nyou will get a brightness modification to the color specified in the \nmaterial primitive.  I don't know of any reliable procedures for taking \ncolor information in a subset of an image and extrapolating it into the \nsurrounding image.  If your color image only covers a fraction of your \nsurface, you are not going to be able to get color for the rest of it \nby combining this somehow with a complete grayscale image.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-November/000487.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000487", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
