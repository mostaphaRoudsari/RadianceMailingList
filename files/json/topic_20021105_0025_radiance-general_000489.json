With firewalls and a central mail\nmanagement at large sites, that is not always the normalized receiving\none, as you found. To circumvent this, subscribe twice and disable\nreceiving mails on the second one. Two or three people on the list use\nit that way.\nThe easiests way to configure options for an account is by the web\ninterface,  it's the last form entry at\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nenter your second (dummy) email address, than select \"Disable mail\ndelivery\", enter password and select \"Submit my changes\"\n\n\nSo mailman accepts your multiple sending addresses, but you get postings\nfrom the list only once.\n\n\nSorry for any inconvenience this may cause, the good side is that we've\nkept the list spam resistant so far.\n\n\nregards\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-November/000489.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000489", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
