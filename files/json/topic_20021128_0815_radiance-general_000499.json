I have done so in the past for ranimate, but it has been a while.\non a per-user basis: on local machine, generate public/privat key pair\n(ssh-keygen -t rsa, optionally with empty passphrase), add public key\n(~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to authorized key file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys) on\nremote machine. Then ssh acts as direct (and enhanced) replacement for\nrsh. I wouldn't recommend solely host-based authorisation since it\nsabotages core ideas of public key authorisation (unless it is used\nadditionally to per-user auth).\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-November/000499.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000499", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
