Sources I have modeled\nusing Radiance behave in this way until they occupy a solid angle relative\nto the observer of less than 4.9e-06 steradian or so (for example, a\ntwo-inch radius disk source at 134 feet).  Beyond this distance, however,\nthe modeled luminance of the source decreases in inverse proportion to the\nsquare of the separation distance.  This behavior is only exhibited by light\nsources.  In contrast, models of small reflective surfaces illuminated by a\nfixed local source exhibit constant luminance as the surface viewing\ndistance is increased, finally disappearing from view altogether when they\noccupy a solid viewing angle of approximately 2.2e-06 steradian.  Can anyone\nexplain the light sources'departure from ideal constancy of luminance with\ndistance?\n\n\nI'll gladly provide additional information about my modeling attempts to\nanyone interested.\n\n\nCharles K.
