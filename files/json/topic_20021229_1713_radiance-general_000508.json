Since I use a laptop (PowerBook/OSX) to do my Radiance \nexperiments, I have always been loath to start any lengthy calculations \non it, since I inevitably need to put the thing to \"sleep\" for \ntransport to/from work, etc.  The long calcs always run on a PC I have \nat the office.  But it would be nice to be able to do test scenes on my \nlaptop, and not have to worry about interrupting the process when I put \nthe thing to sleep.  So the question is, CAN I?  That is to say, what \nhappens if I start an rpict or rad process, then put the laptop to \nsleep?  If I wake it up later will it pick up where it left off, or \nwill there be errors in the calculation from that point on?\n\n\nAn inquiring mind wants to know.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-December/000508.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000508", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
