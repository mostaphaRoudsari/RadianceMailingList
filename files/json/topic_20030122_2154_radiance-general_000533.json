I have the book \"Rendering with Radiance\" but it \nseems to be void of any in-depth information concerning writing procedurals \nwith the CAL files. I have tried to go through the files to see how they are \nwritten but unfortunately, I can't understand how many of the equations were \nderived. The reason why I would like to know is so that I can write my own \nprocedurals and so that I can better optimize the parameters for the \nstandard cal files.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  \nhttp://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-January/000533.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000533", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
