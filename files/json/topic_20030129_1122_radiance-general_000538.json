If\nthere are more such messages, more than one square is not rendered.\nPresumably, the processor responsible was not able to contribute its  share of\nthe rendering because of a conflict with another process sharing the same\nprocessor. To avoid this problem I usually run the \"top\" command to see how\nmany processors are currently running unix processes and then I choose a\nnumber of processors for my rpiece script that will be less than the number of\nunused processors. I wonder if someone has a more detailed explanation of the\nerror and if there are ways to avoid the error when the processors share\nprocesses other than Radiance.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-January/000538.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000538", "created_by": "Thomas_Seebohm"}
