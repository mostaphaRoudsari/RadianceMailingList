One of the subjects we \ndiscussed was the next Unix Radiance release, which we'd like to \nschedule for the beginning of March.  I suggested that we make this \nrelease coincide with OpenSource code availability via CVS.  I have a \nfew questions related to this:\n\n\n1) Is this release date doable?\n2) Has Peter A-B got his site ready, or will it be ready by the end of \nthe month to hold the source tree?\n3) What changes do I need to make on my end for this to work?  (E.g., \neliminate symbolic links, change build procedure, etc.?)\n4) Are we going to have mirror sites at radsite.lbl.gov and \nradiance-online.org?  Mirroring what?\n\n\nI would prefer to make as few source tree changes as possible prior to \nthe release, to facilitate the reincorporation of code modifications \nother developers might wish to contribute to the new release.  It also \nseems that a single CVS site is the way to go, with mirrors set up for \nthe official release and binary tarballs.\n\n\nThoughts on these issues?\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-February/000049.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000049", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
