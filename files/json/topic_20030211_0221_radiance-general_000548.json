I \nhave a question concerning the aux.h header file. As some of you already \nknow, the header file aux.h is reserved exclusively for Windows. I was able \nto get the file onto my hard drive by renaming it aux2.h. What I am curious \nis to know which files (*.c) are associated with this header file. I did a \ntext search for \"aux.h\" to see if it was listed as an <include> directive in \nany files but nothing turned up. I know this file is used somewhere and \nsomehow but I don't know where. Please help.\n\n\nMarcus Jacobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
