I tried the \n\"radiance-benchmerk2\" by Paul Bourke, and got results for my Ultrasparc III \nCPUs equal to P4s at the same frequencies. I hope that Sun's native compilers \nwould help here a lot.\n\n\nIs it worth tryiing to use Sun's optimized math libraries with radiance?\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-February/000561.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000561", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
