Are you sure \neverything is working properly?  Did you check your generated .cal file \nto make sure it has the right values in the right places?  You should \nsee something like this:\n\n\nPx(x):select(x,79,72.3046,71.1568,71.1568,71.1568);\nPy(x):select(x,24,23.2029,23.1347,23.1347,23.1347);\nPz(x):select(x,5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5);\nDx(x):select(x,-0.970143,-0.970142,-0.990371,-0.977998,-0.999862);\nDy(x):select(x,-0.194029,-0.194029,-0.0484078,0.0306398,-0.0091765,);\nDz(x):select(x,-0.145521,-0.145521,-0.129696,-0.206351,0.0138471);\nT(x):select(x,0,2.74756,1.09528,0.658805,0.765425);\n\n\nEach select call has the same number of arguments, corresponding to the \nnumber of keyframes you entered, and the Nth argument of each should \ncorrespond to your Nth keyframe value for that variable.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000565.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000565", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
