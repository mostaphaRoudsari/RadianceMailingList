If you use them as instances and exclude them from \nambient calculation, you can use lots of these detailed geometries. Take a \nlook at the rpict options for this, don't even think about doing ambient \ncalculation of detailed trees' geometries! The placement of tree and plant \ninstances can be done in a very comfortable way if you use a markers file, \nyou simply make a cad-triangle and copy this to the desired locations, using \none layer for every plant/tree type, rotate some of them randomly and take a \nlook at replmarks. BTW, if you have access to rayfront, this tool handles \nmarker files in a frontend.\n\n\nHowever, the representation of grass might be a bit difficult.... they HAVE \n3d-geometry ;-) But maybe one should use a cal file to create the grass \ngeometry, or does it make sense to get brd-data for grass???\n\n\nGood luck, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000564.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000564", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
