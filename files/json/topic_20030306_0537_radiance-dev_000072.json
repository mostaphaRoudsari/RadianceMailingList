If I understand your\nproblem correctly, then you seem to have troubles in certain cases\nto identify where an offending primitive actually came from.\nThat's exactly the purpose of the object ID.\n\n\nA CAD translator should include as mush useful information in\nthat ID as possible, as well as making it as unique as possible.\nI haven't seen all of your argumentation, but I don't think\nthat it's a good idea to \"reverse engineer\" this information\nlater within Radiance, especially if that sould involve changing\nthe behaviour of modifiers and aliases even in subtle ways.\n\n\nThe problems you have with rshow rather seem to be related to\nthe fact that you are using the octree when *modifiyng* the\nscene. I can see some of the reasons for that, but I don't\nthink that's what the octree was designed for, so it may or\nmay not be a good idea in the long run. Especially frozen\noctrees don't look like something that should be \"edited\".\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000072.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000072", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
