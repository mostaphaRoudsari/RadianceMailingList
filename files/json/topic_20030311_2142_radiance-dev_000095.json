Have a try- Any comments appreciated.\n\n\nCVS allows for automatic emails for 'commits' on CVS, aka when Greg\nuploads new versions. Anyone who would like to receive these emails,\nplease write to me directly (techsup@radiance-online.org). Alternatively\nthese automagical emails could be sent to this list- however there may be\none for each file (one for each commit in CVS-speak).\n\n\nThe main pages are update yet, although new versions are ready for upload,\nonce the CVS thing works and R3.5 is released.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000095.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000095", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
