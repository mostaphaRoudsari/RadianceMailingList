I know enough about Unix to be dangerous\nIve DL'd the binaries and distribution.\nI've read posts about installing, and I'm still confused.\nAccording to the readme, it says type\nmakeall install    into the Terminal\n\n\nThat did'nt work, so I typed \n[sudo ./makeall install -- (I know sudo is superuser do - but not sure why\nthe ./ for makeall)\n\n\nIt got me further - asking for places to install the binaries and the lib\nWhere do you want the executables [/usr/local/bin]?  I hit return  so far so\ngood\nWhere do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]?  I hit return\nmkdir: /usr/local/lib/ray: No such file or directory\n\n\nSo I mkdir  called lib inside the local directory - thinking it will find\nlib and make a ray directory\nWhere do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]? /usr/lib\nshould I have made a ray dir as well?\n\n\nInstall library files now [n]? y\nCopying library files to /usr/lib...
