I've uploaded the official 3.5 version of \nRadiance to the LBNL website, accessible via the main Download link \nfrom:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance\n\n\nThe prominent differences between this release and 3.4 are the addition \nof ANSI-C prototypes to the core libraries, and the creation of a new \nanimation program (ranimove) and a new mesh primitive (mesh).  I have \nalso updated the HTML reference manual to match the troff version, and \nfixed the nasty avlmemi bug, at long last.  For full details of what \nhas been changed and added since 3.4, see the release notes:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/ReleaseNotes.html\n\n\nNote that we have a new, OpenSource license agreement in place, also \naccessible from the Download page.  I have posted the compiled 3.5 \nbinaries for Mac OS X, but am waiting on others to contribute binaries \nfor Linux, SGI, and Sun machines.  (Volunteers?)  I understand that it \ncompiles without difficulty under Linux, but I don't have access to a \nLinux machine myself at the moment.\n\n\nIf you are interested in source code developments and CVS availability, \nsubscribe to the radiance-dev mailing list at:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000584.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000584", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
