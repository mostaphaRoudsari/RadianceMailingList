{"topic": "Photosphere 1.0 for Macintosh", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "March 24, 2003 at 08:49AM", "body": "If any of you Radiance users out there are running Mac OS X, I welcome \nyou to download and test drive the application I've been working on in \nmy spare time for the past couple of years, called Photosphere.  I just \nput together the first official release (1.0), and it's hanging off the \nRadiance website at:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/pickup/photosphere.tar.gz\n\n\nFor those of you who attended last year's workshop, I gave a little \ntalk on this program, which Peter has made available at radiance-online:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Ward/HDRbrowser\n\n\n(I renamed it from \"Photophile\" to \"Photosphere\" based on some \nderogatory feedback.)\n\n\nIn addition to providing a means to catalog and browse regular and high \ndynamic-range images (including JPEG, TIFF, Radiance, LogLuv TIFF, and \nILM's OpenEXR format), Photosphere can also build HDR images from \nhand-held, bracketed exposures.  (This is a first, as far as I know.)  \nEventually, I hope to port this to Linux and Windows, but I'll probably \nneed some help on this.  Ian Ashdown keeps saying he'll work on this, \nand I believe he will, but not until he gets a few more urgent projects \ntaken care of....\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.  I'd \nbe very happy to hear them.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000588.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000588", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
