However I would like to make a Linux and/or Mandrake binary and/or RPM package for Radiance, but being rather new to Linux in general, don't know where to start. If anyone could point me to a on-line informative resource that discusses such things, could you be so kind as to forward it to me? Or is this even out of the question for a relative newcomer such as myself?\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-March/000589.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000589", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew"}
