Here: \n\n\nexport RAYPATH=/opt/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH \nexport PATH=/opt/radiance/bin:$PATH \n\n\nI have the new path-entries before the others, to make sure to override\nolder \nreleases of radiance. The binaries are all build on SuSE-Linux 7.x with \n2.4.x-kernels, they SHOULD work on all recent Linux distributions - however,\nI \ncannot test that. The sparc and intel builds were done using gcc 2.95.3, the\n\n\nalpha-build is by compaq c 6.2. \n\n\nSo here are the links: \n\n\nAlpha / AXP, Linux 2.4:\n\n\nhttp://fachschaft.pool.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/static_html/webseiten/linuxarchitekt/Rad-Linux-Alpha-3.5.0.tar.bz2   \n\n\nSun Hypersparc (v8) and later, Linux 2.4:  \n\n\nhttp://fachschaft.pool.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/static_html/webseiten/linuxarchitekt/Rad-Linux-Hypersparc-3.5.0.tar.bz2   \n\n\nIntel x86, Linux 2.4:\n\n\nhttp://fachschaft.pool.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/static_html/webseiten/linuxarchitekt/Rad-Linux-x86-3.5.0.tar.bz2   \n\n\nI will do a gcc-3-based Solaris-build for ultrasparcs, too. However, as I\ndon't \nhave a license of Sun's native compiler, I cannot build an optimized binary.\nSo \nanybody out there who could do the build with Sun Forte C??? \n\n\nPlease tell me if the binaries are working on your systems. BTW, if you are \ngoing to use radiance on a regular base.. it's always better to build\nsoftware for \nyour specific configuration ;-) \n\n\nJeffrey: If you are going to build rpms, I think this would be great. I\npersonally \nthink that one should build rpms for specific distributions, and I don't\nhave any \nexperience in that, but on the long run, it would be great for new users if\ntehy \ncould simply pick a rpm or deb for their distribution without worrying about\n\n\nPATH-settings, compilers and dependencies. I will take a look at rpm, if you\nget \nany further with this, please tell me (I have SuSE and Debian systems here,\nas \nwell as Solaris, having its own package management). \n\n\nCU, Lars. \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
