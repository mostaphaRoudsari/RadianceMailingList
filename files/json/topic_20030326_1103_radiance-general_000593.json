I am trying to separate the direct and indirect\nspecular and indirect diffuse calculation in Radiance.\nActually, I am trying to duplicate the \"artificial\nseparation\" provided in Radiance book, plate 23.\n\n\nI got a little confused with the rendering parameters:\nLets say I have an image, which has all\ndirect + indirect specular + indirect diffuse\ncomputation, with parameters\n-av 0.5 0.5 0.5\n-ab 2\n-st 0.001\nINDIRECT=1\n\n\nWould it be sufficient to change \n-av 0 0 0\n-ab 0\n-st 1\nINDIRECT=0\nso that I can get an image with just the direct\ncomputations? Or do I have to change other parameters?\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, if change the ?st parameter back to\n0.001; would it be give direct + indirect specular\ncomponent?\n\n\nThanks.\nAda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
