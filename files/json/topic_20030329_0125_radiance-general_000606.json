In fact, I have done\nall \ngcc-compiles of Radiance 3.5 on 2.9.x-releases, and now I am using gcc3... \n\n\nAll the rest compiles quite fine. (And I really want to get this new code\nonto our \nultrasparc machines ;-) \n\n\nCU Lars. \n\n\n\n\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l\u00e4cheln!
