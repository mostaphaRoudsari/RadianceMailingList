Anyway, here\nwe go:\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I'm very uncomfortable with Radiance spreading\nseveral hundred files all across /usr/*. There are simply too\nmany of them for this to be a good idea. But looking at the FHS\nspecification, there's an obvious alternative:\n\n\n  http://www.pathname.com/fhs/2.2/fhs-3.12.html\n\n\n  3.12 /opt : Add-on application software packages\n  3.12.1 Purpose\n  /opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application\n  software packages.\n\n\n  A package to be installed in /opt must locate its static files\n  in a separate /opt/<package> directory tree, where <package> is\n  a name that describes the software package.\n\n\n  3.12.2 Requirements\n\n\n    \"/opt\"    \"Add-on application software packages\"\n    <package> Static package objects\n\n\n\n\nRadiance *is* an \"add-on application software package\", right?\n\n\nSo I would suggest to all the folks packaging Radiance for *nix\nbased systems to simply to this:\n\n\n  /opt/radiance3.5/bin/*\n\n\n  /opt/radiance3.5/share/lib/*.cal\n  /opt/radiance3.5/share/lib/*.pic\n  /opt/radiance3.5/share/lib/*.dat\n\n\n  /opt/radiance3.5/share/demo/*/*\n\n\n  /opt/radiance3.5/share/doc/ps/*.ps\n\n\n  /opt/radiance3.5/man/man#/*.#\n\n\nAnd eventually:\n\n\n  /opt/radiance3.5/lib/*.#.so\n  /opt/radiance3.5/lib/*.h\n\n\n\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\n\n - We don't need to worry about name space clashes with other\n   software (eg. rview with vim). The choice is simply made by\n   placing one bin directory in front of the other in your PATH.\n\n\n - You can install and use several different Radiance versions on\n   the same machine, by the same selection method.\n\n\n - Installation is easy with or without any sophisticated package\n   manager (installing in /usr/* is completely unmanageable\n   without one).\n\n\n - You can uninstall by removing a single directory (or through a\n   pagkage manager if you prefer).\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n - Currently, I think the default library paths etc. are\n   hardcoded into the executables, which means you need to decide\n   about their location at compile time.\n\n\nActually, this is not so much a disadvantage of installing in\n/opt, but simply a feature of Radiance that we might want to\nimprove on.\n\n\nIt would probably be a good idea for Radiance to automatically\nadd the standard directories to RAYPATH, if they are found\nrelative to the location of the executed binary. So if eg. rpict\nis run from /opt/radiance3.5/bin/rpict, then it would expect\n*.cal files to be found in /opt/radiance3.5/share/lib, and prefer\nto run eg. xform from its own directory. This would simplify the\nuse of parallel installations considerably.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-March/000112.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000112", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
