So, on Debian based system, it is   \n  necessary to install the package by issuing the following command:\n  # dpkg -i --force-all radiance_3.5.0-1_i386.deb\n  in order to overwrite the /usr/bin/rview executable (very bad, isn't it?).\n  On different systems it may not be a problem, for instance on my\n  linux Mandrake 9.0 box rview from the vim package is put inside /bin/,\n  so no overwrite occurs and apparently everything goes smoothly,\n  but the system will always execute the vim rview binary, unless\n  somebody erases or rename it, or changes the PATH variable.\n\n\nCould anybody give me some feedback about how to solve this problem\nin the best way? I think I'm going to write a message on the debian developer \nmailing list too.\n\n\nCould we ask to add Radiance to the main or contrib Debian distribution?\n\n\nThe packages are located here:\n\n\nhttp://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/packages/\n\n\nI hope to get your comments/suggestions/infos/flames soon, and I also\nhope to have done a useful job.\n\n\n\n\ning.
