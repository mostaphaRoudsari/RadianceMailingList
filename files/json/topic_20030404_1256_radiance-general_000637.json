On my Mac, the window is difficult to resize \nsometimes because the dock icons get in the way.\n\n\nSpeaking of rholo, I haven't been able to run rholo on my RHL8 box on \nOpenGL.  I get a \"cannot start display process\" error when -ogl is used. \n  Tried -glx too. Assuming OpenGL was not installed, I downloaded and \ninstalled Mesa 5.0.1, and the sample images appear fine, but still no \njoy in rholo-ville.  rholo runs fine with -x11, but I'd like to see it \nfly on OpenGL like it does on my Mac.  Anyone know what I might be doing \nwrong?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000637.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000637", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
