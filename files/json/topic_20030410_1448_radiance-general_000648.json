It's the \"quick & dirty\" \nrendering program, used mainly for checking geometry and setting up \nviews, opposed to rpict, which is used for high quality images.\n\n\n> If its not in radiance, is there an alternate command in hp-ux that \n> makes an image from an octtree?\n\n\nAFAIK, the only tools available to take an octree and create an image \nare the ones that come with Radiance (rview, rpict, rtrace, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000648.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000648", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
