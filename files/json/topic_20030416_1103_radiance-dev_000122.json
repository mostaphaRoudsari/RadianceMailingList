HTH.\n\n\n\n\nDxf2rad works fine with files generated by Archicad.\n\n\nI think some people have also had success with exporting\nto 3DS Max, and converting the result with Conrad, unless\nI'm confusing this with something else at the moment.\n\n\nIf Archicad can export Wavefront obj files, then you could\nuse those directly with Radiance 3.5.\n\n\nThere are also attempts around to export Radiance scene files\nimmediately from Archicad, but as far as I know, none of that\nis ready for public consumption at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\nPS: This discussion should really go to the general list,\nas it is not a development issue.\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-April/000122.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000122", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
