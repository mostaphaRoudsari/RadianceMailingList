I presume you are trying to get an accurate distribution of the light fixture.  When I have used Radiance to model light tubes such as tubular skylights, the ray-tracing method of Radiance breaks down after about 20 reflections--with only 7 surfaces!  This means that light will not emit from the tubular skylight at angles between 180 degrees from nadir (grazing the ceiling) to 160 degrees. If many of your mirror polygons can \"see\" each other, then you may have the same problem.  If you limit the number of reflections, then there is a certain amount of error introduced into the calculation for those rays that get \"trapped\". What is really needed is a forward ray-tracer.  Have you tried the product called \"Raydirect\" that Georg Mischler and friends is providing?  Georg, would it work for this application?  -Chas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000660.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000660", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich"}
