This will involve pasting an image\nonto a specific location in the .pic file i have created. \n\n\nIn order to do this i need to know the location of certain points. I\nknow where they are in my 3D scene, but cannot work out a 3D to 2D\ncoordinate transform. I know that with a traditional pinhole perspective\nprojection i can work out new 2D coordinates if i know the old\ncoordinates, the focal point and the focal length. But i cant find any\nway of determining what the focal length used by rpict is!\n\n\nIf anyone has, ideally, an equation for transforming 3D radiance\ncoordinates into 2D .pic coordinates based on an (x,y,z), view point and\nview direction i would be incredibly grateful if you could let me know.\nAnd if anyone could even help me determine the focal length i need that\nwould be a big help\n\n\nThanks a lot for your time\n\n\nJon Bright\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000667.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000667", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
