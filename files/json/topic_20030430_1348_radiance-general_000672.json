Thanks for all who helped.  I know have it installed, and have started playing around with it.  I have walked through the online tutorial, and have ordered Rendering with Radiance, and am anxious to get it in my hands.  In the meantime (it is currently out of stock), I need to get an analysis completed for a project I am working on, and would appreciate some help.\n\n\nHowever, the following problems have occured under Linux (I haven't had a chance to run this on the Mac).\nFirst, when I use rview to preview my scene, everything seems to pop up normally (I get an image).  However, when I use the rpict command, I always get the message\n\"warning - aiming failure for light source [a]\" where a stands for an illum object (the window in the scene).  As of now, I am only analyzing daylighting, so I have no other light sources in the scene.\n\n\nSecond, I'm sure this is covered in \"Rendering with Radiance,\" but is there a way to get orthogonal and orthographic projected views in Radiance?  Moreover, is there a way to make a surface invisible, yet be considered in the lighting calculation?  I would like to look into an interior space in an axonometric view, but look through the ceiling and 1 or 2 walls to see the light distribution throughout a single space.\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nJohn An\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-April/000672.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000672", "created_by": "John_An"}
