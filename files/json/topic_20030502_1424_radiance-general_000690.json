Please \nlet me know of any difficulties you have running these executables on your \nsystem.  I did not link them statically, so there might be dynamic library  \nissues.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000690.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000690", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
