We have gone this route for many years. If you want\nsmoothing on curved surfaces, you have to make sure that you ask for\nsurface normals to be exported in the obj export options dialogue. I\nrecommend that the formZ model be broken up into layers and that you\nexport these one at a time. This allows you to isolate problems if there\nare some. For example, in a recent case where I exported surface\nnormals, there were some lines in the obj files where the surface\nnormals had 0 for the x, y , z components. obj2rad did not like that. I\nalso seem to recall that holes in polygons, like windows, will cause\nRadiance to fill the opening on rendering. You have to split the\noffending polygons before exporting. This is not hard to do in formZ.\nAnother issue to note is that, if you are working in metric units in\nformZ, formZ will multiply sizes by multiples of 10 depending on what\nunits you are using (for meters the exported sizes are 100 times\nlarger). It is best to do a test translation and to look at the obj file\nto check by what factor the dimensions have been multiplied. You can\nthen compensate by applying a scale factor in the export options under\ntransformation. Also, under transformations, uncheck the default\nflipping and swapping of axes.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000695.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000695", "created_by": "Thomas_Seebohm"}
