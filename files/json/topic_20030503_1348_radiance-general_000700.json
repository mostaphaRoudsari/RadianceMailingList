Some grain in\nRadiance images is easily corrected with PFILT using down-sampling and a\nradial blur filter, but the artifacts encountered were too severe for this\nto be effective.\n\n\nPlease visit my Internet Site :\n\n\nwww.daiservices.btinternet.co.uk/Radiance/Radiance_v3_5_UNIX/Render_Tests/Ra\ndiance_render_grain_error_01.htm\n\n\nto assess images of the problem.\n\n\nKind regards\n\n\nDigital Architectural Illustration Services\ndaiservices@btinternet.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000700.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000700", "created_by": "Digital_Architectural_Illustration_Services"}
