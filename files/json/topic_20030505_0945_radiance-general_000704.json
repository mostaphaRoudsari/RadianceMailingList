The price for this \nis the stupid pattern. Augustinus Topor at FhG-ISE looked into this last \nyear too but we found no better idea yet.\n-DMC avoids the pattern but the increase in necessary picture size \nbefore downsampling is substantial (easily a factor of 4). Otherwise the \nrandom clusters show up in the final image.\nA somewhat dis-satisfying situation at present.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, www.pab-opto.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000704.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000704", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
