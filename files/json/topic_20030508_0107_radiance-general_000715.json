You can convert\nfrom Wavefront .OBJ files using the new \"obj2mesh\" program.  See\nthe following link for details:\n\n\n  http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/obj2mesh.1.html\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is a bug in the official 3.5 release in\nthe index computation for (u,v) coordinates, and you will need\nto download and compile the most recent version of the source \ncode from radiance-online to get this to work:\n\n\n  http://www.radiance-online.org/software/\n\n\nIt does not compile on Windows currently, so if you require\na working Windows version, you'll have some time to wait...\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nQuoting Digital Architectural Illustration Services \n<Daiservices@btinternet.com>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000715.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000715", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
