Furthermore, after the latest =\ndiff_HEAD_rad3R5.patch patch file has modified R3.5, the OBJ2MESH =\nutility appears to compile a RTM (RADIANCE triangle mesh) without any =\nbugs apparent.\n\n\nThe smooth phong shading possible with the MESH primitive renders =\ncorrectly, but I am unclear how to apply a bitmap as a texture map using =\nthe compiled UV mapping co-ordinates.\n\n\nThe OBJ2MESH help file explains how the utility reads a Wavefront .OBJ =\nfile, but it does not suggest that the utility reads and compiles the =\ncorresponding Wavefront material file .MTL.  The help file implies that =\nthe .MTL file should contain a RADIANCE material description.\n\n\nMy question is how is it possible to interpret the Wavefront .MTL file =\n(i.e., in Wavefront format) into a RADIANCE material definition, =\nspecifically regarding referencing the bitmap(s) that will be applied to =\nthe RADIANCE triangle mesh file?\n\n\nJohn Graham, DAI Services\n\n\n\n\n------=_NextPart_000_007A_01C31638.B6EEF880\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\n<HTML><HEAD>\n<META content=3D\"text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1\" =\nhttp-equiv=3DContent-Type>\n<META content=3D\"MSHTML 5.00.3314.2100\" name=3DGENERATOR>\n<STYLE></STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff>\n<DIV>Dear RADIANCE users</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>I have recently been experimenting with the new MESH primitive =\nintroduced=20\nin RADIANCE 3.5.&nbsp; Furthermore, after the latest =\ndiff_HEAD_rad3R5.patch=20\npatch file has modified R3.5, the OBJ2MESH utility appears to compile a =\nRTM=20\n(RADIANCE triangle mesh) without any bugs apparent.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>The smooth phong shading possible with the MESH primitive renders=20\ncorrectly, but I am unclear how to apply a bitmap as a texture map using =\nthe=20\ncompiled UV mapping co-ordinates.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>The OBJ2MESH help file explains how the utility reads a Wavefront =\n.OBJ=20\nfile, but it does not suggest that the utility reads and =\ncompiles&nbsp;the=20\ncorresponding Wavefront material file .MTL.&nbsp; The help file implies =\nthat the=20\n.MTL file should contain a RADIANCE material description.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>My question is how is it possible to interpret the Wavefront .MTL =\nfile=20\n(i.e., in Wavefront format) into a RADIANCE material definition, =\nspecifically=20\nregarding referencing the bitmap(s) that will be applied to the RADIANCE =\n\n\ntriangle mesh file?</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>John Graham, DAI Services</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></BODY></HTML>\n\n\n------=_NextPart_000_007A_01C31638.B6EEF880--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000718.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000718", "created_by": "Digital_Architectural_Illustration_Services"}
