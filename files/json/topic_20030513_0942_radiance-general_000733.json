I should have realized that reducing -lw \nwas going to increase your results rather than decreasing them.  \nSetting -av to 0 will decrease them, at least slightly.  If you say \nyou're seeing similar anomolies in the actual model, though, perhaps \nthere is something to it.  Are you using mkillum to compute the output \nof your skylight?  Have you tried that as well?\n\n\nI think I'd have to see the actual model to be any real help at this \npoint.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000733.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000733", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
