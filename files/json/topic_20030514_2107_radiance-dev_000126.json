I used scads of Pentium-4 \ncompiler options, but I can't look them up now--the system I was \ntesting on is running MS-Windows at the moment.\n\n\nI noted these problems:\n\n\n1. There are two places where strcpy() is declared as an external \nfunction; unfortunately it's a macro in that environment, and one gets \na confusing compile-time error.  PJ Plauger says that use of macros in \nthis way is valid, at least as of C99.  See \n<http://www.dinkumware.com/manuals/reader.aspx?b=c/&h=lib_over.html>.\n\n\n2. The provided version of libtiff does not compile in that \nenvironment; the configure script fails.  I suspect a conflict with the \nsystem's version of \"bash,\" which may have a bug--it is \"unstable,\" \nafter all.  The current version of libtiff compiles, but I did not test \nits functionality.  Libtiff is actually available on that platform as \nthe Debian package libtiffg3.\n\n\n3. That version of Linux supports OpenGL, but I had to hack makeall to \nget it built in.\n\n\n\"rholo\" sure was fast, though!\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-May/000126.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000126", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz"}
