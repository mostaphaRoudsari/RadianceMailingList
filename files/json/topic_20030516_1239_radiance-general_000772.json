Seems that the -lw 0 trick helps a lot on its \nown, and adding the overture calc gets things really close to Real \nLife[tm].\n\n\nParameters (set 4):\n+++++++++++++++++++\n-dp 512\n-ar 57\n-ms 4.2\n-ds .3\n-dt .1\n-dc .5\n-dr 1\n-sj .7\n-st .1\n-ab 5\n-aa .15\n-ad 768\n-as 196\n-av 0 0 0\n-lr 6\n-lw 0\n\n\nAgain, the data is as follows:\nCol 1 - Test# (description)\nCol 2 - Exterior horizontal illuminance (in lux)\nCol 3 - Interior horizontal illuminance (in lux)\nCol 4 - \"Expected\" light reduction\nCol 5 - Actual light reduction\nCol 6 - \"error\" (more on this later)\n\n\nParameter Set 4\n(rtrace alone, 5 points averaged)\t\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\t\t\nTest20 (no shade)\t\t82,343\t249.70\t\t\t\nTest21 (10% shade)\t\t82,348\t30.46\t10.00%\t12.20%\t22%\nTest22 (05% shade)\t\t82,361\t16.33\t5.00%\t6.54%\t31%\nTest23 (01% shade)\t\t82,358\t1.53\t1.00%\t0.61%\t-39%\nTest24 (10% + 05% shades)\t82,354\t0.80\t0.50%\t0.32%\t-36%\nTest25 (10% + 01% shades)\t82,351\t0.35\t0.10%\t0.14%\t42%\nTest26 (01% + 01% shades)\t82,361\t0.02\t0.01%\t0.01%\t-38%\n\n\n\n\nParameter Set 4\n(rtrace after overture calc & 1 fisheye rendering, 5 pts. averaged)\t\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTest20 (no shade)\t\t82,359\t250.67\t\t\t\nTest21 (10% shade)\t\t82,352\t29.91\t10.00%\t11.93%\t19%\nTest22 (05% shade)\t\t82,358\t15.36\t5.00%\t6.13%\t23%\nTest23 (01% shade)\t\t82,357\t2.98\t1.00%\t1.19%\t19%\nTest24 (10% + 05% shades)\t82,357\t0.90\t0.50%\t0.36%\t-28%\nTest25 (10% + 01% shades)\t82,355\t0.26\t0.10%\t0.10%\t3%\nTest26 (01% + 01% shades)\t82,358\t0.04\t0.01%\t0.02%\t60%\n\n\nAs you can see, the results are more favorable now.  It is still a bit \ndistressing that the 1% + 1% shades show a 60% error, but when you look \nat the actual values, it's pretty ridiculous, because the difference \nbetween 0 error and 60% \"error\" is something like .015 lux!  Obviously, \nthere's something wrong with my computation of \"error\".  Maybe \nlogarithmic scaling needs to be applied?  Like I said before, I'm not a \nstatistician.  Anyone handy with GNUplot? =8-) When you look at the \nexpected reduction vs. the actual, it's always within a percentage point \nor two.  Very impressive!  Once again, Radiance has proven its mettle.\n\n\nWhere does this leave me?  Dunno.  I have been doing these full-day \ncalcs, one per hour, for a variety of sky conditions and seasons.  They \ntook a long time, when I was doing -ab 4 and no renderings (this was in \na space with more direct component and higher shade transmission). \nLooks like to get good results in these last galleries, I need to do the \nrendering step for better seeding of the ambient file.  No free \nlunches...  In addition, I would have to do several fisheyes, because \nthe real model is far more complex than the simple box room I used for \nthese tests.  One view just won't cover the entire space.  We may be \nleft to simply analyze the worst times of day/year and make judgements \nbased on that.  But then our lux-hour calculation will be more of a \nguess, I guess.\n\n\nThe big lesson learned is that -av and -lw can bite you in the behind \nwhen you're dealing with tiny fractions of light, so, Photon Wranglers \nbeware...\n\n\nGood learning experience though. I hope this was interesting for some of \nyou.  I learned a lot, and I thank everyone who jumped into this mess \nwith me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000772.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000772", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
