I searched \nthe web, and went through Rendering with Radiance, but still have not \nbeen able to find the answer to my problem.  I have a presentation \ntomorrow morning, and it seems like while I will have nice looking \nimages, the quantitative evaluation may be lacking.\n\n\nProblem:\nWhen I generate a falsecolor image of an office space I rendered, I get \na good image with a dynamic range.  The command I use is:\nfalsecolor -s 400 -i image.pic > image2.pic\n\n\nThe image I rendered was a standard Radiance image that calculates the \nradiance/luminance.\n\n\nThe when I try to get luminance reading from the falsecolor image, the \nvalues I get are confounding.  The brightest areas (the bright red \nregions) always get at reading of 47.8L.  Surrounding areas typically \nhave higher values.\n\n\nTo try to test what was going on, I clicked on the color scale on the \nfalsecolor image and got readings which were not even close to what the \nscale indicates.  The L values are maximum around the yellow/green \nsection (reading at about 120L), and decrease going toward both the \nblue and section of the scale.\n\n\nIf anyone is reading this message on a Sunday evening, I would REALLY \nappreciate it if you could fill me in on how to correct this problem.\n\n\nAgain, apologies if I should have RTFM, but I tried, and have had no \nsuccess thus far.\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000776.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000776", "created_by": "John_An"}
