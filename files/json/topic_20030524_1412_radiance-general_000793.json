I would \nnot have gotten beyond the basic tutorial if it hadn't been for the \nsupport provided by this list.  As frightening as it may sound, if I \ncan manage to get enough of the fundamentals down over the summer, I \nwill be trying to introduce the basics of Radiance into the curriculum \nat my school.\n\n\nMy questions this time are related modeling electric luminaires and \naccurately applying photometric data.\n\n\nI have been following the instructions in Section 5.2.3 of Rendering \nwith Radiance, but using my own direct/indirect fluorrescent luminaire \nphotometric file.  As usual, I'm having some trouble.\n\n\n1) The ies2rad command has -di -df -dc and -dm options.  Do I set the \nunits according to the units of the model of my space, or according to \nthe units the photometric data was created?  I am assuming that it \nwould be according to the units of the model of my space (especially \nsince I don't think photometric data is created in inches or \ncentimeters).  However, when I compare the resulting .dat file of using \nthe -df option with the .dat file using -dm, they are identical.\n\n\n2) I used the command:\nies2rad -df -t white -i .56419 D21998.ies\nI then edited the resulting .rad file to use the lboxcorr function.  \nThe file reads as follows:\n\n\n# ies2rad -df -t white -i .56419\n# Dimensions in feet\n#<IESNA:LM-63-1995\n#<[TEST] 21998\n#<[DATE] 05/31/2001\n#<[LUMCAT] AGDMWU232-F3-120-1/2-EB\n#<[LUMINAIRE] DAY-BRITE ADAGIO DIRECT/INDIRECT W/33-CELL SPECULAR LOUVER\n#<[LAMP] F32T8\n#<[BALLAST] ADVANCE REL-2P32-SC\n#<[MANUFAC] DayBrite-Capri-Omega(Genlyte Thomas Group)\n#<[_TIFF_FILE_NAME] AGD2\n#<[_VERSION] fo2ies 2.01\n#<Reflection factor 0.92, Test distance = 26 ft.\n# 60 watt luminaire, lamp*ballast factor = 0.88\n\n\nvoid brightdata D21998_dist\n5 lboxcorr D21998.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta\n0\n4 .816 .141 1.22 .156\n\n\nD21998_dist illum D21998_light\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\n!genbox D21998_light D21998.s .141 1.22 .156 \\\n| xform -t -.0705 -.61 -.078\n\n\nBecause this file is in meters, I decided to xform the above file using \n-s 39.3700787 to convert the file to inches (which my model is in).
