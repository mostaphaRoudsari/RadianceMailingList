Some Linux installations don't have this\ndirectory, working with the more standards conforming \"/var/tmp\"\ninstead. Looks like you are currently running such a system.\n\n\nI think that Radiance should be more flexible in this point, but\nfor the moment, it will be enough for you to create a symbolic\nlink pointing from \"/usr/tmp\" to \"/var/tmp\", like this:\n\n\n$> ln -s /var/tmp /usr/tmp\n\n\nObviously, you need to be root do this.  Once that link is in\nplace, your problem will go away.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000803.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000803", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
