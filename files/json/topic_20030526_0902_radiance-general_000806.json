However, you must do one thing if you substitute \nthe geometry for a fixture; you must multiply the A1 scalefactor in the \nbrightdata primitive by the ratio of the illum sphere area divided by \nthe illum replacement geometry area, or the total lumens will not be \nmaintained during the switch.  Alternatively, you can specify an illum \nradius whose area (4*PI*radius^2) exactly equals the area of the \nreplacement geometry.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000806.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000806", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
