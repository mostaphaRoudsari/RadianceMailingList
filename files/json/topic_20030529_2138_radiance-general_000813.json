Greg knows a lot more \nthan I do, of course, but my guess is that compiling Radiance with \n64-bit integers and floats would probably show unexpected word-length \ndependencies.  Even so, I'd expect computation speeds to improve \nbecause of some technical aspects of the C language.\n\n\nA rewrite of rholo to make use of a 64- (or even 48-) bit address space \nwould also probably be interesting to experiment with.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000813.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000813", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz"}
