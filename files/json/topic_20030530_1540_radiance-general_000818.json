We're doing some glare studies, so \nthe luminance of the mountain is important to me.\n\n\nI could model the mountains, but because they are so far from my model \nI'll get ambient leaks, right?  Is there some way to exclude the distant \ngeometry from adding values to the ambient cache?  I'm interested in \ndoing some daylight animations, so if I could do it with representative \n3D geometry (vs. using a texture map) I'd be ever so happy.\n\n\nFailing that, is there a way to apply a picture of the mountains to a \nlocal object?  My concern there is that if I have a large object close \nto the window it will reflect more light into the space than what would \nactually happen, with the mountain a mile away.\n\n\nAny pointers appreciated.\n\n\nP.S.  If I had a lightmap of this site, could I use it to do an \nimage-based rendering?  All the image-based renderings I've seen are of \nobjects being directly illuminated by the lightmap.   But if I put a \nlocal ground plane and my building into the center of a lightmap, would \nthe interreflection be computed, and the interior of the space be \nrendered properly?  Would it be \"accurate\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000818.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000818", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
