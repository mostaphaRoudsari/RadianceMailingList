The more -ab ambient bounces you have, the smaller its effect on the final value.  This is because the -av value is multiplied by the surface reflectance of each intervening surface beteen the \"eye\" and the \"last bounce.\"  (If av=1.0, surface reflectance =0.5 and -ab 4, then effective  av=1.0*0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5=0.0625)\n\n\nThis has the effect of \"seeding\" the ambient value cache with the -av ambient value.  If the estimate of the ambient value is way off, then it will affect the ambient values stored in the cache.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n--0-1000010107-1054670738=:70122\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<DIV>I just wanted to respond to this statement...<BR><BR>&gt; Only computed ambient values live in the ambient cache, ...</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>This is somewhat true, but misses an important point.&nbsp; </DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>You can think about the -av ambient value as&nbsp;an estimated&nbsp;value for all&nbsp;of the ambient light in your&nbsp;scene that the ambient interreflection calculation can not \"find.\"&nbsp; It is&nbsp;applied to the \"last bounce\" of light during the ambient interreflection calculation.&nbsp; The more -ab ambient bounces you have, the smaller its effect on the final value.&nbsp; This is because the -av value is multiplied by the surface reflectance of each intervening surface beteen the \"eye\" and the \"last bounce.\"&nbsp; (If av=1.0, surface reflectance =0.5 and -ab 4, then&nbsp;effective &nbsp;av=1.0*0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5=0.0625)</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>This has the effect of \"seeding\" the ambient value cache with the -av ambient value.&nbsp; If the estimate of the ambient value is way off, then it will affect the ambient values&nbsp;stored in the&nbsp;cache.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>-Chas</DIV>\n--0-1000010107-1054670738=:70122--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000836.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000836", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich"}
