Sorry if I'm not explaining this well.\n\n\nIf you took a series of photographs, recorded exposures, and stitched \nthem together using the metered exposure and a bit of information about \nthe film (print film preferred, I think) to estimate actual luminance, \nI think you could come up with a reasonable approximation for some \npurposes.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000843.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000843", "created_by": "Randolph_Fritz"}
