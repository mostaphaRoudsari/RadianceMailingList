I want the beautiful pictures and type of\neffects achieved by raytracing and radiosity.  However, I'm\nnot concerned with absolute accuracy and fidelity to reality\nwhich seems to be Radiance's strength.\n\n\nGiven the above, would using Radiance be overkill?  And\nwould I be paying a large penalty in performance (and complexity\nof specification) to get the kind of accuracy I don't need.\nWould I be better off with Povray or Mental Ray or some\nother renderer?\n\n\nAlso, does anyone have some examples of final images along with\nhow long they took to render, polygon count, number of lights, image\nresolution, cpu type/speed, and any other parameters that have a major\nimpact on speed/quality.  That might help me get an idea of whether it's\nwell suited to what I need.\n\n\nThanks,\nBob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000858.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000858", "created_by": "Bob_Coyne"}
