If regenerating the exact samples isn't an issue \nfor you, you probably can run Radiance many times, however, and others \nhave done this.\n\n\nThe best way to do it for non-human consumption is to defined many \nmaterials files, one for every three samples, and render from these in \na for loop.  The only place RGB is assumed in the code is when it's \ncombining primaries to get brightness for a weight test or somesuch, \nand it shouldn't affect the result much for adjacent samples, which \nshould be fairly similar.\n\n\nGood luck!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000869.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000869", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
