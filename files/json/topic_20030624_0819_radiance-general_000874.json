The artifacts don't  \n_quite_ look like an ambient calculation restart.  I have a competing  \ntheory, which is that a long integer is getting wrapped in the source  \ntesting code.  This is really a bug, but I guess it hasn't shown up  \nbefore because no one has testing a light source 2^31 times in a single  \nrun.  Actually, maybe they have, but just never noticed the problem.\n\n\nI'll work on a fix for this today, but obviously you're going to have  \nto find another way to repair your image to meet your deadline.  Sorry  \nabout that.  I recommend using the -vl option to rpict and rerendering  \na portion of your image to cover up the problem areas using pcompos.   \nLet me know if you need help on figuring these options out.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000874.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000874", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
