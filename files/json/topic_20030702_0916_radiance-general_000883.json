Download the current experimental bug-fix version, called \nradiance-HEAD.tgz, and compile from that.  If you still get compile \nerrors with the latest random.h, please forward them directly to me and \nI'll see what I can do.  It's probably best to send me the entire \noutput of makeall.\n\n\n-Greg\ngward@lmi.net\n\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000883.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000883", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
