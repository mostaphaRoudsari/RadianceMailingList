I \ncopied the radbin_osx directory to /usr/local/. Changed my .tcshrc to \ninclude the following paths, the last one pointing to my current \nradiance project.\n\n\nsetenv PATH /usr/local/radbin_osx:$PATH\nsetenv RAYPATH /usr/local/lib/ray:$PATH\nsetenv PATH /Users/username/Documents/Projects/CP_test:$PATH\n\n\nI then moved the ray/lib to /usr/local/lib/ray per a note I found in \nthe email archive. This doesn't work but I'll come back to that. The \nsame email from the archive also noted to copy all the .cal files from \nthe ray/source directory using this command:\n\n\ncp -p src/*.cal /usr/local/lib/ray\n\n\nThis didn't work, reporting \"no match found\" so I went through the each \nof the sub-directories of ray/src and used this command to get them to \ntheir proper home:\n\n\nmv *.cal /usr/local/lib/ray\n\n\nOn first test picture.cal wasn't found so I downloaded \n\"rad3R5supp.tar.gz\" from\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/ unpacked it and moved the contents of \nits ray/lib to /usr/local/lib/ray. Somehow picture.cal wasn't being \nseen in /usr/local/lib/ray/lib/ after the initial copy.\n\n\nNow radiance works!\n\n\nUltimately I hope some knowledgeable person updates the install script \nto make it functional but in the interim perhaps these crude \nworkarounds will help.\n\n\nsome of the renders\nhttp://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/london/model/gallery1/index.html\n\n\nTake care,\n\n\nChris Jessee\njessee@virginia.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-July/000138.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000138", "created_by": "Chris_Jessee"}
