I have filters\ndating back to the early 1990's. Please advise me about the availability of\nmore recent, efficient filters which might run within AutoCAD 2000+. I do\nrealize that Desktop Radiance will provide geometry conversion... I am\ntrying to avoid loading the whole package, when all I need is an output text\nfile.\n\n\nThanks much,\n\n\nRob Shakespeare\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-July/000899.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000899", "created_by": "Rob_Shakespeare"}
