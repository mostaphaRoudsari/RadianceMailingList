The BRDF types (plasfunc, metfunc, transfunc,  \nplasdata, metdata, transdata, and BRTDfunc) allow you to define  \nfunctions that pass the source direction (x,y,z).  Since these are  \nfunction parameters rather than system variables, you can only access  \nthem in the way described in the original Digests post (attached).  The  \nprism material types (prism1 and prism2) actually define a separate set  \nof variables, DxA, DyA, and DzA that correspond to the target light  \nsource direction, but these variables are only defined when evaluating  \nthese primitives.  The Radiance reference manual attempts to be  \ncomplete it its obscure way in defining these things.  (This may be  \nfound in HTML form in the latest distribution or directly from the  \nwebsite at <http://floyd.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html>.)\n\n\nThe reason the incident light direction is not defined in general is  \nbecause there is usually no need for it, and typically it is not known  \nduring pattern/texture evaluation.  What is your application for this  \ninformation?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000905.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000905", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
