Most likely you\nshould already have that installed on your system before you\nstart compiling daysim. Just make sure that the directory\nwhare the Radiance binaries reside is included in your $PATH.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000913.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000913", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
