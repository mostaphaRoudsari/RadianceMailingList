Like you mentioned in your Emails, i will \nnow use a photon mapping to simulate the behavior of my specific HOE's. I \nhave written Roland Schregle to get support (I hope he will answer). \nMeanwhile, for a first try, i will use prism1/2 or dielectric materials. I \nam curious about the results.\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\n-Frank\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000911.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000911", "created_by": "Frank_Eggenstein"}
