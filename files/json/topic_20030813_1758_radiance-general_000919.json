I'm in the initial stages of preparing \nthis model and like to use that objview command to look at the rad \nfiles, so I'm just wondering of there's a way to tell objview to use a \nhigher resolution, giving objview a new -r parameter to pass on to oconv?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000919.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000919", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
