I had problems with the \nmakeall script back when 3.5 was released, so I just kept on using 3.4, \nbut I recall Greg fixed a few more things in the script so I thought I'd \ntry again.  Here's what happenned:\n\n\nScript seems to work, at least it no longer fails with an \"if syntax\" \nerror when answering the questions.  Rejoyce.\n\n\nCompile process flies along, but spewed a few errors.  Where is the \ncompile log?  Maybe I can find the answer to my problems there, but I \ndon't know where it lives.\n\n\nOK, so I figure I have no time to dilly-dally with this.  Grab the \nbinaries, install.  Stuff doesn't work.\n\n\nReset permissions/ownership in the binaries, other stuff doesn't work. \nSpecifically, rview complains it can't find rayinit.cal.\n\n\nReset permissions/ownership on the library files (including \nrayinit.cal), same stuff still don't work.  ~8-\\\n\n\nSo, now I have a busted system.  Anyone got any clues for clueless over \nhere?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000921.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000921", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
