I followed your\nlink to see what you had done, and fetched the patch file you\noffer for download there.\n\n\nIn you patch, most changed files are included in full twice,\nbecause you saved them with line endings in Windows format (\\r\\n)\ninstead of unix format (\\n). This makes it almost impossible to\nsee what you actually did. The patch also includes a few files\nthat don't really belong there (backup files ending with ~, and\nthe automatically generated Version.c).\n\n\nI wouldn't want to apply any patches with the \"wrong\" line\nendings (let alone check them into CVS), and I suspect neither\nwould Greg. Apart from that, we're highly interested in any fixes\nthat make the code easier to compile on any system, so your\ncontribution is certainly appreciated. Just that it isn't really\nuseable for us in its current state. A correctly created diff\nwill at best be a few hunderd lines long, not more than 5500.\n\n\nSince this is a development issue, I'm cross-posting this message\nhere to the Radiance development list. I suggest you post any\ntechnically oriented replies there as well (ideally only there).\nIf you're not subscribed there yet, you can do that here:\n\n\n  http://www.radiance-online.org/\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-August/000183.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000183", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
