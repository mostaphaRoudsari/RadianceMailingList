Here is the link:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/radiance/aa0_test/final.html\n(59 images, ~2 MB total)\n\n\nMy conclusion is that penumbras require high oversampling,\nand at those levels, a very low number of ambient divisions\nare required for a smooth rendering (-ad 4 to 16).\n\n\nI welcome any comments that you may have on the method,\nresults, etc. I may have forgotten some very important\nparameter that throws all of these results askew---if I\ndid, please tell me! =0)\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nMark Stock\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000940.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000940", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
