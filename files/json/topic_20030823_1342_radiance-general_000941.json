I have noticed that setting high can greatly \nincrease computation time so I wish to find out how to better optimize this \nparameter. I know there was something in \"Rendering with Radiance\" on this \nbut unfortunately my book is packed away in a box as I am moving right now. \nDoes this parameter affect the ambient calculation? If so then how? When I \nread the description in the Radiance manual it simply says \"Limit \nreflections to a maximum of N\". Does this limit the amount of ambient \nbounces set with -ab? May I ask does this parameter deals with the virtual \nlight source calculation only? If I do not have many (if any) virtual light \nsources is setting this value to 1 or 2 acceptible? Does setting this value \nthis low greatly adverse to the accuracy of the calculation if there are not \nmany virrtual light sources?\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet MSN 8 and enjoy automatic e-mail virus protection.    \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000941.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000941", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
