There are a couple of reasons for this, the \nmain one being to discourage people from creating thousands of light \nsources in their scenes, which is a disaster for the calculation times. \n  If you need to do this, use the -x option of replmarks instead of -i \nand just create copies of the geometry.  If the geometry itself is too \ncomplicated, instance all the geometry except for the actual emitting \nsurfaces, and put them in with replmarks -x.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-August/000946.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000946", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
