Can you shed some light for me?\n\n\nIn the end, I'm looking for a way to produce the textures of interior walls\n. In the past, I've generated noise in Photoshop, blurred it and used Find\nEdges filter.\nIf there's a way to do this some other way, I'd be open. The Puckered\nmaterial in the Cabin scene is'nt quite what I'm looking for.\n\n\nthanks\nRob Fitzsimmons\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/000954.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_000954", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons"}
