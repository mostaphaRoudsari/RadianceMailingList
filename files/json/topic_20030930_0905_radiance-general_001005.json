Since Radiance \nsamples a rectangle with equivalent area to the source shape, triangles \nare a particularly poor choice.  I recommend replacing any windows you \nplan to use as illum's with rectangles for that reason.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-September/001005.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001005", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
