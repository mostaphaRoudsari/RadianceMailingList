Will we be doing that again this year?  I \nvote yes; Peter, is there room/bandwidth available on \nradiance-online.org?  Reason I ask is that I'm writing a little report \non the Workshop for my friend's computer graphics website, and I'd like \nto mention whether this is available (as I did last year).  I recall \neveryone voted on it last year, at the workshop.  Maybe we could reach \nan e-consensus here?  Let me know.\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001006.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001006", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
