I understand how to\napply modifiers, and patterns, and I've read the old\ntutorial, the new tutorial, the help files,\nand the man pages, and still can't get my head\naround what this is for or where you would apply\nit.\n\n\nIf anyone could point me to a help file,\nor just give a few quick examples of what the\nalias modifier would be used for in application,\nI would be incredibly grateful.\n\n\nThanks a ton,\n\n\nJeffrey\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001033.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001033", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew"}
