Does the Window 5 program output colored \nmaterials for Radiance?  Maybe Judy knows.  (Judy?)\n\n\nThe names of the colors don't really help, much.  You need either \nspectral transmittance and reflectance values or (at least) CIE (x,y) \nchromaticities for each transmitted and reflected color.  I can't get \nthese values from the names.  Perhaps Window 5 can??\n\n\nOther help!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001038.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001038", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
