Although I haven't tried to \nduplicate my problem in Linux, I have had issues with the *.pic files \ngenerated and read by Radiance 3.5. It seems that the files that are \ngenerated by Radiance 3.5 binaries compiled for Windows can be read by \nximage but can not be read by winimage (issued with Desktop Radiance) or HDR \nShop. The same can be said of picture files read by Radiance 3.5. Picture \nfiles created via ra_tiff with Desktop Radiance or Radiance 3.4 (Linux) \nbinaries can not be read by Radiance 3.5 and visa/versa. Has anyone had this \nissue in the Linux/Unix or MacOs environment.\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHigh-speed Internet access as low as $29.95/month (depending on the local \nservice providers in your area).
