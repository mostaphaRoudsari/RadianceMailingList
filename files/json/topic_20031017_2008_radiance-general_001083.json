The code is no longer distributed as \na patch, but rather as prepatched sources which replace the stock \nRADIANCE 3.5 code. This code will *not* work with the HEAD release.\n\n\nBarring residual bugs, this update is final for the foreseeable future. \nNo functionality has been added. I considered adding support for \narbitrary BRDFs, but I soon realised this was more trouble than it was \nworth and of questionable practicality, given the abysmal performance.\n\n\nEnjoy, and let me know how (if?) it works out for you.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\nRoland Schregle\nPhD candidate, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\nRADIANCE Photon Map page: www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/photon-map\n\n\nEND OF LINE.
