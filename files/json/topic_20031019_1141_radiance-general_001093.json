The formula I \ngave you was based on the assumption that the height of a 35mm frame is \n35mm, which is just plain wrong.  35mm refers to the total width of the \nfilm, including the registration (sprocket) holes.  The actual size of \nthe imageable frame is 24x36mm.  I found the following excellent page \nexplaining focal lengths and how to use them, which explains everything:\n\n\n\thttp://www.panoramafactory.com/equiv35/equiv35.html\n\n\nThe formula you fixed from the book:\n\n\n\th35 = 114.6*atan(17/f)\n\tv35 = 114.6*atan(11.5/f)\n\n\nis close to correct for a 35mm landscape frame.  It should actually be:\n\n\n\th35 = 2*180/PI*atan(36/2/f)\n\tv35 = 2*180/PI*atan(24/2/f)\n\n\nThe values of 17 and 11.5mm may have been derived from measurements of \nan actual slide frame, which were probably slightly smaller than the \nofficial size.  The answer is pretty close either way.\n\n\nTo get the view angles for other focal lengths, simply substitute the \ntarget film dimensions for the 36 and 24mm values in the formmula \nabove.  You'll have to verify these sizes yourself.  (I'm not sure for \nexample if a 4x5 transparency has a 40x50mm imaging area or something \nsmaller.)\n\n\nI hope this helps this time.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001093.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001093", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
