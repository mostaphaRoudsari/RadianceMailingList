I have\nspecified the gensky and this time included both \u2013B\nand \u2013R in my sky.rad file. When I do an r-trace I get\na message \nWarning: aiming failure for light source \u201csun\u201d.\nHowever it proceeds to do the run and gives me the\noutput, which seems correct. (Superlite gives me\nsimilar results). What is this warning message due to?\nIs it similar to the warning message, which I got\ninitially when I was doing only sky \u2013warning no light\nsource found (Thanks Rob for your initial response) \nI read in the archives and found that the error may\narise if one is using odd shaped polygons /triangles\nand illum however my geometry consists of simple\nrectilinear forms and I am not using any secondary\nsources. Could anyone explain the reason for this\nwarning message? \n\n\nThank You \n\n\nArvinder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
