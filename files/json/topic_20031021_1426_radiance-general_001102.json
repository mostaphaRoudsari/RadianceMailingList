However I still haven't\nfound an efficient and acceptable workflow\ndue to my reliance on CAD systems for generating\ngeometry (and their somewhat inferior exporting\nability).\n\n\nSo again I'm bothering all of you in asking\nfor two things; first off, how much & what do you\ntypically model in CAD and how much do you typically\ndescribe within Radiance (or array, or instance)\nfor a given project; and secondly, has anyone\never made an effort to make a 3D GUI modeler that\nuses Radiance as it's native file format?\n\n\n(would this even be possible?)\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nJeffrey\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001102.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001102", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew"}
