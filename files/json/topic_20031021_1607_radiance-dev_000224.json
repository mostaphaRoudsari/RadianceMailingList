I decided to do so\nafter I succeded compiling large parts of Radiance on Windows\nwith the help of SCons. Francesco reported a problem when trying\nthe same thing with Cygwin, but I think that's fixed now.\n\n\nCurrently, 86 executables get built without errors on Windows\n(although in some areas still with lots of warnings).\nThe missing parts are as follows:\n\n\n* mgf2rad trips over duplicate file/function names between\n  librt and libmgf.\n* The holodeck will require some substantial porting work.\n* rtrace and rpict trip over multiple definitions of functions\n  named free_os(), as well as over unix specific code in\n  raypcalls.c\n* Ranimate requires a Windows version of netproc.c.\n* Ranimove also has troubles with free_os().\n* The X11 dependent stuff is obvious.\n* I ignored the tifflib for the moment. Since we seem to be\n  migrating to a more current version anyway, are there any\n  chances that the rad3R5supp.tar.gz will get updated?\n  Or do we need a seperate rad3R6supp.tar.gz?\n\n\nAs one of the next things I'll start resolving name conflicts\nthroughout the code base, which probably requires some discussion\nabout what goes where.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000224.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000224", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
