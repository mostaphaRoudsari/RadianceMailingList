I \njust did a run-through of the HEAD distribution and couldn't find \nanyplace where errno is referenced that doesn't include <errno.h> \neither directly, or indirectly via \"standard.h\", \"rtio.h\" or \n\"rtprocess.h\".\n\n\nI bet that some of these corrections were made subsequent to the \nofficial 3.5 release.  We have posted this message before, but it bears \nrepeating.  If you wish to offer a patch, please offer a patch to the \ncurrent HEAD release rather than to an earlier release.  Last night's \nHEAD release may always be found at the download link on \nwww.radiance-online.org.\n\n\nThanks!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-October/000226.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000226", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
