In accordance with the mkillum it\n\n\nwas called mktis:  Make translation invariant Structure\n\n\nFor more information please see http://www.exergia.de/light_sim/mktis.htm\n\n\nAs the complete simulation process required a lot of scripting\n\n\nI signed up a contract with Georg Mischler <www.schorsch.com> to use these original\n\n\nroutines to build up a user friendly front end in accordance to Rayfront\n\n\nand bring it to the market as commercial software: Raydirect.\n\n\nSo far the story.\n\n\nMy problem is that I got no response to emails regarding my outstanding\n\n\nlicense fees for serveral monthes. I tried to contact him via schorsch@schorsch.com\n\n\nwithout success. So my concret question: Does anybody know an alternativ\n\n\nmail address or way to contact him? I know that he was a participant of the last radiance \n\n\nworkshop in Berkley and so still seems to be working in this business.\n\n\nSorry for this unconventional mail in this list, but perhaps someone could help.\n\n\nThanks and regards\n\n\nThomas Schmidt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexergia - ideas in light & energy\nweb  www.exergia.de | www.newenergyshop.com\nfon +49-761 2923589 | fax +49-761 2925915\n\n\n\n\n--------------080800020105090408080604\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title></title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<pre>Hi all!</pre>\n<pre>\nThis mail is not directly related to a technical question.</pre>\n<pre>\nJust a short introduction of myself:</pre>\n<pre>Several years ago I was \"deeply\" engaged in the radiance business:</pre>\n<pre>What I did was to write an additional preprocessor that enables one</pre>\n<pre>to handle translation invariant daylight redirection systems in the</pre>\n<pre>context of <b>Radiance</b>.
