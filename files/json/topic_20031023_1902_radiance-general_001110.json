I got\nsome ideas from the desktop radiance manual, however have still not been able\nto model them properly.\n\n\nI am trying to model blinds for the glazing in a simple room with a south\nfacing glass.\nI wrote the genblinds rad file as follows:\n\n\nvoid plastic blinds\n0\n0\n5        0.4           0.4          0.4        0.02        0\n\n\n!genblinds blinds blind 1 180 51 58.29 0 | xform -t 240 6 30\n\n\n\n\nand I tried modeling the blinds in the following two ways.\n\n\n1.\there the glass is the illum and the blinds are located towards the\nroom side next to the glass.  (modeled using mkillum, using rad)\n\n\n2.\there I modeled the glass and special illum separately.  The special\nillum is located towards to inner side of the glass and blinds setup. (modeled\nusing mkillum, using rad)\n\n\nNeither of them gave me proper results, i'm sure I was doing something wrong.\nThe glass and illum were both getting modelled sperately it seems, because the \nsun component remained unchanged.  What is the correct way to model blinds??\n\n\nIs there another way of modeling the blinds?  I would really appreciate some\nhelp here ...if there is some text I should be reading...let me know.\n\n\nThankyou\nAmarpreet\n\n\n\n\nAmarpreet Sethi\nGraduate Student\nArizona State University\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001110.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001110", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
