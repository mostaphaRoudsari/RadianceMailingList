In my Doe 2 model I am using a flat glass\nwhich has properties similar to that of a \n2 dome fiberglass(translucent) with Visible\ntransmittance = 0.5, SC = 0.45\nI need to create a similar glass type in Radiance.\nI am using the trans material type and based a on\nprevious discussion have created\n\n\nvoid trans skylight\n0\n0\n7 0.54 0.54 0.54 0 0 1 0 \n\n\nIs this the correct material definition.\nWhat would be the definition for a similar white\ntranslucent material.(Would the color effect the\nilluminance values inside)\n\n\nAlso I know that I need to use mkillum for this.Do I\nneed to define both the window surface as well as a\npolygon below the well as illums or simply the polygon\nbelow the well so as to obtain accurate results.\nPlease Guide me with this.\n\n\nThank You\nArvinder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
