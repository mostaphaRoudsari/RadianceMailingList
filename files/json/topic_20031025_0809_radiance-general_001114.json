I have uploaded two versions of this program, one for \nLinux and one for Mac OS X.  I have also written a separate program to \nperform lens flare removal, which may be applied during hdrgen or as a \npost-process.  I have a simple HTML man page for hdrgen, but not for \nhdrflare as it's pretty basic and has no options.\n\n\nThe files are available from my website at:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/hdrgen_linux.tar.gz\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/hdrgen_macosx.tar.gz\n\n\nBoth programs will output either Radiance RGBE, 32-bit/pixel LogLuv \nTIFF, or PIZ-compressed EXR format images.  The input to hdrgen may be \neither JPEG or TIFF.  If the input files have valid camera exposure \ninformation in the header, this will be used to determine the relative \nand absolute exposure differences.  Otherwise, you will have to enter \nthe exposure multipliers on the command line.  For those on a Mac who \nprefer a nice user interface, there is of course Photosphere.  The \nlatest 1.1 release contains all the new goodies:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/photosphere.tar.gz\n\n\nThis version of the HDR builder includes a new ghost removal algorithm \nin addition to the alignment and lens flare removal options.  The ghost \nremoval algorithm looks for parts of the scene where things have \nchanged between exposures, and chooses the best exposure for those \nregions.  The alignment algorithm is written up in an upcoming JGT \narticle.  I haven't written up the flare removal algorithm, but I hope \nto at some point, along with the ghost removal technique.  Everything \nis automatic, so if one of the techniques doesn't work, there's not \nmuch you can do about it but switch it off.  At least the whole thing \nis fast, so there's not much harm in running it multiple times.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  The Linux version is a little slower than it should be because \nthe version of gcc I used has a broken optimizer.  I hope to recompile \nwith optimizations in the near future, and will send out a follow-up \nannouncement when I do.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001114.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001114", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
