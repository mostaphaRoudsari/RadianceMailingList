I even performed what I like to call a \"binary \nenema\", deleting my entire partition and installing the new OS fresh.  \nNaturally, one of the first proggies I wanted to get on here is \nRadiance, but the install script that worked so well on 10.2 is having \nproblems on 10.3.\n\n\nI downloaded the HEAD release, and tried:\n\n\nsudo ./makeall install\n\n\nEverything went well until:\n\n\n\tWhere do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]?\n\tls: lib: No such file or directory\n\tcsh: d1: Subscript out of range.\n\n\nThe directory *is* there, and I own it, but even that shouldn't matter \nbecause I'm trying to install it as root by using the sudo command.  \nIdeas?  I could download the binaries, but that's so boring.\n\n\n-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-\n   Rob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001123.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001123", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
