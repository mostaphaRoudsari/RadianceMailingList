The command line interface says\n\n\nwarning- no light sources found\n\n\noconv and getinfo appear to work OK, but the rview\nprogram will only produce a blank screen.\n\n\nThe results are consistent on my ds20 and a couple of\nxp1000s.\n\n\nI was wondering if this was a general radiance issue\nor one specific to the 64-bit alpha platform.\n\n\nI'm running RHAT 7.1 on all machines.\n\n\n--David Janello\nsimulation and searches, llc\nwww.simulationandsearches.com\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001146.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001146", "created_by": "David_Janello"}
