{"topic": "Several updates", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "October 29, 2003 at 04:39PM", "body": "First, I frighteningly noticed that the rpict defaults had changed\nrecently when I ran PB's bench2 benchmark test and my Athlon took\nan hour to do a 5-minute job. Thus, I updated the \"bench2\" benchmark\ntest to specifically set the rpict parameters to the old default\nvalues. So, new chips don't look awful anymore. The benchmark page\nis at the following URL, and it hasn't seen many new entries\nrecently.\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html\n\n\nSecond, and I'm not sure if I sent this to the group, I updated\nmy \"Radiance resolution and filtering test\" page to include the\nnew behavior of the -r option in pfilt for Radiance\nversions 3R5 and newer. The results are on the bottom half of\nthis page:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/radmisc/resolution_test/\n\n\nLast, and again, if I've mentioned this before, please forgive\nme, I've updated my \"-aa 0\" test page to include the -ps 1\noption, and the results have changed somewhat. This page is at:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html\n\n\nI hope some of this will come in handy to someone. It's helped\nme refine some of compilation and rendering strategies.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001152.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001152", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
