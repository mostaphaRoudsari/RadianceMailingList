(only thing it complained about \nwas wish wasn't found in the path, so it failed to compile trad, which \nI never use anyway).  I added /usr/local/bin to PATH and set \nRAYPATH=/usr/local/lib/ray (in .bash-profile).  I also added the \nDISPLAY variable, so I can call Radiance programs directly from the OSX \nterminal windows.\n\n\nSpecifically, I put:\n\n\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nRAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray\nexport PATH RAYPATH\nset DISPLAY=:0.0\nexport DISPLAY\n\n\ninto my .bash_profile.  So far so good. =8-)\n\n\n-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-\n   Rob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001165.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001165", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
