In \nmy models, I am recieving some noisy reflections. In the following scene, I \nhave modeled some kitchen appliances to have a brushed stainless steel \nfinish with the following material:\n\n\nvoid metal2 brushed_metal_01m1\n4\t1\t1\t1\t.\n0\n6 1.0000  1.0000  1.0000  0.75000  0.040 0.075\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some renderings of the scene:\n\n\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera1.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera2.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera3.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera4.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera5.jpg&.view=t\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the pertinent render parameters:\n\n\n-ps 1 -sj 1 -st 0 -dt 0\n\n\nThe pictures were rendered at 1000 x 1000 and filtered to 500 x 500.\n\n\nI know that there should be some blurry reflections on the surfaces on the \nappliances due to the roughness of the material but I question whether or \nnot the reflections should look like fractalized noise. They look far more \nfractalized in their native *.pic format that the *.jpg format that you see \nhere. The following is a different scene but with the same appliances and \nassociated materials as the previous scene. Instead of being illuminated by \ndaylight, it is illuminated by some illumination squares. Here you can see \nthe reflections are blurry yet smooth except for the reflection of the \nrefridgerator handle on the refridgerator door. Here it seems that we have \nthe same fractalized noise phenomenon (I can provide a close up of this to \nshow more detail).:\n\n\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default1a.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default2a.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default3a.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default4a.jpg&.view=t\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default5a.jpg&.view=t\n\n\nAs a side note, the reflections of the light sources on the floor do not \nseem right. I have noticed this before. Does anyone know what's causing \nthis?\n\n\n\n\nI have tried to figure out what's causing all of this but I can't get \nanywhere. I should note that all of the previous scenes were rendered with \nDesktop Radiance binaries. I have tested to see if I got similar results \nusing Radiance 3.6 binaries using CYGWIN. I have confirmed this to be the \ncase. The folling scene is rendered with Radiance 3.6 binaries for CYGWIN:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=house6a_camera6_filt1.jpg&.view=t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if anyone has problems viewing these photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nConcerned that messages may bounce because your Hotmail account has exceeded \nits 2MB storage limit?
