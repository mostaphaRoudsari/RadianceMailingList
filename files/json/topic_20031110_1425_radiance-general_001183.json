Accurender\nauto-generates trees & plants on the fly\nfractally, and Max/Viz allows for 'RPC\nContent'. However (and please correct\nme if I'm wrong) there aren't any\nRadiance add-ons to auto-generate\nplants and/or allow for RPC content.\n\n\nDoes everyone typically have these\nitems as whole Radiance models, instanced\ninto the 'scene'? Is this not a problem\ndue to Radiance's render engine's differences\nfrom other 3D packages? What about the\nrepetitiveness apparent in an image when\nthe same tree/bush/person/car is used\nover and over and over again? I see\nsome exterior renderings on Visarc's\nwebsite that have wonderful looking\ntrees, does anyone know how those\nwere done?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJeffrey\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001183.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001183", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew"}
