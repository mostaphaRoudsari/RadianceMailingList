What does happen is that the ambient \ncalculation gets, as Greg likes to say, \"nasty\".  Of course, as for \nmost limitations in Radiance, the author has developed a tool for \ndealing with that.  You can exclude materials from the ambient \ncalculation.  By specifying -ae (material) in your rpict/rtrace command \n(or by placing it in your .rif file (render= -ae [material]) you tell \nRadiance to apply the ambient (-av) value to all materials on the -ae \nline, thus skipping a whole lot of interreflection calculations.\n\n\n> Does everyone typically have these\n> items as whole Radiance models, instanced\n> into the 'scene'?

This \nsaves lots of memory.  I have also read about people who write scripts \nthat randomize the placement of these library items.  By varying the \ntree instances over three or four distinct models, and further varying \nthe scale & rotation of each instanced tree, you can create a very \nrandom look to your \"forest\", for example.  AFAIK, the trees you see in \nVisarc's renderings are all 3D geometry.  They pride themselves on \ncreating everything and faking nothing.  Amazing, yeah?\n\n\n-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-\n   Rob Guglielmetti\nrpg@rumblestrip.org\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001186.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001186", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
