If you are compiling from the \nofficial release, the first thing to try (always) is downloading and \ncompiling the HEAD release, which has quite a few bug fixes, especially \nrelated to portability across platforms.\n\n\nIf you do this and are still seeing errors, then I suggest you post a \nmessage to the radiance-dev list, since it will then be a development \nissue once we are working on the latest sources.  It is not worthwhile \nfor anyone to attempt to debug the official release at this stage, as \nthey are 90% likely to be rediscovering bugs that have already been \nfound and fixed.\n\n\nThanks for your efforts -- hopefully, this won't take long.\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Be sure to overlay the rad3R5supp.tar.gz files over the HEAD \nrelease prior to compiling, as without these additional files, you \nwon't have a complete distribution.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001190.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001190", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
