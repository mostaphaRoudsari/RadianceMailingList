{"topic": "Getting the focal length of a Radiance camera", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "November 12, 2003 at 08:45AM", "body": "Hi Rich,\n\n\nMarcus Jacobs asked a similar question about focal lengths last month \non this group (Oct. 19th, in fact).\n\n\nFor a 35mm frame (which measures 36x24mm on the actual exposure), the \nequation for the horizontal and vertical view angles (in degrees) is:\n\n\n\th = 2*180/PI*atan(36/2/f)\n\tv = 2*180/PI*atan(24/2/f)\n\n\nTo derive the focal length from the view angle, you just invert these:\n\n\n\tf = 36/2/tan(PI/180/2*h)\n\tf = 24/2/tan(PI/180/2*v)\n\n\nAs you can see, there are two formulas above, which means that you can \nderive the focal length from either the horizontal or the vertical view \nangles, but they won't necessarily agree.  This is obvious because any \ngiven Radiance view may not have the correct image aspect ratio to \nmatch 35mm (or any other format) film.  You have what is known in math \nas an \"overdetermined problem.\"  You can choose to ignore this and \nsimply average the results from these two formulas, or pick the larger \nor smaller of the two, depending on whether you wanted to fill the \nframe completely or keep the image with black borders (i.e., \n\"letterbox\" format).\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001191.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001191", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
