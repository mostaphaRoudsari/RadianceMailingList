I presume that you don't see this unless you run \nthe image through pcond, which makes the darker areas visible.  Did you \ntry applying the -h option of pcond?  This might reduce the appearance \nof these splotches considerably.\n\n\nGetting at the heart of your errors, they are really due to the \nlow-angle light coming in from the horizon on the outer perimiter of \nyour model.  Your idea of placing a \"mkillum fence\" around the \nperimiter is a good one, and might well eliminate these splotches.  \nMake your polygons out of \"void\" and completely surround your building \nwith a fence as high as the top of the roof.  You might get another \nartifact from this, though, which will be the unexpected appearance of \na bright line right near the mkillum fence, even though the fence \nitself will be otherwise invisible.  I'm not sure how to avoid this.\n\n\nDo you really want to see the spill light on the surroundings?  \nTypically, moonlight would drown this out.  If you added a moon, you \nmight not even notice your splotches anymore.  You could also exclude \nthe surrounding material using the -ae option.  You won't get the spill \nlight anymore, but the splotches would be gone with it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001192.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001192", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
