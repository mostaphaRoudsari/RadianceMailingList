Could you test this by writing out your rendering from \nrview using the \"write test.pic\" and displaying the output?  If it has \nsimilar artifacts to what you're seeing from rpict, then it must be in \nthe RGBE color conversion/display somewhere.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/000246.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000246", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
