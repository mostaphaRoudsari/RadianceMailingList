In fact, you would have to rewrite a bit of code to \ndo this -- a macro change is not enough.  Something more like a loop at \nline 276, where agaussamp() is called would be necessary.\n\n\nAnother thing to try is the -m option of pfilt.  Have you tried this, \nyet?  This option may reduce the appearance of specular noise by \nblurring these samples more widely.  Play around with some different \nvalues -- start at 0.25 and reduce down as low as 0.05 to see the \neffect.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/000250.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000250", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
