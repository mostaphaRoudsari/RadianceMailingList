The formulas in the previous section (5.1.13) \nare correct, but the next section neglects the 179 lumens/watt scaling. \n  We apologize for this oversight.\n\n\nRegarding the best way to get correct colors, I strongly encourage you \nto read the paper I coauthored at last year's Eurographics Workshop on \nRendering, which you can find here:\n\n\n\thttp://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/\n\n\nThis explains how you really want to convolve the source spectrum with \nthe surface reflectance spectra and white balance the results.  Without \nsuch a technique, you are better off simply using white light sources, \neven when you know they are not truly white.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001202.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001202", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
