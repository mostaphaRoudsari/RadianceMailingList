The room\nfaces south, and I am evaluating them through daylight\nglare index (dgi).\n\n\nTo give more details, the room measures 8x12 meters, with a\nceiling height of 2.70 meters. The window is 8x1.70m\n(placed on the 8m side).\n\n\nThe materials: ceiling: brushed aluminium (r=80%), walls:\nbeige (r=65%) and floor: blue (r=20%). These reflectances\nwere taken from recommendations from literature. \n\n\nThe light shelf has a length of 1m and is also made from\nbrushed aluminium and is placed 2.1 meters from the floor.\n(half is inside the room and half outside).\n\n\nI generated pictures with winrview, both looking into the\nwindow and looking sideways, and then used the two main\nglare routines available (findglare and glarendx). \n\n\nAccording to other studies (including those of people who\nhave used Radiance) the lightshelf should have a lower\nglare index than the room without any addition, but to my\nsurprise and in the two picture cases, it is the opposite!\n(absolute illuminance levels are OK, though)\n\n\nIn the beggining I thought that my ceiling was too specular\n(50%) but then I changed it to another with similar\nreflectance but no specularity... and the results are still\nthe same!\n\n\nWhat could be wrong?\n\n\nCarlos\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nInformaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y Am\u00e9rica Latina, en Yahoo!
