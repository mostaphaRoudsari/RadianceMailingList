You'll want to run, don't walk, to this website:\nhttp://www.ise.fhg.de/alt-aber-aktiv/radiance/photon-map/\n\n\nAFAIK, this is no longer being actively developed, but the program's \nauthor does lurk the hallowed halls of this mailing list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001207.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001207", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
