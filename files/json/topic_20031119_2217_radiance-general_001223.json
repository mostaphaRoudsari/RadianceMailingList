You can use it to make\nyour first tests.\n\n\nI hope that you download and try it, report bugs and send\nsuggestions about how to improve it.\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Anselmo\npisuke@libero.it\nanselmo@dream.unipa.it\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001223.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001223", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo"}
