I need more coffee this \nmorning before I fully digest all the numbers there, but one statement \nat the end bears comment:\n\n\n\"One thing to consider is that the camera has a built-in bracketing \noption that can take up to 5 images, with up to 1 stop increments. If \nthe scene has high contrast, this can be insufficient to capture the \nwhole range, so manual set up might be needed.\"\n\n\nI'm actually looking to buy a new camera for the office so that we can \nuse HDR photography for survey work, mostly lower contrast stuff.  But \nI'm wondering, what is the contrast threshold where you would need to go \nmanual?  I'm looking at the Canon digital rebel, which only does the \nthree shot autobracket but can separate each exposure by two stops. \nGreg Ward & I discussed this off-list and he said that that is \nsufficient for what I'm looking to do.  But I assume you're talking \nabout much higher contrast scenes, such as landscapes with direct sun, \nthat would require a manual exposure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001231.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001231", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
