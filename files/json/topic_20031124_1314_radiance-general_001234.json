However, Francesco Anselmo has created a \nbunch of pre-made packages for radiance, including one that uses the \nphoton map.  Head on over to:\n\n\nhttp://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/02.php\n\n\n... for details.  They are based on the official release, but if you \nwanna get started with the photon map and are new to installing & \ncompiling and LINUXing in general, these may be a good way to get your \nfeet wet.  Good luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001234.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001234", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
