The engine under the bonnet is Greg's hdrgen (thanks Greg!). \nYou may upload up to 9 JPEG images, totalling 5MB. The results you get \nback are a RADIANCE image and a false colour JPEG.\n\n\nFor now, you can only hit it with the default option. No command-line \nswitches are implemented yet. When the future of hdrgen becomes clear, \nwe will implement more sophisticated control over the HDR generation.\n\n\nIt's an old K6-II 500 box, so be patient.\n\n\nThere are also some web pages to go with it giving some theory of HDR \nand a list of software and cameras that are suitable. Please email me \nwith the details of your camera (bracketing, exposure correction etc.), \nso we build up a repository of information.\n\n\nWe'd be grateful for any other feedback, too\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001237.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001237", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
