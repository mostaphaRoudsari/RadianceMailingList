I'm sure it doesn't have anything to do \nwith the octree or the -x and -y options or where they appear.  Does \nrpiece die right away, or only after it's done some work?  What \nmachine(s) are you running on?  Rpiece talks to its rpict process over \na standard Unix pipe/socket, which should be reliable.  I'm quite \npuzzled by this error -- has anyone else on the list gotten this before?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-November/001244.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001244", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
