He is interested in putting \ntogether a team of people that would be based out of London to provide \nprevisualization services for US movie productions taking place in the \nUK and possibly elsewhere in Europe. He would be interested in talking \nwith people who have experience with Maya and/or Softimage. Preferably \nwith 3D modeling experience with either of these tools and ideally with \nmodeling and animation experience. The one caveat is that people would \nneed to be from the UK or elsewhere in Europe. If you are interested \nplease send an inquiry to:\n\n\ninfo@proof-inc.com <mailto:info@proof-inc.com>\n\n\nPlease feel free to reference this posting if you wish.
