It says \"e.g. images\" not \"just images\" . Quote:\n\n\n    Steps to install Radiance from source:\n\n\n       1. download one CVS tar ball (stable or pre-release version)\n       2. download tar ball of auxilary files\n       3. unpack both tar balls (unpacks to directory /ray/) : |gunzip <\n          /file/ | tar xf -|\n       4. |cd ray; makeall install|\n\n\nLet me know how the clearity of that could be enhanced and I add it.\nThe reason to split is that the \"aux\" files don't change as frequently \nas some parts of the source do. So, to be updated, folks just need the \nnightly \"HEAD\" version and not the whole bunch. (In fact only the diff \npatches are needed for those still behind a slow modem line).\n\n\n> Radiance installs and works fine - except.. missing all the useful \n> stuff such as 'pfilt' 'pcond', and a zillion other goodies all in the \n> rad3R5supp.tar.gz - but this doesn't have an install program.\n>\n> OK so when the 2 downloads are unpacked i have 2 directories 'ray' and \n> ' ray1' (auxilary files). \n\n\nThey both unpack into a subdir 'ray' . Your \"ray1\" is generated by your \ndownload/unpack program, presumably to intelligently avoid cluttering \nthe already existing subdir 'ray' .\n\n\n> Almost seems as though I need to go through ray1 and shift the various \n> programs across to their corresponding directory in ray.
