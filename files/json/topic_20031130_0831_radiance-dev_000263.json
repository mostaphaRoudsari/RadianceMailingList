I started looking \nthrough Roland's docs a year ago, and never got back to it.  I simply \nhaven't had time to play with it, and I don't see the time appearing \nanywhere in the immediate future.\n\n\nIf the photon map had been implemented as a mkillum substitute, i.e., a \nseparate program that creates light sources for Radiance, there would \nbe no hesitation to include it in the main distribution.  In that case, \nthere would have been no risk whatsoever to the renderer, and it \nwouldn't have affected any of the rendering options.  However, my \nunderstanding is that the photon map has been folded right into the \nmain rendering code, with quite a few new options associated with its \nuse.  This makes it critical to do a fitness evaluation before we fold \nit into the main source, and that requires testing.\n\n\nWe need to take a very careful look at this module's affect on the code \nas well as the rendering process -- does it support all material types \n(or at least do something reasonable with the types it doesn't \nsupport)?  Does it place any restrictions on light sources?  \nParticipating media?  How does it behave when the geometry gets \ncomplex?  Does it burden or otherwise affect the calculation when it is \nswitched off?  Do we get the same results or nearly the same under all \nimportant circumstances?\n\n\nThese concerns must be answered, and I'm sure Roland can answer some of \nthem.  For other concerns, I'll just have to pour over the source code \nand test it and test it.  It would be very helpful to me if Roland and \nI could get together and run through everything, but that hasn't \nhappened, and e-mail gets mixed in with all the other activities we \nhave going on, making communication slow and difficult.\n\n\nI really appreciate the efforts Roland has put forth to get this out, \nand to keep it updated with the latest source changes on our end.  I \nknow this is no small task, and it feels cruel to make new releases \nwithout incorporating his changes, because it just means more work for \nhim without any real benefit.\n\n\nIt would help me to hear from users who have successfully applied the \nphoton map.  I'd like to see how it helped them and hear what they have \nto say about it, on the list or off.  Theoretical discussions and \npeople saying this is a \"good idea\" are useful only up to a point.  \nReal experience is what matters, and that's what I need to hear from \npeople.  I have not used the photon map myself at this point, so I have \nno direct experience of my own.\n\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-November/000263.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000263", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
