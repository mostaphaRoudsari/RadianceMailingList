What is the status of this effort?\n\n\n\n\nI have played around with the unit testing framework included\nwith newer Python versions a while ago, and created a handful of\ntests for some of the auxiliary binaries. This approach has the\nadvantage to be completely platform-independent. Therefore I can\nnow confidently say that my current Windows binaries for cnt, ev,\ngenbeads, getinfo, histo, lam, ttyimage, and xform behave\naccording to their specification.\n\n\nFor that purpose, I wrote several comparison functions trying to\nmake sense of certain classes of text data (eg. file headers and\nscene descriptions). Those comparisons allow for differences in\nwhitespace, and for rounding errors in floating point tokens.\nI found that even small image files can be reasonably compared,\nby picking a few arbitrary lines out of the output from ttyimage.\n\n\nAs it looks, the difficulty is not so much in the testing method,\nnor in writing the actual tests. Both of those are very easy.\nThe real challenge will be coming up with good examples and test\ncases that really cover the critical borderline cases in each\nprogram to be tested. Help from as many people as possible will\nbe required to reach a reasonably complete coverage.\n\n\nI can check the current state into CVS for people to look at it.\nRight now it's located in a directory \"test\" (and subdirectories)\ndirectly under ray, but could be moved elsewhere if someone has a\nbetter idea.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000269.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000269", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
