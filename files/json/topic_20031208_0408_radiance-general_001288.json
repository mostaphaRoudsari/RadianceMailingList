{"topic": "Renaming \"rview\"", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "December 08, 2003 at 04:08AM", "body": "--Apple-Mail-18-236316046\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n\tcharset=US-ASCII;\n\tformat=flowed\n\n\nI only had a few responses to my request to run \"radcollisions.csh\" on \ndifferent machines.  If you missed this message and are still willing \nto help, I have attached the script (slightly modified) to look for \ncommand name conflicts between Radiance on your machine.  This will \nhelp me determine what command need renaming for the next release.\n\n\nIt seems certain that we need to rename \"rview,\" and from the responses \nI received, also \"gencat,\" \"lam,\" \"neat,\" and \"calc.\"  Here are my \nsuggestions for these others, along with my reasoning:\n\n\n\t\"gencat\" -> \"gencatenary\"\n\n\nThis is a little-used, optional generator for catenaries.  I see \nnothing against making the name longer and more explicit.  I don't \nthink anyone expected it to generate a feline, but I imagine quite a \nfew users wondered what the heck it did generate, as there's no man \npage for it.  (Saba Roufchaie wrote this little gem, and I find it \ninvaluable for making certain objects, like hanging chains and ropes.)\n\n\n\t\"lam\" -> \"rlam\"\n\n\nThe other Unix program called \"lam\" fulfills the same function with a \ndifferent syntax, and isn't found on all systems, so we can't rely on \nit as a replacement.  I refer to it in a bunch of my C-shell scripts, \nwhich of course will be updated with the new release to contain the new \nname.  (FYI, the \"rlam\" is meant to stand for \"record laminator,\" not \n\"Radiance laminator,\" since it isn't a function specific to the needs \nof Radiance in any way.)\n\n\n\t\"calc\" -> \"icalc\"\n\n\nCalc is a very useful, interactive version of rcalc, and I don't want \nto lose it or make it's name harder to remember or much longer to type. \n  If anyone has a better idea, I'm all ears.\n\n\n\t\"neat\" -> \"neaten\"\n\n\nI also thought to rename it to \"tidy,\" but that seemed a too big change \nfor an obscure little utility.  If you've never checked this one out, \nyou might give it a look.  I thought it was a cute little program, \nwhich is how I named it.\n\n\nThis brings us to the biggie, renaming \"rview.\"  This is a tough one, \nbecause it's a frequently used command, and one of the first commands \nissued by new users as well.  Besides \"rad\" and \"objview,\" I probably \ntype \"rview\" more than any other Radiance command.  Making it longer \nwould be annoying, but not terrible because by the time you've typed in \na few arguments, the finger-investment in the command name itself drops \nto insignificance.  At the same time, the tendency towards long \ncommands makes it that much worse to alter its name, because it means \nthat you'll have to start all over again when you end up opening \"vim\" \nby mistake in the next Radiance release.\n\n\nI'm thinking we'll want to include a symbolic link from the new name \nback to \"rview,\" for two reasons.  First, old users like me are going \nto have trouble with whatever we name it to because \"rview\" has become \nso familiar to my fingers that they type it automatically.  Second, \n\"Rendering with Radiance\" and all the other documentation that's \nfloating about has only \"rview\" in it and will probably never be \nupdated with the new command name unless Radiance somehow outlasts us \nall...  I'm not particularly concerned about hiding people's use of \nvim's \"rview\" link, since they can also type \"rvim,\" \"rgvim,\" or \n\"rgview\" to get exactly the same behavior, and it's not a behavior most \nusers would want, anyway.  (For the lucky users who don't have vim on \ntheir system, I can tell you that \"rvim\" is a restricted version \nprohibiting shell escapes for calling scripts and programs that provide \nan editor for untrustworthy users.  As such, it's probably always \nexecuted by its explicit path as a security measure, so there would \nnever have been a conflict if it had been put somewhere else, like \n/usr/etc -- or /dev/null!)  Vim is such a command-name hog -- here are \nthe other names linked to it:\n\n\n        vi\n        ex\n        view\n        gvim gview\n\n\nThe first three are historical and therefore expected.  Why they had to \nadd six other links is beyond me, especially when only two of them have \nany different functionality.  Grrrr....\n\n\nOK, finally to the subject of this message, which is coming up with a \nnew name for an old friend.  Below are listed some numbered \nalternatives.  I want you to write back with your favorite (pick just \none, please) and explain your reasoning.  Consider it a chance to \ncontribute to the next release even if you've never written a line of C \ncode.  Here are the candidates.\n\n\n1.\t\"rvu\"\n\n\nPossibly my favorite, because it's short and unique, and if you say the \nletters, you get back the original.\n\n\n2.\t\"radview\"\n\n\nI'm less fond of this one, mostly because it's longer, but also because \nit makes it sound like it's a subcommand of \"rad,\" which it's not.\n\n\n3.\t\"rviewer\"\n\n\nThis is better, because it stays close to the original meaning of the \ncommand, which is \"ray viewer,\" and also has the two extra letters \nadded at the end rather than the beginning, so you can remember the new \ncommand name at the last minute, right as your fingers are leaving the \nword and saying, \"Hey -- you forgot something!\"\n\n\n4.\t\"radiance_viewer_86FQ19GZ15\"\n\n\nGuaranteed never to have (Alias to \"r\" in your ~/.cshrc file.)\n\n\n5.\t\"your_name_here\"\n\n\nYour own suggestion if you don't like any of the others.  (Not really \nyour personal moniker -- we aren't naming the command after you, \nsorry.)\n\n\nWell, those are my ideas.  They're all included in the new \n\"radcollisions.csh\" attached to this message.  If you haven't run it on \nyour system yet, please do so and send me the output.  It would be a \nreal shame to rename a command to conflict with yet another Unix \nprogram, so even if you ran the last one, please indulge me again.  (Do \nit quickly, before \"vim\" takes over the world!)\n\n\nAnd thanks!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n--Apple-Mail-18-236316046\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tx-unix-mode=0755;\n\tname=\"radcollisions.csh\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=radcollisions.csh\n\n\n#!/bin/csh -f\n# Determine executable name collisions with Radiance 3.5\n# Assume no one else has a program named this:\necho path was \\( $path \\)\nset testp=macbethcal\nwhile (1)\n\tset mbc=`which $testp`\n\tif ( $status ) then\n\t\tbreak\n\tendif\n\tset radp=\"$mbc:h\"\n\tset newp=\"\"\n\tforeach i ($path:q)\n\t\tif (\"$i\" != \"$radp\") then\n\t\t\tset newp=($newp:q \"$i\")\n\t\tendif\n\tend\n\tset path=($newp:q)\nend\necho path changed to \\( $path \\)\necho Conflicting executables on `uname -a`\nforeach i ( 3ds2mgf arch2rad bgraph calc cnt compamb cv dayfact \\\ndebugcal dev dgraph dmake ev falsecolor findglare gcomp genbackg \\\ngenblinds genbox gencat genclock genprism genrev genrhgrid gensky \\\ngensurf genworm getbbox getinfo glare glarendx glaze glrad histo \\\nies2rad igraph lam lampcolor lookamb macbethcal markpath meta2tga \\\nmgf2inv mgf2meta mgf2rad mgfilt mkillum neat nff2rad normpat \\\nnormtiff obj2mesh obj2rad objline objpict objview oconv oki20 \\\noki20c pcomb pcompos pcond pcwarp pdelta pdfblur pexpand pextrem \\\npfilt pflip phisto pinterp plot4 plotin pmblur protate psign psmeta \\\npsort pvalue ra_avs ra_bn ra_gif ra_hexbit ra_pict ra_ppm ra_pr \\\nra_pr24 ra_ps ra_rgbe ra_t16 ra_t8 ra_tiff ra_xyze rad rad2mgf \\\nraddepend ranimate ranimove rcalc replmarks rhcopy rhinfo rholo \\\nrhoptimize rhpict rlux rmake rpict rpiece rtrace rview tabfunc \\\nthf2rad tmesh2rad total trad ttyimage vinfo vwrays vwright \\\nx11meta xform xglaresrc ximage xshowtrace xyzimage \\\ngencatenary rlam icalc neaten rvu radview rviewer)\n\tset conflict=`which $i`\n\tif (! $status ) then\n\t\techo $conflict\n\tendif\nend\n\n\n--Apple-Mail-18-236316046--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001288.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001288", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
