Why not take the chance and be one  :-) , this is no shame, \nothers do it, too. ( remember that you live in the worlds most powerful \ndictatorship, Mr. Bush didn't win the elections but still somehow \nmanoeuvered himself into the Oral  - sorry, different story - Oval Office )\n\n\njust some thoughts on it-\n1) There has to be one - or a very small group - who sets the \nguidelines, otherwise things will fall apart sooner or later.  But this \ncan make it difficult for volunteers.  I compare it with my artwork, I \nnever got really big payment, but I only did what I wanted, so it was OK \nwith me. But if I shall fulfill someone else's ideas just for free, hmm, \nwell, that's close to slavery. Wasn't it Abraham Lincoln who forbade this?  \n\n\n2) The engineering/design firms mentioned make lots of bucks with their \nconsulting projects (Jack, Rob's Boss or the guys from Arup probably \nwill correct me here on the 'lots'...) but don't need to pay a cent for \nthe software. This is NOT meant to blame anyone. Its the other way, \ngenerally businessmen are straightforward and realistic, so they might \neven prefer paying some acceptable price for a guaranteed stable version \nincluding support instead of anything free, but 'experimental', \nsometimes working and sometimes not. (OK, maybe I'm too optimistic ...) \nBut I'm a realist, too. See point 1 ...\n\n\n3) LBNL has losened its grip, the software is now open source, it \ndoesn't sound as if they are willing to spend much time on it anymore. \nBut to assure if any of the possible new developments eligible for \nintegration doesn't taint the program and drags the name into the dirt \nis a tedious job and needs a considerable amount of time, too. Currently \nit seems that poor Greg has to do it for free, (so he's a dictator and a \nvolunteer in one person)\n\n\n.......\n\n\nThis are only some organisatorial side-topics. There's of course more to \nsay, but  I think I better not open another can of worms and discuss \ndifferent ideas and possible strategies concerning the addon and its \nintegration itself (separate/connected to the core, etc., etc.). There's \nonly one solution available right now anyway.\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000291.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000291", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer"}
