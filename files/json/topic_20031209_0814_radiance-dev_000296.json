I'm not into that topic in detail, but it\nseems to make sense to have the same language in both places,\nso we should probably update the build scripts.\n\n\n\n\n> Secondly the makeall file has a \"phone home\" function wich i think is\n> normally only something for spyware/adware like programs and not for\n> opensource projects.

We're not monitoring\nyour surfing habits or anything...\n\n\nI have a hard time seeing what kind of data protection problems\nthe transmission of the following information could cause\n(together with your e-mail address):\n\n\n  char VersionID[]=\"RADIANCE 3.6a lastmod Mon Nov 17 21:30:59 CET\n    2003 by gm on local\";\n\n\nOn the other hand, I have no idea how useful the data collected\nlike this over the years at LBNL really is. I think it *was*\nuseful at one time, in order to justify funding. Since funding\nout of their regular budget has stopped long ago, and a growing\nnumber of users either download Radiance in binary form or use\none of the available Windows versions, it's probably not as\nhelpful anymore today. I certainly wouldn't miss this \"feature\"\nif it went away.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000296.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000296", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
