Finally, I got the glare simulations\nrunning, by changing view point, type of view (-vta -vh 360\n-vv 360), materials, etc.\n\u00a0\nThe view now looks towards the window, which is double\nglazing and oriented to the south.\n\n\nIn some cases, however, findglare does not identify a glare\nsource even after setting a threshold manually or\noverriding the absorption of small sources. This results in\nDGI indexes of \"0\" when is obvious they are not such...\n\n\nThe threshold was set using a routine by R. Compagnon\nadapted from Hopkinson.\n\n\nWhat can be done in those cases?\n\n\nCarlos Ochoa\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nInformaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y Am\u00e9rica Latina, en Yahoo!
