{"topic": "Quo Vadis Radiance - devotion, dollars, development", "category": "radiance-dev", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Carsten Bauer", "created_at": "December 10, 2003 at 11:01PM", "body": "Hi all,\n\n\nthe feedback is quite overwhelming, I try to keep track of all points....\n\n\nOK, one more time the money thing :-). Talking about money always \nproduces anger, so lets cool down again. No, Jack, no, I don't even \nimplicitely blame you or others. I can take myself as example. Funding \nfor Radiance from government/institutes was originally justified with a \npolitical background, the concern for the enviromment, promoting energy \nefficient lighting/daylighting etc. . Apparently  (thanx to Chas for the \ncomprehensive historical background) it was Greg who made much more out \nof it then intended and was able to smuggle it out to the public. And \nnow this tool is used in a wide range of commercial applications. But, \nwhy should the US DOE have any interest in supporting e.g. me in getting \nincredibly rich by making nice images of german architecture projects?\nThats why I simply made some hypothetical thoughts about other \n(commercial )ways of financing software development. Nothing more, \nnothing less.\nIn other words, if Greg and Peter and Schorsch now come together and \nstart up a company (the may call it Lightcosoft) and sell the current \nstuff as 'Radiows 3000 NT', would someone buy it? I imagine that it's \ntoo late now for that step. People have accustomed to the things. The \nfolks complain like mad about Autode$k and Microsoft, but at the same \ntime keep on buying their products. On the other hand,  everyone praises \nRadiance, but theres no money for development. Either I miss some \nimportant  point or things are really that strange. \n\n\nNow forget about the money. There are other things in life, too, and if \nyou hop into the coffin, you can't take anything with you anyway. \nCertainly there is much enthusiasm involved when people deal with \nRadiance, either on the development side or on the users side. But if \nthings don't move or hang around with unclear status or direction, every \nenthusiasm will wear out sooner or later. I made an interesting \nobservation (quite generally I have learned an awful lot from this \ncurrent discussion): Jack wrote that he once tested the direct cache but \ndidn't find it suitable  (in the present form) for his working \nenvironment. On reading this I noticed that  this was the *first* \nfeedback at all I've got so far about if or if not  this little hack is \nof any use for people outside the few square meters of my flat. I'm not \nnaive, so I know that this is quite normal, and others face the same \nproblem, but it is simply totally inefficient. If an idea proves \nuseless, the sooner one abandons it and looks for something new, the \nbetter, if it proves helpful, the sooner a solid version emerges out of \na first test prototype, the better. I dare say that even Greg would have \ndifficulties when developing something without any feedback from the \nusers side. Take this little example as one reason why I kicked off the \ndiscussion about some form of coordinating the development.\n\n\nAnd as we speak of development: from the repeatedly appearing statements \nin Gregs answers I assume that he is not reaaaallllllly overwhelmingly \nenthusiatic about modifications which mess with the core (the radius of \nthe core has of course yet to be defined). Let me simplify it (please \ncorrect me if its oversimplified :-) ): \"Do what you want, develop like \nmad, but make it completely separable, don't touch the core!!!\" I have \nno problem at all accepting this, in fact that's just Gregs copyright \nfor the whole stuff. But at the same time I have doubts if that is \nphysically realistic. I don't need to always speak of pmap or dc here,  \nwhen I take a look at Jacks whishlist I find many topics calling for \nquite comprehensive modifications. So once again the same question: to \ndevelop or not develop ? One spontaneous solution to the problem (which \n will secure a good sleep for Greg) would be a new name for a Radiance \nwhich is not Radiance anymore because of substantial internal changes.\n\n\n-Carsten\n\n\nPS: btw, just one more direct answer to Jack:  the idea of different \nexecutable-names is a straightforward and feasable way, it  is easy to \nimplement into rad with an additional switch for specifying the one to \ncall. At least I do it exactly that way for my work here.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000309.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000309", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer"}
