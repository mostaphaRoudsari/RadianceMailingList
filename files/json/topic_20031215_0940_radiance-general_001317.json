However, I seem to be running into a different type of \nresolution mismatch problem right now.\n\n\nI am venturing into the world of parallel processing on a dual G5 \nMacintosh, and my first invocation of rpiece works fine.\n\n\nrpiece -X 5 -Y 5 -F b_b_b_sync -o b_b_b_1_indirect_plan.pic -PP \nb_b_b.pst -af b_b_b.amb -t 600 -vf ../views/plan.vf -dt 0.05 -dc 0.10 \n-ds 0.01 -dj 0.6 -dr 3 -dp 4096 -st 0.01 -sj 1 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -aw 1 \n-ab 2 ad 2048 -as 1024 --aa 0.05 -ar 256 -aE ../ambient_exclude -x 500 \n-y 500 -ms 2.7 -lr 12 -lw 0.0005 -ps 1 -pt 0.04 -e b_b_b.out b_b_b.oct \n&\n\n\nHowever, when I try to start the second process\n\n\nrpiece -F b_b_b_sync -o b_b_b_1_indirect_plan.pic -PP b_b_b.pst \nb_b_b.oct &\n\n\nI get the error message\n\n\nrpiece: resolution mismatch on file \"b_b_b_1_indirect_plan.pic\n\n\nI tried adjusting the -X -Y and -x -y parameters, but the same thing \nhappened.  Just out of curiosity, I also tried adjusting the -av and \n-aw to 0, and the same results.\n\n\n\n\nI am certain that this is not a problem with a limit on the available \nresource.  The machine has 1.5GB of memory.\n\n\nAny hints as to what could be wrong?\n\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001317.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001317", "created_by": "John_S._An"}
