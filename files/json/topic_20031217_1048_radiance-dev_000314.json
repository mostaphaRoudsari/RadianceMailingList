Rtrace doesn't have any concept of\npixels, let alone something like \"the next pixel to the right\npoints x degrees away from this one\".\n\n\nTo make this work with rtrace, there would have to be a way to\nfeed it this information seperately. I'm not sure if a global\nparameter would be enough, because I think it can vary quite a\nbit eg. for wide angle perspectives. On the other hand, allowing\na seventh value with each line of input might be a non-trivial\nchange.\n\n\nIn any case, I agree that this would be a very useful variable.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2003-December/000314.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000314", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
