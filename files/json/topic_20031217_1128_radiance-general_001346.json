If you use the 'c' command, it reports the RGB from the \nfile without exposure correction.  The \"right\" value in terms of \nabsolute numbers is the one reported by the 'l' command.  The one \nreported by 'c' is what is actually at that point in the image, which \nhas been premultiplied by the value(s) reported by getinfo.\n\n\nTo save an image without changing it's exposure in rview, set 'e =1' \nprior to writing it out.  Rpict never adjusts the exposure of its \noutput -- you have to run pfilt yourself for that.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001346.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001346", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
