I appreciate the effort it takes \nto write up these summaries, but they will live in the \nradiance-online.org archive, fully searchable, for all current and \nfuture Radiance strugglers.  It's all these discussions that make \nPeter's efforts so worthwhile.\n\n\nOf course, having four hot rod computers, even it they don't like \ntalking to each other, is not such a bad problem to have, John. ;-) \nMaybe someday I'll have me one o' them there dual G5s, and I'll recall \nthis thread and really have some fun!  Good luck with this.  Keep us posted.\n\n\nThis is as good a time as any to wish my Radiance family a happy holiday \nseason.  So, uh, HAPPY HOLIDAYS, EVERYONE!!  May the coming year be \nfilled with populated ambient caches, blotch-free images, and valid \nresults.  =8-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-December/001359.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001359", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
