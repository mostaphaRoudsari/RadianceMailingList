It seems that ecalloc() is only called for one \npurpose, which is to allocate nodes in the .cal expression parse tree.  \nThis is a very small amount of memory, so either you just happened to \nrun out of memory when reading in a new .cal file or else it was caught \nin a loop reading the .cal file in over and over again.\n\n\nI don't see how the changes I made to the source routines could be \naffecting this, unless you have so many light sources that it gobbled \nup all your VM before loading in the.cal file.  That seems incredibly \nunlikely, since it would have failed on a larger memory request, and \nyou would need over 250,000 light sources to use up a GByte of RAM.\n\n\nMaybe Schorch has some ideas -- he also checked in a bunch of changes, \nthough they were all ANSIfication fixes that shouldn't have caused \nproblems.\n\n\nCan you rerun the process, just to see if it dies at the same point?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000329.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000329", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
