The installation worked fine on several Suse 7.2 machines. \n The problem on the 8.2 machines was related to libtiff, specifically \nwhen using rmake to compile makefile from makefile.in in the directory \nraysource/px/tiff/ .  It seems line 31 and several other lines get \ngarbled and essentially are not commented out anymore.  Line 31 just \ncontains a bunch of version information.  \n\n\nThe relevant differences noted between Suse 8.2 and Suse 7.2 was with \nthe libtiff version and the gcc version.\n\n\nSuse 7.2 has\nlibtiff 3.5.5-136\ngcc 2.95.3-52\n\n\nSuse 8.2 has\nlibtiff 3.5.7-204\ngcc3.3-23\n\n\nI read somewhere on this site that people were successful with libtiff \n3.5.7 and so that leads me to think the problem was with the version of gcc.\n\n\nJust wanted to report this problem to you all as Suse 7.2 is now several \nyears old and Suse 8.2 is also slightly outdated.  Is there any work \narounds we can take to get Radiance working on Suse8.2?  Most of the \nbinaries seemed to compile before this error, could we just execute the \nlast portion of the install script to move the binaries into the correct \nlocations, and what programs would we be missing if we did that? (ie. \nwhat programs are dependant on libtiff?)\n\n\nThanks in advance!\nZack\n\n\nPS Thanks Greg for the help in narrowing down this error!\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nStaff Engineer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-January/000332.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000332", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers"}
