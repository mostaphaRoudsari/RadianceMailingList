If this is still true, then no amount of \"-dj\" is going to help the situation that John is having.  I have run into this problem where the lack of source subdivisions on spheres cause some nasty side effects.  For example, I used a sphere to enclose the illuminating part of a torchiere.  The reflection on the polished floor appeared as if there was a ball of fire floating a few inches above the torchiere.  Other times, supporting geometry would not be illuminated correctly as it gets close to the illum sphere--similar to the problems John was describing.\n\n\nSo obviously, high on my wish list is adding illum spheres to the source sampling subdivision routines.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--0-1200146124-1073672931=:30845\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\n\n\n<DIV>Greg,</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>Can you confirm that Radiance still does not subdivide illum spheres during its source sampling routines?&nbsp; If this is still true, then no amount of \"-dj\" is going to help the situation that John is having.&nbsp; I have run into this&nbsp;problem where the lack of source subdivisions on spheres cause some nasty side effects.&nbsp; For example, I used a sphere to enclose the illuminating part of a torchiere.&nbsp; The reflection on the polished floor appeared as if there was a ball of fire floating a few inches&nbsp;above the torchiere.&nbsp; Other times, supporting geometry would not be illuminated correctly as it gets close to the illum sphere--similar to the problems John was describing.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>So obviously, high on my wish list is adding illum spheres to the source sampling subdivision routines.</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>-Chas</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n--0-1200146124-1073672931=:30845--\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001391.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001391", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich"}
