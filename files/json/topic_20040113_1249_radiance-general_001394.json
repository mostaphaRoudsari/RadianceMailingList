Say for example, I \nam modelling clear glazing that admits light monochromatically (I am \nnot concerned with colours, only illuminance values on a grid) at a transmittance of 80%\n(transmissivity \n0.871538), then the glazing description may look something like this (simple stuff);\n\n\n# glazing with a transmittance of 80%\nvoid glass window1\n0\n0\n3       0.871538 0.871538 0.871538\n\n\nI am going to parametrically change the transmittance at say 10% increments from 10% through to\n100%, hence I will simply change the rgb transmittance to the appropriate values.\n\n\nWhen I open up some of the files in the glazing library included with \nDesktop Radiance, most of them seem to include the BRTDfunc, for \nexample, the lbnl clear glass (glass6.rad).  The description looks \nlike this;\n\n\nvoid  glass       clear6_glass      \n0 \n0 \n3      0.85852      0.97582      0.95237                              \n\n\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc      clear6_front      \n10      \n      0.78802      0.89604      0.87443      \n      0.07011      0.0822      0.08231      \n      0 0 0 \n      .      \n0 \n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0      \n\n\nvoid       BRTDfunc      clear6_back      \n10      \n      0.78802      0.89604      0.87443      \n      0.07011      0.0822      0.08231      \n      0 0 0 \n.      \n0 \n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0      \n\n\nMy question is this.  To what extent will my simplified way of \ndescribing the transmittance affect the accuracy of my results?  I \ndon't completely understand the workings of the BRTDfunc (even after reading the manual page), and\nthink I \nwould have trouble measuring any variable of glazing other than \ntransmittance of the specimens I am sampling in the real world (Rendering with Radiance \ntalks briefly of measuring glazing transmittance, \nbut not things like reflectance.  I have just seen a citation for a paper by Peter Apian-Bennewitz\n(1994, Designing an Apparatus for mearuring Bidirectional..., Freiburg) who appears to be a\ncontributor on here that I am in the process of requesting from my library).\n\n\nI presume also that transmittance + reflectance (+ absorptance) of \nglazing can never exceed 1.  In Desktop Radiance, the description of \nGeneric clear glass lbnl (clear3.rad) states a transmittance of \n89.90% and a reflection of 82.0%.  Is my understanding fundementally \nwrong, or is this a typo?\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\nPhD researcher, Sheffield, United Kingdom.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001394.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001394", "created_by": "Daniel_Lash"}
