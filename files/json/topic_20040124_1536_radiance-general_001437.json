Function files took\nme a little while to understand anyways, but what I can't figure out\nis how to specify only a change in transmittance in a material.\n\n\n        mod transfunc id\n        2+ brtd funcfile transform\n        0\n        6+ red green blue rspec trans tspec A7 ..\n\n\nI'd like to render a mesh object in \"x-ray\" form, but visualizing\nits surface and not its volume. I'd like a material that diffuses\nand reflects no light, and transmits light based on the \"thickness\"\nof the surface (assuming that the object is a thin shell of fixed\nthickness). I'd like the transmittance to be something like\n1.0-(const/Rdot), but when I try the following:\n\n\n        void transfunc meshcolor\n        2 1.0-A5/Rdot .\n        0\n        6 0.5 0.5 0.5  1 0.66667 1\n\n\nI've tried several different values for the function, and everything\ngives me a totally opaque object, or an \"undefined function\" error.\nI'd like to get something like this:\n\n\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/vort3d/bd10/run168_first_sphere/burn1/run05/save_0053.jpg\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001437.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001437", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
