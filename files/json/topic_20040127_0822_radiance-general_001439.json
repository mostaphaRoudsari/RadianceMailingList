It seems that if you have a static scene and a\ndynamic view, then you use the OCTREE (say OCTREE= scene.oct) variable\nin the ranfile while the view variable and file contains all the\ndifferent views (one per frame).  However in my case I would have a\nstatic view and a dynamic octree.\n\n\nSay I have sky files; sky1.rad sky2.rad ... skyN.rad\n\n\nThen how would my ANIMATE variable look in the ranfile?  There is no\nexample in the man page.\n\n\nANIMATE= ???\n\n\nIf there is a more appropriate place to ask this type of question,\nplease let me know.  Thanks in advance if anyone can help out.\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\nWilliam Tao & Associates\nElectrical Project Engineer\n349 Marshall Avenue\nSuite 200\nWebster Groves, MO 63119\nv. 314.961.5252\nf.  314.961.5258\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001439.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001439", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
