It is an excellent conversion tool that \nwas optimized for 3DS export to the Radiance scene format. Ole, the last \ntime I heard from him, had stopped offering and developing the software. I \ndo have a copy that I can send to you. I do not believe that Ole would not \nmind me sending it to you. Before he closed his site, he had offered it for \nfree.
