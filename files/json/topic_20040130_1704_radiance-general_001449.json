Everything seems to be working, however I am\nhaving a hard time getting the exposures to work out.  Because my\ninterior space is mostly windows, my exposure varies in order to get the\nrenderings to look normal.  If I set the exposure to one value, then\nsome frames look great while others are way overexposed.  It seems that\nto correct this problem, a file with exposure settings can be\ndeveloped.\n\n\nHowever, I will have to go frame by frame and try and figure out what\nexposure settings might work in order to develop this file.  And if I\nmake 150 or so  images per animation like I am planning, this will be a\nvery tedious task to accomplish with rview.  I guess I can interpolate\nand guesstimate, but perhaps there is a better way of doing this? \nAnyone run into this issue before?\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\nmdelafuente@wmtao.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001449.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001449", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
