Maybe there's another limitation somewhere\nelse in the code, but I don't really expect so.\n\n\nThe other relevant factoid is that almost all non-whitespace\ncharacters are legal in identifiers. Just avoid 'single' and\n\"double\" quotes. Those are reserved because 3.6b needs them\naround file paths that contain whitespace characters (eg. to\nreference function files, particularly on Windows).\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001458.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001458", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
