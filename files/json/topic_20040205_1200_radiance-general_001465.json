Thanks for sharing this.  I \nmanaged to find a website for this product \n(http://www.thefarleyceiling.com/default.asp), but it is a bit thin on \ninfo.  From what I can tell, this is just a fabric panel.  Is this \ncorrect, or is part of the system the skylight well above the panel? \nEither way, judging from the photos on the website, is seems like a \nsimple job for plastic & trans (and illum sources!), to model this in \nRadiance.\n\n\nCan you share more info about this ceiling system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg@rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001465.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001465", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
