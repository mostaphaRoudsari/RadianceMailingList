It is not GPLed at the moment, and I won't \ngrant you the right to redistribute it now, because I want to get an \nidea if there is interest in this. If you have any comment about the \nproject, or questions, or proposals, or if you want to participate, \njust send me (private, not list-) mail.\n\n\nCU, Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
