If these were\ntransmittances it should have been (photopic average):\n\n\n0.265*tauR + 0.670*tauG + 0.065*tauB = \n0.265*0.930 + 0.670*0.916 + 0.065*0.847 = 0.840 (wrong!)\n\n\nbut it is instead:\n0.265*0.930 + 0.670*0.916 + 0.065*0.847 = 0.915 (indeed the transmissivity,\ncheck with the formula).\n\n\nSo I suppose it is exporting correctly. And you can use it directly into\nRadiance without converting the values.\nHope it is clear.\n\n\nRegards,\nAnnalisa.\n\n\n\n\n#\n# FileName= Activ2.lof\n# Product Name= Activ(tm) on Clear\n# NFRC ID= 9936\n# Manufacturer Name= Pilkington North America\n# Glazing Type= Coated\n# Coated Side= Front\n# Transmittance= 0.840\n# Front Reflectance= 0.150\n# Back Reflectance= 0.148\n# Thickness(mm)= 2.235\n# Appearance= Clear\n#\n\n\n\n\nvoid  glass       Activ2_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.930     0.916     0.847\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    Activ2_front\n10\n      0.127     0.153     0.212\n      0.854     0.841     0.778\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    Activ2_back\n10\n      0.124     0.152     0.208\n      0.854     0.841     0.778\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-February/001474.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001474", "created_by": "Annalisa_Simonella"}
