(The world is consistent! Great!)\n\n\nThen I read the binary file in (I have taken into account that the files \nwere generated on a big-endian machine and are now read on a \nlittle-endian machine).\nAnd: The numbers that you yield look reasonable, similar to what you \nwould expect, BUT  they are not the same, even though the binary and the \nascii file were generated from the very same pic-file.\n\n\nI looked at the minimum and the maximum values of either file, I \ncomputed the sum over all pixel values: they are just not the same! \n(just in case the matrix I deal with is in a different orientation)\n\n\nWHY???? Please help!\n\n\nThanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nAlexa\n\n\nP.S. yes, I could use ascii-files, but they are huge and it takes longer \nto read them in. So, that's why I want to store them as binaries.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDr. Alexa I.
