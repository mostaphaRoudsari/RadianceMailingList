I\nhave previous experience using Pov-Ray but I just\ncan't find documentation that describes exactly what\nthe view vector is or what the values mean. Can anyone\nhere either point me towards documentation that\ndescribes it or give me that crictical piece of\nknowledge that makes it obvious to someonme who knows\nalot of math?\n\n\nThanks for your time,\nTyler Riddle\n\n\n\n\n\"There are only 10 types of people in this world: Those who understand binary and those who don't.\"\n\n\naim: TheMastaSpice\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
