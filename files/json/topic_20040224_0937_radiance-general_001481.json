I have not really used these material types \nbefore. However there should be others in the group who can provide \nfeedback to you.\n\n\nIt is also possble the depending on how you breakdown your problem that \nthere are simpler ways to do what you want. For example what are the key \nissues of what you are trying to simulate and evaluate:\n\n\n    * properties of light pipe performance - then this probably requires\n      the use of photon mapping\n    * properties of prismatic glazing as enhancers of light distribution\n      - can this be seperated out from the light pipe and evaluated\n      using more classic techniques in standard radiance, in other words\n      can you make some estimates for light output from the side\n      apertures of the light pipe and thus remove the actual simulation\n      of the light pipe behavior?\n\n\nI expect you wil get other input, which I will look forward to reading \nmyself.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n\n\nPS: I have cross posted to radiance-general, to give the discussion \nwider input.\n\n\nAnthony J.
