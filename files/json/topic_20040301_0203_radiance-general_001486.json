With the \nintroduction of \"smart\" materials (that are able to exhibit different \nbehavior under different conditions) into the architectural context, \nI'd like to experiment with defining such a material.  The mixfunc \nmaterial seems promising in that it allows one surface to display two \ndifferent behaviors.  What I would like to achieve is to use an \n\"if-then\" condition to determine which of the two material properties \nshould be exhibited in the rendering.  More specifically, I'd like to \ndefine two different behaviors (rgb, reflectance, and transmittance), \nand use mixfunc to determine which one of the two behaviors will be \nused for the rendering (on a each pixel) along the surface depending \non,\n1. the angle of the light ray from the point of view to the surface \nnormal; and\n2. the angle of the light ray from the light source to the surface \nnormal\n\n\nIf this is possible, then would it be possible to eventually define \nmore than two behaviors (by modifying a mixfunc with another mixfunc) \nto get a more gradual gradient between the different behaviors?\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nJohn An\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001486.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001486", "created_by": "John_An"}
