I have written a conversion program myself. I based the \nmapping of patterns onto polygons on a cal file x2ruvmap.cal written by Ole \nLemming for Conrad. It does its job well but this cal file is fairly long \nand I think that it may be hampering performance. It seems the conversion of \nuv coordinates to barycentric coordinates for patterns is done at render \ntime rather than the file conversion stage. For hundreds of millions (if not \nbillions) of ray hits, this can be quite costly. Then again, I may be wrong. \nI have looked into tmesh.cal and I believe that the approach taken here is \nmuch more efficient. My goal is to utilize the approach and routines in the \nexisting source code to implement into my conversion program. I have done \nsome research through some of the source code and I have some questions.\n\n\nWhile looking through obj2rad.c, it is mentioned in a comment block that the \ntexture map indices were taken out. May I ask why? Do mapping of 2d images \non polygons work with obj2rad/obj2mesh? Also while looking through \nobj2rad.c, I noticed that there are steps to output a reversed triangle. It \nhas been my understanding that polygons in Radiance are 2 sided and as such, \nthey are visible on both sides. The only time I know when surface normal \norientation is critical is when setting up polygons for usage with mkillum \nfor mimicking windows and other apertures within a building. Why is it done \nhere?   As I looked through tmesh.c in the function comp_baryc, the order of \nthe vertices are rotated. Out of curiosity, why?\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nStore more e-mails with MSN Hotmail Extra Storage \u0096 4 plans to choose from! \nhttp://click.atdmt.com/AVE/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-March/000348.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000348", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
