Im using the mkillum lighting technique on the windows,\nbut I have some questions which I need to ask to be sure I'm approaching\nthe problem correctly..\n\n\nFirstly - Ive read a lot about the mkillum approach, so for stained\nglass I'm guessing I create an object that is textured glass material,\nand have the mkillum secondary source behind it? Shining through. This\npresumably will project the colours of the glass into the room?\n\n\nSecondly - You can see mkillum sources from the rear side, I'm guessing\nyou turn them off for renders of the outside of buildings looking at the\nwindows?\n\n\nSecondly - I'm really interested in the internal lighting, how bright\nthe inside will be at different times of day etc. When I render\ninternally with no av settings (rview), and set e to 1 is it bringing\nthe environment into a range that we can see? What im saying is, how do\nI know what settings to use to get the most realistic representation of\nwhat it would have been like to the human eye? I know this is a tricky\nproblem considering that the human eye adjusts to light. How can I\napproach this problem?\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\n(im new to this mailing list so go easy on me)\n\n\nJohn Sutherland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001513.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001513", "created_by": "John_Sutherland"}
