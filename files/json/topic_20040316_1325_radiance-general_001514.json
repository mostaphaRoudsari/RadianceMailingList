Rview is more used to get an idea about the \nviewpoint and direction, so you can select a good one before you start with \nthe real rendering using the rpict-command.  Rview is also convenient to get \na fast check on your space, to see if it is fully closed, ...  But if you \nreally want to get a good impression about the internal lighting,  rpict \nwill give a more accurate impression of what it would look like.  important \n: use the right sky and try to get a good idea about the surface-parameters \n( RGB, reflectance en roughness)  because if these are incorrect, the result \n( pic- or tif-file) will not give a good image of the lighted space.  see \nthe Radiance Reference Manuel for the rpict-parameters before you try to \nrender the structure.\n\n\nHope this helps a bit,\n\n\nkind regards,\n\n\nBirger Van den Brande\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001514.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001514", "created_by": "Birger_Van_den_Brande"}
