Internally when you look at the\nstained glass its good, looks pretty realistic, but when you go\nexternally, with the sky shining onto it, it looks really bad, the\ncolours are very washed and far to faint, the black between each section\nof glass is very light and it doesn't have that stained glass look at\nall. Anyone know of a solution to this problem? What I want is the black\nsections of my glass to not let light through, but in this case they do,\nand they aren't very dark at all. If there is not a solution , what\nwould be the easiest way to blag it? I could use a different material on\nthe windows for external renders but then it would be obviously not\nglass.
