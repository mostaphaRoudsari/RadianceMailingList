When modelling geometry does it matter if\nopaque (ie plastic) elements intersect?  I am modelling using autocad.  For example, say I am\nmodelling a 'waffle' type roof structure, to which a standard plastic material is to be added.  I\nhave drawn all the beams going in one direction.  For the beams cutting through this beam\nperpendicularly, do you;\n\n\na; draw individual small beams between the existing beams (no intersection, but alot more geometry\ndescription.  does this do anything to calculation times?)\n\n\nb; draw long beams cutting through the existing beams (much less geometry entry, but does the\nintersection result in inaccuracy/redundancy somehow?)\n\n\nc; does it matter?\n\n\nin RwR p.59, the simple vase case, primitives are intersected together, such that the 'interior' of\nthe vase is not as in 'real life'.  Given this, and as long as the exterior of the 'waffle' is\nlight tight, can I draw it with fewer but intersecting elements?\n\n\nMany thanks, this mailing list has been a very useful learning resource,\n\n\nDan Lash\nSheffield Hallam University, UK.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001541.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001541", "created_by": "Daniel_Lash"}
