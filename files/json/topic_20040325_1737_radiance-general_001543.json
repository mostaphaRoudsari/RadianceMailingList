I'm done with the \nmodellingphase using Autocad, and have succesfully converted the 3D-model to \na rad file.  When I try to run the oconv-command, I always get the following \nerror :\n\n\n\"The instruction at 00406033 referenced memory at 06060606\nThe memory could not be read from\"\n\n\nI simply can't get Radiance to make the .oct file, I tried to split the \nrad-file but that didn't work.\nI'm quiet sure it has something to do with memory shortage, but I'm not sure \nlet alone know what to do about it.\n\n\nIf anyone has got a solution for such a problem, please inform me about it.\n\n\nThank you in advance,\n\n\nBirger Van den Brande\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTest uw vaardigheden en win een MS Office pakket! \nhttp://www.msn.be/microsoft/funwithoffice/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-March/001543.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001543", "created_by": "Birger_Van_den_Brande"}
