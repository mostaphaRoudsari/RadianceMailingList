Thanks to\nyour active participation, we collected 185 valid responses from 27\ncountries. Key findings were:\n\n\n*\tsurvey participants worked predominantly on offices and schools \n\n\n*\ttools' complexity and insufficient documentation are weaknesses of\nexisting programs \n\n\n*\tself-training was the most common training method \n\n\n*\ttool usage is significantly higher during design development than\nduring schematic design \n\n\n*\tshading type and control are the most common design aspects\ninfluenced by daylighting analysis \n\n\n*\tover 50% of selected tools were RADIANCE based \n\n\nShould you be interested in the results of the survey, you can download a\nPDF file with the main findings from\n<http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/survey.html>\nhttp://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/survey.html.\n\n\nThanks to all of you who took the time to participate in the survey! \n\n\nYour thoughts and comments are welcome.
