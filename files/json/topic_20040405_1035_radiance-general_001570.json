The inside of the\nchapter house im modelling I would expect to be a little orangey as the\ntextures are orangy-ish colour. Which is what I get when I do a render\nthen run pcond -s, its too dark really for an unfiltered render:\n\n\nhttps://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/0j8_md0p1NAu1fdWB6pt8A7o/12hrinter\nnal-s.jpg\n\n\nBut when I run pcond -h the renders come out very grey, any idea why\nthis is? Is it correct, is it something to do with the light levels, or\ncontrast forcing it to grey?\n\n\nhttps://www.bris.ac.uk/fluff/u/js0754/2u4diWLd_7Kih_chtUlZTA7o/12hrinter\nnal-h.jpg\n\n\nIf it is meant to be like this then why? Any ideas\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001570.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001570", "created_by": "John_Sutherland"}
