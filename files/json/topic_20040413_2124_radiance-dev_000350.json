I am assuming that it has \nsomething to do with the fact that all object in Radiance are two sided and \nthis relates the surface normal orientation wrt the ray being traced. Then \nagain, I am probably wrong. Out of curiosity, if it is already known that \nall surface normal for faces are properly oriented (i.e. facing the viewer), \nis it necessary to calculate this value?\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch LIVE baseball games on your computer with MLB.TV, included with MSN \nPremium! \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/mlb&pgmarket=en-us/go/onm00200439ave/direct/01/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-April/000350.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000350", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
