I have noticed\nhowever, that no matter what changes I make to my\nmodel, the lowest illuminance reading I can generate\nanywhere inside a daylit room is between 150 and 200\nlux. For afternoon models where the sun is at a\nlow-angle, the core areas of my models should be below\n50 lux (from in-situ light measurements). I understand\nRadiance has trouble with low-angle sun simulations.\nBut when I look at my noon hour models (sun very\nhigh), I notice that my core readings are also all\naround 200 lux...seemingly unable to drop below 200\nlux. My false colour plots do show minimum extrema\nlower than 200 lux, and areas in direct shadow, are\nshown more blue (closer to 50 lux on my scale). From\nin-situ measurements at desk height, though, it would\nseem that the drop off of illuminance levels from the\nperimeter to the core of a room is not adequately\nrepresented in my Radiance models. Can anyone offer a\nsuggestion why my illuminance values, for the most\npart, bottom out at 200 lux?\n\n\nRegards,\nCaroline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
