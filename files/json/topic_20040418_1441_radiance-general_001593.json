I used spheres with radius 0.0075 which\nworked out RGB values of\n\n\nR=16.575\nG=5.240\nB=0\n\n\nFor the flames light material.( The base weightings of rgb for tallow\ncandle flame were R 0.759 G 0.240 B 0)\n\n\nFor a tallow candle, emitting 1 candela of light. When using these\nvalues my night renders look like this:\n\n\nhttp://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.sutherland/internaltallow-h.jpg\n\n\nWhich is not quite what I was expecting using pcond. I get the\nimpression my lighting values are too low? But the results aren't too\nbad, so I thought I'd try to illuminating of a manuscript.\n\n\nIn this next render I moved the candle right up close to the manuscript\n(its just off the bottom), but the illumination is not really enough to\nshift the book out of scotopic levels.\n\n\nhttp://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.sutherland/outputbook22hrtallow-h.jpg\n\n\nA false colour image shows they levels barely get above 1.5 lux\n\n\nhttp://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.sutherland/outputbook22hrtallow-hfalse\ncolor.jpg\n\n\nI thought id try a home experiment, I lit a candle in a pitch black room\nand moved a book varing distances away from the candle, and there was\nvery little scotopic vision even at a distance of about a metre away.\nWhen I do a render without the candles at night the falsecolour images\nshow very little increase in lux. Is lux a very sensitive scale? A small\ntiny increase in lux real life increases the visability a lot? But pcond\n's filter is not sensitive enough, and also the limitation of the\nmonitors contrast and lighting abilities not enough to show any\ndifference? So many questions!\n\n\nThe problem is that using the RGB lighting values suggested, they don't\nappear to be able to illuminate the manuscript to a reasonable looking\nlevel, even though in real life a candle could. Wheres my problem?\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001593.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001593", "created_by": "John_Sutherland"}
