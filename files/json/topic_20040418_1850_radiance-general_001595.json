Since then I've gone back and tried to clean up and\nimprove the animations (for marketing purposes) only I've run into what\nseems to be either a glitch or more likely a user error.  I'm using rad\nand ranimate to automate the process.\n\n\nMy rif file looks like this...\n\n\nEXPOSURE= 1\nDETAIL= H\nEYESEP= .225\nINDIRECT= 2\nmaterials= ./material/mat.rad\nOCTREE= ./octree/lobby_a.oct\nPENUMBRAS= T\nPICTURE= ./images/lobby\nQUALITY= H\nRESOLUTION= 512\nillum= ./scene/illums.rad\nscene= ./scene/ground.rad ./scene/floor.rad ./scene/ceiling.rad\n./scene/aluminum.rad\nscene= ./scene/brick_xy.rad ./scene/brick_xz.rad ./scene/brick_yz.rad\n./scene/brick_45.rad ./scene/brick_135.rad\nscene= ./scene/glaz_exterior.rad ./scene/glaz_interior.rad\n./scene/glass_door.rad ./scene/glaz_ripple.rad\nscene= ./scene/wall.rad ./scene/rug.rad ./scene/wood.rad\n./scene/wood_wall.rad\nscene= ./scene/steel.rad ./scene/slats1.rad ./scene/slats2.rad\n./scene/drapes.rad\nUP= Z\nVARIABILITY= H\nview= vw1 -vf ./views/v1.vp\nZONE= I 0 17 0 19 0 9\nrender= -t 10\n\n\nMy ran file looks like this...\n\n\nBASENAME= anim2/frame%03d\nDIRECTORY= anim2\nDISKSPACE= 500\nSTART= 1\nEND= 53\nhost= localhost\nINTERPOLATE= 0\nMBLUR= 0\nOVERSAMPLE= 3\nRESOLUTION= 512\nRSH= rsh\nRTRACE= F\nVIEWFILE= ./views/v1.vp\nANIMATE= genoctree_a.script\nEXPOSURE= ./exposure/exp_a_interpolated_15.rad\nRIF= lobby_a.rif\n\n\nAnd my octree generator looks like this...\n\n\nframe=$1\ntmp=sun.rad\ntime=`ev \"5.25+($frame/4)\"`\ngensky 3 21 $time +s -a 38.7 -o 90.5 -m 90 > $tmp\noconv -i ./octree/lobby_a1.oct -f $tmp sky.rad\nrm $tmp\n\n\nThe problem is that the illum.dat files are not being updated for each\nimage and considering the fact that the sky is changing for each frame,\nit seems to me like they should be.  Perhaps ranimate was really only\nmeant to deal with static lighting scenes with movable objects/camera\npositions?\n\n\nAny comments would be appreciated.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001595.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001595", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
