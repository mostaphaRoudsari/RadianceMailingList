No fancy links between them, and the text\nfiles are done as jpegs, but the info is there.\n\n\nI ran simulations of a 15m x 15m room. The west wall\nhas 4 windows and the north, south and east walls each\nhave 1 central window. I simulated December 21st in\nToronto for noon, 4pm and 6pm. According to other\nsoftware and my weather data, there is no sunlight at\n6pm on Dec21, and the sun is quite low, but not yet\nset at 4pm. I did not model any exterior obstructions.\n\n\nUsing the Desktop Radiance interface in AutoCAD I\ngenerated .rif files for the time/day selections\n(Radiance>Simulation>Camera...). Then in Command\nPrompt I performed RAD on the various .rif files.\n\n\nThe sky definitions all appear identical, except for\nthe time markers in the top line.\nThe .riff and sky.rad files are posted here:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Sky_and_Rif_files.jpg\n\n\nThe RAD command ran through my camera views\nsuccessfully, but generated some warnings:\nwarning - no light source found. Well of course, I\nhave no luminaires (as suggested in the Desktop\nRadiance FAQ), I am studying daylighting, so I presume\nI can move on despite this message.\nand\nwarning - aiming failure for light source\n\"softwaretest4_38.4.2\". Looking at the DesktopRadiance\nFAQ, online, there would not seem to be any reason for\nthis warning, based on the model I have drawn. No\nconcave items, no cylinders, no rings with holes, etc.\n\n\nThe entire script for my RAD run of Dec 21 at noon is\nposted here:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Rad_Script.jpg\napologies for the fuzziness.\n\n\nSo the resulting images are posted as follows:\nDecember 21, noon:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Dec21_12_ca6_images.jpg\nDecember 21, 4pm:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Dec21_16_ca6_images.jpg\nDecember 21, 6pm:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Dec21_18_ca6_images.jpg\nThe false color maps are generated within the winimage\nscreen (Analysis>False color>choose metric,\nilluminance, max=1000, intervals=10)\n\n\nNote the centre of the floor of the room (roughly the\ncentre of the floor area as I have cast my camera\nview) is near 200 lux in all three cases, even when\nthere are no luminaires and the scene is after\nsun-set.\n\n\nI've also noticed that the 6pm version produces an\nambient glow in the room, both in general and more\nspecifically along the ceiling edge. Where is this\nlight coming from? \n\n\nThings I HAVE checked. \n1.All planes are in contact along all edges. \n2.All windows have their surface normals pointing \ninwards. \n3.Double and triple checked (multiple runs with same\nresults) each of these simulations.\n\n\nI am a new user so my use of the Command Prompt to do\nmost of this is limited. Any suggestions would be\ngreatly appreciated, though.\n\n\n\n\nCaroline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
