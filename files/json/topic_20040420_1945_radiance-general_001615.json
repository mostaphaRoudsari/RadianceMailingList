Basically \nit will be a computer that sits in my closet, running Linux, that I \ncan e-mail it a render job and have it e-mail back the finished images.\n\n\nFirst off: Before I replicate a bunch of work, is there already \nsomething like this out there available? I know that Design Workshop \nhas a render server available via a web form.\n\n\nSecond off: Would it even be feasible to use e-mail as the way to \nsubmit and receive jobs? The jobs would probably be rather large, so I \nguess I'll have to figure something out. Just seems very simple to \nmake some programs that would take an e-mail and run with it than to \nhave to build a web front end or something...\n\n\nThanks for any input,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001615.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001615", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew"}
