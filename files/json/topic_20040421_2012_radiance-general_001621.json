I am trying to create some sort of\nunderwater visualisation using Radiance. I have been told the Mist\nmaterial is the way to go with it or possibly a Mixfunc with Trans and\nMist.\n\n\nI have tried experimenting with Mist and Trans, both with limited\nsuccess. Does anyone have any advice about how to achieve a realistic\nmodel?\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nmatt\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001621.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001621", "created_by": "Matt_Aranha"}
