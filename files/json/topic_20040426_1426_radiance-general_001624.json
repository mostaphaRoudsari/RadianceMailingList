I need data of window glass from byzanthine \ntimes (500-700 AD). I know few about it, and for reference (to see how \ngood or how bad I guess) it would be great to compare with some \nmeasured data. I will search the library for literature about glass \ntechnology, maybe there is some reference to history. However, maybe \none has worked on such materials before?\n\n\nTIA + CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001624.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001624", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
