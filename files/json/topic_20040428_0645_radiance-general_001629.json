The \nprice, with shipping was about $38.\n\n\nhttp://www.booksurge.com/author.php3?accountID=IMPR02587\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001629.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001629", "created_by": "John_An"}
