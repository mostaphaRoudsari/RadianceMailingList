I have created a simple double glazed\nconfiguration of two 6mm layers of generic clear glass (the system is therefore symetrical i.e.\noptical properties are congruent for front and back).  The export as a rad file (named 'roofglass')\ncreates a glass material and 2 brtdf materials (for front and back).  Which should I use, the\nglass, or one of the BRTDFs?  They return slightly differing results.  Is there a way of combining\nthe all 3 somehow to get one BRTDF that covers front and back (and which is front and back anyway,\nfront outside, back inside, assuming surface normals have been oriented inwards??).  The rad file\nlooks like this;\n\n\n#\n# FileName= GlzSys.usr\n# Product Name= \n# NFRC ID= 30000\n# Manufacturer Name= User\n# Glazing Type= Glazing system\n# Coated Side= Neither\n# Transmittance= 0.785\n# Front Reflectance= 0.144\n# Back Reflectance= 0.144\n# Thickness(mm)= 23.430\n# Appearance= \n#\n\n\n\n\nvoid  glass       roofglass_glazing\n0\n0\n3     0.807     0.875     0.849\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    roofglass_front\n10\n      0.134     0.147     0.147\n      0.740     0.803     0.779\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    roofglass_back\n10\n      0.134     0.147     0.147\n      0.740     0.803     0.779\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nmany thanks\n\n\nDan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001638.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001638", "created_by": "Daniel_Lash"}
