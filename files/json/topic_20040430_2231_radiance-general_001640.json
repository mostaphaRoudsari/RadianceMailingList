The command I'm using is:\n\n\ncnt 6 12 1 | rcalc -e '$1=51+((72/6)*$1+6);$2=96+((144/12)*$2+6);$3=30' \n\\\n-e '$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' | rtrace -h -ov @../options_aa08_ab5 -af \nb_b_m_2_bare_aa08_ad1024_ab5.amb -e \nb_b_m_2_bare_illumgrid_task_08_l.out b_b_m.oct \\\n| rcalc -e '$1=179*(.265*$1+.670*$2+.065*$3)' > \nb_b_m_2_bare_illumgrid_task_08_l.dat\n\n\nThe values reported by rtrace are in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 \ncandela/meter squared.  However, in an image, I am getting values in \nthe range of 1.5 to 2.5 candela/meter squared (which is much more \nreasonable).\n\n\nIn response to Mehlika's question, Schorsch had mentioned that the \nheader to the pic file would give an exposure value, and that luminance \n= 179*(.265*R+.670*G+.065*B) / e.  But I can't seem to find the \nexposure.\n\n\nWhat am I missing?  Where am I not looking?\n\n\nThanks.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-April/001640.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001640", "created_by": "John_An"}
