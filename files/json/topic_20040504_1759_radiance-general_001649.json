There are probably \njust a few new entities that are giving radout problems when it sorts \nthru the selection set.  I had a nifty LISP routine a while back that \nconverted entity colors, even entities nested in blocks.  This program \nblew up when R14 came out with its new LWPOLYLINE entity.  Once the \nprogram was told about LWPOLYLINEs, it worked again. =8-)\n\n\nYour friend should probably get in touch with Georg Mischler so that \nGeorg's downloads can be updated too, assuming he's able to work out a fix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001649.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001649", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
