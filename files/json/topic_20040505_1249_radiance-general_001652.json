(Note\nradsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/ only has Sparc.)\n\n\nRendering images is CPU intensive and every effort has been made\nto optimise for increased speed.  Sun's Forte compiler (Sun One\nStudio 8) was used.  The packages contain architecture optimised\nversions of the heavily used executables which are invoked as\nrequired automatically by isaexec.  This gives a few percent\nadvantage over generic compiles but that can add up to several\nhours when rendering images.  The Sparc package is 35% faster\non an Ultra than the binaries offered from the radsite.lbl.gov\nwebsite, (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/radbin_sun.tar.gz).\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001652.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001652", "created_by": "James_Lee"}
