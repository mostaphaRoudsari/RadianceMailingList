I need to do this \nbecause I'm generating many images at the same scale, so don't want to \nhave to remove the scale and resize the image.\n\n\n% falsecolor -i picture1.pic -lw 0 -s 10 > picture_falsecolor1.pic\n% falsecolor -i picture2.pic -lw 0 -s 10 > picture_falsecolor2.pic\n\n\netc.\n\n\nHowever, because I need a scale to compare my images against, I use \nfalsecolor without the -lw option\n\n\n% falsecolor -i picture1.pic -s 10 > picture_falsecolor_legend.pic\n\n\nThe problem is, the color on the image with the legend is completely \ndifferent from the color on the image without the legend.\n\n\nIs there an option that I am missing to synchronize the color scale?\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001655.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001655", "created_by": "John_An"}
