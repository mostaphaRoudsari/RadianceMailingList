I've converted the various algorithms into a series of  simple\nC functions and would like to use Radiance to simulate these material\nproperties. However, after a quick examination of the dielectric.c file\nthe implementation is not going to be as easy as I'd expected especially\nincorporating Monte Carlo sampling methods. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions on how I go about\nincorporating the algorithms into Radiance, and especially how I go\nabout incorporating Monte Carlo sampling into the BRTDF / BSDF within\nRadiance? \n\n\nThanks\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001660.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001660", "created_by": "David"}
