I guess there must be \ntoo much ambient light so the highlights on the objects are invisible. I \nwant to turn off the ambient light in the scene and only keep a few area \nlight sources. How shall I set up the parameters? Also, how do I include these parametesr in the .rad file? \nthanks. \n\n\n\n\nBei\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001662.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001662", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao"}
