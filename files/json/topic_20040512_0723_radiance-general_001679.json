Color Checker and Digital Camera - using the techniques that are\n      outlined in Rendering with Radiance, you can use the Color Checker\n      Chart from Gretag Macbeth and a digital camera to sample color and\n      reflectance. The color checker is an accurate set of color samples\n      with known measured reflectances and chromaticity coordinates. It\n      can be used to calibrate color/reflectance information that is\n      acquired through a device such as a scanner, digital camera, or\n      even a regular old film camera. I think used correctly the results\n      can be within +or- 10%. We have used this method with reasonable\n      success on a variety of materials. This is a very economically\n      method (~$100 for color checker plus cost of sampling device)\n   2. Handheld Spectrophotometer - there are a variety of options out\n      there for hand held spectrophotometers. I believe that Gretag\n      Macbeth has several. These will likely be more accurate than the\n      above and cost a lot more. I think when I last looked into this (5\n      or more years ago) such a device cost ~$5,000 and did not include\n      the software necessary for operation. I have not had the\n      opportunity to use one yet.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001679.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001679", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
