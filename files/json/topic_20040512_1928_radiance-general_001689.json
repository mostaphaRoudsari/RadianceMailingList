It is probably becuase they also had momentary access to the unapproved soft cover versin of the book with its unapproved price.  I expect their records will be updated when the other online retailers also begin to carry the book.\n\n\n-Chas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, any idea why the price quoted from Alibris is $45 ??  Is it the\ncorrect hardback version, a good deal, or just another error?\n\n\nThanks for the effort making the book available again,\n-Jim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001689.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001689", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich"}
