See\nhttp://puffin2.curtin.edu.au/restricted/mcminn/radiance-cdrom-v3.3.shtml.\n\n\nThis version is based on the Knoppix Cluster V3.3 (English) CDROM.\n\n\nThere is a script on the CDROM called ompiece (/usr/local/bin) which is\nuseful for experimentation into using the openmosix cluster software and\nrpiece.\n\n\nOpenmosix doesn't require NFS for file sharing as it has its own system\nbuilt in.\n\n\nPlease email any comments. \n\n\nRegards\n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987\nPerth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001697.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001697", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn"}
