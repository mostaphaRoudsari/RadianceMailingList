(They are\nused to using Lightscape and don't know anything about Radiance)  And I\nwas hoping some of you might have some comparison or contrasting\ncomments on this subject since I'm sure most of you have had some\nexperience with this sort of discussion.\n\n\nEven though we are specifically talking about Radiance Vs Lightscape &\nViz, I think this is in part more a comparison about radiosity Vs\nraytracing.  From what I know, the big problem with radiosity is that it\nsimplifies things and assumes lambertian reflections.  This is obviously\na deviation from reality, but I assume it's still possible to achieve a\npretty accurate calculation of some sort depending on the situation.  (I\nknow the person I'm having this discussion with is certainly convinced\nyou can).  Therefore what I am more interested in, is knowing what type\nof calculation you really CAN'T do with radiosity (Viz or Lightscape)\nthat you could do with Radiance.  Like if I am trying to evaluate the\nperformance of a light shelf, can I use a radiosity based engine to\ncompare the differences from one light shelf of material A with the same\nlight shelf made out of material B?  I mean if material A is matte white\npaint and material B is chrome, how could you compare the two scenarios\nif the software assumes lambertian reflections?\n\n\nI appreciate your feedback.\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001706.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001706", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
