I have this on my machine, running under Cygwin, but\nhave never used it before. \n\n\nSo the question is, I really like Ecotect as the modeller, it is very\nquick, good for adapting DXF's and is great for shadow animations and\nthe OpenGL visualisations are really effective, but I want to be able to\naccess some of the functionality of Radiance. Can I generate my scene\nfiles in the DOS version and then use them under Cygwin, and if so, what\nis the best way to go about this? In particular file extension names\netc. \n\n\nCan I use Desktop Rad for generating the .pic images and then perform\nfindglare, xglaresrc etc under cygwin? \n\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n\nNickd\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001726.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001726", "created_by": "Nick_Devlin"}
