I think people put quite a bit of stock in a\nwell rendered image and the arguments can get blurred.  Especially when\nyou are talking about something as subjective as lighting as a whole. \nAre you after accurate results for research purposes, close enough\nresults, convincing pictures, etc?  I know we have some very impressive\nimages here in our office that were developed with the latest\nLightscape/Viz that look (and were developed to look) identical to the\nphotos they were extrapolated from.  And the associated false color\nimages actually gain a certain amount of credibility based simply on how\n\"real\" the renderings look.  Which as you pointed out has nothing to do\nwith the accuracy of the calculation result since the ray-traced part\ndoes not affect the numerical results!  ;)\n\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think some confusion stems from the fact that Lightscape & Viz have a\n\n\nray-tracing capability that you can apply, as a post-process.  When you\n\n\napply that to a Lightscape/Viz model, the specular reflections are \n*rendered*, but not *calculated*.  So you have a rendering that looks \nsomewhat accurate, but at that point that's all you have.  You cannot \nderive quantitative luminance/illuminance information from the image at\n\n\nthat point.  That data always comes from the radiosity-calculated \nmodel, and that's fundamentally flawed because of the lack of specular\n\n\nreflections (and in Lightscape's case, no diffuse transmissions \neither).\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001733.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001733", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
