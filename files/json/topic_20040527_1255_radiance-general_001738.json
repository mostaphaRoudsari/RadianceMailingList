If it is feasible 2. If it is, how \nto apply it...\nAllow me to explain:\n\n\nWhen it comes to mapping material colors or photograph and textures to a \n3D geometry funny things start to happen in certain situations, i.e. a \nnoise pattern used to simulate a fabric will create ambient rays with \ndifferent colors & intensities depending on the point in the map where \nthey bounce. For accurate illuminance measuring, though, we could get \naway with the mean reflection / trasmisivity of the surface (as long as \nthe scale of the perturbation is not big enough), so: is there a way to \ntell RADIANCE to use those mean values for the interreflection \ncalculation and after that just stick the map & texture on the surface \nfor 'slickness' purposes only?\nI know one can play with sample interpolation, but still in certain \nsituations big color variations happen. Does this make any sense to any \nof you?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nIvan Pajares\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001738.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001738", "created_by": "Iv\u00e1n_Pajares_S\u00e1nchez"}
