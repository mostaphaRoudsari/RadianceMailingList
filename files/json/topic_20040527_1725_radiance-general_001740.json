{"topic": "rpict can recover, can rpiece?", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "May 27, 2004 at 05:25PM", "body": "I am rendering a medium piece (8k x 8k) using rpiece on a\ncluster of Opteron processors, and I have used \"rpiece -F\"\nto create the sync file and start 4 processes. I even used\n\"rpiece -R\" to restart the job once. (Thanks to Giulio\nAntonutto for helping me get started.)\n\n\nAnyways, there are two parts of the 64 subdivisions of the\nimage that are giving me trouble. I invoke them piece-at-a-\ntime:\n\n\n% more argsN\n-X 8 -Y 8 -t 600 @vp11 @opts -x 8000 -y 8000 -o img13.pic scene.oct\n\n\n% echo 2 0 | rpiece @argsN\nrpict: warning - no light sources found\nFRAME 1: -vta -vp 1.3 -1.8 1.1 -vd -0.524211 0.708567 -0.472373\n-vu 0 0 1 -vh 5.45455 -vv 5.45455 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs -1.5 -vl -3.5\nrpict: 0 rays, 0.00% after 0.000u 0.000s 0.000r hours on str2\nrpict: consistency - bad ray direction in inithemi\nrpiece: read error from rpict\nCommand exited with non-zero status 1\n\n\nI understand the \"no light sources\" error: I illuminate with\nthe sky dome only. It's the \"bad ray direction\" that is causing\nme problems.\n\n\nNow, I had previously seen this error when I rendered a smaller\nversion with rpict. I simply re-ran rpict with the \"-ro\" recover-\noverwrite option. But it seems that the \"rpiece -R\" recover\noption restarts any incomplete subsections instead of continuing\nwhere rpict left off. So, every time I try to patch the missing\npieces, I get the same error at (presumably) the same place.\n\n\nSo, can rpiece recover in a pixel-wise sense like rpict, or,\nhow can I find out what command sequence (including rpict and\nnot rpiece) can render those bad patches and put them in the\nfinal image.\n\n\nOr, is there any rpiece option that will ignore the \"bad ray\ndirection\" error, or mitigate its effects?\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001740.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001740", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
