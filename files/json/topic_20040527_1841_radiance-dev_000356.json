Perhaps this\nshould be:\n\n\n        for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n                if (meshbounds[0][i] > meshbounds[1][i])\n                        error(USER, \"no polygons in mesh\");\n\n\nThe only way this could trigger is if no vertices were processed so I\nwould think there is an easier way to tell if there were no polygons, ie,\nwhat does this check really do? Why not see if the count of polygons is\ngreater than zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Lee.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-May/000356.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000356", "created_by": "James_Lee"}
