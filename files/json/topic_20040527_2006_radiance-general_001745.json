I\nhave successfully installed pmap version onto my linux. Do I simply copy all\nthe windows generated files (*.rad; *.oct; *.rif; etc.) to linux environment\nand run the pmap software...what is the run command line if I want to simply\nrevisual the exact same illuminance simulation that I had done with the\nDesktop version?\n\n\nMuch appreciate any contributions.\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message has been scanned for content and \nviruses by the DIT Information Services MailScanner \nService, and is believed to be clean.\nhttp://www.dit.ie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001745.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001745", "created_by": "Anthony_J._Farrell"}
