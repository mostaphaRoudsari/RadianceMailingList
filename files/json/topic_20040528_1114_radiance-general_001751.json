The perturbation applied in the CAD models\nis, in my experience, always a cosmetic hack.  For example, to\ngive variation in shading across a flat facade - here the\nbuilding was a tall block with a square cross-section but the\nsurface normals were perturbed as if it was a cylinder.\nThese perturbations are preserved in the conversion from\n3DS -> mgf -> rad and may go un-noticed in later renderings.\nAt least I didn't notice them at first.  They are more likely\nto reveal themselves in illumination/irradiation images. \n\n\nMight they also bamboozle the ambient interpolation algorithms (Greg?).  \n\n\nThe offending polygons may appear something like this in the rad file:\n\n\nmat0 texfunc T-nor\n4 dx dy dz tmesh.cal\n0\n10\t1\n   -0.00645062     0.00858814   -51.95344592\n    0.00910556    -0.00762344    42.56315834\n    0.01317944    -0.01247687    71.46587731\n\n\nT-nor polygon Obj_000001.t1\n0\n0\n9\n         6483.0762         -6394.1626           725.7263\n         6463.3491         -6344.1626           681.5585\n         6502.5605         -6394.1626           699.0936\n\n\nI strip them out using scripts.  Intrestingly, the people who\ngenerated the CAD didn't seem to be aware that they were introducing\nthese perturbations.  Perhaps it happens when they select some\nshading option in 3DStudio (or similar).\n\n\nAny one else encountered these?\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic                     \nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk   \nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001751.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001751", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
