And if yes, how it could be done? The Radiance format \nenables reading of luminance values directly from the pictures, something \nthat could be very usefull in the project I plan to start soon.\n\n\nMuch appreciate any contribution.\n\n\nBarbara.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001754.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001754", "created_by": "Barbara_Matusiak"}
