Radiance's \"normpat\" script does this within the Radiance \nframework, as do other image processing packages (e.g. \"gimp\").  \nEfficient texturing is also helped by blending the texture to some \ndownsampled texture or uniform color if the observer is too far away to \nresolve the fine texture. (note to devs: That brings up the request for \nthe angle-per-pixel issue again. Not to mention mip-mapping built into \nRadiance's texturing, and therefor crossposted to the dev list.)\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-May/000360.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000360", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
