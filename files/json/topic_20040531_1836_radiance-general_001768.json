When I type \"vi\" or \"vim\" \nI get this error message:\n\n\nvi: fatal - missing octree argument\n\n\nwriting: which vi\n\n\n/usr/bin/vi\n\n\nwriting: /usr/bin/vi --version\n\n\n/usr/bin/vi : fatal - command line error at ' -- version'\n\n\nwriting: \"vi foo\"\n\n\nvi - system - cannot open octree file 'foo\": no such file or diretory\n\n\nI've checked:\n\n\n/usr/share/vim/vimrc\n/usr/share/vim/vim62/syntax/viminfo.vim\n/usr/bin/vi\n\n\nRadiance works fine, I can render scenes, but I can't use vi. I spoke \nto the creator of vim, he thinks Radiance has installed a program that \nhas replaced vi. Can anyone suggest a change I can make to fix this \nproblem? Is this a problem anyone has seen or heard before?\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n- Leslie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-May/001768.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001768", "created_by": "Leslie_Everett"}
