(really, nothing special is \nneeded, anything out of the trash can will do :-)\n\n\nMany thanx in advance !!!\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001776.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001776", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer"}
