The rad-file which I use contains a laser scan of a\nreal room and I have no idea what are the right values for the 'section'\nvariable. Every time I change the values the actual grid appears somewhere in\nthe middle of the whole scenery and I get such warnings as\n\n\n          dev/ogl.hdi: no sections visible from this view\n\n\nif I try to turn around or to zoom. I understand why these warnings come, but I\nwould like to know how I can estimate the values for the section to avoid the\nwarnings and to be able to see the whole room and not only 2 walls.\n\n\nAnother funny thing is that the whole room stands on its side, i.e. lines that\nare supposed to be vertical appear horizontal. First I thought the view\ndirection might be wrong, but if I run the same .oct-file with rview using the\nsame view-file everything is perfect. In addition to the right view direction\nthe rview-command produces colored images and rholo gives only grey values from\nthe same .oct-file. Is there a particular reason for such different results?\n\n\nregards,\n\n\nOlga\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001797.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001797", "created_by": "O_Graf"}
