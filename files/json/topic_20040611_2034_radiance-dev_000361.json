I have a \nquestion though as to how to ascertain the real arguments for the position \nfor each vertex for a triangle. I have gone through the function readfargs \nin readfargs.c and it appears to me that the arguments for type FUNARGS is \nstored in its member farg as an array. I have tried reading through some of \nthe source code and it appears to me that the arguments can somehow be \nascertained via a macro in face.h, which states:\n\n\n#define  VERTEX(f,n)\t((f)->va + 3*(n))\n\n\nI am unsure how this macro works. At first it seems that the values of each \nreal argument is added to the quantity 3 multiplied times the number of \nvertices but that I do not think is what is happening. If so, then the \narguments are being transformed into another coordinate (maybe local) \nsystem. I have not the slightest clue as to what is going on. I am wondering \nif anyone in this group can provide some guidance in order for me to get the \nvertices for a triangle.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n\nMarcus D.
