Turns \nout this was to be my first encounter with an IESNA LM-63-95-formatted \nfile, on a directional, linear fixture.  Well, the first time, using \nRadiance that is.\n\n\nI ran the *non*-directional downlight file thru ies2rad and then checked \nit in ltview, and it looked like this:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/site-img/rad/linear.jpg\n\n\nSo far so good.\n\n\nThen I ran the *directional* downlight file thru ies2rad and checked it \nin ltview, and it looked like this:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/site-img/rad/assym.jpg\n\n\nEureka!  I have defied physics!  It was after looking at this image that \nI re-checked the ies file, and discovered that it's the LM-63-95 spec. \nThis is a problem, because the spec calls for the 0-180 vertical plane \nto be oriented parallel to the lamp axis, whereas it's more common to \norient it perpendicular.  ies2rad can't even have a check for this, \nbecause the spec is so loosely written.  This is why checking the \ndistribution of my converted luminaires is so important to me, prior \nusing them in a calc.  I always did it because I don't trust myself, but \nclearly too much faith in the quality of your input files is also a bad \nthing.\n\n\nAnyhoo, I simply reversed the length and width values for the luminous \nopening parameters in the ies file, and got this:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/site-img/rad/assym90.jpg\n\n\nNow, I have a useable fixture, albeit one with a default plan \norientation that is 90 degrees off from the norm.  I guess I could \n\"wrap\" the whole thing in an xform file so that I could use it in a \nstandard library.\n\n\nIs there a better way to \"correct\" a funky IES file for ies2rad? What do \nyou all do when you encounter this?\n\n\n- Rob G.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001805.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001805", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
