And I've run into a very strange issue that I haven't hit using \nRadiance on any other platform, and seeing that several here use \nRadiance on OS X I figured I ask. I bet it's something obvious, but I \ndon't know enough yet about OS X's flavor of *nix to know what's going on.\n\n\nSo here's my problem: doesn't matter if I'm logged on local or via \nssh, when I run Rad, and it generates an Octree, everything is fine \nand works. But if I try to reuse that Octree in the future, or in a \nlater session, I get a strange error reporting that the system can't \nfind some temporary file that appears to have a machine-generated name \nthat's different every time.\n\n\nWhat's going on? Why would there be anything temporary about Octree \ngeneration?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nJeffrey McGrew\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001806.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001806", "created_by": "Jeffrey_McGrew"}
