I am uncertain of the function file command line\n\n\nmod prism1 id\n5+ coef dx dy dz funcfile transform\n0\nn A1 A2...An where the new direction variables\n\n\nSo if I wanted to redirect light from a vertical glazed window down at an\nangle of 45 degrees onto the working plane what values would I substitute in\nfor A1 etc?\n\n\n* DxA DyA DzA and are the normalised direction to the target light source\n* dx, dy, dz are?\n\n\nI sketch of the dimensions would be very helpful, as I just can't picture\nthe above scenario.\n\n\nRoland, Is it possible to use Prism1 or Prism2 commands in the PMAP version\nof Radiance to forward raytrace from the photon port (the target light\n(*luminance* source?)to the target illuminance source (the working plane)?\n\n\nMartin, could is it possible to model a standard prismatic panel that\nredirects vertical light from a light pipe for example, out at an angle of\n45degrees onto the working plane? I will be testing one of the siteco panels\non my test rig so would be interesting to compare the results.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAnthony.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001814.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001814", "created_by": "Anthony_J._Farrell"}
