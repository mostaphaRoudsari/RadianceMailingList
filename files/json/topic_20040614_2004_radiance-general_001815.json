His code has been validated and I am very happy with it. \n\n\nThere are 7 different prismatic panels from Siteco/Bartenbach - there is no standard prismatic panel. Which one do you mean? For redirecting light from a vertical light pipe onto the horizontal workplane at an incidence angle of 45 degrees, the easiest device seems to be a mirror/two mirrors mounted at the bottom of the pipe. \n\n\nYou need a good setup for testing to get meaningful results. This is expensive. Meters are the other problem. I am building a setup right now and my students have been working on it for 3 months (on and off). I am using a 1000W metal halide floodlight with a near parallel beam as a light source. Everything else makes weak signal-to-noise ratios with values below 5 Lux or so. \n\n\nMartin\n\n\n\t-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001815.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001815", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
