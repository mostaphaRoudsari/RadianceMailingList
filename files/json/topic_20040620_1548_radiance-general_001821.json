I already tried to add the following line to the .hif-file:\nrender= -faa, but unfortunately the output (=holodeck file) was not readable at\nall. Basicly it was the same as without the mentioned line or with -fdd instead\nof -faa. Maybe I am using the wrong command or just the wrong place for the\nright command? Or is the holodeck file not supposed to be viewable at all?\n\n\nregards,\n\n\nOlga\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001821.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001821", "created_by": "O_Graf"}
