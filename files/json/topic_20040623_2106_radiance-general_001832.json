Does anyone happen to have the 3ds2rad converter from Ole Lemming?\nBoth his website and he himself seem to have vanished from the internet\nand even after extensive search I was unable to find his converter.\n\n\n2. Does anyone know a reasonable method to render an ArchCAD (6.5+)\n3D model with radiance? All the DXF output options I have tried so far\nwere rather unsuccessful, I have not found a way to correctly\nexport/ translate materials or elements from ArchiCAD.\n\n\nWith Georg's dxf2rad I get a Radiance model, but the resulting Radiance\nscene is pretty much unusable which is not Georgs fault. If I load the\nDXF file into AutoCAD for examination I see that the DXF file is just\nmessed up with regards to layers/blocks/materials.\n\n\nAny input very welcome!\n\n\n Erwin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001832.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001832", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler"}
