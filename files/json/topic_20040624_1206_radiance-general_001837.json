These samples have \ntypically dimensions of about 30 x 20 cm (similar to the Macbeth \ncolorchecker). I rendered using the materials colors obtained from \nthese samples.\n\n\nNow I want to map pictures onto the surfaces. I still want to use the \ncolor as obtained from the sample. But the mapped picture is usually \nmuch larger than the sample. So I would need a way to bring the average \ncolor of the picture to the (average) color of the calibrated sample. \nIs there a way to do that with Radiance's tools? I could use these \nmappings on a clear white (.9 .9 .9) surface than, right?\n\n\nIs there a way to use the pic only as variation of the color? E.g. \nconverting from radiance pic to a file that could be used by \nbrightdata? I could use the color from the calibrated (small) sample \nthan, and the big pattern only to map some structure.\n\n\nThe way I used so far: applying normpat to a grayscale pattern, and \nmapping that onto the surface which has the color measured from the \nsample. Similar to using brightdata, and not able to reflect the color \nvariation.\n\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
