I'd welcome any reports of using SketchUp to model scenes for\nRadiance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried exporting a Sketchup model to Rad. It's been a while but I recall\nhaving problems going directly to Radiance with dxf2rad and strata2rad.\u00a0 I\nexported dxf and then brought that into Infini-D. I also tried going through\nBryce.. and Hash Animation Master\n\n\nWhen finally got it into Radiance, there were too many unnecessary polygons\n- I ended up Re-modelling the house. \n\n\nBut now, playing with the 3ds2rad script, it seems to be a much more\nseamless process, not to mention maintaining material properties.\n\n\nAfter a quick try, Sketchup export to3ds, > 3ds2rad seems to work well. \n\n\nRob F \n\n\nPS - when you reply to a message, it directs to\nradiance-general-bounces at radiance-online.org\nBut that does'nt seem to make it to the list. I'm always copy/pasting the\nadddress. Is it just my email client (MS Outlook)?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001841.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001841", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons"}
