Actually there is an\noption -r for the rholo command which is supposed to open the holodeck file\nonly for reading, but each time I try to use it with the destination hdk-file i\nget the following error:\n\n\n           rholo: fatal - cannot create read-only holodeck\n\n\nIt doesn't matter how I use rholo, without or without -n/-o, this error appears\nevery time. Maybe I'm missing something about how to use this -r option? Or is\nthere another possibility just to view the content of a holodeck file without\nactually recalculating the rays?\n\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nregards,\n\n\nOlga\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001844.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001844", "created_by": "O_Graf"}
