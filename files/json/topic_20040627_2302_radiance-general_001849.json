But now I would like to generate a false-color image of the\nilluminance values on a plane .8m above the floor. I can easily do\nthe floor (or walls, etc.) with a parallel projection view, but I\ndon't see how to get the workplane illuminance values without creating\nan opaque surface at the correct height which would change the light\ndistribution. Does anyone know of a way to specify a \"virtual\" surface\nor other technique to do this?\n\n\nThanks,\nJim Estes\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-June/001849.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001849", "created_by": "Jim_Estes"}
