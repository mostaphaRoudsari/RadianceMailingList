It may be just a matter of linking fileds to\nrpict options\n\n\nWhat would be usefull is to have a small window (128 x 128 or so) that\nrenders a simple scene (with rview? or rpict?)\nMaybe the scene is a sphere in a cornell box or something\n\n\nAnd then several fields that correspond to the options in rifs - quality,\nPENUMBRAS,  DETAIL,   VARIABILITY etc\nplus advanced rendering options... ad   as  ar  ab   aa  etc.\n\n\nchanging any of these values would re-render the thumbnail with those\nsettings.\n\n\nIf it could be done, it would be helpful in determining good render\nsettings.\n\n\nOr - Ive heard and kind of experienced that each scene has its own quirks\nand needs - maybe a simple scene would not give a reasonable idea of what\nwould be needed for a complex scene.\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nRob F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001894.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001894", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons"}
