How does time work in gensky? It seems to accept\nvalues which are not realistic. For example\n\n\ngensky 3 20 14.8 -a 40 -o 98 -m 105 > sky.rad\n\n\nIf I assign the time as 14.8 it produces a sky for that particular time\nwhich of course is not possible. I need to know because I'm writing a\nscript to produce a sun animation (1 frame = 1 minute) and I need to\nknow whether values such as above are meaningful or if I should set the\nscript so that values for minutes are allowed only between 0-60.\n\n\nThe same goes for the hours.. It accepts any value larger than 24!\n\n\nCheers,\nPatrick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.715 / Virus Database: 471 - Release Date: 04/07/2004\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001908.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001908", "created_by": "Patrick_Ledda"}
