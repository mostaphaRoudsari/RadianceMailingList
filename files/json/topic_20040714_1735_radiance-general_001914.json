Enough people replied to \nthe initial call for interest that we felt good about going ahead, but \nsince then we haven't received as many actual registrations as we were \nexpecting.  If we don't get enough registrations by August 17th, we \nwill be forced to cancel the workshop.  Raphael has offered a lottery \ndiscount on registrations to those who send in early -- by the 15th of \nthis month in fact, so today could be your lucky day!\n\n\nThe workshop registration page is:\n\n\n\thttp://www.eif.ch/~compag/rw2004/\n\n\nPlease write to Raphael Compagnon directly if you have any questions:\n\n\n\traphael.compagnon at eif.ch\n\n\nThanks, and hope to see you in October!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001914.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001914", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
