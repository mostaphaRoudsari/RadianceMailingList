I have some questions regarding \nRadiance units, which I understand are radiometric units.  Here are some \nquestions I came up with. My biggest confusion relates to luminous \nefficacy, and when to apply it.\n\n\n1) If I have a spectral distribution of the sun in wavelength increments \nfrom 380 to 780, and apply cieresp.cal to obtain the XYZ CIE values, \nwhat units is Y in? When I convert to RGB using something like \nxyz_rgb.cal, should I divide by the luminous efficacy 179 or not? \nReading Chapter 5 of Rendering with Radiance (pages 305-307), it seems I \nshould just take the RGB values and use them.\n\n\n2) If I have data in CIE XYZ, with Y in cd/m^2. Should I convert to RGB \nand divide by 179?\n\n\n3) When using skygen, what units is the solar intensity in? What units \ndoes skyfunc return?\n\n\nThanks a lot for your time,\nAlejandro\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001915.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001915", "created_by": "Alejandro_Troccoli"}
