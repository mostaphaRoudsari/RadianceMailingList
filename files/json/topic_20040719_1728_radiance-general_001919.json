(The first prelease from April wasn't really worth the name, \nthere were quite a lot of funny errors, but, well, every thing starts \nwith a small step...)\n\n\nThe current RADZILLA contains:\n- 'almost all' RADIANCE primitives/options,\n- a previewer rzvu,\n- full Photon Map support, all maps, all gimmicks, e.g. ports, the \n   problems with faulty option parsing should no longer appear.\n\n\n- new primitives:\n1) the 'scene', an enhanced instance which allows to include \nlightsources in a instanced octree and further allows to set separate \nrendering parameters for this subscene\n2) the 'ghost' material (a shadowless material type for\nmarkers, background, cheating, whatever)\n3) a second mapping mode for the color4pict, allowing to map \nsemitransparent images also onto opaque objects,\n\n\n...and furthermore this or that modification to the classic RADIANCE stuff\n\n\nHere's the link for the adventurous folks to check it out:\nhttp://www.cb-d.de/radzilla.html\n\n\ngreetings,\n\n\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001919.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001919", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer"}
