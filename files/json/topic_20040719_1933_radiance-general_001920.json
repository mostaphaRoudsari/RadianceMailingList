The source is located \nin /rad/install/ray.  Any ideas?  I know a few of you out there are \nrunning Radiance on Cygwin, but I have just about zero experience with \nit.  Any tips or pointers to FAQs would be most appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001920.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001920", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
