Great information, very useful\nJohn! I have two further going questions which some of you might have\nencountered in the past:\n\n\n*\tIs there a way to extract a view point defined in  a 3ds file into\nRadiance? \n\n\n*\tA problem with AutoCAD 14R seems to be that when it exports into 3ds\nfile format the naming of the layers changes from whatever they are in\nAutoCAD into m_GLOBAL_x (x=1,...,n). This is really bothersome as it forces\nyou to go through the file and identify what GLOBAL_x is. Is anybody aware\nof a workaround for this?\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001924.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001924", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
