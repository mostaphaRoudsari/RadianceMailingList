I don't want to map on a transparent surface, but an opaque \none, to describe a mosaic. If I used the void modifier, I think I would \nhave to model three surfaces, so that each surface takes one material \nmodified by the mixpict \"mask\" - that doesn't sound very reasonable to \nme. So the question is still if I can use a mixpict-modified material \nas background in a mixpict modifier's definition, some kind of nested \nmixpict modifier.\n\n\nThanks+CU Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
