I can resize the \nwindow, but usually I have to type 'new' a couple times and drag the \nwindow while I'm doing it to \"force\" the redraw to take up the larger, \nresized window.  The window used to seem to default to around 512px or \nso.  Dunno what I did to make it load differently now, and for the life \nof me I can't figure out where a default like this would be stored.\n\n\nAs they say, what's up with that?\n\n\nThis is happening on a Fedora Core 1 machine, running the xfce window \nmanager.  Happens on Gnome & KDE too though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Rob Guglielmetti\n\n\ne. rpg at rumblestrip.org\nw. www.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001939.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001939", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
