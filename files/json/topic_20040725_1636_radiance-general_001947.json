To\nkeep the conversion to RADIANCE-format easier i created a .rad-file with small\nspheres for each point to represent the original file. But as far as i know i\nhave to create an octree first, before running the actual rholo command. And\nexactly this is my problem. Because I am working on a university computer,\nmemory used for calculations is restricted and the oconv process gets killed\nafter a couple of minutes each time I try to run it. The resulting .oct-file is\nempty. The original point set is a file with a bit more than 200Mb. If i convert\neach point in this file to a sphere, the resulting .rad-file is about 500Mb.\nAfter the octree calculation for this 500Mb file failed, I reduced the number\nof spheres by taking only each 3rd, then 10th, then 20th point. At the moment i\nhave a .rad-file with 31Mb and the oconv process still gets killed. Now I am\nwondering how much memory does each sphere need in an octree? Is there any\napproximate rule to calculate the required memory for .oct-files? Or may be\nthere is another possibility to create a holodeck-file out of my spheres?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nOlga\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001947.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001947", "created_by": "O_Graf"}
