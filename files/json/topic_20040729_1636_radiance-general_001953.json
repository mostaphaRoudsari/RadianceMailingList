It seems\ntriangular illums are not good for some reason.  Long polygons are not\ngood.  (How do you define long?  Aspect ratio not to exceed?)  Large\npolygons are not good.  (How \"large\" is too large?)\n\n\nI'm looking at studying a building with a lot of odd exterior glazing\nwhere I will need to be very creative making my illums.  In this case I\nthink I will be forced to create my illums outside the building... which\nI don't think is ideal since it avoids some issues only to create\nothers...\n\n\nWell thanks for any information.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/001953.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001953", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
