Resulting ambient values are \nsomething around 5, but I think it is too high for interior.\n\n\nSince I have to compare real and simulated values how can I know which -av \nvalue is good enough?\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija Cvetkovic\ncveleglg at bankerinter.net\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001966.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001966", "created_by": "marija_cvetkovic"}
