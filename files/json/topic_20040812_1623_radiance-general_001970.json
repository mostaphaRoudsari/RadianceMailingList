I would like to re-run these images with a\nlower \"ds\" value as I believe this is the setting that is not fine\nenough.    Normally I would re-run the entire thing if I change a\nsetting.  However due to the enormous size of the model, the amount of\ntime it's taking, and the number of frames involved, I don't want to\nredo everything just for a slight improvements.  Can ambient files be\nre-used if the ds (or any of the \"d\" parameters for that matter) are\nchanged?\n\n\nAlso, while we are on the subject.  P.387 in RWR says you can relax the\nad, as, and aa parameters after the overture calculation is done.  Is it\npossible to go the other way and increase the ad, as, (and reduce) the\naa parameters \"slightly\"?  The idea being that one computed an image,\nfound some splotches presumably because ad and as parameters were not\nhigh enough, and want to tweak the image with out taking as much time to\nre-run.  Or can you only relax the parameters?\n\n\nThanks for any responses.  Hopefully some day I will have more answers\nthan questions. :)\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001970.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001970", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
