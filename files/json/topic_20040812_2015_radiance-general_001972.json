I will set the reflectance for the material by altering the\nmaterial RAD file. The actual material I am using currently is\nTraffic_black, which has reflectance of 8.83% and zero specularity and\nroughness.\n\n\nFurthermore, the material file which I used in desktop radiance states a\nreflectance of 8.83 (Traffic black) but when I looked at the respective RAD\nfile I get:\n\n\n#  RAL9017_Traffic_black RAL RAL840-HR\n#  0.02\nvoid plastic RAL9017_Traffic_black\n0\n0\n5  0.05098 0.070588 0.101961 0 0\n\n\nI assume these values for 8.83% reflectance were shown to have 5% red, 7%\ngreen, and 10% blue were shown to exist for this material (does anyone have\na reference for this study?). What configuration should I use for mounting\nboard to produce 8.5% or is there a great difference from the simulation end\npoint?\n\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001972.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001972", "created_by": "Anthony_J._Farrell"}
