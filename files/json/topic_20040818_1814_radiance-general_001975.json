For\nexample, if I put a very shinny sphere on a checkerboard floor, in\nreality, we sholud be able to see mirror images of the floor on the sphere. However, I\nwas not be able to render this using plastic material and my current\nparameters in Radiance. I can only see the specular highlight but\nno image is relfected onto the sphere. Does anyone have any experience\nwith it that could give me some hints.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nBei\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001975.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001975", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao"}
