I have modeled a 3d building in Autocad and now I would like to add some new materials to the Library. My question is how can I input the transmission factor of materials? Because I think the material editor window only has the option of changing average reflectance, specularity and roughness.\n\n\nI will appreciate any help since the selection of different materials' properties is the main part of my work.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\nJulia Mundo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ALL-NEW Yahoo! Messenger - all new features - even more fun!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001985.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001985", "created_by": "Julia_Mundo"}
