Attached is \nthe announcement for those who have recently joined.\n\n\nOur registration deadline is imminent -- August 31 -- so sign up today \nand don't delay!\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCALL FOR PARTICIPATION -- THIRD ANNUAL RADIANCE WORKSHOP\n\n\nWhat: Scientific Applications Using RADIANCE\n\n\nWhere: University of Applied Sciences of Fribourg, Switzerland \n(www.eif.ch)\n\n\nWhen: October 11th & 12th (Monday & Tuesday) 2004\n\n\nOrganizers: Raphael Compagnon and Greg Ward\n\n\nRegistration:\tCHF 205 for speakers (approx. 1.5 CHF per Euro)\n\t\tCHF 270 for attendees\n\t\tCHF 105 for students\n\n\nFee includes: Coffee breaks, lunch both days, a dinner on Monday \nevening, and a workshop CD-ROM\n\n\nHotel:\tRooms of various categories have been pre-booked for \nparticipants at rates specified on the hotel registration form\n\n\nDownload registration forms from the workshop's web page: \nhttp://www.eif.ch/~compag/rw2004/\n\n\nDeadline for registration:\tAugust 31, 2004\nAs early registrations greatly help us in organising the workshop, we \nrecommend\nthat participants send their registration forms as soon as possible. \nDuring the workshop\nwe will make a prize drawing for 2 participants among those who have \nregistered before\nJuly 15. The 2 winners will get a 50% cash refund on their registration \nfee!\n\n\nPurpose:\nTo provide researchers with an opportunity to present their work with \nRadiance, and to share ideas and solutions with other attendees.\nParticipants are invited to give a talk, which will be limited to 30 \nminutes (~20 minute for the talk followed by ~10 minutes of open \ndiscussion).\nNo printed proceedings will be produced, but a CD-ROM will be \ndistributed to attendees that will include electronic materials \nsubmitted by the speakers and edited by the organizers.\n\n\nAt this workshop, we will introduce a special Problem Solving session \non the second day, where users may present their difficulties and seek \nadvice and suggestions, possibly working through solutions in a \ncollaborative \"brain-storming\" with Greg, Raphael, and other attendant \nexperts.  In addition, Georg Mischler and Andreas Lahme have been \ninvited to give a half-day tutorial on Rayfront, and will demonstrate \ntheir new Radiance web rendering service.  Depending on the number of \ntalks we end up scheduling, we may or may not conduct the problem \nsolving session and Rayfront tutorial in parallel. Either way, everyone \nshould get a chance to ask questions, and ample opportunities to help \nothers with their problems as well.\n\n\nA list of planned speakers and preliminary titles is given below. The \nlist will be regularly updated on the workshop's web page.\n\n\n\t\u2022 \tForward ray tracing analysis of a light pipe, by Anthony Farrell\n\t\u2022 \tUsing image based lighting to assess glare under different \nconditions by capturing the whole dynamic range of daylight, by \nSantiago L.

At minimum, we would like to get a copy of each \nspeaker's presentation in PowerPoint, PDF, or HTML (preferred) format, \nand a short bio with contact information. If the speaker also has test \nscenes, images, and/or software they would like to share, these would \nbe most welcome. We need to get all of these materials in order to have \nsufficient time to assemble them into a usable CD-ROM, so we cannot \npromise to include anything submitted after the August 31 deadline.\n\n\nWe look forward to meeting you at the workshop!\n\n\nGreg Ward and Raphael Compagnon\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001993.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001993", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
