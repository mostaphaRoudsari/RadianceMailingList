The project is in Lebanon, but I'm interested in any sources \nhere.  Thanks in advance.\n\n\nP.S.\nI see today is the 31st, so after today it will be official.  I will \nmiss the Radiance Workshop this year.  :-(\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-August/001996.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001996", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
