Intended for\nresearchers and practitioners, it will be led by Dr. John\nMardaljevic (author of the Daylight Simulation chapter of\nthe Radiance book) and take place at De Montfort University,\nLeicester, UK.\n\n\nNOTE - The UK Course is not to be confused with the\nTHIRD ANNUAL RADIANCE WORKSHOP (Firbourg, October 2004):\nhttp://www.eif.ch/~compag/rw2004/\n\n\nUK Course Schedule\n\n\n\n\nDay 1.\n(am)    Primer - A swift overview of Radiance.\n(pm)    Introduction to the ambient calculation.\n\n\nDay 2.\n(am)    Mastering the ambient calculation + scripting.\n(pm)    Problem solving session.\n\n\nThe emphasis will be on understanding the key algorithms\nin Radiance and how they are best used to solve practical\ndaylighting problems.  The UNIX version of Radiance\nwill be used for all demonstrations.  Users of PC versions will\nstill benefit however from a better understanding of general\ntechniques and problem-solving approaches.  Hands-on sessions\nwill be kept to a minimum because they invariably impede the\nprogress of courses.  \n\n\nWe intend the Course to be mixture of tutorial and responsive\nproblem solving.  So, please bring questions and/or examples\nof problems that you have struggled with.  There is scope to\nuse some of your actual Radiance models in the demonstrations.\nFor this, you will need to contact me in advance of the\nCourse and email the 3D model in Radiance format together with\na brief description of the problem/scenario.  I will include\nthose example models that best illustrate a particular Radiance\nfeature or problem solving technique.\n\n\nWe also hope to offer presentations on Radiance-related\nsoftware, e.g. SketchUp.\n\n\nCost will be about \u00a3350 (+VAT) for the two days.\nExpect it to be quite intense, but also rewarding.\n\n\nFor accomodation details:\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/2004RadianceCourse/\n\n\nFor contact details and updates:\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/\n\n\nPlease email jm at dmu.ac.uk asap to reserve a place.\n\n\n-John Mardaljevic\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic                     \nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk   \nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/001997.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_001997", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
