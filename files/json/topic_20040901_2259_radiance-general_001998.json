My \nunderstanding is that a minimum of 4 vertices are needed (Out of curiosity, \nI understand that shadow rays are traced to the centroid of an object. \nUnless the triangle is obtuse, it seem that it should be simple to find its \ncentroid.)\n\n\nI would like to know whether or not the rendering time and accuracy would be \nadversely affected by using 3 sided polygons as illums and living with the \n\"aiming failure\" error messages. The reason why I ask is because sometimes I \nuse windows that have some curved profiles (such as gothic windows) that can \nnot be modeled as 4 sided polygons (my modeling software creates them as a \nmesh of 3 sided polygons by default). I may be able to export some of the \npolygons as 4 sided but for some windows, there is no getting around having \nsome polygons 3-sided. Even when I do export some polygons as 4 sided, there \nstill are some instances when I get the \"aiming failure\" error message. As \nfar as I can tell, the polygons are non-concave and have no opening. I have \nlooked at creating an illum object outside of the window but unfortunately \nthis approach leads to some goofy reflections on the inside. Any \nsuggestions?\n\n\nMarcus\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
