The topic of modeling glazings in Radiance using Optics 5\ndata has been extensively discussed in January 2004. I just reread the\nemails with great interest in the archives. BUT I am still undecided whether\nto go with Optics 5 is worth the effort. \n\n\nin January, everybody agreed that creating a specific glazing in Optics 5\ncreates an output as follows:\n\n\n#\n# header info\nvoid  glass       TestSystem_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.638     0.647     0.568\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    TestSystem_front\n10\n      0.230     0.263     0.326\n      0.585     0.594     0.521\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    TestSystem_back\n10\n      0.289     0.336     0.371\n      0.585     0.594     0.521\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nPhilip mentioned that to use this material description, one would need \"two\nglass polygons for each window, one for the front and one for the back\". I\nassume this means:\n\n\nTestSystem_front polygon FrontOfWindow\n0 0\n12     0     0     0\n         1     0     0\n        1     1    0\n        0    1    0 \n\n\nTestSystem_back polygon BackOfWindow\n0 0\n12     0     0     -0.01\n        0    1    -0.01\n        1     1    -0.01\n        1     0     -0.01 \n\n\nIs this correct? How does the glazing know its transmittance, i.e. how does\nTestSystem_glass come into play? Also, does anybody have any references or\nexperience how much more accurate a simulation gets if one uses the full\noptics 5 file instead of a stripped down version such as:\n\n\nvoid  glass       TestSystem_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.638     0.647     0.568\n\n\nAny thoughts are elcome,\n\n\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart, Ph.D.                        tel: (613) 993-9703 \nResearch Officer                                      fax: (613) 954-3733 \nInstitute for Research in Construction      e-mail:\nchristoph.reinhart at nrc-cnrc.gc.ca \nNational Research Council Canada        1200 Montreal Road M-24, Ottawa \nOntario K1A 0R6 Canada \n\n\nDaylighting Analysis Software: \nThe Lightswitch Wizard (initial design)   www.buildwiz.com\n<http://www.buildwiz.com/lightswitch/index.cfm>  \nDAYSIM (expert software)                       www.daysim.com\n<outbind://26/www.daysim.com>   <outbind://26/www.daysim.com> \n\n\n\n\nIEA Task 31\nhttp://www.iea-shc.org/task31/ <http://www.iea-shc.org/task31/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002003.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002003", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
