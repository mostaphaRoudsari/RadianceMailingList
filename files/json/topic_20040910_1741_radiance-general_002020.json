(while light does nothing...)\nSo why only light? \nAny ideas appreciate!\nthanks a lot\ngiulio\n\n\nBTW I was used to employ the inner part of a sphere in a script of mine to\ncreate a polar distribution of a light source (basically an illuminance\nimage of a dome with a light source in the middle  and a known radii)... may\nbe stretching radiance capabilities...\nNow it's no more working :-(\n\n\nPS settings are default, without ambient bouncing.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-September/002020.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002020", "created_by": "Giulio_Antonutto"}
