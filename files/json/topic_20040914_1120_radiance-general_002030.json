I couldn't find any documented example so far (I have RwR \nhere, the old digest, the mailing list's archive for some years and a \ngoogle-window in my browser ;-). If there is anything like that out \nthere, it would be a great help to understand how to use these. I want \nto use metdata and plasdata to represent some more complicated \nstructured surfaces, e.g. I still have the problem how to model a gold \nmosaic as seen from a very distant point of view.\n\n\nTIA + CU, Lars.\n\n\nLars O.
