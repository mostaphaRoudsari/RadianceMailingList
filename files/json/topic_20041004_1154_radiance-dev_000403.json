In particular, most browsers by now\nsupport PNG but don't support TIFF, which seems to be\nreceeding into the obscurity.\n\n\nI don't know what people on UNIX systems do (I see\ncommand like \"TIFF | cjpeg\" in Radiance book) but I\ncan't see anything in existing code for pic->jpeg on\nWindows.\n\n\nI also started work on decoder for PNG that shows\npromise to work on Win32 (I follow the rules for image\ndecoder writing) but it would be nice if somebody with\naccess to UNIX/Linux would later check that code\ncompiles on those platforms.\n\n\nOr am I just wasting time and there is code for JPEG\nand PNG already available somewhere?\n\n\nTony\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
