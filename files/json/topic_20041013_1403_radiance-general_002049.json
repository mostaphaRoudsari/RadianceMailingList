It was good fun\nand highly informative - thanks to Greg, Raphael and all speakers.\n\n\nregards\nPeter Apian-Bennewitz\n\n\nPS: I took the liberty of removing the list of participants from the\nonline version. Such a nicely grouped, unprotected, online list of valid\nemails is just too easy for spam generators.\nThe downloadable ISO images of the CD are left in the original state, so\nyou can burn the CD yourself, which is nearly as good as having been\nthere.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002049.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002049", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
