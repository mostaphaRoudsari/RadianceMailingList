This polygon is an \nillum and it renders visible. It renders unvisible as expected if I set \neither:\n- ps = 6\n- change the height of the illum face\n- change the view a little bit.\nThe effect also depends on the Radiance version. I first found it in the \nold Windows version, but it is also in Radiance 3.5 and 3.6a. The latter \nrenders the polygon outlined, with dashed lines, but it is visible.\n\n\nThis might be a problem in the Radiance kernel.
