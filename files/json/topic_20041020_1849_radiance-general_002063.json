I got these by installing DeskRad.  Thanks to obligatory corporate hardware/software upgrades I lost AutoCrap2000 forever, so I can't use DeskRad itself.  Undaunted I am hoping to learn to use Radiance directly in the DOS-box, hands-on from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour humble novice in trepidation\n\n\nGeorge Chadwick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ALL-NEW Yahoo!
