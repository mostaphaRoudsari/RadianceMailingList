These are books that were sent by mistake from \nBookSurge.com, following the original order for the workshop, which \nalso arrived too late to be distributed.  Those books, however, were \nalready spoken for.  These are not.\n\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining a copy of the book and you live in \nEurope, please write to Raphael Compagnon and he will take orders on a \nfirst-come, first-served basis.  Payment will be made by credit card.  \nRaphael's e-mail address is:\n\t<raphael.compagnon at eif.ch>\n\n\nThe chief advantage of ordering one of these books rather than going \nthrough Amazon or BookSurge is that you will get your order much \nsooner.  Again, this is only for European addresses, since it would \ncost too much to ship them overseas (again).\n\n\nThanks!\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002065.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002065", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
