My interest is mostly automating rendering\ntasks. From that I intend to see whether it could be interesting to combine\ngenetic algorithms with radiance to automate architectural research. I have\n-modest- experience in computing this way, but initial research focused on\nGA/FEM simulation. An example of such an experiment would be to parameterize\na window, the placement of the window, or the material in the room, and to\nsearch for a solution -using a GA- where there would be a constant luminance\nin the room. In order to conduct these experiments I first need to progress\nin automating rendering tasks.\n\n\nCheers!\n\n\nJF\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002072.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002072", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
