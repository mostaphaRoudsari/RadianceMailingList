The logic looks very sound, and I got as far as\nstage 3, when it barfed at -lw as a bad option. This I assume means that\nI don\u0092t have the latest version that includes Rob's option. The\ndifficulty at this stage is that I am running it under Cygwin and am not\nconfident about compiling it. \n\n\nHowever, will try compliling the latest release on one of the mac's in\nthe office and see how I get on - however for now I have another\ndeadline looming. Many thanks though as I suspect your solution does\nexactly what I wanted. GREAT!!\n\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002076.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002076", "created_by": "Nick_Devlin"}
