I have a basic idea just from using a\nsolar chart, but I would like to accurately illustrate every possible\nsun patch location.\n\n\nMy thought was to make a loop where I render all possible sun positions\nfor half the year (renderings with sun only, no sky, and with -av 0 0 0\n-ab 0) and add all the images together as I go.  The resulting image\nwould show where the sunlight is falling for the entire year.  Depending\non how fine I make my sky changes, this might result in quite a few\ncalculations.  (6 months x 16 hrs per day =  96 calculations.. not too\nbad)\n\n\nHas anyone tried to do this before?\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002080.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002080", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
