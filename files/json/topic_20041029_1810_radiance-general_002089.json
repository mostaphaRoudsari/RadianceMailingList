This way one could simulate interior annual illuminance profiles\nwith the blinds opened and closed. This is already possible if one simulates\nthe blinds geometrically in gory detail (genblind), but the simulation times\nare horrendous. I assume the calculation time penalty would be less severe\nif one used \"BRTDFunc\" instead? To my knowledge, mkillum cannot  be used\nwith a daylight coefficient approach since mkillum is tied to a specific sky\ncondition? \n\n\nChristoph\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002089.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002089", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
