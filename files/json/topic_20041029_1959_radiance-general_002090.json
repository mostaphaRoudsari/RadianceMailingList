My question is what would be a valid \napproach for materials not scanned and calibrated? Many of the image maps \nthat I use I obtain from various sources (i.ow. the internet) such that I \ncan not get the exact reflectance of the material used for my image maps. \nThis would generally apply to the floor materials that I use. What I have \nbeen doing has been a similar approach that I have used with Lightscape. \nWhat I do is take the image apply it to a material and set the RGB \nreflectance to a range similar to the recommended reflectance range that is \nused in Lightscape. I question the validity of this approach.  I know that I \nam in the minority in this group due to the fact that I wish to obtain a \nvisually pleasing image while at the same providing accuracy when it regards \nthe lighting distribution throughout the building. Any help would be \nappreciated.\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002090.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002090", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
