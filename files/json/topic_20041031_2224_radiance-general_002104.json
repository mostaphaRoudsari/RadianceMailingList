I get 'bad\ninstance \"my_instance\"' type errors I never saw before and now I am\nwondering if there have been changes in radiance or if it is my system that\ncauses these errors?\n\n\nI use instances a lot, has anyone tried xform, replmarks and the other tools\non scenes with lots of instances in current releases? Have there been any\nchanges applied to the code in these areas?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-October/002104.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002104", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
