I think most of the \npeople on this list are not so lucky as to live in the god-blessed U.S. \nof A., the greatest country on the planet (soon to be the only country \non the planet).  I feel really sorry for you.  All you bystanders can \ndo is fret, but there is a website if you're interested in sharing your \ndiscounted opinion with others:\n\n\n\thttp://www.betavote.com\n\n\nTo my fellow Americans, proud and reluctant alike, this is probably the \nmost important presidential election of our time, and given how close \nthe race is, yours could be the vote that decides the outcome \n(especially if you happen to sit on the Supreme Court).\n\n\nIf you are \"on the fence\" and wish to discuss it, I'm happy to talk.  \nIf you just want to know my opinion from curiosity, I'll give you a \nhint:  the environment is my #1 issue.  If you can figure out how to \nrun rpict, you should be able to figure this one out.\n\n\nProud to be a Californian,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002105.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002105", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
