Since this is the first time I've tried doing this,\nI mostly want to know if I'm looking for the right numbers, and using them\ncorrectly\n\n\nThanks, Rob Fitzsimmons\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002109.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002109", "created_by": "Rob_Fitzsimmons"}
