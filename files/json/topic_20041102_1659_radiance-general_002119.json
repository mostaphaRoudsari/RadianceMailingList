With this email, we invite you\nto share your opinions considering a preferred date and location for the\nnext workshop.\n\n\nThe NRC could host the workshop next August in conjunction with the IBPSA\nconference 2005 which will take place in Montreal, Canada\n(http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/ <http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/> ) from Monday,\nAugust 15th to Thursday, August 18th. The workshop would take place on the\nThursday and Friday before the conference (August 11th & 12th) at the School\nof Architecture at McGill. The school is located in downtown Montreal within\neasy walking distance from restaurants and cafes. The benefit of organizing\nthe workshop in conjunction with a major building simulation conference\nmight be that some individuals (including myself) have an easier time\ninternally justifying travel expenses to attend a major conference than an\ninformal workshop. \n\n\nJohn offered to host the 2006 workshop in the UK. Please let us know your\npreference for either location. \n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nPS: Montreal and surroundings are definitely worth a trip in case you have\nnot been here before. There are plenty of weekend/ after meeting activities\nfrom Moshe Safdie's Habitat (that would make a nice Radiance model) to\ncanoeing in the Laurentians.\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Ph.D.                        tel: (613) 993-9703 \nResearch Officer                                      fax: (613) 954-3733 \nInstitute for Research in Construction      e-mail:\nchristoph.reinhart at nrc-cnrc.gc.ca \nNational Research Council Canada        1200 Montreal Road M-24, Ottawa \nOntario K1A 0R6 Canada \n\n\nDaylighting Analysis Software: \nThe Lightswitch Wizard (initial design)   www.buildwiz.com\n<http://www.buildwiz.com/lightswitch/index.cfm>  \nDAYSIM (expert software)                       www.daysim.com\n<outbind://24/www.daysim.com>  <outbind://24/www.daysim.com>  \n\n\n\n\nIEA Task 31\nhttp://www.iea-shc.org/task31/ <http://www.iea-shc.org/task31/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002119.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002119", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
