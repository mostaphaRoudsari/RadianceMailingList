Some window  \nmanagers have preferences you can set for specific X11 clients, but I  \ndon't know where they live.  Do you know what window manager you are  \nusing?  (Hint: they are generally platform-specific, so if you tell us  \nwhat machine/OS you are using, this would help.)  Can anyone on the  \nlist offer suggestions?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002133.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002133", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
