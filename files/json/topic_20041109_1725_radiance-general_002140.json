For this,\nit relies on what the X server tells it about the screen height\nand width. If on your machine the initial window is smaller than\nthe screen in both directions, then the X server lied to rvu.\nObviously, your X installation is (or was) broken. There's\nnothing Radiance can do about that.\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002140.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002140", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
