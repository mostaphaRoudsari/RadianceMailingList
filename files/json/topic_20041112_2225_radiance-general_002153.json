{"topic": "Discrepancy between the simulated DF and calculated DF in Desktop RADIANCE 2.0.", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Byoungsoo Ahn", "created_at": "November 12, 2004 at 10:25PM", "body": "Dear All,\r\n\n\nI am using Desktop RADIANCE 2.0 with AutoCAD R14.\r\n\n\nFor the DF, I got different values from the simulated (from the \r\nsimulation manager) and calculated DF (from the illuminance ratio of \r\nindoor/outdoor sensor). I don\u00a1\u00aft know which one is correct DF. I \r\nalso measured with scale model to compare the DF with DR simulation. \r\nDF in scale model is very close to the simulated DF (from the \r\nsimulation manager option). Calculated DF from indoor/outdoor \r\nilluminance is higher than simulated DF.\r\n\n\n\n\nBy checking the batch files in project folder, I noticed the \r\ndifference between the simulated DF and calculated DF is come from \r\nthe outdoor illuminance level. But I could not figure out why I got \r\ndifferent numbers. \r\n\n\nAs shown below, all the numbers are same in batch files.\r\nIn the FL_0110.bat file, 26100 looks like outdoor illuminance (see \r\nthe FL_0110.bat file). \r\nHowever, outdoor illuminance at that time is 14648.064 lx (see the \r\nOut_0110_I_out.out file).\r\n\n\nOutdoor illuminance level in DF simulation is higher than \r\nilluminance simulation for outdoor sensor. I think the difference of \r\nDF is come from the difference of outdoor illuminance level. But I \r\nstill can not understand which one is correct. \r\n\n\n\n\n*I run all the simulation at the same conditions. All runs are at \r\n1:10 pm (CST) in College Station. And all the other parameters are \r\nalso same.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch Files in Project Folder\r\n\n\n\n\nRun for DF calculation (FL_0110.bat)\r\n\n\ndel FL_0110_DF_floor.out\r\nrad -v 0 FL_0110.rif\r\ntype Grid_floor.pts | rtrace @FL_0110.opt -faa -h -opv -I -dv- -x 1 \r\nFL_01101.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=\r\n($4*47.4482686+$5*119.950519+$6*11.6012125)/26100.000000' >> \r\nFL_0110_DF_floor.out\r\n@cls\r\n\n\n\n\nRun for Indoor Illuminance (FL_Illum_0110.bat)\r\n\n\ndel FL_Illum_0110_I_floor.out\r\nrad -v 0 FL_Illum_0110.rif\r\ntype Grid_floor.pts | rtrace @FL_Illum_0110.opt -faa -h -opv -I -dv-\r\n-x 1 FL_Illum_01101.oct | rcalc -\r\ne '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=$4*47.4482686+$5*119.950519+$6*11.6012125' \r\n>> FL_Illum_0110_I_floor.out\r\n@cls\r\n\n\n\n\nRun for Illuminance of Outdoor Sensor (Out_0110.bat)\r\n\n\ndel Out_0110_I_out.out\r\nrad -v 0 Out_0110.rif\r\ntype Point_out.pts | rtrace @Out_0110.opt -faa -h -opv -I -dv- -x 1 \r\nOut_01101.oct | rcalc -\r\ne '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=$4*47.4482686+$5*119.950519+$6*11.6012125' \r\n>> Out_0110_I_out.out\r\n@cls\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut Files in Project Folder\r\n\n\nRun for DF calculation (FL_0110_DF_floor.out)\r\n\n\n3750      4800      275.0001      0.00196749261\r\n7500      4800      275.0001      0.00202036887\r\n11250      4800      275.0001      0.00186442329\r\n3750      3300      275.0001      0.0020485585       Floor_1\r\n7500      3300      275.0001      0.00214985753      Floor_2\r\n11250      3300      275.0001      0.00199673954      Floor_3\r\n3750      1800      275.0001      0.00195969207\r\n7500      1800      275.0001      0.00215063028\r\n11250      1800      275.0001      0.00186199776\r\n\n\n\n\nRun for Indoor Illuminance (FL_Illum_0110_I_floor.out)\r\n\n\n3750      4800      275.0001      52.3787953\r\n7500      4800      275.0001      58.7716727\r\n11250      4800      275.0001      50.8646398\r\n3750      3300      275.0001      53.6415735         Floor_1\r\n7500      3300      275.0001      55.2004445         Floor_2\r\n11250      3300      275.0001      54.263763          Floor_3\r\n3750      1800      275.0001      53.1193063\r\n7500      1800      275.0001      55.2840016\r\n11250      1800      275.0001      52.6013467\r\n\n\n\n\nRun for Illuminance of Outdoor Sensor (Out_0110_I_out.out)\r\n\n\n14250      2900      14120      14648.064\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.\r\n\n\nRegards,\r\nByoungsoo Ahn.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002153.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002153", "created_by": "Byoungsoo_Ahn"}
