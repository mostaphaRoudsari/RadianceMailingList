So, I'm \nlooking around and trying to come up with some nifty ideas for pulling \noff such a stunt and, as a very new user to Radiance, I find that \nRadiance has its OWN FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGE.  Well, that makes me feel \nbetter, because I spent a while figuring out the mechanics of the \"if\" \nstatement in the man page example for pcomb.  Damn if this software \nisn't just the coolest.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nkirk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002161.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002161", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault"}
