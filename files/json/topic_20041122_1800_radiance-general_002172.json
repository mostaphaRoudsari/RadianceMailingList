I am using a fitting which\nincorporates 2 cfl lamps, each with 1200 lumens output. This is clearly\nstated in the .ies file supplied by the manufacturer. Problem is, my\nscene looked too dark, and I am not too sure why. \n\n\nWhat is the simplest way to reverse-check that the .rad description of\nthe light includes both lamps?? - ie - is as bright as I would expect???\nI am not too clear on all the variables for a light description just\nyet.\n\n\nThe .rad file reads like this: \n\n\n\n\n# IES2RAD.EXE\n# Dimensions in meters\n#<IESNA:LM-63-1995\n#<[TEST]      ST5303\n#<[MANUFAC]   Zumtobel STAFF\n#<[LUMCAT]    60810384\n#<[LUMINAIRE] Panos MWW 200 2/18W TC-D VVG\n#<[LAMPCAT]\n#<[LAMP]      TC-D 18W\n# Unknown lamp type (used default)\n# 36 watt luminaire, lamp*ballast factor = 1\n\n\nvoid brightdata St5303_dist\n5 cylcorr St5303.dat source.cal src_phi2 src_theta \n0\n3 1 0.176 0.0005\n\n\nSt5303_dist light St5303_light\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nSt5303_light ring St5303.d\n0\n0\n8\n            0 0 -0.00025\n            0 0 -1\n            0 0.088\n\n\nDerived from the following ies file: \n\n\nIESNA:LM-63-1995\n[TEST]      ST5303 \n[MANUFAC]   Zumtobel STAFF\n[LUMCAT]    60810384\n[LUMINAIRE] Panos MWW 200 2/18W TC-D VVG\n[LAMPCAT] \n[LAMP]      TC-D 18W\nTILT=NONE\n2  1200  1.0  19  13  1  2  -0.176  0.000  0.000 \n1.0  1.0  36\n\n\n(angles etc omitted for brevity)..\n\n\nAny thoughts would be very gratefully received. \n\n\nNick \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCO2 \n\n\n\n\nXCO2 conisbee  Ltd\n1-5 Offord Street\nLondon N1 1DH\nTel: + 44 (0)20 7700 1000\nFax: + 44 (0)20 7700 4455\nEmail: nickd at xco2.com\nWeb: http://www.xco2.com \n\n\nengineering sustainability \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis e-mail and any attachment contains information which is private and\nconfidential and is intended for named recipient(s) only.
