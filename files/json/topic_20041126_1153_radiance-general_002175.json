I've\nseen a few posts to the mailing list about this, but I haven't found a\nreply that solves the problem.\n\n\nThe problem:\nI want to create a simple walkthru of a room using a games engine. I've\nalready created the model in Lightwave and exported it to radiance (let\nme know if anyone is interested in the exporter). From there I want to\nuse radiance to render separate images for each of the polygons in the\nmodel, and then map those images back onto the polygons. From there it\nis a simple process to export the textured model to the game engine.\n\n\nMy approach so far:\nI've attempted to use examples of computing illumination across a grid\nto crack this one. This boils down to walking over the polygon surface\nand using rtrace to find the value at various points, spaced at some\nregular interval. This is easy for extremely simple polygons (read\nhorizontal or vertical quads) but becomes a tad more complex for concave\nn-sided polygons.\n\n\nMy questions:\nDoesn't rad already do most of what I need as part of the standard\nrendering process? Has someone already attempted / solved this problem?\nIf not, could someone point me to some src documentation so that I can\nleverage the existing code libraries to roll my own solution in C?\n\n\nAs a starting point, I'm sure there must be some code for subdividing a\npolygon into smaller patches - this would do most of what I want. Any\npointers?\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\nmike\n\n\n\n\nMichael Kruger\n\n\nmike at cityscape3d.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002175.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002175", "created_by": "Michael_Kruger"}
