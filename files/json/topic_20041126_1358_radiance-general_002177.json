The instance element is  \nthe result of replmarks, and oconv gives me the following:\n\n\n/opt/radiance_3.6/bin/oconv: fatal -  \n(model_sophia_aisles_vaults_render.rad): bad arguments for instance  \n\"l_walloverarcade.0.1\"\n\n\nNow I copied my model's directory tree to a different location, so that  \npath names are shorter, and everything is fine. However, this is bad  \nfor me, as I like to have the model in a cvs sandbox in a project  \ndirectory in my home... not in the root directory ;-)\n\n\nThanks, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002177.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002177", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
