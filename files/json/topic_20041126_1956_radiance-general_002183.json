Here at the lab, we have Maya and \nMentalRay set up, and I know it's easy to render Maya models in \nMentalRay.  But so far I haven't found any way to convert the .rad files \nto something usable by Maya or MentalRay, and I'm not at all experienced \nwith any of these three packages - this is just a small step in a much \nlarger project.  I'd be very grateful if someone could point me in the \nright direction.\n\n\nThanks much,\n-crispy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-November/002183.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002183", "created_by": "Chris_Poultney"}
