I'm hoping to be able to scan an image from \nthe store's catalog and map that to the glass window, or perhaps to a \nintermediate polygon modeled with trans.  I'm expecting to get a sample \nof the graphic material so I can estimate the transmission; I'm \nwondering how to accurately simulate this in Radiance.\n\n\nI know Carsten created a new image format and primitive (color4pict) to \nfacilitate some of this, but the gist of how to do this escapes me at \nthe moment.  Could the group offer suggestions on how to accomplish this?\n\n\n\n\n    Rob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002213.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002213", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
