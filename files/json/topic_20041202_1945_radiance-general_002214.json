I was just\nstruggling for the soft shadows. This is my parameters for rpict:\n     rpict -vf default.vp -ps 1 -aa .08 -ab 2 -ad 512 -as 256 -ar 128\n-dj .6 -ds .1 -x 12288 -y 9216 scene.oct > scene.pic\n I made such a large image to get 12 times oversample. I then filter\nit down. This is for pfilt:\n     pfilt -e .4 -r .7 -x 1024 -y 768 scene.pic > scene_filt.pic\n Even so, I still get the image like that. I'm really confused. How\nto get a satisfying result?\n\n\ncheers,\n\n\n    Alex\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002214.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002214", "created_by": "alex_wang"}
