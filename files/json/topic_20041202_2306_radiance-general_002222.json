When I render an image (call it \"output.hdr\") \nand display it in ximage, I hit the \"h\" key and the image gets \nredisplayed with the \"human\" exposure mapping.  Then i take output.hdr \nand i put it through\n\n\n  pcond -h output.hdr  >  output_cond.hdr\n\n\n(now call the new conditioned file \"output_cond.hdr\") When i display \n\"output_cond.hdr\" in ximage, i get a different resulting image than \nwhen I viewed output.hdr in ximage and hit \"h\".  The ximage \"h\" version \nof output.hdr is darker and has more contrast than the output_cond.hdr \nimage.  What's up with that?\n\n\nthanks,\n\n\nkirk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-December/002222.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002222", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault"}
