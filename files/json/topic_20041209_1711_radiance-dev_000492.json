I'm planning to take <rendering\noptions>, <octree>, & <a list of polygon_ids to bake> as params to my\nprogram, but I'm not sure that the octree stores the info I need. (Each\nspecified polygon needs to have its own viewpoint to create a rendered\nimage.)\n\n\nIn short, could someone tell me how if it is possible (& how) to retrieve a\nface by polygon_id from <CUBE thescene>, or whichever structure I need to\nlook in? \n\n\nMany thanks,\nmike\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-December/000492.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000492", "created_by": "Michael_Kruger"}
