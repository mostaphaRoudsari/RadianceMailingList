E.g.: There's got to be a \ncouple of students at Universities worldwide who are confronted with \nRadiance each course and from which we never hear. Especially when they \n/don't/ like it.\nThe whole thing is planned to be used continuously other the next years, \nrather than being a one-time snapshot.\nWerther the idea works out, I can't say, but hey, at least it's worth a try.\nTechnically each entry is stored in MySQL, together with a time stamp \nand the client IP. The latter is handy in case some bored \"script-kid\" \nfloods the entry form, otherwise it won't be made public. The time stamp \nallows for a time dependent analysis over the next years, while the \ndatabase allows for correlations like \"what do architects see as missing\".\n\n\nFeedback on the idea or form is welcomed, otherwise I post a note next \nweek on the general list,\ncheers & a happy start into 2005\n-Peter\n\n\nPS: \"Limits felt\" doesn't list \"user interface missing\", since that \ncould be hardwired to \"on\" under any circumstance, a catch-all from \n\"rpict is a drag\" to \"Radiance doesn't automagically deploy lamps in the \noptimal way in a room\".\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2004-December/000504.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000504", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
