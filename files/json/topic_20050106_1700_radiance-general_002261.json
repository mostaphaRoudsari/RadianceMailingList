I guess \nwhat I am looking for is a color that is warmer that the color that I am \nachieving now. This is for asthetic purposes but I want a solution that is \nphysically accurate. I have tried altering the day and time of day to \nachieve this but it seems that only the angle, height, and intensity of the \nsunlight is changed and not the color. I don't mind hard coding it in the \napplication if it necessasary if it isn't too messy. Any suggestions?\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002261.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002261", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
