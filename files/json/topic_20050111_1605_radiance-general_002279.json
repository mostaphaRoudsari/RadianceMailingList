So for isotropic reflectance I get K as below\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t             [ exp(-tan^2(delta/alpha^2)]\n\t\t\t  K =     -----------------------------------\n\t\t\t         cos(theta_i)*cos(theta_r) *4pi*alpha^2\n\n\n\n\nand use the formula to get the returned colour as\nLi = Ii*projected_solid_angle(rho_diffuse/pi + rho_specular*K) where\n\n\n\t\t\t\tcos(theta_i)*PI*r^2\nprojected_solid_angle =\t\t-------------------\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         dist_to_light^2\n\n\nand r is the radius of my spherical light source.\nwhen I do rview -vf view.vp -av .5 .5 .5 file.oct do I just add this -av value\nfor ambient light as below?\nLi = light.colour*projected_solid_angle*(rho_diffuse/pi +rho_specular*K)\n+ ambient;\n\n\nThanks for any help\n\n\nTarik\n\n\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institue of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002279.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002279", "created_by": "Tarik_Rahman"}
