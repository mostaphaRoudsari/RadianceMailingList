It is more likely to happen if \nchanges are of general use, special short cuts would be somewhat \ncumbersome to maintain. Many special and weird uses are possible with \nnifty scripts and cmdline tools like /rtrace/ without writing C code.\n\n\ncheers\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000506.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000506", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
