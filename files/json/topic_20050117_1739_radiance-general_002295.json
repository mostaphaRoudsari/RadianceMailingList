I (will) ask about inside this book?\n\n\nMake sure you also take a look at the LEARNIX web site:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/\n\n\nUnder \"Documentation\", you\u00b4ll find our course notes from the simulation\nmodule we teach on our masters course. We teach RADIANCE for lighting,\nESP-r for thermal simulations.\n\n\nOh, and DO give LEARNIX a spin!\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002295.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002295", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
