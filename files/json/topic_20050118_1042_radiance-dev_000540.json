If you're interested (hey, _your_ the ones with a \ndegree in IT). It is more social than technical so. But then, some of \nyou are in Berkeley. Home of the revolt on Telegraph....\n\n\nWiki main idea is to allow anyone to write anything. In its pure form \nwithout any access restrictions. Now that's freedom of speech. Good. Or \nchatter with low S/N ratio. Bad. On average, I don't believe that a \ncompact and reliable guide manifests itself out of thin air without \nanyone being responsible. Not without sorting more important parts from \nless important ones, and care taking. Self organization does happen in \nnature, but it seems to either take a very long time (evolution leading \ne.g. to cats) or to be not energy efficient (laser).\nSuccess of collaboration depends on people. Obvious. However, when I \nthink what I like to see on radiance-online, it is something that is \nmore structured than the 100% open Wiki starting config. Something like \na book, with chapters, authors, sections, subsections. And remarks by \nreaders on the edges. Wikis can technically do hierarchical structure, \nbut at least the split between 'readers' with remarks and  'authors' \ndoing the damn writing is not a Wiki spirit. If radiance-online sees a \ncollaborative platform, it'll be more a collaborative book in my view, \nand I would for haven's sake not call it a /wiki/.\n\n\nCompiling contents takes a lot of time, as anyone experienced writing \nhis/her thesis (or a chapter in abook). As author investing this time to \nexplain a point carefully in a compact way, I'd be not very comfortable \nwith the idea that anyone has the same technical editing rights on the \ntext after thinking about the problem for 5 seconds from scratch. Maybe \nthe other is right and brilliant, maybe he/she is dumb&proud-of-it. In \nthe first case he/she should be passed the authorship to, or the remark \nbe woven into the text (incl. reference). In the second case he/she may \nscribble along the paper edge.\n\n\nApart from the technical bits like\n\n\n    * how to you get formulas printed nicely (LaTex is still good at this)\n    * conversion quality to PDF so a chapter can be printed and read at\n      the beach\n    * reshuffling of the structure (chapter 2.3.4 now moved to 3.1.1\n      where it fits much better), including update of links\n    * back-up and mirroring\n    * potential conversion to other systems, and what to we do with all\n      the work in 5 years from now (how abstract is the internal storage\n      format ?)\n\n\nAs author I'd like to have those questions sorted out before I invest \ntime to compile substance.\n\n\nso far, so hoopy\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000540.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000540", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
