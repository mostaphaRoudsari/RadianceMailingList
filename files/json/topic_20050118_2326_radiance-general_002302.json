Also, I am wondering what values would be considered acceptable for \neach of these 3 methods of determining glare (ie. VCP > 70% or 50% ??? .. what \nis generally considered acceptable?).\n\n\nThanks for your help,\nRichard\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002302.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002302", "created_by": "Richard_Furry"}
