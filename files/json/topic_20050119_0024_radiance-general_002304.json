This gives about 10 % performance when I try the benchmark  \nfiles provided on Mark Stock's pages. I also submitted the result to  \nhim. The opt-line in the makeall script here is as follows:\n\n\nset opt=\"-O2 -DSPEED=200 -mcpu=7400 -mtune=7400 -malign-natural  \n-funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing -fsched-interblock -falign-loops=16  \n-falign-jumps=16 -falign-functions=16 -falign-jumps-max-skip=15  \n-falign-loops-max-skip=15 -ffast-math -mpowerpc-gpopt  \n-fstrict-aliasing\"\n\n\nThose who want to try my binaries can get them directly from the  \nfollowing address:\n\n\n3.6 patch 1 release:\nhttp://130.83.168.34/lars/rad/bin/Radiance-Darwin-PPCG4-3.6.1.tar.bz2\n\n\nHEAD release from 18th january:\nhttp://130.83.168.34/lars/rad/bin/Radiance-Darwin-PPCG4- \nhead20050118.tar.bz2\n\n\nThe files will be linked on the binary-pages I maintain on  \nlgrobe.port5.com (those are linked from radiance-online.org), but the  \nhost is currently down and I have to wait that my provider brings it  \nback ;-)\n\n\nCU, and have fun, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002304.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002304", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
