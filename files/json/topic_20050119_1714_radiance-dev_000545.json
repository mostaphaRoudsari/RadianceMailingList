In that room you have a \nsingle polygon that represents, for instance, someone's desk top.\n\n\nNow, we want to find the average illumination of that person's desk top.\n\n\nSo, our idea is to render from a view point and direction such that the \nview plane is exactly the bounding box of the polygon, using rtrace to \noutput all the illuminance at each point.\n\n\nThis would be pretty easy if there is some way to tell Radiance to clip \nall but a named polygon, but still render the illuminance on that \npolygon taking into account the rest of the scene.  Is there a way to do \nthat?\n\n\nOur pretty dodgy idea at the moment is to place a near and far clip \nplane just in front and behind of the target polygon, but that's dodgy \nto say the least :)\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nChris\n\n\nps. check out http://www.radiance-wiki.org/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000545.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000545", "created_by": "Christopher_Kings-Lynne"}
