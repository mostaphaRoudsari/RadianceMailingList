As most folks using their Mac for rendering don't use G3 or older \nfor that, I think it might be a good idea to have an option in the \nmakeall script to compile on recent Macs. What do you think? Maybe even \none G4 and one G5 option? Should this be included in the distribution?\n\n\nMy opt-line (based on the proposed PPC-optimizations from gcc 3.3 docs):\nset opt=\"-O2 -DSPEED=200 -mcpu=7400 -mtune=7400 -malign-natural \n-funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing -fsched-interblock -falign-loops=16 \n-falign-jumps=16 -falign-functions=16 -falign-jumps-max-skip=15 \n-falign-loops-max-skip=15 -ffast-math -mpowerpc-gpopt \n-fstrict-aliasing\"\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-January/000553.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000553", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
