The best thing that I can think of is to render the \nimages as a seriese of sub views (tiles) with appropriate shift and \nlifts so the final image can be composed from the sub pieces. If the \ntiles are all pfilted (using the same exposure settings) to their final \nsize prior to composing the final image will there be problems at the \ntile edges?\n\n\nThanks for any input/guidance,\n\n\n-Jack de Valpine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002311.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002311", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
