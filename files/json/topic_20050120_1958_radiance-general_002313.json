The two other HEAD\narchive formats, cpio and zip,  had been unaffected by this.\nSince this afternoon, the archives are generated by a locally compiled\ncpio version 2.6, which has the above bug fixed.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\npab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n[see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002313.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002313", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
