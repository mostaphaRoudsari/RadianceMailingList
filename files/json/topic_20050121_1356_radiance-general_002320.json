Are there any other softwares doing this? If they are many, is there anywhere that I can find some information for their differences?\n\n\nDoes Radiance compute light sources from hdr images? \nThe only software I know doing this is lightgen, a plugin for hdrshop.\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n\n\np.s. By the way, is there a known problem with hdrgen (for linux) alignment algorithm? I captured perfectly aligned photos (using remote capturing - connect camera with computer) and using alignement with hdrgen (not use of -a option) results very bad hdr image. Althought when alignement was disable, the result was perfect!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002320.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002320", "created_by": "Despina_Michael"}
