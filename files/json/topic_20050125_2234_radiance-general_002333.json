Would a radiance holodeck file\ndo the trick, since from what I understood, its storing the actual traced\nrays in a file format.\nThe other question would be how many rays such a graph should contain,\nprobably a 100k is more than sufficient for such a graph, while an actual\nradiance render would consist of many more. Looking forward hearing your\nsuggestions!\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJelle.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002333.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002333", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
