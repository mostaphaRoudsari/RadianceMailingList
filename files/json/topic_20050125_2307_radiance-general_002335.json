How does one pick \nthe common exponent? How does one deal with extrem intensity values in \nthe different color channels? \nI am writing the program in C.\n Can anyone help?\n\n\nTHANKS\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002335.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002335", "created_by": "Katja_Doerschner"}
