I then assume it would be  \npossible to overlay the relevant waldram diagram using Pcomb.\n\n\nIn particular I am looking to address the calculations of Rights to Light  \nissues in the UK. I am confident of being able to calculate the sky  \ncomponent within a scene at reference points, but as a nervious beginner  \nwould like to be able to generate the waldram diagram from the same  \nreference points to double check the accuracy [and convince potential  \nclients].\n\n\nMany thanks..\n\n\nNickd\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002341.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002341", "created_by": "nick_devlin"}
