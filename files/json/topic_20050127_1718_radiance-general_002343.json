In radiance I take a close\nup .pic of the mirror sphere and convert it to a light probe using HDRShop.

Will angmap.cal work for any light probe or do I have to write\nmy own because when I render this, the reflections from the light probe aren't\nmapped onto the walls of the room properly?\n\n\nThanks for any help\n\n\nTarik\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002343.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002343", "created_by": "Tarik_Rahman"}
