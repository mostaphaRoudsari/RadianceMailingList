The issue surrounded the infamous Unisys patent on \nLZW compression, which expired a couple of years ago.  The 3.6 release \nwas _supposed_ to have the new TIFF library with -z enabled again, but \ndue to pilot error (mine), it never got in there.\n\n\nTo get the latest version, you'll need to download and recompile the \noverlay for 3.6 that's on the Radiance websites:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\nand\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/\n\n\nLook for the file \"rad3R6P1supp.tar.gz\".\n\n\nIf you don't know what ra_tiff is or have never used and don't intend \nto use this option, then feel free to ignore this message.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002360.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002360", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
