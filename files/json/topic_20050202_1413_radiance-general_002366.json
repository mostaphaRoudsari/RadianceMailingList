Do I need to set a bunch of jitter \narguments to 0?\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002366.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002366", "created_by": "Christopher_Kings-Lynne"}
