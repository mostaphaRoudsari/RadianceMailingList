That did the trick.  Now then: where is the best place to\n>look for info on this functional language?\n\n\nRob,\n\n\nGood idea, the functional language is still something of a mistery, also\ncoverage of it in 'rendering with radiance' isn't over elaborate. Even\nthough you would have some notion on how it operates, some examples would\ngive quite some insight in the matter. How about a .cal repository, linked\nfrom the Radiance Wiki, explaining would they actually do? That could give\nsome insight into the bowels of Radiance?\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJelle.\n\n\n//Cool to see xshowtrace & related issues coming by this list again, its\nreally a insightful!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002388.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002388", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
