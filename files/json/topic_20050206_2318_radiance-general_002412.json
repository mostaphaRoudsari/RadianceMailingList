I've searched the \nRadiance documentation, digests, etc., and the following was the best I \ncould come up with, but it doesn't seem to work.  Any advice would be \nwelcome.\n\n\nI think I should be able to define a material like this:\n\n\n     void plasfunc myplastic\n     2 refl mybrdf.cal\n     0\n     4 1 1 1 0\n\n\nand then in a file mybrdf.cal, put an arbitrary definition for the BRDF \nfunction refl, something like this:\n\n\n     refl(x,y,z,area) = (x*Nx + y*Ny + z*Nz)^10;\n\n\n(This isn't actually the form of BRDF I'm interested in.)  Then, I \ndefine an object with material myplastic:\n\n\n     myplastic sphere ball\n     0\n     0\n     4 0 0 .5 .5\n\n\nWhen I render this, though (with light sources, other objects, etc. \nadded), the sphere just looks Lambertian.  What am I doing wrong?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nRichard\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002412.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002412", "created_by": "Richard_Murray"}
