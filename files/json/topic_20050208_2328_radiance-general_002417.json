Daysim is based on LBNL's Radiance software and combines the Perez sky\nmodel with a daylight coefficient approach to effectively predict the annual\ndaylight availability (daylight factor and daylight autonomy) in buildings\nfor multiple sites worldwide (you can import EnergyPlus epw climate files).\nDaysim further features a user behavior model which allows to compare the\nelectric lighting use for manual and automated controls (occupancy sensor,\nphotocell control). The software runs under Windows and Linux OS and can be\ndownloaded from  <http://www.daysim.com/> www.daysim.com. The following new\nfeatures have been added since version 2.0:\n\n\n*\textended tutorial: an extensive document to help newcomers to get\nstarted with daylight simulations \n\n\n*\tstep-by-step instructions of how to import building scenes from\nAutoCAD, SketchUp, and Ecotect into Daysim \n\n\n*\ta list of case studies of how your colleagues have used Daysim in\nactual building projects \n\n\n*\timproved simulation output in html-format \n\n\n*\timproved JAVA GUI with an extensive help file system \n\n\n*\tbased on Radiance version 3R6P1(latest version) \n\n\n*\tthe new version allows to model Radiance function file materials\n(transdata, etc.)\n\n\nYour comments/suggestions are appreciated.
