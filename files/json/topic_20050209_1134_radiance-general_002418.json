The green area is the area \nthat is above 0.2% sky factor before the building and the red area is \nthe area that is above 0.2% sky factor after the new building is put in.\n\n\nI have tried with and without mkillum:\n\n\nSkyglow:\n\n\nhttp://img138.exs.cx/img138/977/skyglow8bi.gif\n\n\nMkillum:\n\n\nhttp://img239.exs.cx/img239/2804/mkillum7kx.gif\n\n\nNote that the skyglow one would seem to be much more accurate (basically \na big building that covers almost all the window in the top left edge is \nput in), but the mkillum one has smoother edges.\n\n\nI guess what I just do not understand after hours of playing with all \nthe rendering and mkillum settings is how to either:\n\n\n* get rid of the speckling in the skyglow render\n\n\nor\n\n\n* make the mkillum render actually accurate (in particular, the green \nleakage in the top left corner seems wrong)\n\n\nCan anyone give any suggestions?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002418.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002418", "created_by": "Christopher_Kings-Lynne"}
