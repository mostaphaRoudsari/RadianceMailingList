I need to get rid of those. First I tried the most\nsimple approach, setting the viewfile such that the sky isn\u0092t included, et\nvoila, openings are black. This approach seems oversimplistic, since it\nyields a complete different rendering, looks like any source outside of the\nclipping plane isn\u0092t included (I suppose this is the expected behaviour). So\nI need to do this in a smarter manner. Has anyone run into this before? The\nbest would be to render the mask as a separated image, such that they can be\ncombined using pcomb.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJelle.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002420.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002420", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
