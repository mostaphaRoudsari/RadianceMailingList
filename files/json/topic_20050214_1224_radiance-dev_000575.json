I was enquiring whether he intended to make pmap work with R3.6.\nUnfortunately, the answer was \"no\". He doesnt have the time for\nmaintaining it and considers it abandonware.\n\n\nTHIS IS BAD!\n\n\nI was actually going to put it on the next LEARNIX, and add a section to\nthe advanced tutorial, but this is not possible without being able to\ncompile it...\n\n\nI personally consider pmap as one of the most useful add-ons to RAD\n(although, admittedly I havent used it myself yet)\n\n\nSo I guess my question is this:\nWould any of you guys take on the burden of making it work with R3.6? What\nare the possible solutions without going back to 3.5? (Well, he DOES\nmention on name in his reply, but I am not going to point my finger)\n\n\n---------------------------- Original Message ----------------------------\nSubject: Re: pmap + LEARNIX\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000575.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000575", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
