There are two things\nthat could help to make this possible.\n\n\nThe first one is that someone who understands the code will have\nto be available for continuous maintenance. That needn't\nnecessarily involve a lot of work, but should be understood as a\nserious commitment anyway.\n\n\nThe other thing that I'd like to see is a better seperation\nbetween classic and pmap code. Last time I looked at it, pmap\nadded a number of function definitions and other code to existing\nRadiance source files (eg. xxxPhotonScatter() in rt/normal.c).\nAn effort to move this code into seperate files would make it\nmuch easier to adapt pmap to future (and current) versions of\nRadiance.\n\n\nIn the ideal case, the pmap related code in the existing files\nwould be reduced to function calls. For one, this would make it\neasier to delegate maintenance responsibility to different\npeople. And a \"minimally invasive\" integration might also lower\nthe psychological barrier against a quick (possibly tentative)\ninclusion. The fewer and smaller conditional compiles are needed\nto build Radiance with or without pmap, the better the chances.\n\n\nI hope that won't scare you away again, Carsten...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-February/000580.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000580", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
