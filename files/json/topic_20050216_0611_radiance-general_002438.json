The particular case \nI am interested in is a woven wire blind where the light incident normal to the \nblind would be transmitted better than at an angle.\n\n\nAt the moment, I am modelling using BRTDfunc with a tranmittance value \nappropriate to the light at normal incidence, however I assume this is no \ndifferent really to modelling glass with the same transmittance value.\n\n\nThanks,\nRichard\nClibborn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002438.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002438", "created_by": "Richard_Furry"}
