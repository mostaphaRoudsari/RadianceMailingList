With a uniform sky, how can I determine the theoretical irradiance or \nilluminance at 0,0,0 looking straight up?  I'm currently testing a \npolygon on the z=0 plane and I get a slight variance in the illumination \nacross that surface, due to slight errors in the calcs I presume.  What \nI need is the theoretical exact value...\n\n\n2. With a uniform sky, will the position of my test plane matter?  ie. \nIf I translate the plane from the origin +10000 in the Z direction, will \nthe illumination on that plane still be identical?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-February/002456.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002456", "created_by": "Christopher_Kings-Lynne"}
