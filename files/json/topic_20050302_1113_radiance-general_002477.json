It works sometimes and other times it doesn't, I don't\nunderstand why. The metal spheres such as the gold and steel ones and the\ncrystal  sphere all render perfectly but sometimes (not all the time) any\nobject with plastic material doesn't render properly.\n\n\nTarik\n\n\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002477.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002477", "created_by": "Tarik_Rahman"}
