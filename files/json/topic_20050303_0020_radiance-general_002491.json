For this, the background of the falsecolor contour line\nimage should probably be black, but this is no problem. The false colour\nlines would appear to be hovering in the room. I saw something similar in\na demo of some commercial lighting software, but don't remember where.\n\n\nI think my problem is the cal file (PAB named his one picture_UV.cal)\nwhich is often referred to, but never given as an example. Since my object\nis a nice'n'easy plane, would it be possible to use picture.cal that comes\nwith RADIANCE?\n\n\nThose are PAB's words of wisdom:\n\n\n--------------------- 8< - Schnipp -----------------\n\n\nvoid plastic mp1\n0\n0\n5 .01 0.01 0.01  0.35 0.1\n\n\nvoid glass mp2\n0\n0\n3  .9 .9 .9\n\n\nvoid mixpict mp\n15 mp1 mp2 digital1 sp.pic picture_UV.cal tpic_u tpic_v ...\n0\n0\n\n\n--------------------- 8< - Schnapp -----------------\n\n\nCould somebody explain the mixpict primitive a bit more?\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002491.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002491", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
