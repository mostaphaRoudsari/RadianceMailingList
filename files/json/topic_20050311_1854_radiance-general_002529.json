Thanks so much. I think I'll color rays in the graph according to\nhow often they bounce; the more often, the lighter they get since the light\nwill be more diffused accordingly. \n\n\n//One of these days I'll do myself a favor and get a linux box I promise ;)\n\n\nThanks again for your feedback!\n\n\nJelle.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002529.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002529", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
