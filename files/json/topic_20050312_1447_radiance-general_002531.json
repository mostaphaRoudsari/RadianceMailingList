When I tried all other commands there in no such a problem so I supposed I have set correct my path. 3ds2mgf does not appear eihter in this list: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/index.htm Does exist such a program in radiance?\n\n\nFor this reason I decided to make it with an \"indirect process\" and export my model as .obj (I used anim8or (www.anim8or.com ) to make model and export it as 3ds and obj as well)\n\n\nI used \nobj2rad thermos6.obj > thermos6.rad \nand successfully thermos6.rad was created.\n\n\nBut when I call\nobjview thermos6.rad there is the following error:\n      oconv -f -r 16384 example.rad /usr/tmp/lt27666.rad > usr/tmp.ov27666.oct\n      oconv: fatal - (thermos6.rad): undefined modifier \"mesh01\"\n      rad: error generating octree usr/tmp/ov27666.oct removed\n\n\nSame error ( oconv: fatal - (thermos6.rad): undefined modifier \"mesh01\") appears when I call oconv command\n\n\nCan anyone help me? What I am I doing wrong? How can I solve the problem?\n(by the way I have also used 3D studio max to try for a simpler model but the same problem appears, so I assume that it is not a problem of anim8or exporting)\n\n\nHere are the files i used:\nwww.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~cs99dm1/rad/thermos6.rad (430K)\nwww.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~cs99dm1/rad/thermos6.3ds (30K)\nwww.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~cs99dm1/rad/thermos6.obj (80K)\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot,\nDespina\n\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002531.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002531", "created_by": "Despina_Michael"}
