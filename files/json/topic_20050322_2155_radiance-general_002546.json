SPOT is a free software program \nthat assists in the design and installation of photosensor systems in \ndaylit environments.  In addition, SPOT is a useful tool for general \ndaylighting and daylight and electric light integration analysis.  The \nprogram consists of a Microsoft Excel based user interface with a \nRadiance engine performing the calculations in the background.  The \nnewest version SPOT Beta 2.1 can be downloaded from the SPOT website \nat:  (please uninstall any previous versions of SPOT)\n\n\nwww.archenergy.com/SPOT <http://www.archenergy.com/SPOT>\n\n\nThe main forum for Q & A, bug reports, product updates, and other \nannouncements will be through a SPOT discussion list.
