(I added arrows manually)\n\n\nIs there a way to make the lighting smoother in area  where red arrows show? \n\n\nI used this to take the result:\nrpict -x 600 -y 600 -t 30 -ab 2 -ar 10000 -aa 1.0 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -st 0 -sj 1 -lw 0 -lr 8 -vf camera.vp thermos12_base.oct > res.hdr\n\n\nThanks,\nDespina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002549.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002549", "created_by": "Despina_Michael"}
