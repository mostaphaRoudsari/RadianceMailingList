{"topic": "how to filter objects by modifier?", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Lars O.

I know that I could simply alias them\nto void, however, I don't want to keep geometry in my rather large scenes\nwhen not necessary.\n\n\nI found that some translators (e.g. obj2rad) have such features during\nimport, however, I can't use the tool-for-everything mgfilt here and don't\nknow any other way to filter radiance scenes which have already been\nimported.\n\n\nThe background for this question: I have windows objects as instances in my\nscene. These are complete models of the windows including frames and glass\npanes. I want to use mkillum to have the glass as light source, but as\nillums cannot been instanced, I have to treat the glass panes different. My\nidea was to filter the glasspanes out, the create the octree for the\ninstance (replamrks -i), than filter out everything except the glass pane\nand place theses \"objects\" (in fact all the glass panes of one window) with\nreplmark -x. I know that I could simply have to rad-files per object for\nthat (one with the glass panes and one with the frame), but I have to stay\nclose to my CAD-files here, as the whole project consists of quite a lot of\nobjects.\n\n\nSo is there any known way to filter radiance scenes? Or should I just forget\nabout this and use replmarks -x for all the windows? Will add some MB to my\nscene...\n\n\nTIA, CU and happy easter,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002557.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002557", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
