I have a couple questions again, on this\n1. In the paper \"High Dynamic Range Image Encodings\" is mentioned that RGBE \nformat cannot cover the visible gamut.\nI can not understand this since RGBE supports 76 order of magnitudes and our \neye can see luminances between 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^-7 that is ontly 13 orders of \nMagnitudes.\nThe only thing that I can think is that propaply RGBE can not encode small \nsteps of change for luminance. Is that the reason that RGBE cannot cover the \nvisible gamut?\n\n\n2. and my second question is what we mean by relative precision of an hdr \nimage format? Is the smallest step (change of lumminance) that format \nsupports? (and why we measure it in %?)\nIf it is so, when the value of relative precision is greater means that we \nhave greater precision (smaller step) or the opposite?\n\n\n\n\nDespina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-March/002567.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002567", "created_by": "Despina_Michael"}
