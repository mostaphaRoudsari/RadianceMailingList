Is this the way \nclipping planes operate?\nIf so, it suggests that the rendering is created after the clipping \nplane is applied and therefore doesn\u2019t include objects that are between \nthe viewpoint and the fore clipping plane.\n\n\nThis can be seen where the ceiling meets the wall and where the floor \nmeets the wall in the perspective image.  (-ab 2 -ad 1000 -av  .368 \n.368 .368 -as 500 -ar 500 -aa .15 -dj .03)\n\n\nThe parallel view is also created with a clipping plane that seems to \nexpose the wall interior, the scalloped isoline at the top of the \nimage.
