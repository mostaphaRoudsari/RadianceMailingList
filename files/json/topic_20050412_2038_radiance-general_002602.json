You can get it \nin last night's HEAD, and the synopsis is below:\n\n\nNAME\n        mksource - compute distant sources for RADIANCE image-based \nlighting\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n        mksource [ -d nsamps ][ -t thresh ][ -a maxang ] [ octree ]\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n        Mksource produces a RADIANCE scene description of distant illum \nsources\n        corresponding to bright, concentrated  regions  in  the  given  \nambient\n        environment.   Any local geometry is ignored in the input \noctree, which\n        should be derived from a captured light probe.  The output \nsources  may\n        then  be  combined  with  this  environment to produce a more \nefficient\n        scene for rendering, faster and less prone to sampling artifacts.\n\n\n\n\nI'd be interested in feedback if you give this a try.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002602.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002602", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
