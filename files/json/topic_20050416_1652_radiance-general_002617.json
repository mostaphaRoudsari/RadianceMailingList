As you \ncan see, some surfaces are rendered as black (the region over the \narches). These errors arise since I added more and more geometry. The \nmodel is made up of a lot (!!!) of instances, to get all the geometry \ninto memory, but I know that there is some problem with overlapping \ninstances. So is this a symptom for such problems, or am I experiencing \nsomething completely different here?\n\n\nI attach the small pic, which should be ok for the list. Thank you for \nany help, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002617.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002617", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
