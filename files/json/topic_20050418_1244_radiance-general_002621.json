The contrast is better with ximage and I would like to take \nthe output as my final image.  Is there an easy way to do this ?  I use \nthe default values for all options.\n\n\nA few things I've tried:\n\n\nximage -e auto hdr.pic\n# produces nice high-contrast rendition of image\n\n\npcond hdr.pic ldr.pic\nximage ldr.pic\n# tonemapping is inferior\n\n\nra_tiff ldr.pic ldr.tif\nxview ldr,tif\n# tonemapping is still not good.  This suggests that it is not the 2.2 \ngamma of ximage that makes the images look good, because ra_tiff also \nuses 2.2 gamma correction (according to the documentation).\n\n\n  ximage -e auto ldr,pic\n# tonemapping is better, but still not quite as good as the original.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for any tips!\nRoland Fleming\n\n\n\n\nr o l a n d   f l e m i n g   p h d\nr e s e a r c h   s c i e n t i s t\n\n\nm a x   p l a n c k   i n s t i t u t e   f o r   b i o l o g i c a l   \nc y b e r n e t i c s\ns p e m a n n s t r .   3 8\n7 2 0 7 6    t u e b i n g e n\ng e r m a n y\n\n\nt e l ::   [ + 4 9 ]   0 7 0 7 1   6 0 1 - 6 0 9\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002621.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002621", "created_by": "Roland_William_Fleming"}
