I had a hierarchical \nstructure of nested octrees (instances), which were not really good. I \nhad used this structure as I wanted to \"bundle\" geometry into some more \ncubic-like clusters. In fact, I did the opposite as I later \"invented\" \nthe use of ximage to repeat objects - the result was that the octree \ncontained not this \"cube-like\" block, but all the instances of this \nblock - and thus this octree was not cube-like any more.\n\n\nNow I use instances only on a lower level, for small objects, and use \nxform everywhere else. The errors are gone, as there are fewer \noverlappings of octrees now.\n\n\nCU and thanks a lot, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002623.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002623", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
