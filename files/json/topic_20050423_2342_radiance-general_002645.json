I recently installed the .deb\npackages for radiance, but I'm having some problems with the oconv command.\nFor some reason bash can't find it. I followed the instructions for\ninstalling the .deb files <a\nhref=http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/packages/>here\n<a>, and did not see any mention of oconv. Is this a separate package I need\nto install? Is there another PATH that needs to be set? Any help you could\noffer would be appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDave Maino\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002645.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002645", "created_by": "J._David_Maino"}
