I \nhave been searching in Andrew Glassner's collection (from mgf website) \nand in Radiance's libraries, without success, and I don't have samples \nhere. So it would be great if someone has it in his collection, if not, \nI will go find samples and scan them...\n\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-April/002650.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002650", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
