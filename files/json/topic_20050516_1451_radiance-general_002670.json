So far I always used\ninstances generated by oconv, and the -r setting was always the one that I\nalso used when assembling the whole scene (the same with -n). Now I use\nobj2mesh, and a question comes to my mind. If I follow the rule -r >\nbounding cube / smallest face, I can use a much smaller -r for obj2mesh then\nfor the finally assembling oconv. However, does that make sense? Or will I\nproduce trouble with differing resolution settings for instances, meshes and\nthe complete scene?\n\n\nThe reason for my question is that the model I am working on is currently\ngrowing a lot, and I a getting trouble with really large oconv processes\nwhen assembling the scene ( > 1 GB) or, when using the -n parameter, slow\nrenderings...\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002670.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002670", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
