I \nhave an obj-file, and if I load it with obj2rad, I get a nice radiance \nmodel of the file. If I use obj2mesh, the model has errors.\n\n\nThere are zero-surface polygons reported, so the CAD geometry is not \nreally clean. However, I thought that the basic parser would be the \nsame in both translators. Have I been wrong here? My problem is that I \njust decided to use mesh objects instead of instanced geometry \nresulting from obj2rad. So I wonder if I should go back in this case \nnow.\n\n\nBelow the small images, \"nice\" from obj2rad, \"corrupt\" from obj2mesh \n(both as seen in objview).\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002674.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002674", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
