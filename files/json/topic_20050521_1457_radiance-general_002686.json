This gives me some visual \nimpression of a mosiac and the right color of gold (I use the measured \nvalues by Andrew Glassner).\n\n\nHowever, as for the indirect calculation, I wonder if I am completely \nwrong with this material. I have a specularity of 1.0 in my definition, \nwhile the effect of using this material as mosaic (not large, plane \nsheets of gold ;-) will in fact give a diffuse reflection in the large \nscale of e.g. a complete dome. So there is a difference in the material \nbehaviour between the scale of a single piece of mosaic (which is more \nor less planar and may have this 100% specular reflectivity) and the \nscale of the building, where the material is \"mosaic\" consisting of \nmillions of pieces, and diffuse.\n\n\nI once planned to do some experiments with some kind of a \"virtual \nphotometer\", where I could measure the output of a modeled sample from \nvarious directions. I did not do so simply because of a lack of time. \nAnd I was quite pleased by the effect of using the roughness parameter. \nNow I am worried, because I wonder if the diffuse effect of the mosaic \nwill be neglected in the indirect calculation?\n\n\nThank You for any help, have a nice week-end, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002686.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002686", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
