If I use an \nalias pointing to another alias, should this work? E.g.:\n\n\nvoid plastic my_mat\n0\n0\n5 .3 .2 .1 .2 0\n\n\nvoid alias lars_mat my_mat\nvoid alias new_mat lars_mat\n\n\nShould the modifier new_mad be valid, with the same properties as \nmy_mat? I am  experiencing that this does not work.\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002687.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002687", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
