In the result I get 2 of everything, objects\n& light sources. I must be doing something wrong. Is it something to do with\nselecting the right points, or the positioning of the probe?\n\n\nThanks for any help\n\n\nTarik\n\n\nTarik Rahman\nPhD student, Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour\nSchool of Informatics\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002689.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002689", "created_by": "Tarik_Rahman"}
