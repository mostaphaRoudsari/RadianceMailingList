Now upond exploring the .fmt file it refers to the 'void lamp\nglow' in this instance its: 4 0 3.57 14.72 860 \n\n\nI think that this may be the line I need to change to alter the colour?\nUnless it's already taken care of in the ies2rad conversion via the .dat\nfile in which case I need to alter the 0.907 0.863 0.4762 values relative to\ndesired K values. I'd be indebted to anyone that can provide the relevan\ncombination for the two lamp colours I'm looking for.\n\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n\nAnthony Farrell\nDublin Institute of Technology\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002693.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002693", "created_by": "Anthony_J._Farrell"}
