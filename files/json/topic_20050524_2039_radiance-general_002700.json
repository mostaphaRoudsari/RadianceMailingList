So e.g. I have a \nbunch of objects that get modified by \"marble_edgings\", and later, I \nuse \"void alias marble_edgings marble_grey_1\" to assign these objects \ntheir actual material. Now I want to exclude them from the ambient \ncalculation (as you can see by the name, these edgings are not really \nimportant, they are small-surface objects). Can I use -ae \nmarble_edgings, which is the alias, or do I have to use -ae \nmarble_grey_1, which is the (plastic) modifier?\n\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n\n\n(Yes, I tried with rvu, but didn't notice a big difference, that's why \nI have to ask now ;-)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002700.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002700", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
