How could I get my hands on it?\n\n\n//as a more personal question: c-shells? Have you been tempted by any of the\n//p-languages (Python, Perl, Php)? Excuse me for not being a *nix guru, but\n//I think it would be a good idea to code the c-shell scripts as a (Python?)\n//module? Speaking for myself myself, but it would ease up scripting\n//radiance considerably. Idea?\n\n\nCheers, Jelle.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002711.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002711", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
