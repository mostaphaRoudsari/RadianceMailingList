VERY COOL.  However, when I run\nthe command:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf | rtcontrib -ffc \\\n         `vwrays -d -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf` @render.opt \\\n          -o c_%s.pic -m light1 -m light2 scene.oct\n\n\nI get the following message:\nrtrace warning: zero ambient accuracy so \"test.amb\" not opened\n\n\n...but I did have -aa set to .1 (and this is in my render.opt file), and\nthere is a valid ambient cache.\n\n\nTwo questions:\na) Why is this happening?\n\n\nb) Is this the only reason for the direct-only component showing up in the\nrenderings, or is this the intended result of the command?  IOW, I was\nhoping to be able to create renderings that showed the net result of a\nsingle light source, but both its direct *and* indirect contributions to\nthe scene. Can this be done?\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-May/002714.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002714", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
