There are several correlations of light depreciation with lightpipe\ndepth, and of course the light pipe reflectance is key to this. Most light\npipes are 97 - 99 per cent specular reflective. Could you please elaborate\nhow one would implement the glow material and brightfunc relative to a given\nrelation and light pipe reflectance?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message has been scanned for content and \nviruses by the DIT Information Services MailScanner \nService, and is believed to be clean.\nhttp://www.dit.ie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002730.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002730", "created_by": "Anthony_J._Farrell"}
