The pipe used the 3M film, but had a square cross section and glowing sides. See the intensity distribution and the luminance distribution along the full lightpipe length at \n\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/lightpipe\n\n\nThe intensity distribution was measured approximately at the center of the length of the pipe. \n\n\nMarin Moeck, Penn State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002731.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002731", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
