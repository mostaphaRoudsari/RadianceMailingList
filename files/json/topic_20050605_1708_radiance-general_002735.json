There seems to be a conflict. Mkillum without -ab 1 works fine, but anything else is now disfunctional, meaning, it just runs without end. Can others please check if they have similar experiences?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMartin Moeck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002735.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002735", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
