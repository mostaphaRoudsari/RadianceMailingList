I know that the Desktop Radiance has some problems, but the scene I want to render is quit simple, so I think I can handle the text-based input files, without the AutoCAD GUI.\r\n\n\nI found that in the \"Desktop Radiance Overview\", it is said:\r\n\n\n\"For individuals who are familiar with the standard Radiance program, the advanced features that are not currently part of the Desktop Radiance system can be accessed through the MS-DOS batch files by modifying the original text-based input.\"\r\n\n\nSo my question is can all Radiance features be accessed in this way? Is it stable and reliable?\r\n\n\nThanks.\r\n\n\nYours,\r\n\n\nHuang Weixin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002737.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002737", "created_by": "Huang_Weixin"}
