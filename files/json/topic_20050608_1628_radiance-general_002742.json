So in order to get a more intelligent rpict settings based on the open\nsurface area  would be a good start. Now my question would be whether\npossible rad (don't think so) takes this relation into account, or has\nanyone another suggestion of doing so. \n\n\nRight now, I'm making a couple of rough intermediary tests, try to come up\nwith a couple of reasonable settings, and interpolate through them, but it\nwould be cool to do this in a more formal manner, such that will be an\nadvantage for later on since it could be quite useful.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJelle.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002742.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002742", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
