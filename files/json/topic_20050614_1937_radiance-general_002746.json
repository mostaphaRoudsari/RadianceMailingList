I am referring to paper \n(http://diuf.unifr.ch/courses03-04/imaging/simoncelli.pdf). This paper \nsuggest that to calculate contrast luminance is first needs to be \ncalculated.\nI am calculating lumninance using the formula.\nL_w = exp[ 1 / N( sum[ log( delta + L_w ( x, y ) ) ] ) ]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n  * L_w - log-average luminance\n  * N - number of pixels in the image\n  * delta - a small factor to avoid problems with black pixels\n  * L_w ( x, y ) - the world space luminance for pixel ( x, y )\n\n\nwhere log has base e.\n\n\nI am using the image from http://www.cacs.louisiana.edu/~cice/lal/. i \ncant get the luminance values mentioned on the website.\nCan someone please tell me where am i going wrong.\n\n\nthanks\nJay\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002746.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002746", "created_by": "Jay"}
