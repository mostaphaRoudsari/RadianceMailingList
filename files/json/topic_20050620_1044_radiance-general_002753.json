Are you trying to create an accurate internal lighting analysis, or generate a nice render from the outside? If\nthe latter, there are all sorts of ways you could cheat - starting with texture / bump / alpha mapping.\n\n\nHave you tried modeling this without using xform? ie: use some sort of script to generate all the cylinder geometry in their final\npositions so that oconv has less work to do?\n\n\nmike\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002753.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002753", "created_by": "Michael_Kruger"}
