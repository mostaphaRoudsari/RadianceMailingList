I have researched the following site to get some background about \nthis:\n\n\nhttp://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/\n\n\n>From searching through the archive of this message board I came across a \nresponse by Greg to a previous question that I had for adjusting the sun \ncolor:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-January/002263.html\n\n\nMy question is how may I convert from a CIE(x,y) chromaticity to RGB using \non two variables as was performed for the above. The Radiance function file \nxyz_rgb.cal requires three variables (x,y and the luminosity, z). The reason \nwhy I am asking this is because I wish for the values that I'll employ to be \nin the physically valid range (i.e. .265074126*r + .670114631*g + \n.064811243*b = 1).\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002765.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002765", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
