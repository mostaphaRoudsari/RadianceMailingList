I need to subdivide the polygons\nmany time before this effect becomes less noticeable ...\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-June/002776.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002776", "created_by": "Francesco_Anselmo"}
