Instead \nof rendering two frames apart and composit both into one image with \nfields later, I am thinking about a solution in wich I render two \nviewpoints in one image directly.\nIn this image all even scanlines should show view01 and all odd \nscanlines should show view 2 (or in reverse order, I dont know yet).\n\n\nCurrently I work with the following command to render my animation with:\nvwrays -fd -vf view8_0001.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304 | rtrace -av 20 20 20 \n-ab 0 -st 0.01  -x $1  -y $1 -fdd -ovpN model-ani.oct\n\n\nI think it should be possible to extend this command in order to fit my \nneed, but I don't know where to start.\n\n\nAn example of the result I like to achieve can be found on \nhttp://www.toren.com/radiance/fields.jpg\n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\nPS:\nIn 2003 (?) we discussed in this forum about imageprocessing for \nanimation. Two years later, I managed to create some images.\nI put the very first result on http://www.toren.com/radiance/imgshader.html.\nThe processed image shown there is created by a program I wrote that \nreads the output from the above command:\nvwrays -fd -vf view8_0001.vp -pa 0 -x 2880 -y 2304 | rtrace -av 20 20 20 \n-ab 0 -st 0.01  -x $1  -y $1 -fdd -ovpN model-ani.oct,\nso I am rather dependend of this output of rtace. In other words, I am \nsearching for a solution to render two views in one image, using \nsomewhat the same pipeline as I do now.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002794.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002794", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
