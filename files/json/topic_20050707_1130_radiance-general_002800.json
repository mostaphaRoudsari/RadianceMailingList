Everything is working fine. I'm useing XFCE4 as desktop and \nhave no probs with other X11 progs.\n\n\nWhen starting rview, like with one of the makefiles provided in the \nobj-directory of the sources a window with a correct title pops up for a \nfew millisecs and than disappears again. In my xterm I get the message \n\"Illegal instruction\".\nI found out that this message does not belong to the radiance source \ncode, so it will probably belong to X.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any idea, how I can find out more on this problem or \nhow to solve it?\n\n\nRegards,\nMario Minati\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002800.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002800", "created_by": "Mario_Minati"}
