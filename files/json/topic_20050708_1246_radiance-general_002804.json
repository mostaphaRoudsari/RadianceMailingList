I am currently \ntrying to make rendering times shorter, excluding detail geometry from \nthe ambient calculation. Using -ae, I got the \"too many modifiers\" \nmessage, and switched to -aE with a file containing the modifier names. \nHowever this did not help. So how many modifiers can I exclude with a \nstandard-compile radiance (I guess it is defined somewhere in the \nsources)?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002804.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002804", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
