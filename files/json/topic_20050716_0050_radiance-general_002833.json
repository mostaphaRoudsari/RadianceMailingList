The paper proof is at \n\n\nwww.personal.psu.edu/mum13/rays.pdf\n\n\nIt should appear in about 2 weeks in LEUKOS at www.iesna.org. \n\n\nAnyway, I was quite surprised how many rays it takes to get stable results. We traced up to 7 million rays through a specular microlouver sold by www.Siteco.de. We took the exiting ray distribution towards the room and converted it into an IES photometric format file in 1-degree vertical and 22.5 degree horizontal steps for use in Radiance or other lighting calculation programs. \n\n\nMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002833.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002833", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
