What I wish to do is to be able to alter/shift the color of a \ntexture map within a render. I could probably do this is colorpict alone but \nbecause I deal with so many faces (50 000 - 500 000), if I wanted to adjust \nsome of the input parameters for the function file, I would have to change \nthe values during a re-export with my Radiance conversion program. This can \nbe a time consuming process to re-export and recompile the scene in order to \ntweak some parameters. Ideally what would happen is that I would pass the \ncolor returned by colorpict to colorfunc, where my function file would then \nalter the color in accordance with my input parameters. From there, I would \npass the altered color returned by colorfunc to a plastc, plastic2, metal, \netc. material. I would only have one colorfunc (unlike the thousands of \ncolorpicts) so I can adjust the parameters manually during the test \nrendering phase. Is this possible?\n\n\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002834.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002834", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
