I \napologize if you receive it twice!\n\n\nHello, \n\n\nHas anyone an example of how to write a .cal function for plasfunc, \nfor a given BRDF?\nSpecifically, I am not sure which predefined variables correspond to \nthe view direction vector.\n\n\nThis is the BRDF I want to use in Radiance: \nV(i,j,n,a)=(1/PI)*(a/(a+(i dot n)(j dot n))\n:i is unit vector from the source direction, j is unit vector of view \ndirection, n is surface normal, a some other parameter.\n\n\nI know the Radiance-predefined variable names for the source direction \n(x,y,z) and surface normal (Nx,Ny,Nz), but I am not sure what to use \nfor the view direction.\n\n\nCan anyone help? \nThank you!\nkatja\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002835.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002835", "created_by": "Katja_Doerschner"}
