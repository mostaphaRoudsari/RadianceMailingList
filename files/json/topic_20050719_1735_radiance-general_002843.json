Those are some of my most dark & inner secrets only to\nbe shared with certain mailing lists ;)\nThe idea is to find a way to communicate the abundance of data a Radiance\nimage contains. One of the more original ways of doing so, is perhaps the\nexample given _the book_, where Charles Ehrlich is pointing out how to fake\nasa/iso exposure of a Radiance image. Which isn't a particularly useful\nthing to do, but does give insight to the extent of control a decent\nRadiance operator has. \n\n\nThanks for supporting the virtual prototype thing... I'm not a fan of\nmarketing yadi yadi yah, but one has to stand firm when comes to Radiance\naccuracy. The point of accurately modeling light & materials is taken, for\nsure.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJelle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey Jelle,\n\n\nJust a few thoughts here. Explaining rendering systems to clients is \nalways difficult. I think that unfortunately clients typically just want \ngood looking images and do not neccessarily care how the images is \n\"made.\" However, I think that you are probably on a good track to \nconsider the results of a Radiance simulation as a virtual prototype, \nwhich means something more than just a \"rendering.\" But in order for \nthis to hold true, the underlying data, (lighting levels, materials, \ngeometry and other fundamental assumptions in the scene) used to \ngenerate the simulations needs to be \"accurate\" to some standard \nsuitable for the given objective. Filtering an image with tone mapping \noffers one way to view the scene in the image.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002843.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002843", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
