I have asked one question about mapping texture and thanks very much for your answers. But now I am still not clear about those functions.\nI use \"frac(U) frac(V) \" to tile the texture just like an example I found on the Internet. But I found there are other methods to do so such as \"tile_u tile_v\". I have searched in the book \"Rendering with Radiance\", but can not find explanation about it.  Also I can not find further explanations of function clip( ) and noop( ). Is there anything I can refer to or are they just somwhere in the book \"Rendering with Radiance\"?\n\n\nWould you please help me on this naive question? Thanks a lot.\n\n\nyours,\nHuang\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002848.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002848", "created_by": "Huang_Weixin"}
