The lightsources cause \nspecular reflections with very bright specular spots (highlights) on the \nfloor. These specular spots do not look realistic (better said: these \nhighlights disturb in the image, because there are so many of them).\nI have tweaked the specular, roughness and rendering parameters also, \nbut I can't  get rid of these specular reflection highlights, apart from \nmaking the roughnes very small or 0. But with low or zero rougness the \nrelections of the other geometry become too sharp.\nIs there a way to model a reflective material (or lightsource?) without \na ( or a dimmed) specular reflection highlight ?\nOr any other suggestion?\n\n\nIebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002849.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002849", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
