Searching the online db, I found \ndiscussion of this glaze.csh script. Does this create a better model for \na fritted glass, and is this used with mkillum?  My definition for the \nglass comes from Optics 5.\n\n\nThanks!\nZack\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers\nEngineer / Daylighting Designer\nArchitectural Energy Corporation\n2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201\nBoulder, CO 80301 USA\n\n\ntel (303)444-4149 ext.235\nfax (303)444-4304\nhttp://www.archenergy.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002854.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002854", "created_by": "Zack_Rogers"}
