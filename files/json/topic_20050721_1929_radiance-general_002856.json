Is it assumed that in general, the light conditions \nin a building are like that? I have used a -av of .5 .5 .5 here, \ntogether with -ae excluded objects (I wrote enough questions on that \ntopic ;-). This results in a strange image, as the calculated ambient \nis redish, and the ambient-excluded objects appear very strange (like \nblueish) because they are the only objects illuminated by this neutral \ncolor. I can understand that if using -ab 0, setting a colored -av \nwould not make sense as ALL indirect illumination would be neutral \nthan.\n\n\nSo, am I right that in the case here (I use the -av settings only for \nthe -ae excluded objects in a scene that is rendered with -ab 2), using \na neutral value would be simply wrong and I have to use the \"measured\" \n(from rview) radiance?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002856.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002856", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
