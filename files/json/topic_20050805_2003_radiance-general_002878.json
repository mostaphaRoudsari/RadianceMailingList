These files have not been posted as yet on radiance-online, as  \nPeter A-B is off on vacation for the week.  I expect he'll get around  \nto it before too long, and meanwhile the HEAD dump will be very close  \nto 3.7.1 (if not identical).\n\n\nI hope to see some of you at the Radiance workshop next week.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002878.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002878", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
