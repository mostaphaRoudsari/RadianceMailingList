I just installed the latest\nversion (rad3R7all) on Mac OSX.4 and it is working\nfine (as long as I start X11 first) with rad, rview,\netc.  I have downloaded and installed\nTclTkAquaBI-8.4.10.0.  I try to run trad from the\nxterm, and I get the following message:\n\n\n$ trad\ntrad: line 12: syntax error at line 16: `(' unexpected\n\n\nThanks for any help you might be able to offer.  I\nhaven't actually run any tcl programs on the mac\nbefore, so perhaps there is something I need to know\nabout that.  I tried installing the tcl launcher and\nthen running trad from the finder, but it didn't work\neither.\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\n-mmatthe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002879.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002879", "created_by": "Andrea_Matthews"}
