There are many references to the old 'rview' program which\nneed changing to 'rvu' in the next release as this directory is a good\nsource of information to new users.\n\n\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002882.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002882", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn"}
