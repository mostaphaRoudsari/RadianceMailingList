To avoid misunderstandings, it doesn't provide any CAD\ninput or the like, (there are other projects aiming at this already) but\nfocuses on making octree generation, scene preview/rendering, parameter \nsetting\netc. more convenient. The stuff is still in an alpha state and not\ncomplete, nevertheless I think time has come to publish it for the first\ntesting . There's also an additional manual for it,  providing at least\nthe basic overview to get you started.\n\n\nAs I combine the trip to Canada for the workshop with some holiday, I\nwill be out of reach for the upcoming weeks, leaving you pretty much alone\nwith this stuff, so be prepared to wait a bit longer for answers from me :-)\n\n\nGood luck & have fun\n-Carsten\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002884.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002884", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer"}
