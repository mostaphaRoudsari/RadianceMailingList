Aug 2005. As before,\npatches are generated nightly between the last official (rad3R7P1) and the \ncurrent HEAD release. \n\n\nAs an extra, Greg has thrown in binaries for MacOs and Linux. The latter\nwere compiled here, which is a \"Debian, i386, Sarge\" Linux distribution. I'd\nexpect the binaries to run on other, reasonable current, Linux dists as well.\n\n\nso much for house keeping, \nhappy rendering\n\n\nregards\nPeter Apian-Bennewitz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002885.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002885", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
