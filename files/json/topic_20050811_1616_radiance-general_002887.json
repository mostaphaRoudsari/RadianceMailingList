I am finding it \nvery useful. What I would like to know is if it is possible to adjust the UV \nshift and scale of a pattern associated with a mesh? Say if a pattern tiles \n4 times in the U and V, if I want for it to tile 1,2,3,6,8,etc. times and I \nwish to shift the patern by 1/2, is there a method for doing this?\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002887.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002887", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
