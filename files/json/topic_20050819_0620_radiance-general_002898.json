I have moved this discussion to the general section as \nrequested.\n\n\nThe white card method that Chas proposed was my \"Plan B\" if no white \nsurfaces were available. I'll have to try the method that Greg suggested. \nThe error message, \"exposure out of range\", that I receive is from pfilt.\n\n\nRegarding the code modification, I am unsure if this method will work the \nway that I wish. If I am using a color, I could vary its hue with colorfunc \nbut if I am using in image map with colorpict (wood floors are generally the \nmost offending material with regard to color bleeding), I do not think that \nI can vary the color in accordance with a color bleeding parameter.\n\n\nThanks for all of everyone's help (including the email from cb)\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002898.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002898", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
