{"topic": "Errors in ambient calculation in 3R7P1?", "category": "radiance-dev", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Mark Stock", "created_at": "August 20, 2005 at 07:15AM", "body": "I am testing a new benchmark scene to replace the old \"mirror \npyramid\" scene, and I came across some strange behavior in the \n3R7P1 release.\n\n\nThe benchmark scene and spase table is at:\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html\n\n\nThe 3R7P1 image in question is:\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/radmisc/bench4_02.png\n\n\nThe same commands, under 3R6P1, created this:\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/radmisc/bench4_01.png\n\n\nSo, neither of the images are perfect, but the large black areas \nin the 3R7P1 image worry me. I have tried very similar scenes \nwith nearly similar parameters, and every other time I run it, \nthose dark spots appear on the fractal object in the middle. I am \nstill running more tests on every Radiance install that I can \nfind.\n\n\nSome notes about the benchmark scene: I tried to include a \ngreater variety of commonly-used Radiance objects and modifiers. \nThe majority of the time spent, though, is still in the ambient \ncalculation---the forte of our favorite software. But I included \na large colorpict/mixpict, an obj2mesh object (with normals), \nplastic, interface, glass and metal, daylight and electric light, \nand large and small features. The render takes long enough that \nparallel machines of 2010 still won't be able to finish it in \nless than a minute. The bench2 scene saw speed improvements of \nnearly 100-fold over it's 5-year history. Any comments about the \nbenchmark scene are also welcome.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-August/000633.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000633", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
