{"topic": "Radiance 3.7.2 patch release", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "August 22, 2005 at 07:15PM", "body": "Well, another significant bug was discovered in the interreflection  \ncalculation of the new release, prompting me to create a new patch  \ndistribution, version 3.7.2.  This may be found in the usual place at:\n\n\n     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\n\n\nI have also recompiled everything under Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X,  \nso the posted binaries contain the fix.  The problem manifests in  \ncertain complex environments, causing severe underestimation on rare  \noccasions, and didn't show up in my initial tests.  It took me a  \ncouple of hours to track down the problem, and I spent a few more  \nmaking sure I'd really fixed it.\n\n\nThanks is due to Mark Stock for creating the killer test scene and  \npointing out the error to me on the radiance-dev list over the  \nweekend.  Mark has been busy creating a new benchmark for Radiance,  \nand will no doubt make an announcement to radiance-general when he  \nfeels it is ready for prime time.  This of course requires that the  \nnew version of Radiance be ready for prime time as well...\n\n\nI appreciate your patience in working out these difficulties.  There  \nwere a great many changes in the latest release, and I'm not  \nsurprised to find one or two glitches.  I hope this is the last of  \nthe serious ones requiring a patch release.  I expect Peter A-B will  \nupdate radiance-online shortly.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002899.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002899", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
