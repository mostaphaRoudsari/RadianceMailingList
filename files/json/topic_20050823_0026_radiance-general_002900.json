I tried looking through the archives, but could\nnot find anything specific I might have to do when compiling or installing\nRadiance to take advantage of the 64 bit processing. What is the best\napproach that people have found to build and run Radiance on a 64 bit\nmachine? I'm not a Linux expert by any means, so any little tidbits of\ninformation would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002900.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002900", "created_by": "J._David_Maino"}
