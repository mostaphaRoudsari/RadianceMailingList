I have billiard balls that\nare a \"plastic\" material and a large area light above them. For some reason\nthe area light appears in their reflections as a grid of squares (or\ncircles now that I've changed the roughness). The shadows even show this\nbreak-up of the area light.\n\n\nHere's a small sample:\nhttp://www.ian.testers.homelinux.net/dump/billiard_main4.weird\n(hosted on my ADSL line, be nice!)\n\n\nI've tried fiddling with -dj and -ds, and a few other rpict parameters, but\nthey don't seem to do much at all. Is this a bug in Radiance 3.7 or am I\ndoing something wrong? I've never had this problem with area lights in\nRadiance before.\n\n\nthanks,\nbye\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002904.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002904", "created_by": "Ian_Tester"}
