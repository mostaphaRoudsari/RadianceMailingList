I have run into some issues \nwith 1-3 of my colors (depending on the scanner settings) being out of gamut \nfrom reviewing by debug.pic. What I would like to know is if there is any \nway to rectify this situation? If not, how concerned should I be with this? \nI wish to use calibrated colors in order to match some of the paint color \nswatches that are available at many hardware stores for use in my \nrenderings.  Regarding my scanner, I am using an Epson Perfection 2480. Its \na great scanner and therefore I wish not to have to replace it in order to \nexperiment in finding another scanner that will keep the colors within \ngamut. As far as my scanner settings, I choose no auto exposure (selecting \nthis option too leaves some colors out of gamut) and no color correction. \nAny thoughts or ideas?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-August/002917.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002917", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
