That is materials whose BRTDF is not more complex than a TRANS-type. So that i don't have to worry too much about them (??).\nSome textil materials (such as molleton for theater applications)  seem to be good diffusing ones, with an almost lambertian behaviour, but i'm still searching...\nHas anybody in the community a good tip (matt paint, etc.)?\n\n\nThanks a lot for any contribution and have a nice day,\nfederico\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002920.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002920", "created_by": "Federico_Giovannetti"}
