The new version should be in  \ntonight's HEAD dump, or you can grab it directly from CVS:\n\n\n     http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ \nray/src/util/rtcontrib.c?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-csrc\n\n\nIt doesn't depend on any other changes in HEAD, so you can drop it  \ninto src/util and run \"rmake install\" there if you've run \"makeall  \ninstall\" previously.\n\n\nThis may be the cause of Francesco's mysterious problem using -f and - \no together on the PC.  I'm not sure about that, though.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002939.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002939", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
