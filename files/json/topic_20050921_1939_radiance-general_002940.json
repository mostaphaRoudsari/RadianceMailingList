Apparently, the Linux  \nimplementation of the fseeko(3) library call is broken.  This means  \nthat the recovery (-r) option in rtcontrib will not work with files  \nlarger than 2 GB under Linux.  It also means that we need to compile  \nrtcontrib with -Dfseeko=fseek for the time being, until they get this  \nfixed.  (I wouldn't hold my breath, given how long it's taken them to  \nfix other problems in little-used functions.)\n\n\nI have added -Dfseeko=fseek to the Linux rmake in makeall in CVS, and  \nI recommend that anyone wishing to use rtcontrib under Linux modify  \ntheir rmake script manually by adding this define to the MACH=\"\" line  \nthere.  Then, using the latest rtcontrib.c, you can run \"rmake  \ninstall\" in your src/util directory and all should be well.\n\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.  I didn't think either of these problems  \nwas worth a patch release, but I also want rtcontrib to work for  \nthose brave souls who are trying it.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002940.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002940", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
