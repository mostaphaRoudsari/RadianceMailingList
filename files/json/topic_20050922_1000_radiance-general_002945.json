I am sure there is a sophisticated manner  \nin which to achieve this, but I have cobbled together an approach in the  \nfollowing way:\n\n\ndelete the ground source glow from the sky.rad description\nuse rtrace to calculate the values for the points, but set -av 0 0 0 and  \nuse a single material for all surfaces (except apertures!) which is  \nexcluded from the ambient calculation using -ae.\n\n\nThere are some points within the rooms, which I am pretty certain do not  \nhave a direct view of the skydome, and therefore should return a zero  \nvalue, but they do not.\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nregards\n\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Devlin\nXCO2\n1-5 Offord Street\nLondon N1 1DH\n\n\nTel: 020 7700 1000\nFax: 020 7700 4455\n\n\nEngineering Sustainability\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002945.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002945", "created_by": "nick_devlin"}
