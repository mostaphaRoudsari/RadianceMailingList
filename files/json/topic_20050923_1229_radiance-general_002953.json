I believe this is a good  \nthing.\n\n\nYour thoughts would be greatly apprecicated however.\n\n\nmany thanks\n\n\nnick\n\n\n\n\nOn 22.09.2005, at 13:19, nick devlin wrote:\n\n\n> Thomas,\n>  thanks for that.

For your final\nrtrace calculations you can use -ab 0 again and only\nget the \"direct\" contribution of the window illum.\n\n\nI have to admit that I don't know what causes your\nproblems and therefore this approche may fail as well.\n\n\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002953.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002953", "created_by": "nick_devlin"}
