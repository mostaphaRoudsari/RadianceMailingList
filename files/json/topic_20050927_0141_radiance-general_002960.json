Basically, instead of\nhaving a uniform colored object, I want to add some other color to the\nobject but the object is made of uniform material. Can I generate a\n.cal file and directly manipulate the color at specific location using\nlocal coordinates and use colorFunc to add the pattern? It sounds\ntrival to do but I m having trouble generating it right. Thank you\nvery much.\n\n\n\n\nalways on full sail during high tides\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002960.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002960", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao"}
