I am new to Radiance and I want to use this wonderfull software for my Phd in Architecture which involves a lot of simulation.Unfortunately I am aWindows user without time to learn Linux or Unix from scratch.I have looked at the different forms of the windows versions like Desktop radiance, but I discovered on some site that it is for \"less serious\" scientists. Is that true?Also I have been advised to use either CYGWIN or a CD-rom version from ftp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/\nI may not be able to use cygwin 'cos it does not have resume and being in a developing country where electric power supply is not guaranteed, this is aproblem. Also the learnix version too does not have a resume capability(using DAP) variety  for download. Pls I need some advice on what to do. \n\n\nA big thanks to everyone and more grease to everyone's elbows!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbubakar Salisu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo! for Good\n Click here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-September/002963.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002963", "created_by": "Abubakar_Salisu"}
