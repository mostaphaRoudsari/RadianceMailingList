As I am now beginning to  \nexperiment with more shell programming, the question is, are there  \nparticular aspects of RADIANCE that make programming it in a  \nparticular shell more advantageous to others?\n\n\nI was using tcsh (the Mac OSX former default) but am at the point  \nwhere I want to explore other options.\n\n\nThanks for the input - I know this can be a highly personal and/or  \napplication-specific decision, but all thoughts welcome.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
