Some backup programs (take HP's Omniback as an example) \nfail on some of these too. Shells treat spaces as default delimiters. \nIt's all stupid, but it is a fact. That's why there's a somewhat \nfriendly common sense not to use characters which cause problems on \nother systems (like space, double colon, ambersands, etc) volantarily. \nIf you insist on a space in a directory name of a general test scenario \nand declare the whole directory, which serves others purposes, a test \ncase for filename handling, that's fine, but a little pointless IMHO.\n\n\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-October/000658.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000658", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
