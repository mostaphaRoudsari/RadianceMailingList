I'm struggling at bit \nwith this, as documentation on using Radiance with measured BRDF data \nseems not to exist? Can someone give me directions, links to previous \nwork on this, documentation or advice on this?\n\n\nThanks,\nJeppe Vesterbaek\nUnivesity College London\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/002988.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_002988", "created_by": "Jeppe_Vesterbaek"}
