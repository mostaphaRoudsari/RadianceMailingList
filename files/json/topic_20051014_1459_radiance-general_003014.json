The processes are migrated than to other hosts.\n\n\nA, yes, I have the same question for rad -N ...\n\n\nTIA*CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003014.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003014", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
