So \nfar, the views had been in the Makefile itself, each as one target. Now \nI wanted to change this and use a viewfile together with the -P option \nof rpict for multi-processing.\n\n\nI am wondering now how to understand the manual. I used a line like \nthat:\n\n\nrpict -S 1 -P pics.pfile -o pic%02d.pic scene.oct < scene.vf &\n\n\nBecause I thought that the rpict process must go to the background, so \nthat I can start the other processes with\n\n\nrpict -P pics.pfile &\n\n\nHowever, I did not get any output. So was the & after the first rpict \nthe problem? Will it read the scene and send itself to the background, \nwaiting for more processes? Or do I simply have to wait before starting \nthe second rpict, until the first one has read the entire scene?\n\n\nTIA + CU, this multi-processor radiance stuff is really not easy... \nLars.\n\n\nfrom my Makeile:\n\n\npics: scene.oct scene.vf\n\trpict -S 1 -P pics.pfile -o pic%02d.pic scene.oct < scene.vf & \\\n\trpict -P pics.pfile & \\\n\trpict -P pics.pfile &\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003017.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003017", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
