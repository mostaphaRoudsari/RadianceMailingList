I'm 21, from England, and I like to  \ncode. I'm studying Computer Science at University, which I would like to  \ntake into a career of graphical programming. But I think now's the time to  \nstart working on my CV, and getting to grips with programming projects  \nlike those I would like to work on out of college, because I guess I ought  \nto develop myself as a programmer (& I enjoy it!).\n\n\nThe situation that I'm in is that I'd like to start some branch of project  \nwork that I can independently work on, but I really don't know where to  \nbegin, or what contribution you would need....my scope of ambition isn't  \nthat huge - I'm basically looking for something useful that I could  \nproduce for this project, written in c/c++ (but I'm flexible), that an  \nintermediate level programmer could accomplish.\n\n\nI have attempted contribution to such projects before, but am often  \npresented with a situation where I'm coming into the project as a  \nnewcomer, and I'm directed to a hoard of code (tens of megabytes), and  \nit's not that useful. But I'd really like to create/work on little useful  \nbranch I could do for this application. By that I mean, I envision a  \nproject that (hopefully!) implements some useful algorithm(s), that I can  \nactually research and turn into code myself (even if it's just as a  \nstarter, that could lead to more), but I'm not really sure what the  \nproject needs, or where I should start looking. I'd really appreciate it  \nif someone could give me some guidance on this - I know a little about  \nstuff like Bezier curves, Matlab, Markov models, and the kind of stuff  \nthat undergraduates know about. But I'm willing to do more, and put quite  \na bit of time into it.\n\n\n\t\t\tAnyway, thanks for any guidance you can give me,\n\n\n\t\t\t     I just re-read it, and it sounds a bit desperate, but, it's  \nsincere.\n\n\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t\tMayur\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2005-October/000660.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000660", "created_by": "Rx_Mayur"}
