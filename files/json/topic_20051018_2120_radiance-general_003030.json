One thing that has come to my attention is \nthat the overall reflectance seems out of range. For example, a creamy white \ncolor once calibrated has an overall reflectance (determined by ximage and \ngrey(r,g,b)) equal to .93. From RWR I think it was mentioned that a \nreflectance of greater than 80% may be unrealistic. Although I have had some \ncolors out of gamut, particularly Cyan,(noticed by looking at the debug.pic \nfrom macbethcal), there seems to have been no apparent issues with the \nwhite, neutral 8, neutral 6.5, neutral 5, neutral 3.5, black (I am assuming \nthat these patches are used to calibrate the reflectance) during the \ngeneration of the calibration file. Has anyone else encountered this issue?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003030.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003030", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
