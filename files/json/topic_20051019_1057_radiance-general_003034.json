I'm using radiance 3.6 at the moment.\n\n\nThe strange about it: I sucessfully rendered the scene before, and now, \nafter changing some setting, I get this error. In fact, the geometry \nhad been changed, but not the object that is reported to cause the \nproblem.\n\n\nI use oconv with -r 4096 -n 12. Is it possible that this problem occurs \nas a result of a low -r oconv resolution?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003034.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003034", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
