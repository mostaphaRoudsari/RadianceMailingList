Since it has exporter to Radiance, single or\nmulti layer glazings can be easily converted to Radiance format.\nResulting file has a form like:\n\n\nvoid  glass       GlzSys_glass\n0\n0\n3     0.807     0.875     0.849\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    GlzSys_front\n10\n      0.134     0.147     0.147\n      0.740     0.803     0.779\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    GlzSys_back\n10\n      0.134     0.147     0.147\n      0.740     0.803     0.779\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nMy question is how should I use these data in Radiance scene description.\n I suppose that idea is to define window glass with 3 layers:\nGlzSys_front  GlzSys_glass  GlzSys_back\n\n\nAm I right?\n\n\nOne more question: does anyone know how this BRTD parameters are calculated \nfrom Optic5 data?\n\n\nThanks,\nmarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003036.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003036", "created_by": "Marija_Cvetkovic"}
