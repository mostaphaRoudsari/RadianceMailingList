Perez sky gives the luminance  \nvalue at a certain point, but I guess in order to multiply the  \ncontribution of a certain section of the sky, I need to integrate the  \nluminance values inside that section. Is this correct? Can anyone  \npoint me to any reference where this might be explained more? Any  \nideas about how to implement this in a script?\nThank you in advance. Best regards,\n\n\nSantiago\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-October/003046.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003046", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres"}
