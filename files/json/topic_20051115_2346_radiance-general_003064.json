She did not yet check the accuracy of those:\n\n\nIn Photoshop you can Automate --> Merge HDR Photo\n\n\n            Then you select the photos and before it merges them it asks for exposure speed and f-stop values. \n\n\n            You then press Okay and it will compile them.\n\n\n            Then you have to check the White placement level and press Okay\n\n\n            When its finished doing all that you go to \"save as\" a Radiance file\n\n\nThis will give you an HDR format which needs to been processed by Radiance to get a Falsecolor map and luminance ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003064.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003064", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
