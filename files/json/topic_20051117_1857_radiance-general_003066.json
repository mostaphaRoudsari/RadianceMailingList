I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find \nfunction file \"rayinit.cal.\" I searched through the mailing list \narchives and found a few items on the placement of library files and \nsetting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I \nhave my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make sure \nthat rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables are \nexporting properly as I can see the paths when I \"echo $PATH\" and \"echo \n$RAYPATH,\" however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for some \nreason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave Maino\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003066.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003066", "created_by": "J._David_Maino"}
