If I \nunderstood well I should have 2 lines in .rif file: illum and mkillum.\n\n\n-illum line\nShould the file defined in this line contain both glazing material and \nsurface definition or it can contain only one of them?\n\n\n-mkillum line parameters:\n-ab 2 - I suppose this is enough since the environment is clear (no \nobstructions)\n-as and -ad can be the default for rtrace\n-av - What exactly represents this -av value for mkillum?   How could I \ncompute it?  Would the calculation be accurate if this is 0?\n\n\nI am simulating simple room with a window on the South wall.\n\n\nIf I run compamb with rif file containing this mkillum, would it use the \nillum material data? I am asking this because in the book it said that rad \nwould take care for all changes in illum files, but I am not sure if compamb \nwould do that too.\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003083.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003083", "created_by": "Marija_Cvetkovic"}
