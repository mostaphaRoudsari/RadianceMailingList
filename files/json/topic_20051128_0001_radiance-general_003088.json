A\nhighly reflective pipe (approximately 400mm diameter) runs from this\nroof to the ground floor's ceiling where it strikes a diffuser and\nlights the space below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious way to model this would be a vertical cylinder with a highly\nreflective surface inside.  Probably the top surface (where the light\ncomes in) should be an illum surface.  I'm not sure, however, that this\nmethod would be very efficient or accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the best way to model these light pipes?  Has anyone done a\nsimilar thing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrett \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrett Beeson\n\n\nSustainable Designer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNDALL\n\n\nHSBC Building Level 20\n\n\n300 Queen Street\n\n\nBrisbane QLD 4000\n\n\ntel:   +61 (0)7 3023 5048\n\n\nfax:  +61 (0)7 3023 4000\n\n\nwww.cundall.com.au <http://www.cundall.com.au/> \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Notice.
