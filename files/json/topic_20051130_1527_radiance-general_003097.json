I know the type of flourescent tube I want to use (lenght, diameter, Ra-value and lumen) , but I don't know the shape of the reflector yet. I want to optimize the reflector shape and the way it is mounted in relation to the flourescent tube and optionally generate an ISO-lux diagram for the work plane and also to generate an ISO-lux table for import in Excel.\n\n\nI have browsed Radiance-Online for \"luminaire\" and \"lamp\" just to find out that modelling luminaires/lamps always start with using an IESNA candlepower file which I don't have. So where do I start?\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nSteen Traberg-Borup\n\n\n******************************************************************\n\n\nSteen Traberg-Borup                   Phone:          +45 45865533\nDanish Building Research Institute    Direct phone:   +45 45742380\nDepartment of Health and Comfort      Fax:            +45 45867535\nDr. Neergaardsvej 15                  E-mail:           stb at sbi.dk\nDK 2970 Horsholm                      URL:       http://www.sbi.dk\nDenmark\n\n\n******************************************************************\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-November/003097.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003097", "created_by": "Steen_Traberg-Borup"}
