Two days of formal instruction and hands-on\nexercises will be followed by a day during which participants will be\nable to apply the concepts learned to a design project of their\nchoosing. \nThis workshop is open to students and practitioners. \n\n\nProf. Marilyne Andersen, Dr. Christoph Reinhart (NRC Canada)\n\n\nRegistration deadline: December 12, 2005 \n\n\nCourse tuition fee: $180\n\n\n\n\nFor more information: http://architecture.mit.edu/subjects/sp06/4493.pdf\n<http://architecture.mit.edu/subjects/sp06/4493.pdf>   \nFor questions and workshop registration: contact Kathleen Ross at 617-\n253 1876 or kross at mit.edu <mailto:kross at mit.edu>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003111.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003111", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
