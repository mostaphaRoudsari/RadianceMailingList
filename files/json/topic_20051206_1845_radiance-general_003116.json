Has \nsomeone info on the inofficial side to this ?\n(If you are not aware of it, holding the 'menu' button at power-on \ndisplays the firmware version)\nSomeone I talked to mentioned  some undocumented pins on the 4500 USB \nconnector, which  are supposed to be RS232 with remote control \nfeatures.  Apparently he'd be testing this soon.\n\n\nAnyone aware of 3rd party companies selling something like an HDR \nfirmware for NIkons (or other cameras) ?\n\n\nInfo on positive experiences with other brands and HDR control via USB \non Linux would also be much appreciated.\n\n\nTIA\n-Peter\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003116.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003116", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
