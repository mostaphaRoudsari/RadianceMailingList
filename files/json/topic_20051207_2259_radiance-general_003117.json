This adjustment creates a slight \"bump\" in the summertime \ncorner of the analemma when you view a hemispherical fisheye projection \nof the annual sun positions.  (The sun positions are being generated by \nthe script, which is getting its info from an epw weather file.)\n\n\nWhat is the cause for gensky relocating my suns to 87 degrees?\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003117.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003117", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
