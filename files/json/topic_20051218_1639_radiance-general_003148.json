With processor performace at \"Highest\" I get the\nfollowing result for Mark's benchmark test (details for Mark and other\ncompiler switch freaks out there):\n\n\nrpict time:\t6403.98 user\nprocessor:\tG5\nnum procs:\t1\nclock speed:\t2 GHz\ncache:\t\t512 kB\nOS:\t\tOS X Tiger 10.4.3\nRadiance vers:\t3.8a Patch 2 (?)\ncompiler:\tGCC 4.0.0 20041026 (build 4061)\nrays:\t\t693777405\noptions:\t-O3 -fgcse-sm -funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing\n                 -fsched-interblock\n                 -falign-loops=16 -falign-jumps=16 -falign-functions=16\n                 -falign-jumps-max-skip=15 -falign-loops-max-skip=15\n                 -ffast-math -freorder-blocks -freorder-blocks-and- \npartition\n                 -finline-floor -mdynamic-no-pic -mpowerpc-gpopt\n                 -force_cpusubtype_ALL -mtune=G5 -mcpu=G5 -mpowerpc64\n\n\nNote: These options are equal to the \"-fast\" optimization switch of  \nthe gcc\n       for G5 except for one missing \"-malign-natural\" option which  \nbreaks\n       rpict and probably a lot of other programs.\n\n\nFinally this iMac is up to the Athlon XP on Mark's page and acceptable\nfor a real \"desktop\" machine where fan noise is much more important than\nrender speed.\n\n\n\n\nHappy holiday season and i hope everyone gets a PowerMac G5 Quad under\ntheir christmas tree,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003148.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003148", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
