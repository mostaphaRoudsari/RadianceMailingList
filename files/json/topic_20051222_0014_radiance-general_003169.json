Let's say I have a \nscript that performs some numeric analysis of a scene (rtrace) and then \ndoes some renderings as well.  I typically crank up the settings quite a \nbit for rtrace, but relax them a bit for images (usually).  My question \nis, can the rpict process(es) safely use the existing ambient cache left \nover from the high-accuracy rtrace run?  Could running the rtrace at \nlower accuracy settings degrade any of the previously cached values?  \nJust curious.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003169.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003169", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
