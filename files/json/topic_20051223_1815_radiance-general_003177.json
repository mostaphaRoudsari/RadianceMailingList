It looks like it uses some Radiance algorithms.\n\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n\n\n__________________________________________\n\n\nAfter more and more research of render engine, I have finally got my hands on a new breed of rendering engine which should worth your time to look at. Maxwell Render - brought the us by the world famous NextLimit Corporation (the maker of RealFlow3, a real physical simulation software for Computational Fluid Dynamics). t is the first physical based rendering engine with a GUI. The approach is almost identical to Radiance, except I am not sure if it produces hard number calculations. One thing for sure, it does produce False-Color images. Please take a look at this, \n\n\nhttp://www.wahn.demon.co.uk/Maxwell/PhysicalSky/index.html\n\n\nhttp://www.maxwellrender.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1121&highlight=\n\n\nfor further description of the renderer, please see the following link.\n\n\nhttp://www.maxwellrender.com/product.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMing Norman Tsui\n5th-Year Architectural Engineering\nThe Pennsylvania State University\n601 Vairo Blvd, Apt. 113\nState College, PA 16803\n201. 233.7871\n\n\nmxt906 at psu.edu\nming.n.tsui at gmail.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003177.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003177", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
