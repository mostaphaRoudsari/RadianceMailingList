I found trans.h (and\nthe readme in translators), and as an example rad2mgf. Is there anything\nlike a generic parser (there is something like that for mgf, with functions\nthat have just to be overwritten)? OT: Is there a parser class in Radzilla?\n\n\nAnd than I found some message about rat2mgf in rad2mgf.c... maybe one of the\ncvs-writers can correct it ;-)\n\n\nBest wishes for the new year!
