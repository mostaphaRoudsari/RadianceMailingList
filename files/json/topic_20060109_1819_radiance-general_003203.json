I am wondering about methods for generating a \ngood response curve for a given camera. The book gives a variety of tips \nand suggestions, however I am curious about good scenes.\n\n\nIn a prior email footnote from Greg (a faq item relating to camera \nresponse curves and Photosphere), he suggests shooting a scene looking \nout a window during daytime with about 10 exposures. What about shooting \na controlled scene such as a Macbeth Color Checker or a Kodak gray scale \nchart (can't remember the name of this) outdoors under daytime \nconditions or using some type of interior fixed lighting setup?\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003203.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003203", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
