I present an inconsistency when working\nfrom\n\n\n(1) Radiance book\n(2) Georg's diagram\n(http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html)\n(3) Greg Ward's emailed example (Desktop Radiance Digest v2n7, Sep 1994,\nin RADIANCE_HOME/doc/digest/v2n7).\n\n\nClearing up of the inconsistency will help me and many others!\n\n\nTo summarise my understanding the trans arguments\n\n\nA1,A2,A3 - colour components.  As shown by \"colour\" diamond in Georg's\ndiagram. Fraction of light NOT absorbed for each component.=\nA4, A5 - specular reflection, roughness (ignore, 0 for following\nexamples)\nA6 - trans (\"trans\" diamond on georg's diagram).  (ie, fraction\nnon-absorbed light transmitted through material.)\nA7 - specular proportion of transmitted light (ignore)\n\n\nAccording to the Radiance Book:\n\n\nA1 = Cr / (1-Rs)(1-A6)\n\n\n*I assume that A6 = \"trans\" diamond on georg's diagram.*\n\n\nGreg's example:\n\n\nRequirement: grey trans material.  Transmission factor of 60% (ie\n*total* amount of light going through).  Specular component of 10%:\n\n\nvoid trans opale\n0\n0\n7 .6 .6 .6 0 0 1 .1666\n\n\nie\nA1 = 0.6\nA6 = 1\n\n\nWe adapt a number of his formulae to show this meets the requirements.\n>From Georg's diagram (note no reflection, as per Greg's example)\n\n\nDiffuse reflectance Rd = (1 - Rs)(colour)(1 - trans)            \n                       = (1 - 0 )(0.6   )(1 - 1    )\n                       = 1 x 0.6 x 0\n                       = 0 (ie no diffuse reflectance, => 40% is\n                       absorbed)\n\n\n\n\nDiffuse transmittance Td = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans)(1 - Tspec)\n                         = (1 - 0 )(0.6   )(1    )(1 - 0.1666)\n                         = 50%\n\n\nSpecular transmittance Ts = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans)(Tspec)\n                          = (1 - 0 )(0.6   )(1    )(0.1666)\n\t\t\t  = 10%\n\n\nThat's great and seems to make sense.\n\n\nBut - the inconsistency:\n\n\nPlug this example into Radiance book's formula.  (Stiil assume Rs=0.)\n\n\nA1 = Cr / (1 - Rs)(1 - A6)\nA1 = Cr / (1 - 0 )(1 - A6)\nA1 = Cr / (1 - A6)\n\n\n\n\n* Now consider what happens as A6 approaches 1.  A1 tends to infinity -\nclearly not correct.*\n\n\nMy questions are then:\n\n\n-   Is A6 = trans (in the diamond in Georg's diagram) as both Greg and\nGeorg appear to show.  (ie. is A6 the fraction the non-absorbed light\nthat is not diffusely reflected?)\n-   If so, why doesn't the Radiance book formula make sense?\n-   What is Cr, Cb and Cg?\n-   Does total transmissivity = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans) ?       \n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading and thinking!\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBrett\n\n\nBrett Beeson\nSustainable Designer\n\n\nCUNDALL\nHSBC Building Level 20\n300 Queen Street\nBrisbane QLD 4000\ntel:   +61 (0)7 3023 5048\nfax:  +61 (0)7 3023 4000\nwww.cundall.com.au <http://www.cundall.com.au/>\n\n\nImportant Notice.
