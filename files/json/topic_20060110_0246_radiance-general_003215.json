We use\nit for teaching purposes on our Masters course.\n\n\nHere are the improvements:\n- interactive Luminance Map\n- demo mode\n- updates/corrections everywhere\n- facilitates Response Curve Calibration and Absolute Luminance Calibration\n- output of tone-mapped JPEG\n- gallery page\n- option to remove lens flare\n- histograms are generated for every uploaded image\n- 'Test your camera' page to make sure your camera is supported by WebHDR\n- now supports more cameras than Greg's hdrgen\n\n\nPlease do give it a try. If you don't have an exposure bracketed sequence\nat hand, please upload any old picture to the Camera Test page to help me\nimprove the software. Your uploads are completely anonymous.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003215.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003215", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
