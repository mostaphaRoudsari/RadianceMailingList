Probably Reinhardt and Walkenhorst in Energy and Buildings, and Mardaljevic in LR+T - any others? If you could list the details, I'd appreciate it - good to know for everybody. \n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nMartin Moeck, Penn State\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003246.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003246", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
