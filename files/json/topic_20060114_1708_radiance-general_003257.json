Does anyone know with which \nversion of Tcl/Tk this issue frst raised its head? I've only tried the \nmost recent versions. I also tried to install the version I believe trad \nis meant to run under (Tcl 7.4, Tk 4) but the source for these no longer \nunder the new gcc! I'm pretty new to the linux system im running (fresh \nfrom windows) and I dont really know what I'm doing changing code, so I \nthought I'd appeal to this list for advice about any other front-ends \nfor Radiance. I'm aware of Rayfront, but unfortunately I dont have much \nbudget to spend on this project (it's my 4th year undergraduate \nEngineering degree final project) and I am hoping for a free version!\n\n\nThanks again for all your help\nWill\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003257.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003257", "created_by": "william_reynolds"}
