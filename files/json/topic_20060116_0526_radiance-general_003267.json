However, a quick Google tought me that the majority of\nHDR discussion seem to be going on at\nhttp://www.hyperfocaldesign.com/,\nand frankly, it doesn't seem to cut the custard for me. So please DO tell\nme if there is a more appropriate List to direct this one to...\n\n\nAnd 'ere we go:\n\n\nI've just put up a few more examples on the WebHDR Gallery page, and\nnoticed that all of the tonemapped images are rather desaturated, compared\nto what you get when hitting the old 'Do-it-all-for-me-Button' in Auto\nMode. I understand that most if not all digital consumer cameras do some\njigger-pokery colour gamut stretching, so the photos look a bit nicer.\nHowever, my understanding is that once you've done an HDR, you can do all\nsorts of things to it, probablay including those colour transform\nthings...\n\n\nSince I am processing all results of WebHDR with RADIANCE tools, I was\nwondering if there is a way of putting the colour-vibrancy back into the\ntone mapped imaged.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003267.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003267", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
