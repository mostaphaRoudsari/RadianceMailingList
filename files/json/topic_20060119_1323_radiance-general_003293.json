The super computer has 128 CPUs, \nand it should be very fast. But I found the rendering \nspeed is almost the same as my notepad. A stuff of \nthe super computer center tried to analysis the rendering \nprocess, and found out that most time was not taken by \ncomputation, but by outputing data to files. I think \nwriting data to the .unf file must take a lot of time. \nIs there any way to solve this problem?  \n\n\nYours,\nHuang\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003293.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003293", "created_by": "Huangwx"}
