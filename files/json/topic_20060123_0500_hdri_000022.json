I just wanted to report my success so far. I have \naccomplished the following:\n\n\n   1. acquire mac-mini\n   2. open and install 1G RAM upgrade\n   3. install photosphere\n   4. run remote session to mac-mini via VNC allowing for use of full OS\n      X desktop and applications (including photosphere)\n\n\nSo this is a great little HDR image processing appliance that can be run \nremotely to other types of systems using VNC. Pretty neat.\n\n\nI have been doing some initial experimenting with a Cannon EOS 5D and a \nSigma 8mm Fisheye. The camera is pretty cool, certainly the most \nhigh-end digital I have used. It is very nice the way the the camera can \nbe controlled from a pc (windows, sorry). Not sure what to report on the \nlens yet. I guess there is the optical vignetting issue that Greg \nprovided some data on, however I guess practicality of equipment ease of \nuse also has to play an important part.\n\n\nPreliminary experience with Photosphere is quite nice. Now on to trying \nout some IBL.\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-January/000022.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000022", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
