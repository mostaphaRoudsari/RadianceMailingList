We will try to keep prices much the same as before  \n(i.e. in the region of US$200-250 for the registration, less for  \nspeakers).\n\n\nTo allow for some flexibility in planning, I have provisionally  \nbooked a room during both the first and third (full) weeks in  \nSeptember [1].  I will need to finalise the booking in the next week  \nor two.  Please respond as soon as possible giving your preference.\n\n\nOption A:   7-8 September (Thu-Fri)\nOption B: 18-19 September (Mon-Tue)\n\n\nIt would greatly assist the organisers if firm bookings could be made  \nsooner rather than later.  I will send more details once we have  \nsettled on a preferred date.  The tally stands at 1 for Option B (my  \npreferred date).\n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you -- soon.\n\n\n-John\n\n\n[1] Greg asked that I avoid the second week, so please don't ask for  \nthat.\n\n\nPS.  The Queens Building is a (rather famous) low energy building  \nwith natural ventilation and copious daylight (weather permitting).\n\n\nInside views here:\nhttp://www.dmu.ac.uk/aboutdmu/campuses/vt/unidemrjm.jsp\nOutside here:\nhttp://www.dmu.ac.uk/aboutdmu/campuses/vt/unidemrcm.jsp\n(Building with glass walkways between projecting wings)\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003299.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003299", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
