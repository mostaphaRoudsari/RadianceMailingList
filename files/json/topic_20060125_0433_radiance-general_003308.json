It appears that you can then import the  \nobject into a 3D app like Maya and proceed as usual.\n\n\nkirk\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003308.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003308", "created_by": "Kirk_Thibault"}
