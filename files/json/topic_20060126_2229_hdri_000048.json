I also took the tone-mapped TIFF and  \nmade some moves in the L, a and b channels for tweaking.  No masking  \nwas done, so all of the pixels got moved - I think the tone-mapped  \nLDR could probably benefit from some masking during color  \nmanipulation, as those hot areas like outside the window get that  \nfunky ethereal glow about them.  This kind of thing is more for  \naesthetics than quantitative lighting analysis, so I plan to take  \nsome liberties.\n\n\nNote - for the JPEG sequence on the smugmug site, down below the  \nlarge image is a link to view the EXIF data if you are curious.\n\n\nSuper cool.  The whole process took about 30 seconds for the sequence  \ncapture and output to HDR.\n\n\nkirk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk L.
