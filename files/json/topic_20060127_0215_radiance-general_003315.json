I would like to include period-correct stained\nglass in the windows (in this case 13th century grisaille).  However,\nI have no idea where to find information on the transmittance index\nand other properties of stained glass.\n\n\nHas anyone modelled something like this before?\n\n\nCan anyone point me toward a resource that might have details on the\nproperties of stained and/or historic glass?\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n\n-- Anthony\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003315.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003315", "created_by": "Tony_Masinton"}
