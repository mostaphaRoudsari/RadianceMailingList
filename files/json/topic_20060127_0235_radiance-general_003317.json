They were all created in \nRadiance (duh) and have been scaled down 5:1 or 6:1. I hope this \ncounts as \"giving back\" to the Radiance community in some way.\n\n\n(these are all temporary URLs and they are all > 1.2 MB JPEGs)\n\n\n\"Open House\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img04_2400.jpg\n\n\n\"Boil\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img05_1800.jpg\n\n\n\"Dynamo\"\nhttp://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img31_2400.jpg\n\n\n\n\nIn other news, I have finally updated my Benchmark page with \nresults that were given to me up to 4 months ago. I welcome any \nnew contributions you may have. Parallel results may have to \nwait, as there are unresolved timing issues with the Linux \nplatform.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-January/003317.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003317", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
