Problem\nI got Auto CAD 2005 files of studio equipment, like video monitors, edit \ndesks etc. from a company. I want to work with them in Radiance.\nThe 'radout' exporter doesn't work with autocad 2005, so i got an old \nlicense for Autocad 2000. There the exporter works. But the 2005 files \ndont work in 2000! An exported version of .dxf files didn't work either \nin 2000.\nI got a hint from an old mailing list article, to export the files from \nautocad 2005 in a .3ds format. Autocad 2000 can read this format and the \n'radout' export worked. But now i have a '.rad' file with hundreds of \npolygons and its impossible to give them the right material, because i \ndon't know where they belong to. If i create one material and apply it \nto all polygons, i can see the model.\nHow is it possible to get different 'layers' in the file like the body \nof a monitor and the screen separately ?\nI have the feeling that even a simple box is subdivided in lots of polygons.\nDo i have to modify may CAD files in a special way ?\n\n\n2. Problem\nI tried to import a 'Poser 3D' model of a character with 'dxf2rad'. I \nfollowed the instruction of the 'RwR' book on p. 422, but the command :\n $ dxf2rad  -i figur.dxf -orad figur\ndoesn't really work. When i execute:\n $ dxf2rad   figur.dxf   figur.rad\ni end up like in my first problem. I have hundreds of single polygons \nwith no specific name and the same identifier.\nI am a CAD and a Radiance starter but maybe someone can guide me.\nThanks,...\n\n\nP.S. Thank you Greg for your last answer concerning color an units. I \nincluded my own display primaries now.\n\n\n\n\nChristian Fusenig\nDiplomand, Medientechnik\nUndergraduate, Media Technology\nHamburg University Of Applied Sciences\n\n\naddress: Beim Schlump 27/07\n              20144 Hamburg\n\n\nemail:    christian_fusenig at gmx.de\n\n\nmobile:  ++49 179 5975845\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003349.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003349", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
