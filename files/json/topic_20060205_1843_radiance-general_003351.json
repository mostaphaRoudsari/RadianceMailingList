It was a luminaire file from ERCO Lighting. \nI defined different layers and named them. The dxf2rad worked fine and i \nended up with my desired modifiers.\nBut the files i got from this company didn't work! I opened them in \nAutocad 2005 and it said something that they were created with 'Pro \nLignum 3D'. I can work with the file in Autocad but when i save it as \n.dxf then the dxf2rad converter messes it up. I get an empty file like \nthat:\n## Radiance geometry file \"Video_Monitor.rad\"\n## Converted by dxf2rad 0.9: Sun Feb 05 18:33:59 2006\n## C:\\cygwin\\opt\\ray\\bin\\dxf2rad.exe Video_Monitor.dxf Video_Monitor.rad\n\n\n\n\n## End of Radiance geometry file \"Video_Monitor.rad\"\n\n\nI have no web space to post this .dwg  file to and i guess to send the \nfile to this list is a bad idea. Maybe i can send it to you and you can \nopen it and see whats wrong. I have to ask this company if i can give \nthese files away but maybe we can make a deal. ;-)\nThank you so far!\n\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n\nChristian Fusenig\nDiplomand, Medientechnik\nUndergraduate, Media Technology\nHamburg University Of Applied Sciences\n\n\naddress: Beim Schlump 27/07\n              20144 Hamburg\n\n\nemail:    christian_fusenig at gmx.de\n\n\nmobile:  ++49 179 5975845\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003351.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003351", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
