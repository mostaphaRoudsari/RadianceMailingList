The first time I tried to create a calibration \nfile I got an \"out of gamut\" error, which I understand points to a \npoorly exposed gretag photo.  Before re-photographing everything, I \nthought maybe cropping my gretag image to the registration marks may \nhelp (lazy Sunday thinking).  But now, after cropping the photo and \nre-creating the pic file, I now get the following error when running \nmacbethcal (macbethcal -d debug.pic mbscan.pic colorcal.cal):\n\n\nmacbethcal: non-increasing neutral patch\n\n\nThe resulting debug.pic is 59 bytes and is useless.  Two questions: how \ncan I get a better image to avoid the out of gamut error, and what \ncaused the error above?  I was using northern skylight on a fairly \ncloudless day for my lighting, and f2.0 1/125 for all exposures.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003352.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003352", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
