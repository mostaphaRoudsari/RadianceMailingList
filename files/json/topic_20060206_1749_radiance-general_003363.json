PPG provides a \ngloss range for its factory applied metal coatings (such as DURANAR). \nThe way they indicate this is as a range at a given measurement angle, \nfor example:\n\n\n    25% to 35%  at 60 degrees\n\n\nThis is according to the ASTM-D523 - Specular Gloss.\n\n\nIs there some way to make this meaningful as a part of a radiance \nmaterial specification?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003363.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003363", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
