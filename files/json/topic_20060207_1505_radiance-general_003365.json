The problem is that my knowledge of shell \nscripting is rather limited, and the only other programming language I \nknow fairly well (perl) is not wanting to cooperate. I'm trying to \nautomate the process of multiplying the luminance values of the sky \npatches to the corresponding RGB values that rtcontrib puts out so that \nI can get illuminance data for a whole slew of sky conditions. Does \nanyone know of any scripts out there that might do this, or what \nprogramming language might be best suited to dealing with very large \nfiles (I have a lot of illuminance points)? Any help you could offer \nwould be greatly appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003365.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003365", "created_by": "J._David_Maino"}
