I tried the same on\na very large model, but rendering is slow now because the different views\ncan't share ambient data. So my suggestion is to keep low -ad and downsample\nas proposed, but cache the fewer ambient values in an ambient file using a\nmoderate -aa. Any comments? I wondered why this was not mentioned in the\nstudies, am I completely wrong or is it because he simply did not have to\nreuse the ambient values (in a comparision with different ambient settings,\nthat would be a bad idea ;-)?\n\n\nTIA+CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003380.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003380", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
