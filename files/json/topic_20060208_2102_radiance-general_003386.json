One of our Postdocs bought a Mac Box\nand I am trying to install Radiance on it. At first I had trouble\ncompiling Radiance since no ggc was on it. So I installed the gcc\npackage. Now, it keeps on complaining that it does not find the standard\nlibraries such as studio.h. Would anybody know off-hand which packages\nneed to be installed on the Mac so that Radiance compiles? Also, when I\nuse the pre-installed binaries, 'ximage' is missing the file\n/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib. Which package do I need to get that\nrunning? \n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nPS: Windows forever:)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003386.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003386", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
