There are some problems that I am encountering. I have gotten \nsome of Radiance's utilities to compile (about 50 total) but I have run into \nsome issues in getting the core rendering programs (rpict and rtace) to \ncompile. I am willing to forgo rview while using Interix and use this \nfeature with Cygwin. Here are there error messages that I received while \nattempting to compile the core rendering utilities:\n\n\npersist.c:37: error: conflicting types for `sighandler_t'\n/usr/include/signal.h:40: error: previous declaration of `sighandler_t'\npersist.c: In function `pfhold':\npersist.c:129: warning: passing arg 1 of `mkfifo' makes pointer from integer \nwit\nhout a cast\npersist.c:131: warning: passing arg 1 of `mkfifo' makes pointer from integer \nwit\nhout a cast\npersist.c:134: warning: passing arg 1 of `mkfifo' makes pointer from integer \nwit\nhout a cast\npersist.c:152: error: cast specifies function type\n\n\n\n\nambient.c: In function `ambsync':\nambient.c:891: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should note that I am using the latest CVS snapshop (I downloaded within \nthe last 30 minutes). Can anyone help me?\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000675.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000675", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
