It's a bit crippled, because it doesn't read or  \nwrite TIFF or OpenEXR files right now, but I'd like to know if it's  \nat least working on the Intel.  In particular, I'm curious whether  \nyou can read your previous catalog file and write it out again  \nsuccessfully.\n\n\nWARNING:  Please make a backup copy of your catalog (*.adb) file  \nbefore trying this out!!\n\n\nI am not sure I have byte-swapping implemented correctly.  I'm also  \ncurious if the Intel-based Mac's run the old version of Photosphere  \nor not.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-February/000060.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000060", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
