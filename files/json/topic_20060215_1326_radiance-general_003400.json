None of it\nworked.\n\n\n\n\n- I did not see any option for implementing smooth shading in the obj2mesh\nmanual, can anyone helps explaining how it should be specified?\n\n\n\n\n- For mapping texture I used the following code, but there was no texture\non the object rendered (a ball) just plain color :\n\n\nvoid colorpict ball_surface\n7 red green blue ball.pic . frac(Lu) frac(Lv)\n0\n0\n\n\nball_surface plastic ball_finish\n0\n0\n5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0\n\n\nball_finish mesh ball_mesh\n1 ball.rtm\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nThat's about it, any support will be appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003400.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003400", "created_by": "Nicolas_Roy"}
