The \ncompiler has run into problems in locating the file librt.a. In the past \nthis file has been located in the path /ray/src/lib but in the latest HEAD \nfile that I downloaded last week this file was not present. Is this file \nstill apart of the Radiance or has it been removed? If it has been removed, \nshould the makefiles for the program be updated to reflect this change?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-February/000679.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000679", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
