My image was\na rectangle at first and was converted to a square later, but\nboth images had the same (wrong) look. I have uploaded two\nimages (one from Blender, one from rpict) to illustrate the\ndifference.\n\n\nhttp://home.arcor.de/tbleicher/blender/bliff/current.html\n\n\nMy questions now are:\n\n\n1) What went wrong?\n2) How would I define a non-rectangulare image texture?\n\n\nPlease not that I have not checked the quality of the generated\nUV coordinates. They are generated by a established *.obj exporter\nfor Blender and I think they are correct for now. My understanding\nof the Radiance texture mapping options is so bad that I expect\nthe error in the texture definition.\n\n\n\n\nThanks and have a nice weekend,\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003417.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003417", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
