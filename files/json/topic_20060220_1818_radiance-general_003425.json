There is  \nno need to either modify obj2mesh or the .OBJ exporter to obtain a  \ncorrect mapping.  Radiance coordinate mappings are programmable for a  \nreason...\n\n\nIf you want to create a utility to automate the process, I suggest  \ncreating one that converts the texture input to Radiance picture  \nformat, simultaneously outputting an appropriate material/pattern  \ndefinition, which must be served as an input to obj2mesh, anyway.  If  \nyou're ambitious, you could even look into translating the material  \nparameters to Radiance's physically-based model.  Does this make sense?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003425.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003425", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
