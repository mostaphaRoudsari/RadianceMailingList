I used lots of obj's with obj2rad \nso far, and some in a more or less stupid way, converting them to \nmeshes, writing a mesh primitive in a file, scaling it and making an \ninstance of the file than. Now I would like to replace this stupid \nmesh-to-instance step, but I run into the problem that I cannot scale \nmy obj with obj2mesh. Is there noone else needing such an option? Or is \nthere a way to scale the object input? My problem is that I am using \nlots of files, scripted processing, and input my instances or meshes to \nreplmarks. But I cannot make sure that all my markers have the x-axis 1 \nunit long (than I could use replmark's -s SCALE). I was thinking of \nwriting my mesh primitive in a small file, apply xform to this and use \nit than with replmarks -x. Still, it seams to be a silly way to deal \nwith the fact that my objs are in feet and my model in meter.\n\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003454.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003454", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
