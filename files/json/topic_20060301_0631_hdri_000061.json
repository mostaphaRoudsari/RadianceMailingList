(Should I be talking to  \nBrightside?)\n- Are there any common graphics toolkits (like ImageMagick, NetPBM,  \netc.) that can non-destructively transform HDR images?\n\n\nIf you can't tell where I'm going with this, then let me explain: I'd  \nbasically like to set up a web-based \"gallery\" of LDR and HDR images  \nwith dynamic content processed by the server. Files in common HDR  \nformats could be uploaded and the server would handle things like  \nthumbnails, resizing, gathering image data, and converting to browser- \nviewable JPEG HDR. (The HDR version would then be \"inspectable\" upon  \ndownloading the JPEG HDR) I've got all the pieces except HDR support...\n\n\n-Mark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-March/000061.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000061", "created_by": "Mark_Banas"}
