It is now\nupdated on-the-fly on new submissions and runs of WebHDR. You might want\nto use it for reference when shopping around for a suitable camera for\ntaking HDR pickies:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/cameras.shtml\n\n\nPlease note that an 'O.K' doesn't necessarily mean the cam will work with\nhdrgen/Photoshpere, too. What it does mean, however, is that the pictures\ncan be batch-processed with free, OpenSource software and without\nadditional user input to make them work (Perl + ExifTools).\n\n\nIf there is any interest, I'd be happy to write a little utility and post\nit to the list.\n\n\nFurthermore, I am wondering if any of you have access to older Nikon\nCoolPix models (8xx and 9xx). If so, could I kindly as you to submit a\npicture to the address above. Thanks 1000 for your time!\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nPS: Pics of cameras not listed yet are also welcome.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-March/000070.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000070", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
