Still I wonder if this mode is still \n\"supported\". I had expected errors with oconv when assembling large \nscenes, but I got segfaults, and that seams to indicate that error \nchecking is not clean for DSMLFLT.\n\n\nThe reason for my attempt to use the good old single float was to try \nthe effect when used together with modern processor's float capabilities.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-March/000700.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000700", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
