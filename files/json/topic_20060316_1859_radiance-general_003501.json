So I could use the external file as mkillum's input and run\nit with the (large) scene's octree:\n\n\nmkillum large_scene.oct < only_illum_faces.rad > only_illum_sources.rad\n\n\nthan, later\n\n\noconv large_scene.rad only_ilum_sources.rad > full_scene.oct\n\n\n(eh, I could have used oconv -i large_scene.oct only_illum_sources.rad >\nfull_scene.oct, right?)\n\n\nBut now I have to change the structure of my scene a bit, and it gets\ndifficult to keep the illums in an external file. So, given that\nlarge_scene.oct is made of large_scene.rad, could I equally use\n\n\nmkillum large_scene.oct < large_scene.rad > only_illum_sources.rad\n\n\ngiven that I set the right -i=illummodifier at the beginning of\nlarge_scene.rad? Will this use much more ressources? As I understand,\nthe only difference should be file access, as the full file will be sent\nto mkillum instead of only the faces that are to be converted.\n\n\nIf you wonder why I do not simply try, it is because my model is build\nby some scripts I have to change, and I wonder if it is worth it and\npossible at least.\n\n\nTIA+CU, Lars.\n\n\nP.S.: Concering the link I sent, now I know that I REALLY missed what I\nshould have seen on the workshop :-(\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003501.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003501", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
