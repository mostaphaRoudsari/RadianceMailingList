As  \nexpected, there were a few bugs to fix in the byte-swapping code, so  \nsharing catalogs between architectures should work, now.  (I also  \nupdated the PowerPC-only version, and the two applications have  \ndifferent names to avoid confusion.)  All image formats are now fully  \nsupported.\n\n\nThe only things that aren't quite there are the Application icon,  \nwhich I can't figure out how to reinstate, and the file types, which  \nthe Universal app doesn't seem to understand when you drag images  \nonto its (generic) icon.  I'm not sure when (or if) I'll get those  \nthings fixed, as I can't recall how I got them working in the first  \nplace....\n\n\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Thanks is due to Bruce Carlin for the loan of his MacBook Pro,  \nwhich enabled me to compile the OpenEXR and TIFF libraries and debug  \nthe Intel operation.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-March/000071.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000071", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
