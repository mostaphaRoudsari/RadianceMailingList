I get the following error from time to time:\n\n\nrtrace: signal - Broken pipe\nSegmentation Fault\n\n\nIt usually happens while running rtcontrib, but not always. Sometimes it \nwill run fine with no problems, but then the same geometry with the same \ncommand produces and error and it is not always at the same point. \nSometimes it is right away, sometimes a few minutes into it, and \nsometimes a few hours into it. Is this more a memory/hardware issue, or \ncould it be a problem with the way I arrange my files? Any help you \ncould offer would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003507.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003507", "created_by": "J._David_Maino"}
