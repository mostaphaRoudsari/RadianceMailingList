I  \ncreated one using the SFO air traffic control tower, but it wasn't a  \nserious entry.  The field is wide open as near as I can tell.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003510.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003510", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
