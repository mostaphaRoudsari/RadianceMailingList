This could include\napplication (visualization / research / daylight / lighting planning) as\nwell as technical stuff ( machine(s) / os / radiance release including\nfrontends like rayfront or derivates like radzilla) and general environment\n(research / company / freelancer / ...).\n\n\nThis MAY be interesting and cetainly much more informative than if some\npeople post their os now...\n\n\nIs there need for that?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003513.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003513", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
