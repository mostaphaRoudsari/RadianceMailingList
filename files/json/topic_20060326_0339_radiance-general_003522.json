(24x365 = 8760 values for a point on\na work plane)\n\n\nIf any, what are the constraints to such a process and how can they be\novercome so as not to model each hour individually?\n\n\nI am using Radiance on Cygwin.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nRamana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenkata Ramana Koti\nMS in Building Design (Energy/Climate)\nSchool of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\nCollege of Design\nArizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003522.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003522", "created_by": "Ramana_Koti"}
