When I ran the\nsimulation I got the 'uncommented lines in the dc file' error which I looked\nup in the tutorial and fixed the PATH and RAYPATH environmental variables. I\nam using Windows XP on my notebook (the tutorial points these fixes for\nWindows 2000, I tried them nevertheless).\n\n\nI encountered the same error even then. I was trying to fix it and in the\nprocess uninstalled and installed the program 2 to 3 times. Now the program\ndoesn't start after installation. I can't get it to start despite some\neffort. It would help my thesis a lot if I can make it work.\n\n\nNeed your help.\n\n\nThanks again,\nRamana.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-March/003527.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003527", "created_by": "Ramana_Koti"}
