But as soon as i want to \nwrite an .ies-file for a rectangular shaped luminaire with non \nsymmetrical distribution the file doesnt' work.\nThis is my file:\nIESNA95\n[TEST]\n[MANUFAC] Arri Studio Cool 2\n[DATE] 03/27/06\n[LAMP] Osram Studioline, StudioLine55W/31VAR 2G11 FS1\nTILT=NONE\n\n\n1 5000 1 12[vert.] 27[horiz.] 1 1 .2[width] 0.6[Lenght] 0[height] 1 1 55\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 [vert. degrees]\n\n\n0 2.5 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 \n[horiz. degrees]\n\n\n1623 1582 1618 1693 1815 1979 2169 2185 2166 2111 2273 2511 [vert. values]\n\n\n1623 1628 1634 1641 1658 1677 1705 1744 1786 1885 2064 2254 [hor. values]\n 2546 2905 3247 3864 4579 6024 7642 9496 8984 30789 6024 7642\n 9496 8984 30789\n\n\nThe [...] are only comments, i don't have them in the file normally. \nWhen i convert the file this returns:\n$ ies2rad -t white -o light/sc2  ies/sc2.ies\ndosource: bad distribution data\nies/sc2.ies: bad luminaire data\n\n\nI can't really find a file explanation or help on the .ies file format. \nCan anyone help me on this one?\n\n\nSecond question:\n\n\nI tried to get 'rshow' to work, but it doesn't really do. I downloaded \nfrom 'http://www.pab-opto.de/progs/rshow/' the Linux version but i use \nRadiance under 'cygwin', a Unix emulation for WinXP, as a Unix version i \nguess. Where do i have to set the environment variable, when i use \nRadiance in c:\\cygwin\\opt\\ray\\bin ? I'm not used to do these things, so \ni am a little bit confused where to install rshow. Can someone guide me?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Fusenig\nDiplomand, Medientechnik\nUndergraduate, Media Technology\nHamburg University Of Applied Sciences\nhttp://www.mt.haw-hamburg.de\n\n\naddress: Beim Schlump 27/07\n              20144 Hamburg\n\n\nemail:    christian_fusenig at gmx.de\n\n\nmobile:  ++49 179 5975845\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003539.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003539", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
