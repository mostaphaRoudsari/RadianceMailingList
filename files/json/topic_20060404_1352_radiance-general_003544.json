But as long as \nyou are not adapting the radiance value of the light source (which you \ndon't do), you'll loose more than 10% of the flux of the sun by reducing \nthe value from 0.533 to 0.5 !!\n\n\nIs there any reason to use 0.5 instead of 0.533?\n\n\nAnd a question to Greg: gensky is also using 0.5. Is there any reference \nto that? But: As long as the overall flux is correct, the difference in \nthe angle can be neglected.\n\n\n\n\nFor the cygwin-version of gendaylit I would suggest to correct that \nvalue in your version to 0.533 of the source code. In addition to this, \nI'll try to put a gendaylit version on our Web-page, which can be \ncompiled also under cygwin without any modification. If ready, I'll \nannounce this here again.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
