If this is the case, the most\nlikely cause of your problem is that you have defined a material that\nRadiance cannot find (as Christoph mentioned). What I would recommend as a\ntroubleshooting step is to redefine the materials of all objects in your\nmodel into a material in the Ecotect library, and then try rendering. Please\nlet us know if the issue persists.\n\n\n\n\nJohn An\nEnvironmental Designer\nAtelier Ten\n45 East 20th Street\nNew York, NY 10003\n212-254-4500 (o)\n212-254-1259 (f)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003566.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003566", "created_by": "John_An"}
