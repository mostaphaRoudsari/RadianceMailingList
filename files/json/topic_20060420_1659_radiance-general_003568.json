Yes Rob i meant the \nappearance of the illuminance patch.\nConcerning the glass with the values of a Lee color filter i just want \nto make sure that i got all right:\nI calculated the RGB values from the spectrum, taking in consideration \nthat Y is not =1 but 0.642.\nThen i got the transmissivity which is 0.92.\nI multiplied my RGB values with 0.92 and thats it, or not?\n\n\nIs there some kind of \"roughness\" for glass too? The glass with the \nfilter on top is too \"glossy\", reflective, shiny or whatever you would \ncall it. I would want it more \"dull\". ( I dont know if this is the right \nterm in this context)\n\n\nChristian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003568.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003568", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
