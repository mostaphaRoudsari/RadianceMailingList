Can i take 0.624 ?\nAs i understand it, my resulting RGB components should be the same as \nyour example normalized ones.\nThen i would apply them to trans.cal to get the normal transmission.\nMaybe i am dead wrong but thats how i see it.\nThanks,\n\n\nChristian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003580.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003580", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
