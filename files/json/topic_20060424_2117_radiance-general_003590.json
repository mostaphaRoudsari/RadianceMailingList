However, when I modify the\nnormals, using texfunc as the following example, apparently, just the\nmain normal is modified.\n\n\n   void texfunc id\n   3 Px*A1  Py*A2  PZ*A3\n   0\n   3 A1 A2 A3\n\n\n\n\n   Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can make a \"grid of normals\"\nin order to modify the normals of smaller regions of the surface? and\nhow can I change the scale of that \"grid\"?\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nAdriana Lira\nMaster in Design Studies, 2003\nCandidate for Doctor in Design Studies\nHarvard Graduate School of Design\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003590.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003590", "created_by": "Adriana_Lira"}
