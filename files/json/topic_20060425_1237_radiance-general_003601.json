In order to model a disc of 'real'colored glass (e.g. n=1.52) i would apply these values to 'trans.cal' how you suggested an get the transmissivity.\nrcalc -f trans.cal -e '$1=tn($1)'\n.239\n0.260699013\n.384\n0.418782103\n.701\n0.763929466\n\n\nAm i right here too?\n\n\nNow i want to triple the effect of the filter, that means have 3  blue filters in a row. My Y=.624 would then be \nY\u00b3 = .243, can i simply multiply my normal transmittance of RGB with this factor to get the triple effect?\n\n\nI know these are pretty simple questions, but as i plan to use the 'trans' material later i want to make sure to be on the right way!\n\n\nChristian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003601.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003601", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
