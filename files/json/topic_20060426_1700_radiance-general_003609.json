Seem a bit excessive. Am I missing some important\ndetail here?\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003609.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003609", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
