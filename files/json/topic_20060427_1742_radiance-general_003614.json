I have  \ninformed everybody that has already expressed an interest (e-mail  \nsent 26 April) but I expect there are others that have not yet  \ncontacted me.\n\n\nI will post a flyer about the event next week once I get some details  \nabout presentations that have already been offered.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n-John Mardaljevic\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003614.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003614", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
