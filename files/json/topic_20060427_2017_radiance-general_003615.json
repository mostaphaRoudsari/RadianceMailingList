So I need to know about the exact relationship between the color of a surface and its luminance. For that reason I am going to do some simulation with radiance. As  I have just common knowledge of using radiance, sorry if my questions are too basic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculation method used in \u201cRadiance\u201d for computing  the luminance value is:\n\n\nLuminance = 179 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B)                                            (1)\n\n\nWhere the 179 value has been defined so: The value of 179 lm/w is the standard luminous efficacy of equal energy white light that is defined and used by Radiance specifically for this conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Unfortunately I could not find this value at any other document about lighting and colour measurement. Does anybody know how the value of 179 has been derived? I assume it is the average of all the luminous efficacies in visible light spectrum (380 \u2013 780 nm). Isn't it ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. As I know, the method for calculating the luminance is:\n\n\nL = 683 \u222b I (\u03bb) * \u03c1 (\u03bb) * V (\u03bb) d\u03bb                                                                             (2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere: 0=<V (\u03bb) < =1 and has a maximum of 1 at 555 nm and I (\u03bb) is the Spectrum power distribution at any wavelength of arbitrary spectrum. If I have understood correctly,  in the file \u201csrc/common/color.h\u201d the value of (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B) will give us the tristimulus value \u201cY\u201d, which is the same as: Y= \u222b I (\u03bb) * \u03c1 (\u03bb) * \u203ey (\u03bb) d\u03bb                                                              (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \u203ey (\u03bb) = V (\u03bb) for computing the luminance value (according to the methods (2), (3)) what we should do is to multiply the Y value at 683 which gives:\n\n\nLuminance = 683 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suppose if we use the method (1), it means that we have calculated luminance so: L = 179 \u222b I (\u03bb) * \u03c1 (\u03bb) * V (\u03bb) d\u03bb  \n\n\nThat means the value of 179 lm/w has been used as maximum luminous efficacy instead of 683 lm/w at 555 nm??\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if 179 has been used as average, I can not understand why we shoud average again , whereas behind the 683 \u222b  V (\u03bb) d\u03bb  (380nm- 78nm) there is the meaning of averaging the luminous efficacy over the visible light spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope I could make my questions understandable.\n\n\nIf I have gotten the concept wrong, I would be thankful if somebody could tell me where my mistake is, it would be really important and helpful for the result of my research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\n\nNiloofar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiloofar Moghbel\nChair for Building Physics\nUniversity of Stuttgart\nPfaffenwaldring 7\n70569 Stuttgart, Germany\nTel.: ++49 (0)711-685-6301\nFax: ++49 (0)711-685-6583\nNiloofar.Moghbel at lbp.uni-stuttgart.de\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003615.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003615", "created_by": "Niloofar_Moghbel"}
