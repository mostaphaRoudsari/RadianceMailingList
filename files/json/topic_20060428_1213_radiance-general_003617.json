I'm relieved.\n>  \n>\nAnd I AM too!!!\n\n\n>Did you erase the info. from the CM-2002?  Maybe the spectral data is  \n>still there.  It would be better to use it if you have it.

If it would be like this i would simply multiply the two spectra \nand convert to CIE xy etc..\nLike in 'RwR' p. 435\n\n\nNow i want to ad the color attributes of this filter somehow to this \ncylinder:\nI think the best way to simulate this, is to use the 'trans' material \nbecause the surface shouldn't be so shiny or polished like the glass \nmaterial.\nI made an Excel sheet to calculate the 'trans' parameters but it's \nconfusing.\n\n\nWhat would you suggest?\n(I promise this my last problem ;-)\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\nChristian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003617.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003617", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
