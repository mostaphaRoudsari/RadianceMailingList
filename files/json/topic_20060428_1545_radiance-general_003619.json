It is an amazing tool that\nallows you to do pretty advanced 3D drawings in no time. Another caveat\nfor Radiance users: SketchUP geometries can have two different materials\nattached to the two sides of a surface. When you export into Radiance\n(via 3ds) the material attached to the front of the surface is exported.\nThis can lead to surprises so bear this 'feature' in mind when you set\nup your SketchUP model. Also, do not make your material names in\nSketchUP too long as the names will get cut to eight (?) characters in\nthe 3DS model.\n\n\nChristoph  \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-April/003619.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003619", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
