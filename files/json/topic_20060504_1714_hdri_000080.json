Look for that in the next  \nweek or two.  Unfortunately, it won't be able to create full  \nspherical panos like the one on Lisa's site, due to the warping and  \nstretching that would require.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-May/000080.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000080", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
