The reflectances are fairly low, 0.3 for the rack and 0.6\nfor the other surfaces.  I've compared daylight factor results from Ecotect\nand Radiance and found big differences in the magnitude and range of values\nacross the surface.  In one case, Ecotect is giving values varying between\nabout 7.5% and 1%, the corresponding values from Radiance are between about\n2.5% and 0.25%.\n\n\nEcotect's export to Radiance facility appears to incorrectly set the\ntransmissivity of the glazing material in the .rad output.  Setting the\nglazing transparency (I guess this is the same as tranmsmittance) in Ecotect\nto 0.88 and using the 'clean' glass preset I would expect to see\ntransmissivity values of 0.96 in the .rad file output.  I'm actually getting\nvalues of 0.66.  Even after correcting the .rad file I still find the output\nvalues to be considerably smaller than those from Ecotect.\n\n\nI'm using the high quality preset for Ecotect's calculation (further\nincreasing the quality appears to give slightly larger daylight values), and\nan 'indirect reflections' value of 5 for Radiance, all other parameters are\nthe defaults for Ecotect's Radiance interface.\n\n\nI suppose my real question here is which values should I trust?  Perhaps\nneither.\n\n\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003653.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003653", "created_by": "Nick_Doylend"}
