I exported to Radiance and brought them into Daysim for\nanalysis.  I was surprised to see identical results for the models.  It\nappears that Ecotect doesn't take account of the orientation when it exports\nthe radiance geometry.  What it does instead is to rotate the (sunny) sky\ndescription.  I guess this is fine for Radiance but Daysim does its own 'sky\nthing' and so I guess disregards the exported sky description.\n\n\nI thought I could rotate the geometry file as required, but I also need to\nrotate the sensor grid file.  I can use xform on the geometry file to spin\nit round the z axis, but it doesn't appear to work on the grid file.  I read\na little in the archives about using cnt and rcalc to define new grids - it\nmight work if I thought about it for long enough.  I wonder if there's a\nquicker and easier way to transform the grid file.  Is there?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003684.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003684", "created_by": "Nick_Doylend"}
