Most of the 'free' \nmodels on the Internet are not great or not 'human'. I need a female \nnewsreader with short hair for my scene, or at least a standing female \nmodel with different layers. I tried to get something out of 'Poser 3D' \nbut all i get is a DXF file with one layer. Maybe someone has experience \nexporting DXF out of Poser. I'm a little bit under pressure because it's \nfor my thesis and the 'clock' is running ;-)\nThanks a lot!\n\n\nChristian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003695.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003695", "created_by": "Christian_Fusenig"}
