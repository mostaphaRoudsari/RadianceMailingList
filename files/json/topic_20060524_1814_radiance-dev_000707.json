Please respond there rather  \nthan replying to this.  (You will need to subscribe first if you  \naren't already on that list at <http://www.radiance-online.org/ \nmailman/listinfo/radiance-dev>.)\n\n\nDefinitely run both versions of ximage on both machines after  \ncompiling with -DDEBUG, because the visual selection code changed  \nconsiderably between 3.1.11 and 3.7.2.  It seems the color table code  \nalso changed, though, and the problem might be there.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000707.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000707", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
