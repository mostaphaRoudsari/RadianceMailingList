It is based on keywords and a\nranking system with voting.\n\n\nThe site is working, I am just waiting for our new .eu domain to go up, so\nbear with me.\n\n\nIn the meantime, may I ask for your feedback regarding the keywords. While\nI can easily add new ones as we go along, changing existing ones (or\ndropping them) is more difficult. Here is what I thought:\n\n\n    * AddOns\n    * Ambient\n    * Daylighting\n    * Generators\n    * HDR\n    * Materials\n    * Modelling\n    * Patterns\n    * Scripting\n    * Textures\n    * Tutorial\n\n\nIs any of them not sensible to have?\nShould any be renamed?\nOther ones?\n\n\nIn general, where possible would it be better to\na) use the noun rather than the gerund, e.g. scripts/scripting;\nb) prefer plural over singular, e.g. patterns/pattern.\n\n\nI am trying to make them as consistent as possible. The site has a\nsuggest-new-keywords form, so adding to the list is easy-peacy.\n\n\nThanks for your thoughts\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000708.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000708", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
