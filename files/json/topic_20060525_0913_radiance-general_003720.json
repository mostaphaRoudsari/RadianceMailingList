If I use glass with a bumpy function,\nit looks really cool but I\u0092m not sure if the amount of\nreflection is right. I tried a dielectric, but the\n\u0093water\u0094 becomes a mirror.\n\n\nIs there a material to use that gives properties\ncloser to water than glass? If so, I\u0092d love to hear\nabout it.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nNick L\n\n\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-May/003720.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003720", "created_by": "Nicholas_Lander"}
