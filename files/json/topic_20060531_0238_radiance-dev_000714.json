The domain had been registered (and paid for) \nby me at Network Solutions and will expire* 27. July 2006 *, so you guys \nmight want to establish a new way before that date.\n\n\nSomeone would have to locate new hardware and a new provider, or re-use \nother existing servers, as the current server (a 19\" rack mount on loan \nfrom pab-opto) and its location would not be available. Experience with \nLinux based Internet servers (if iptables ring a bell- excellent!), \nApache, Mailman and CVS are useful.  I'm happy to provide limited \nassistance during the transition, e.g. burn a frozen version of its \ncontent on CD/DVD, supply details of the current config or ship the \nsystem disks. There gotta be a few folks out here, among the 90 people \non the dev list, who fit right in.\n\n\nregards\nPeter Apian-Bennewitz\n\n\n\n\n pab-opto, Freiburg, Germany, http://www.pab-opto.de\n [see web page to check digital email signature]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-May/000714.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000714", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
