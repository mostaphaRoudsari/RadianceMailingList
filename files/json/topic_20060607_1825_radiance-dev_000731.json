If I remove the -DNOSTEREO argument from mach= in the OS X  \ncase in makeall it fails because in glrad.c it can't find X11/ \nextensions/SGIStereo.h. Is there some documentation about what the  \ncode is trying to do so that I can substitute the appropriate os x  \nincludes. I don't have access to an sgi box so it is difficult to  \nfigure out what is in the includes.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nDoug Reeder\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-June/000731.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000731", "created_by": "Doug_Reeder"}
