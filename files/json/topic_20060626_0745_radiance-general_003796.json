The material inside the\nwindtower is non reflective, made with stucco, reflectivity of almost 85%\nI wanted to know what would be the best ambient bounces to use while\nsimulating it since two sincers wher placed in side the space, one sensor\nis placed directly under the windtower, and the other one is at the center\nof the space.\n\n\nThank you,\nMaitha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-June/003796.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003796", "created_by": "Maitha_Dalmouk_Al-Nuaimi"}
