It used to be\nsomewhat similar to NCS, but it's different now. The info on the pack of\nswatches I have here lists the hues as:\n\n\nRR: Magenta through to Red\nYR: Red through to Orange\nYY: Orange through to Green\nGY: Green through to Turquoise\nBG: Turquoise through to Blue\nBB: Blue through to Violet\nRB: Violet through to Magenta\n\n\nIf I assume that lime is 1/2 Y with 1/2 G on the NCS circle, violet is 1/3\nblue with 2/3 red, and magenta is 2/3 blue with 1/3 red, then YY would\ncover a whopping 90 deg on the NCS hue circle, but BB, RB, and RR only 30\ndeg. That doesn't look right.\n\n\nA (not particularly accurate) representation of the NCS circle is in\nchapter 1, page 29 of SynthLight:\nhttp://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/packages/synthlight/handbook/index.html\n\n\nDulux have also changed the chroma part of their notation from 2 to 3 digits.\n\n\nThanks for your time.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003820.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003820", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
