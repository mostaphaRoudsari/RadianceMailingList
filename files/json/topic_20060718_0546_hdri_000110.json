I'm generally wondering who else  \non this list (aside from the obvious) will be in Boston? And related  \nto that, is the HDRI BOF worth a slot on the schedule?\n\n\nI'll also be wandering the Conference w/ iBook, Canon and HDRcapOSX  \nshooting HDRs in both framed and panoramic formats, and I hope to  \nshare them with the list shortly after I get back. (One of my goals  \nis to capture a Brightside monitor in HDR for those who cannot attend!)\n\n\n-Mark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-July/000110.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000110", "created_by": "Mark_Banas"}
