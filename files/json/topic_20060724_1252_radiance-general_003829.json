The color of each sensor is defined based on sun exposure data, I\ncalculate separately (some kind of false-color). With this data I can \ncreate an image with the surface and sensors on it, where color of \nsensors define the distribution of sun exposure on the surface.\nNow, I want to make this representation continual (like the results of\nfalsecolor program), so I must somehow interpolate the color data from\nthe sensor points.\nMy idea is to define the rectangular surface near the original one, made\nof plastic with colordata pattern. Colordata takes next form:\nmod colordata id\n7+n+\nrfunc gfunc bfunc rdatafile gdatafile bdatafile\nfuncfile x1 x2  transform\n0\nm A1 A2 .. Am\n\n\nrdatafile gdatafile bdatafile will be defined with my sensor colors.\n\n\nHow should I define rfunc, gfunc, bfunc to enable bilinear or bicubic \ninterpolation of color?\n\n\n\n\nRelated question:\nAre there any example of coloradata definition? I tried to find them in \nthe Book and in mail archives, but without success!\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003829.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003829", "created_by": "Marija_Cvetkovic"}
