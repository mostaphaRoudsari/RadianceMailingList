Therefore, there may be  glare occured on the monitor screens. I would like to study this through radiance. I wonder how to model the monitor screen in radiance (what material, what reflectance?) and what glare assessment should be used (dgi?ugr?cie?or others?)\n\n\n  Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help.\n\n\n  Best regards,\n\n\n  Yuni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Next-gen email? Have it all with the  all-new Yahoo!
