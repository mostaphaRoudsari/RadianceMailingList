At the upcoming SIGGRAPH conference, BrightSide will\nbe demonstrating the results of this work by showcasing an MPEG-HDR codec in\nconcert with a High Dynamic Range display.  The primary user benefits of the\nMPEGHDR codec are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*         HDR content is preserved throughout the entire digital imaging\npipeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*         Original HDR content can be archived at reduced storage cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*         Image quality is maintained through various stages of video\nediting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking beyond SIGGRAPH BrightSide is interested in developing partnerships\nto further develop and license our compression technology.  If you are\nplanning to attend the SIGGRAPH conference this year and would be interested\nin seeing a demonstration of the power and utility of HDR compression please\nlet contact Mark Grist mark.grist at brightsidetech.com  to arrange a meeting.\nFollow this link for more information on the MPEG-HDR codec. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.brightsidetech.com/products/info/HDR%20Brochure%2002.pdf \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Grist\n\n\nVP Business Development & Marketing\n\n\nBrightSide Technologies Inc.\n\n\nPh  604-228-4624\n\n\nCel 604-317-1533\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-July/000114.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000114", "created_by": "Mark_Grist"}
