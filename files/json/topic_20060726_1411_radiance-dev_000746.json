During the Beta\ntesting stage, please ignore the requirement of having the RadHub logo\nwith uplink on your pages (Submit, Step 2). This check is disabled until\nwe go live, hopefully at the workshop. The data base will be reset then,\nand we'll start from scratch. So don't be shy of submitting any pages,\neven if it is not directly RADIANCE related. The more, the merrier.\n\n\nPlease send lots of feedback.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-July/000746.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000746", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
