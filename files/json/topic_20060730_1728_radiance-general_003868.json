One problem that I am having is \nthat the illums themselves are causing shadows (see here)\n\n\nhttp://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/room7a_day_Camera07_day_pcyl_tr3.jpg\n\n\n\n\nFor the wall fixture, you can see the shadow of the spherical illum. I am \nusing a void material for the illum so it's invisible to the eye but \nobviously not invisible to shadow rays. Is there any work around for this?\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\nMarcus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003868.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003868", "created_by": "Marcus_Jacobs"}
