I know enough to be dangerous!  :)\n\n\nMy comparison consists of placing a calculation point 10' below an iesfile based light fixture.\n\n\nAGI calc = 64810 lux\n\n\nRadiance = 40,822 lux.\n\n\nies2rad -di -t white iesfile.rad\nrtrace -w -h -I -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 2048 -as 512 -ar 512 -ds .1 -aw 0 test.oct < input_pt.txt | rcalc -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'\n\n\nOK, red flag, I've messed up somehow.  The numbers are off by 30%.\n\n\nAfter almost giving up, I ran the same command but deleted the \"-ds .1\" and got 64844 lux!\n\n\nWhat's going on here?  I would think source substructuring \"-ds .1\" would be better than the default (which I think is .2)  I appreciate your thoughts.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-July/003871.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003871", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
