I dont require the display to show any pictures, i just want it to have a uniform white light emitting from one side of 400 nits. Should i use an illum surface? How can i ensure it has the brightness i require??\n\n\nYour reply email (below) and attachments to yuni has helped me some greg, i can now add pictures if i so wish, but not sure if it helps me with my above questions\n\n\nmy box is below, although im sure i havent needed to put it in.\n\n\nthanks in advance \n\n\nchris\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003874.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003874", "created_by": "Chris_Foster"}
