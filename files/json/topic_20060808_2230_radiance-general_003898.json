First, does rpict involve any tonemapping\nprocedure?  In other words, does the .pic file contain the original\ndata without any tonemapping? Second, I rendered the same input files\nwith the same rendering parameters using the \"rad\" comman complied\nfrom the same version of Radiance on a mac and a linux machine. I got\ndifferent .pic files. Not only the images look different ( the\nhighlight on one sphere look brighter), but the .pic values are\ndifferent.  I wonder why this happened. Has anyone experience this?\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the advice,\n\n\nBei\n\n\n\n\nBei\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-August/003898.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003898", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao"}
