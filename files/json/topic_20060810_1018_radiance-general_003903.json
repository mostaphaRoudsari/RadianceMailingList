So I need a sed-command maybe, \nthat finds the normal vertex reference by examining the /-seperated \ntriples in lines beginning with f and replace the normal vertex index by \n0. And it should take care of lines that are continued after a line \nbreak, indicated by a backslash, as that seams to be valid in obj.\n\n\nI am not very good in sed. If someone has a tested sed-string (I guess \nso) it would be great if you could post it, might be of general \ninterest. If not, I will have to think myself ;-) and make hundreds of \nfailed attempts to get this done...\n\n\nThanks...
