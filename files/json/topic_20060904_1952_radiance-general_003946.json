The file format is as follows:\n\n\nx1 y1 z \nx1 y2 z\nx1 y3 z\n...\nx1 yn z\nx2 y1 z\nx2 y2 z\nx2 y3 z\n...\nx2 yn z\n...\nxm y1 z\nxm y2 z\nxm y3 z\n..\nxm yn z\n\n\nwhere z is a variable with different real positve values indicating variable different heights. This set could come from a radiance mesh primitive, but this is not important here. It is just topography, such as the geometry of a landscape. How would you approach this problem? Intermediate steps using the obj or other formats might possibly help. \n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003946.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003946", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
