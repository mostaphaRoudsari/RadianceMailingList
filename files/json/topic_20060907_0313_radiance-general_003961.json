To fit them to a given image aspect ratio\n(height over width) make sure that the quotient of the tangents of the\nangles fit the image aspect, i.e. tan(vv)/tan(vh) = 576/1024 in your\nexample.\nThis gives you undistorted square pixels at the given resolution, I\ndon't know however if this is what you need, 'cause I don't know how\nthat stretching in anamorphic pal is done..\n\n\n-cb\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003961.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003961", "created_by": "Carsten_Bauer"}
