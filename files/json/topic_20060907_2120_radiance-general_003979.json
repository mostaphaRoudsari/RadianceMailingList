It's tricky, but\nwe can turn to RGBs from wavelengths. At least we can use only 550nm\nmeasured data for specific tasks. But for every incident ray we'll get\na whole hemispherical distribution, while in Radiance material\ndescriptions like plasdata, metdata it seems we do not have any means\nto describe this distribution. There is only an incident light and\ncorresponding RGB reflectance (specular I suppose?). Is it right?! \n\n\nBut where is diffuse component to declare?\n\n\nI searched thru the mailing list archives, looked in the digest and\ndidn't find any answer related to my question.\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\nIlya Zimnovich                          mailto:webmaster at audice.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003979.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003979", "created_by": "Ilya_Zimnovich"}
