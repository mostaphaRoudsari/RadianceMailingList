If I am \nsetting ar as usually (ar=scene boundary/detail dimensions, I get \nsomething like -ar 2000. That leads to slow processing with huge memory \nuseage (around 1.6 GB).\n\n\nI wonder if there is a way to reduce the general resolution in such \ncases and increase accuracy in detailed regions only by ad, as and aa.\n\n\nI also wonder if there is at least some performance to win by changing / \nreleasing ambient parameters for high-res pictures after the ouverture \nproduced some values. While people did such things for a while, later \nposts suggested that this is not safe. Is this true for ALL ambient \nparameters?\n\n\nFinally, I am using mkillum to cut one step from the ambient daylight \ncalculation, illums are covering all windows. Does this influence the \nsimple formula used to calculate ar, or is ar only determined by scene \ngeometry?\n\n\nI am a bit desperate, as the ambient paramters needed to produce clean \nimages lead to rendering times about two weeks per 1200x1200 picture at \nthe moment here, on a 3.2GHz P4... so I hope to optimize a bit by \ntweaking ambient calculation. I am already using mkillum and ambient \nexclude lists to accelerate things a bit. The scene will become even \n\"worse\" when I switch on my artificial light sources...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/003983.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_003983", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
