I\nfound somewhere that luminance = 179 * (R*0.265 + G*0.067 + B*0.065).  Can I\nassume that this equation is the one to use to scale my HDR file properly?\n\n\n2) In some references, it is mentionned that I should always capture LDRs\nwith a Daylight white balance.  Is this the general agreement?  Even if my\nscene is lit with tungsten lights?\n\n\n3)I found limited explanation on how the camera calibration curve would\naffect the results in HDR Shop.  I would have to think  that this is to\nlinearize the color values (remove the effect of Gamma + CMOS response) so\nluminance measurements can be actually applied to the colors later on.\n\n\n4)HDR Shops refers to Fstops in the UI.  However,  I read that you want to\nmaintain Fstops constant and only change the shutter speed.  The problem I\nhave is that the interpreted Fstops of HDR Shop turn into some \"arbitrary\"\nnumbers and I can't really type-in the values used by my camera.  \n\n\nI am not too sure if I am using the right methods.   Some \"cook  book\" would\nbe handy.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nPierre-F\u00e9lix Breton\nwww.pfbreton.com <http://www.pfbreton.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2006-September/000135.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000135", "created_by": "Pierre-Felix_Breton"}
