Which seems absurd\nto me.\n\n\nSo what would be the appropriate thing to do here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-September/004028.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004028", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
