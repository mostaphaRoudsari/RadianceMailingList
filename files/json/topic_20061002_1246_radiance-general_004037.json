How would such an approach work\non Radiance? I remember it's been quite a help, but am not sure if it would\nmake sense for Radiance. \n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004037.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004037", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
