Can anyone offer advice in modelling this\nLight-transmitting Concrete\n(http://www.litracon.hu/building-blocks.php)?\n\n\nFor those who have never heard of this material before, it is basically\nconcrete with embedded optical fibres.\nInitial thoughts are to model as 'trans' material modified with a dirty\nfunction for the opaque areas, though there is a definite suggestion\nthat the optic fibres be arranged in rows or columns within the block.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845 Western Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004047.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004047", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn"}
