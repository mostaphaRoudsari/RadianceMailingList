Which material is recommended to get plausible values (for\nreflection (on aluminum and transmission (through the gaps) by using a\nsunny and overcast sky in my simulation model? The result should be the\nilluminance level and respectively Daylight factor inside.\nThe lamellas are just rotatable but not movable, the perforation is\nfixed with 15% (whitout knowing exactly the design of the longish small\nholes) and should be used like lightshelves in front of heat-protection\nglass. \n\n\nThanks for help!\n\n\nFriedemann Kik\nkik at transsolar.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004061.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004061", "created_by": "Friedemann_Kik"}
