One of the beloved render farm machines at my \noffice just turned in a sub-4K second timing on the Mark Stock Radiance \nbenchmark scene.  SSSssssssss!\n\n\nWhat's interesting to note is that there are subtle differences in cpu \nspeed, even among the same cpu model.  I assume this is due to different \nvoltage settings on the motherboards, but I'm not positive.  I also \nwonder how much of the speedup is attributable to the use of the new \nofficial release of Radiance 3.8.  Another interesting thing is that \nthree of four benchmarks had the same exact number of rays traced.  I \nfind this a little odd. \n\n\nI was hoping Greg and maybe Ferdinand (builder and maintainer of my \noffice's render farm systems) could weigh in on this.  I have a couple \nother benchmark timings and stats to add to the site \n(http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html) as well, I was hoping \nothers have installed the official 3.8 and were doing similar testing.\n\n\nHappy benchmarking.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004066.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004066", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
