With only my optimizations added to the default options, \nevery compilation returned something like:\n\n\ngcc -I../common -L../lib -O2 -march=athlon-xp -ffast-math \n-mno-ieee-fp -Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -Dfseeko=fseek \n-L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO   -c -o nff2rad.o \nnff2rad.c\nIn file included from nff2rad.c:70:\n/usr/include/stdio.h:688: error: conflicting types for fseek\n/usr/include/stdio.h:656: error: previous declaration of fseek \nwas here\nmake: *** [nff2rad.o] Error 1\n\n\nSo I removed \"-Dfseeko=fseek\" from the build command and \neverything progressed nicely. This is with gcc (GCC) 4.1.1 \n20060525 and Linux zeus.localdomain 2.6.16-1.2133_FC5 #1 Tue Jun \n6 00:52:14 EDT 2006 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux.\n\n\nMy older machine, with Fedora Core 1 and gcc (GCC) 3.3.2 20031022 \ndid not encounter that problem. Radiance built beautifully on the \nfirst try.\n\n\n\n\nNow, the only \"bad\" stuff that I get is the usual\n\n\npfilt.c:(.text+0x144f): warning: the use of `mktemp' is \ndangerous, better use `mkstemp'\n\n\nwhich doesn't affect compilation or execution.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2006-November/000756.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000756", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
