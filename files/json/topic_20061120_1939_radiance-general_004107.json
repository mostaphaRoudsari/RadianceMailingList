Also we'd like to undertake some measurements of\nirradiance/illuminance inside the scale model under artificial skies.\n\n\nSo I need your suggestions concerning what camera to choose.\nAt the current moment I keep an eye on SBIG ST-8XMEI and ProMetric 1400/1600\nseries. What else can you recommend?\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\nIlya A.
