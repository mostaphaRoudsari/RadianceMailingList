I am responding purely so that other newbies can find the answers\nmore quickly next time. \n\n\nTo test the sky output I produced just one sky description with +s and -B &\n-R defined. Created octree with a simple horizontal surface (not sure this\nwas necessary) and sky. Then: \n\n\nRview -i -vf viewfile.vf test.oct\n\n\n>From this I derived the direct illuminance on the surface using TRACE\ncommand. \n\n\nThen restart rview with same parameters but include -ab 1 to include the\ndiffuse component from the skydome. Easy. Trace again, and check the values\nagainst my assumptions. \n\n\nIn short, specifying -R & -B explicitly define. Had just managed to confuse\nmyself by thinking too hard! \n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nNick  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 5\nDate: Wed, 22 Nov 2006 10:24:34 -0000\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-November/004116.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004116", "created_by": "Nick_Devlin"}
