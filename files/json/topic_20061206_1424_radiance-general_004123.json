If I know a little about the composition of the mist\n(e.g. droplet size and density), is there a way to derive the extinction\ncoefficient (-me), scattering albedo (-ma) and eccentricity parameter\n(-mg)?  \n\n\nAlso, the beginning of chapter 14 of Rendering With Radiance suggests\nthat the single scatter approximation used is only appropriate for thin\nmists - is there a guideline for how thin \"thin\" should be?  I want to\ntry several different thicknesses including some cases where visibility\nmight be less than one metre...\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nAndy Stone\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004123.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004123", "created_by": "Andy_Stone"}
