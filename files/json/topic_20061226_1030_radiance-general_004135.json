If I understand this \nparameter well, 0 value turns off irradiance caching, so we can use it \nwhen caching isn't needed (mkillum calculation for venetian blinds or \nrtcontrib).\nWhen we set -aa 0, does -ar have influence on minimum sampling distance, \nsince: min sampling distance = max scene dimension* aa/ar.\n\n\nWhen I run a rtrace calculation with -aa 0, calculation time is much \nshorter than with -aa 0.1. Why?\n\n\n\n\nHave a nice holidays :)\nMarija.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-December/004135.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004135", "created_by": "Marija_Cvetkovic"}
