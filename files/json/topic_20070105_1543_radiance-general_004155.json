I'm currently working\non a research project on glass lamellas for daylight directing and solar\nshading purposes at the technical university of Denmark. \n\n\nHere's the question:\nWhat is the best way to model the glass blinds in Radiance? \nThe glass that I'll be using for the project has the following\ncharacteristics:\n\n\nVisual properties\t\t\nExt. Reflectance, LR [%]\t31\t\nInt. Reflectance, LR [%]\t31\t\nTransmittance, LT [%]\t59\t\nRA-index\t97.3\t\n\n\nSolar properties\t\t\nSolar reflectance [%]\t32\t\nDirect solar transmittance [%]\t40\t\nSolar Absorption [%]\t20/8\t\ng-vl/solar factor\t0.48\t\n\n\nI have been trying to use the material types \"trans\" and \"dielectrica\",\nin order to benefit from the angular dependent properties of the glass,\nI would prefer to use a matrial type which includes the refraction\nindex.  \nHere comes my dilemma:\nThe material type \"glass\": in IESve the type does not include the\nrefraction index which means that the only input is the transmissivity\nof the glass. \nThe \"trans\" material type: same problem but at least I'm able to define\nthe reflectance of the glazing. \t\nThe \"dielectrica\" material type: IESve only allows me to enter values\nbetween 1 and 2 for the refraction index which in this case have no\nsignificant effect.\nI'm sure that the best thing I could do is to model the whole thing over\nagain in the \"original\" Radiance - but as I have a short deadline, I\nprefer to get it done in IESve!\n\n\nHope someone out there is able to help me out on this one!\n\n\nKind Regards \n\n\nJacob B Laustsen, DTU, Denmark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-January/004155.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004155", "created_by": "Jacob_Birck_Laustsen"}
