But what about the light \nsources generated by mkillum?\n\n\nThan, my scene has one more strange feature. More or less all the outer \nwalls are instances. So putting a big occluder around the closed parts \nof the building would speed-up because I do not have to test for light \nsources behind the wall. But the only outer light source there is the \nsky distribution + sun. The sky distribution is an indirect source in \nRadiance afaik, so will I win anything?\n\n\nThanks, hope someone can bring some light into my occluded understanding \nof the cache,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004182.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004182", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
