I used the header that \nwas posted from the thread but it still prompted me with 'bad header'. \nSo, I'm not sure whether it's the header or my input lines that didn't \nwork.\n\n\n   I was wondering if someone could share a file with correct spacing \nof header along with sample input lines that would make glaze.csh run \nwithout error? Thank you very much in advance.\n\n\nSiritip Harn.\n\n\nPh.D. Pre-Candidate\nTaubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning\nUniversity of Michigan\n\n\nsiritip at umich.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004184.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004184", "created_by": "Siritip_Harn"}
