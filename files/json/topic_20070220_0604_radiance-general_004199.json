The second room is only lit via 'borrowed' light at the top of\nthe wall between the two rooms.\n\n\nMy question is: \"How to use mkillum with different parameters for the\ntwo sets of windows using rad?\"\n\n\nFor the outside windows, genrad suggests a ground ambient level of 68.5\nthus I would need to specify an -av 68.5 68.5 68.5, -ab 1 and possibly\ns=16 d=8.\n\n\nFor the internal windows, which can be seen through (to the ceiling of\nthe other room) I am not sure as to the av settings. Tests using the av\n68.5 settings, while giving a good gradient, have an odd bright band on\nthe ceiling, so I assume the av would need to be lower - how to\ndetermine that value or do you simply leave it out.\n\n\nAs I am using trad/rad I want to embed the commands within the window\nrad file rather than in the rif 'mkillum=' line. Reading the man page\nfor mkillum, it suggests that these options can be embedded but have had\nno success to date.\n\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nTerrance Mc Minn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/004199.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004199", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn"}
