I need to minimize the number of triangles and would prefer polygons.\n\n\n2) Now that PowerMac laptops are on the rise, how can I get the most out of hardware life? Turn the computer off at night or use the sleep function whenever possible? Put ice packs under the powerbook? \n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMartin\n\n\nMartin Moeck, ASU\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004224.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004224", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
