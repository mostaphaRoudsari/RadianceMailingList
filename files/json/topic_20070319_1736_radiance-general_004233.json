Greg provided for me an accurate monitor model as part of the furnishing to be incorporated in this space. The monitor is a .rad file format. I didn't get the chance to insert the file in the cad system. I asked Greg about this and he doesn\u2019t know enough about Desktop Radiance to advise me on how to incorporate the monitor in my model. Is there an advice that might help. The option of accessing the file using the furnishing folder in the radiance menu (by uploading the monitor in the library) didn't work.\n\n\nIs there is an efficient way to upload the monitor into my Desktop Radiance model.\n\n\nWith thanks and you are much appreciated.\n\n\nRespectfully,\nMohamad\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004233.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004233", "created_by": "Mohamad_Tarek_Araji"}
