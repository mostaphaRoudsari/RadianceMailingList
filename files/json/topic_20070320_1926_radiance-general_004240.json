I think we should take a position on this\nlist and to strongly discourage anyone tempted to use dtp-rad. It's a corpse\nof the nice (na\u00efve? )intention to encapsulate the power of Radiance in a\nGUI, and choose (god forbid) acad as a place to do so... \n\n\nThere is a ton of tools that will allow you to work perfectly with Radiance\non win32, but dtp-rad is *NOT* one of them! If you need a positive\ndefinition of what those are, I'm happy to re-iterate those.\nThere are many competent converters out there, and many project that present\na good interface to Radiance (brad, conrad, schorsch.com)\n\n\nCan I suggest that perhaps it would be great to have pointers to these\nvaries projects on the official radiance site, or perhaps\nradianc-online.org? Radiance on *nix is pretty straightforward, and is a\ndifferent  audience from the win32 platform, where it is *far* more\ndifficult to set up a decent Radiance workflow, rather than the configure,\nmake, install routine. I think this knowledge needs to be condensed\nsomewhere soon.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004240.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004240", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
