In the near future, we'll also cover how to import\nand export images and records.\n\n\nAnything else?\n\n\nEven if you're not a newbie, that's ok -- what do YOU think would be\nhelpful?  What did you struggle with when you first started using it?\nWhat do you still struggle with?\n\n\nLastly, is anyone interested in reading the drafts and giving feedback\non what's already written?\n\n\nTIA!\n\n\nJudy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2007-March/000160.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000160", "created_by": "Judy_Lai"}
