Of course I don't \nexpect to obtainr 100% accurate reflectance in each point of the \nmaterial :)\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004247.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004247", "created_by": "Marija"}
