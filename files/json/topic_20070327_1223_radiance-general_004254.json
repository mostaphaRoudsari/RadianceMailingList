I\ncertainly prefer it to Autocad, 3d studio etc. It's development was always\nintended for use during early design stages by providing quick iterative\nresults.\n\n\nHowever, I would also suggest that using it with Desktop Radiance will not\nonly seriously limit the analysis process by limiting access to the newer\nRadiance functions, but also potentially compromise the validity of your\nresults and cloud your understanding of the various Radiance analysis\nfunctions and parameters.\n\n\nSo, if you have access to Linux and the latest Radiance versions, I would go\nwith that, but use Ecotect to build your models and export the relevant .rad\nfiles. You can also export the analysis girds locations etc for use with\nRtrace directly within Linux version. Finally, you can then re-import the\nvalues to Ecotect for certainly visualization tasks. \n\n\nI run Ubuntu Linux on my windows machine through VMware workstation, where\nyou can set up shared folders to move data between linux and windows. \n\n\nI would however strongly recommend that you have a look at Axel's Radiance\ntutorials from London Metropolitan University as these are on the money as\nthey say. They can be found at:\nhttp://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/student/resources/notes.shtml.\n\n\nGood luck..\n\n\nNick\nNick Devlin Associates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Mon, 26 Mar 2007 22:32:11 +0100 (BST)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004254.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004254", "created_by": "Nick_Devlin"}
