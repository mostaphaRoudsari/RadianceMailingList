Radiance binaries compiled with Mingw32 for \n    windows, look in: \n\n\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=3Dmodload&name=3DDownloads=\n    &file=3Dindex&req=3Dgetit&lid=3D12\n\n\n    Ecotect 5.5 is very fast and easy to model and run daylighting \n    simulations. Model your atrium, after that call RADIANCE Export Toll \n    and voila.\n    ECOTECT has a very good interface trough RADtool, they run smooth and \n    you'll have very precise images and analyses.\n    If possible, forget Desktop Radiance.\n\n\n    Regards to all, from Brasil\n\n\n  [vangelis] \n\n\n1. Do you think Ecotech 5.5 with Desktop Radiance control panel (the\nnewest version ) is the right tool to do my atrium research? I like using it\nfor its clear GUI, but if it could finish similar work and achieve the same\nresults as its UNIX/LINUX brother?\n\n\n  2.  I think a lot of complex atrium roofs have to be researched and\nconstructed in my project, if UNIX/LINUX Radiance is the most suitable tool?\nIf Linux version is good, could I use the Radiance on Cygwin Environment?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-March/004257.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004257", "created_by": "Evangelos"}
