The scene is listed below. The scene is rendered as follows:\n\n\nrview ... -ab 1 -ae red (or redsky) octree \n\n\nThe object sc.oct turns red. This should be avoided. What is the issue here - the material glow?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMartin\n\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nvoid instance sc\n1 sc.oct\n0 0\n\n\nvoid glow red\n0 0 4\n2 0 0 0\n\n\nred source redsky\n0 0 4\n0 0 1 360\n\n\nvoid light bright\n0 0 3\n1000 1000 1000\n\n\nbright source light1\n0 0 4\n1 1 1 1\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004285.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004285", "created_by": "Martin_Moeck"}
