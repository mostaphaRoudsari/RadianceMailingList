I can output the transmitted flux vs outgoing direction for \nlight incident at different angles.\n\n\nHow would I create a surface in Radiance which would behave in the same way \nas observed using the forward ray tracer. BRTDfunc? Can I specify arbitrary \noutput distributions for a comprehensive sampling of all incoming \ndirections? Is there a \"BRTDdata\" surface type?\n\n\nAny ideas? Other things I should be aware of?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nFrank\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck Out Our List Of Trendy Restaurants.
