But be careful when you wrap the fixture in an illum box as the light output may be quite right.  It's been a while since I've had to do this, but I recall having issues with \"flatcorr\" and \"lboxcorr\" in my brightdata definitions (created by IES2RAD).  I'm not sure where these are documented, but I'm sure other functions are used for spheres and rings.  I believe the sphere option is the easiest to work out, but only works if you can wrap your fixture in the illum sphere and the sphere does not bisect geometry.  In my case I've had to work out linear fluorescent pendants which have required a box.\n\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Wed, 25 Apr 2007 13:03:30 -0600\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004304.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004304", "created_by": "Mark_de_la_Fuente"}
