The 'lampcolor' script calculates the right RGB  \nvalues\nfor you. Here is a sample session for a T5 35W lamp:\n\n\nble at zwielicht:~ $lampcolor\nProgram to compute lamp radiance.  Enter '?' for help.\nEnter lamp type [WHITE]:\nEnter length unit [meter]:\nEnter lamp geometry [polygon]: cylinder\nCylinder length [1]: 1.449\nCylinder radius [0.1]: 0.008\nEnter total lamp lumens [0]: 3300\nLamp color (RGB) = 80.569890 80.569895 80.569895\nEnter lamp type [WHITE]: ble at zwielicht:~ $\n\n\nThe RGB values of 80.57 now go in a definition for the light material\nwhich in turn is used by the cylinder definition:\n\n\n## light material for 35W T5 lamp\nvoid light light_35W_T5\n0\n0\n3 80.57 80.57 80.57\n\n\n## light applied to cylinder centred at (0,0,0) and aligned with x-axis\nlight_35W_T5 cylinder lamp_T5\n0\n0\n7 -0.7245 0 0   0.7245 0 0   0.008\n\n\n\n\nThese four lines will create a bare T5 lamp that can be used as light\nsource in Radiance scenes. The output distribution of a real lamp might\nbe a tiny bit different (at the end caps for example) but I'd say it's\nclose enough for lighting calculations.\n\n\nYou should not stick this lamp in complex reflector geometry and let\nRadiance do the calculations of the resulting distribution for you.\nThe algorithms in Radiance are not suited for this kind of calculation.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004309.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004309", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
