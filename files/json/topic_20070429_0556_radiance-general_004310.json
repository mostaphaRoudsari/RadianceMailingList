Due to unforseen circumstances  \nbeyond our control, ASU is no longer a possibility.  Therefore, we  \nmade a small call for volunteers, and had an offer from Katja  \nDoerschner at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.  The  \ncurrent dates proposed are the 1-2 October, barring any conflicts.   \nIf you know of major conferences being held at that time, please let  \nus know either by responding to this message, or sending e-mail to me  \nand Katja directly.  We could probably push it a little later, but no  \nearlier due to our own personal schedule conflicts.\n\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-April/004310.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004310", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
