What do you get when you type  \n\"echo $RAYPATH\"?  I'm guessing you don't have '.' in the path for  \nsome reason.  Either that, or the directory you're in doesn't have  \nthe right permissions.  (Though I would expect an earlier error in  \nthat case.)  What do you get when you type \"ls -l illum12.dat\"?\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004318.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004318", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
