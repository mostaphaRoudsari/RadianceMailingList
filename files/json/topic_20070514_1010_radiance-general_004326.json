I \nhave a dome with a highly specular (consider 99% specular) surface. The \ndome is an obj-mesh, with interpolated vertex normals (\"smooth\") and \nimported using obj2mesh.\n\n\nThe rounded vertexes render a smooth dome when viewed from below, as \nexpected. But as this dome reflects light onto the floor, it is some \nkind of a big convex reflector. I wonder if for light reflected from \nthis reflector to the ground, the normal interpolation is applied, too. \nThe background for my question are big bright splotches on the floor. I \nalso wonder if this geometry is something not really to be modeled in \nclassic radiance, as the old questions of convex reflectors and backward \nraytracing might occur. Is this even a case for photon mapping? I have \nnever been in modeling a convex reflector, for architecture this is not \na typical example in our days, so I am curious about what you propose...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004326.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004326", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
