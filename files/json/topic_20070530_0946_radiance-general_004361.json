Since we're doing this as part of a big event, we  \nthought we might ask for community donations to sponsor cancer  \nresearch and Mashhuda Glencross set up the following page with  \nJustGiving, a leading UK fundraising organization:\n\n\n\thttp://www.justgiving.com/AcceleratedRenderers\n\n\nIf you feel like sponsoring us, I'm told it's easy to do.  The  \namounts are all in British pounds, but I think any credit card should  \nwork the conversion for you.  It's a very good cause, though I'm told  \nthat jumping out of a plane is one of the quickest cancer cures known...\n\n\nMany thanks,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  Katja Doerschner and I are just putting in the proposal for the  \nnext Radiance workshop to be held at the University of Minnesota.  We  \ndidn't hear back from anyone regarding conflicts for the selected  \ndates, the 1st and 2nd October, so let us know right away if you are  \naware of any problems.  Thanks.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-May/004361.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004361", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
