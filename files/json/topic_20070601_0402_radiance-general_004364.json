But the error is still very large. Again\nthanks for telling me the command \"rtrace\". It's really a useful tool to\nhelp me debug my program and it facilitated me to find out there is\nsomething wrong about conversion from PIC file to TIFF file. I failed to\ndisable the gamma correction!!! After setting the gamma exponent to 1, all\nthe values are correct. Many many thanks!!!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-June/004364.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004364", "created_by": "Sun_ChenGuang"}
