Convert the 'jpg' image to uncompressed 'tif'\n#\tconvert -compress none texture.jpg texture.tif\n# 2. Create a 'pic' image from the 'tif':\n#\tra_tiff -r texture.tif texture.pic\n# 3. Determine the average red green blue values of the 'pic' image\n#\tximage texture.pic &\n#\t  Left click and drag a rectangle over a representative area of the\nimage\n#\t  Press the letter 'c' to display the values e.g. 0.02,0.45,0.36\n# 4. Calculate the appropriate grey values e.g.\n#\ticalc /usr/local/lib/ray/lib/rayinit.cal\n#\t  grey(0.02,0.45,0.36)\n#\t  $1=0.330185114\tprinted by the icalc program\n#\t  ^C\t\t\tControl C to quit the program\n# 5. Copy/create the texture material as a plastic or trans material\n#\tDon't label the material with the final modifier name at this stage\n#\tThe red green blue values should be the value of $1 calculated in\nthe last step\n# 6. Create the colorpict entry to link the image and transformation size.\n#\tSize is always taken as the smallest dimension of the image is 1\nunit.\n# 7. Alias the colorpict and the material to the required modifier name\n\n\n# size 1219 x 2438 This is the size reported with Sketchup for the use of\nthis image\nvoid plastic Concrete_Form_4x8\n0\n0\n5 0.423402293 0.423402293 0.423402293 0.000000 0.000000\n\n\nvoid colorpict image_data_Concrete_Form_4x8\n9 red green blue textures/Concrete.pic . frac(U) frac(V) -s 1219\n0\n0\n\n\nimage_data_Concrete_Form_4x8 alias Concrete Concrete_Form_4x8\n\n\nximage Concrete.pic shows the expected 1 to 2 aspect ratio.\n\n\ngetinfo -d Concrete.pic reports -Y 336 +X 168\n\n\nI have tried varying the last line of colorpict stanza to add in an aspect\nratio e.g 1 0.5 or 1 2, neither made any difference.\n\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.\n\n\nRegards \n\n\nTerry Mc Minn\nFaculty of Built Environment, Art and Design\nCurtin University of Technology\nGPO Box U 1987 Perth 6845\nWestern Australia\nEmail: T.Mcminn at curtin.edu.au\nCRICOS Provider Code: 00301J \n\n\n\n\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. \nVersion: 7.5.472 / Virus Database: 269.8.5/826 - Release Date: 31/05/2007\n4:51 PM\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-June/004365.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004365", "created_by": "Terrance_Mc_Minn"}
