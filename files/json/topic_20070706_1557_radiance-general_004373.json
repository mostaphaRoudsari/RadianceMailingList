Peter Apian- \nBennewitz packed it up, and Daniel Fuller unpacked, connected and  \nconfigured it.  The site was working almost immediately with IP  \nredirection, but the mailing list has been more of a problem.\n\n\nIf this gets through, but you don't see a post you made to the list  \nin the last few weeks, please repost it to the list.\n\n\nThanks,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004373.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004373", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
