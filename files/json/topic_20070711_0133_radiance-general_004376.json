Each pane is ordinary 4mm clear glass with transmittance 0.91.\n\n\nFor double glazing simulation I use glaze.csh script, but I don't have  \nan idea how triple glazing can be simulated. I suppose I should use  \nsome BRTDfunc material with transmittance angle distribution similar  \nto my glazing system.\n\n\nI didn't manage to find anything on Internet, so hints, ideas and  \nexamples are very welcome!\nSince I can see that triple glazings gain the popularity, I suppose  \nthis subject is interesting to other members too.\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004376.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004376", "created_by": "Marija"}
