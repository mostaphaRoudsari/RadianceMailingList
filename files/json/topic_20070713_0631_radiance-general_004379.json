But now I want to apply it to a mesh, (or object generated \nwith gensurf with the smoothing option on).  Instead of receiving the \nperturbed (interpolated) vertex normals, it just applies to the local \nsurface normal, leading to faceted appearance.\n\n\nHow do I access the interpolated surface normals in a .cal file?\n\n\nCheers,\nRoland\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004379.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004379", "created_by": "Roland_William_Fleming"}
