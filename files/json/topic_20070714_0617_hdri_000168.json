{"topic": "PostDoc position - Removal of Ghosting Artifacts in High Dynamic Range Images", "category": "hdri", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Geraldine Joffre", "created_at": "July 14, 2007 at 06:17AM", "body": "A postdoctoral position is available at Laboratoire d'Informatique de Robotique et de \nMicro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, UMR CNRS 5506, France, to develop and investigate algorithms for \nremoving ghosting artifacts that arise when merging differently exposed photographs of a moving \nscene into a High Dynamic Range image.\n\n\nThis work in the field of High Dynamic Range Imaging will be carried out in the context of a project \nbetween HDRsoft Sarl and ICAR team of LIRMM Laboratory.\n\n\nThe project involves analyzing the publications on the topic, understanding the strengths and \nweaknesses of existing algorithms, and researching techniques to improve them.  It also involves \nidentifying the different types of ghosting in order to propose a classification with the appropriate \napproaches for each type. The goal is to devise algorithms that properly address all types of \nghosting artifacts.\n\n\nRequirements:\n\u0095       PhD in computer vision, image processing or allied field.\n\u0095       Excellent mathematical and analytical abilities\n\u0095       Good programming skills in C or C++\n\n\nBeginning: October 2007\nDuration: One year fellowship\nLocation: ICAR team, LIRMM, Montpellier\n\n\nIf interested, please  email a CV and the names of three references to:\nGeraldine Joffre: contact at hdrsoft.com\nWilliam Puech:  william.puech at lirmm.fr and Olivier Strauss: olivier.strauss at lirmm.fr\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2007-July/000168.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000168", "created_by": "Geraldine_Joffre"}
