I'm getting my settings all wrong.  I'm using -ad and -lw to control\nthe accuracy, but I haven't got a good feel for how to vary them -\nshould I set -ad as I would for a normal rtrace-type calculation and\nthen reduce lw until I get what I want, or does ad need to be higher for\nan rtcontrib type calculation?  Or is there another setting I need to\nlook at?\n\n\n2. I'm using cygwin.  Is anyone aware of any memory limitations with\ncygwin? I've seen the web page about increasing the memory available to\ncygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html) and that\ndidn't help at all - apparently cygwin on my machine has a maximum heap\nsize of about 1.5Gb.  \n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nAndy Stone\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004386.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004386", "created_by": "Andy_Stone"}
