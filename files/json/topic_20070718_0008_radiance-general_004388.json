I have taken a 'Radiance' course during my MS\ncurriculum. My thesis deals with daylighting and radiance is primary\nsoftware that I am using for my thesis research.\n\n\nI will be graduating by mid-september, and have started looking for\njob. I believe that during my MS curriculum, I have acquired a\nskillset appropriate for Building energy analysis and Daylighting\ndesign & analysis.\n\n\nDaylighting design and analysis is one of my core interests in my\ncareer. I wish to keep working with Radiance during my professional\ncareer to further develop my software knowledge and modelling skills.\n\n\nCould you please suggest consulting firms (in USA) which use Radiance\n(as one of the tools) for daylighting design and analysis ? (and\nfirms, which might be looking for fresh graduates)\n\n\nThanks and regards,\n\n\nShrikar\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-July/004388.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004388", "created_by": "Shrikar_Bhave"}
