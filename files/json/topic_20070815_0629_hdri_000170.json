This isn't an issue with other .hdr  files rendered in \nother applications, just the renders from 5.6U.\n\n\nCheers,\nLisa\n\n\nLisa E Yimm\nHDR-VFX, LLC\nhttp://www.hdrvfx.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2007-August/000170.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000170", "created_by": "L.Yimm"}
