There is less than a week until the abstract deadline,  \nand just three weeks until the workshop is held, and we have many  \nslots left to fill.  I am just starting to work on my abstracts, too.\n\n\n\thttp://www.dtc.umn.edu/cgi-bin/seminars/symposia/radiance.php\n\n\nIt should be an exciting workshop, and Minneapolis is pretty nice  \nthis time of year.  I hope to see you there!\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-September/004429.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004429", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
