It is stated in the manual that \"If the\ntime is preceded by a plus sign ('+'), then it is interpreted as local\nsolar time instead.\" However, I use the following command:\ngensky 3 21 +10.00EST -a 40.77 -o 73.967\nThe program echoes:\ngensky: bad time format: +10.00EST\n\n\nI look into gensky.c and find out that\nif ( (tsolar = *cp == '+') ) cp++;\nif (tsolar || !isalpha(*cp)) {\n\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"%s: bad time format: %s\\n\", progname, hs);\n\t\texit(1);\n}\nIf tsolar is 1, then the program will exit. Does it mean that the\nlocal solar time is not supported? Thanks.\n\n\nYu Sheng\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-September/004434.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004434", "created_by": "Sheng_Yu"}
