If you have been  \nthinking about coming, Minneapolis is lovely this time of year, and  \nwe hope you can make it -- it's not too late.\n\n\nTo round out the talks, we've decided to hold a few tutorial  \nsessions.  One will be given by Zack Rogers of Architectural Energy  \nCorporation on his Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool (SPOT),  \nexplaining its design and use.  I plan to give a tutorial on image- \nbased lighting, demonstrating HDR image capture, using mksources and  \nusing a captured lighting environment to illuminate synthetic  \nobjects.  I may give another tutorial on rtcontrib as well, depending  \non time constraints.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-September/004440.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004440", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
