Those of you that run servers\nthemselves and read their log files regularly might have noticed some\nextra traffic this weekend caused by RaySearchBot. Hope this didn't\ncause any hardware to catch fire, and I do apologize for any\ninconvenience this might have caused.\n\n\nHere is the link: http://luxal.dachary.org/raysearch/index.shtml\n\n\nYou'll find the sites and pages that are indexed on the Stats and\nSites page. I tried to guess what the structures of your sites are,\nand how to get most of the pages relevant to the Radiance users, but\nchances are that not all of what you see in the list is correct.\n\n\nSo: If you run one of those sites, please get in touch with me\noff-list, so we can:\n- discuss some optimization,\n- remove your site if you don't wish to be included\n- work out any problems\n\n\nAnybody else is welcome to make any other suggestions on-list, e.g.\nother pages that I am not aware of or simply forgot. The system is\nstill a bit rough around the edges, which is why I am not posting to\ngeneral yet, but please do try it out and let me know what you think.\n\n\nFor now, I intend to focus solely on technical infos on Radiance, and\ndon't want to include consultancy, general (day-)light stuff etc.\nThere are also still problems with non-english texts, Php-generated\nsites (Francesco), and some PDFs.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-September/000779.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000779", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
