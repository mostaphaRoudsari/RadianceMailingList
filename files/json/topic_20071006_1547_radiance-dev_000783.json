Ward for replying to all my emails and taking\ncare of all problems I run into.\n\n\nAt the moment Debian's version is '3R8+20070924.dfsg' - which mainly\nmeans it is the CVS HEAD from 2007-09-24. Unfortunately I had to remove\nsome pdf files which are in the Radiance distribution without sources,\ntherefore the .dfsg was added to the version - but I'm sure Gregory and\nme will find a way around that, too.\n\n\nThe following packages are shipped in Debian:\n\n\n* radiance - containing the binaries and manpages\n* radiance-doc - containing all other documentation and the examples\n* radiance-materials - all material files\n* radiance-sse3 - SSE3 optimized versions of the renderers, this package\nis only available on i386, the amd64 binaries are automatically\noptimized for SSE4 (if I remember right, man gcc tells more ;))\n\n\nThe overview in the package tracing system can be found at [1].\n\n\n/usr/share/radiace/doc/README.Debian provides additional details, it can\n also be read online at [2]\n\n\nIf the pacakges are not available on your favourite platform yet,\nthey're probably just not built yet - some buildds seem to lag a bit\nbehind - [3]. Please try again later :)\n\n\nI'd be happy about any kind of feedback, especially before Lenny will be\nreleased - which will take some more months for sure, but as soon as it\nis released, there's no way to fix minor bugs anymore.\n\n\nAlso - if there's any interest - I'll make sure there will be backports\nfor Etch available as soon as the package migrates from unstable to testing.\n\n\nIf there's any interest I can also build and provide a Debian live cd\nwith radiance pre-installed.\n\n\nFor developers are probably the build logs interesting - they're\nprovided at [4]. Patches I've added to build under Debian are listed at\n[5]. Mainly they remove the shipped libtiff in favor for Debian's\nlibtiff and fix several implicit declarations, which are known to result\nin problems on several of Debian's architectures.\n\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions regarding the packages or Debian.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n\n\n\n\n[1]:\nhttp://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=radiance&searchon=names&suite=unstable&section=all\n[2]:\nhttp://svn.recluse.de/filedetails.php?repname=debian&path=%2Ftrunk%2Fpackages%2Fradiance%2Fdebian%2FREADME.Debian&rev=0&sc=0\n[3]:\nhttp://people.debian.org/~igloo/status.php?packages=radiance\n[4]: http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=radiance\n[5]:\nhttp://svn.recluse.de/listing.php?repname=debian&path=%2Ftrunk%2Fpackages%2Fradiance%2Fdebian%2Fpatches%2F&rev=0&sc=0\n\n\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-October/000783.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000783", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz"}
