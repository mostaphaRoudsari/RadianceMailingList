But the\nresult right under the lamp was strange, that is, the other values were as I\nexpected but only in the area directly under the lamp the illuminance was\nhighest at the center and decreased gradiently as went to the end of the\nlamp. For example, the illuminance was 5000 lux at the center right under\nthe lamp, but it decreased to 15 lux at a quarter point of the lamp,\nthough the two would be almost same.\nMaybe I am not understanding properly the lamp description. Can you anyone\nexplain this to me? Or Radiance is not adequate for near field calculation\nwith long cylindrical lamp?\n\n\nBest Regards\n\n\nMinki Sung\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004475.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004475", "created_by": "Minki_Sung"}
