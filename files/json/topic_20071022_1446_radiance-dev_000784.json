(Feel free to subscribe if you aren't.)\n\n\nHaving compatibility links as an option during installation is fine  \nwith me if it defaults to \"yes\" or provides a clear explanation of  \nthe pitfalls of not installing the links.  I guess we only need a  \nlink for genbox at this point, though I would like to keep \"rview\" in  \nthere as well for consistency with extant documentation.\n\n\nNone of the tools look in the $RAYPATH directories for executables,  \nand I don't store any there.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-October/000784.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000784", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
