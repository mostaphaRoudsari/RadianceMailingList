You can convert IGES to brlcad to OBJ, which should produce \nvery clean OBJ files. Than you can enjoy the great OBJ-support in \nRadiance, including smooth surfaces and all the neat stuff...\n\n\nYou can script the whole procedure.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-October/004519.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004519", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
