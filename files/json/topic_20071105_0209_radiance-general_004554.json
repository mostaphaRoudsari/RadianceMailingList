Of course,\nwriting a face with its colors wouldn't really work out here, since I would\nneed some form of interpolation of the color values between the different\nfaces, or things would get pretty ugly. Has anyone run into this kind of\nconversion? Any pointers much appreciated!\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004554.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004554", "created_by": "jelle_feringa"}
