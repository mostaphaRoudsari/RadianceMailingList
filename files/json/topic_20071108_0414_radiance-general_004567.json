I have just \nstarted my PhD studies at Uppsala University, Sweden, where my project \nwill be related to optical characterization, daylighting simulations, \nand energy aspects. I am currently not a Mac user and I\u2019ve therefore \nchosen to work with Daysim. I understand that this is a radiance mailing \nlist, but I believe that Daysim is well-known to at least some of you, \nand I\u2019m hoping that you will be able to help me.\n\n\nMy problem is that when I import my SketchUp files to Daysim the \nresulting material file references the ImportFrom3ds.geo.ra file rather \nthan the C:/DAYSIM/materials/ catalogue, which from my understanding is \nthe preferred reference.\n\n\nThis occurs for all materials in the SketchUp file that I have created \nand for the glazing materials in the example file (PrivateOffices.3ds) \nincluded with the Daysim program.\n\n\nI\u2019m using the DaysimMaterialsForSketchUp in my sketch and I have the \nstyle set to \u201cMonochrom\u201d before I export the 3ds file. What else do I \nneed to think of when creating/exporting/importing my drawings?\n\n\nI am new to the daylighting simulation world, but I\u2019m hoping to learn, \nand I appreciate any hints, ideas, comments and help I can get.\n\n\nBest regards,\nAnnica\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004567.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004567", "created_by": "Annica_Nilsson"}
