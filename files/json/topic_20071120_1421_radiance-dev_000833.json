As\nmigrating often takes longer than 10 days, it should be uploaded as soon\nas possible.\nSo if you have something that should go into Ubuntu Hardy, please\ncontact me as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nThanks & cheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n[1]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyReleaseSchedule\n\n\nBernd Zeimetz\n<bernd at bzed.de>                         <http://bzed.de/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2007-November/000833.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000833", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz"}
