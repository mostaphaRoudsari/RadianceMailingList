Earth to G. SKETCHUP it assumes the full coordinates from\nbuilding location and VOIL\u00c1..... Now only you have to do is align\nNORTH/SOUTH direction, rotating the model.\n\n\nNice to hear from you,\n\n\nVangelis\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-November/004614.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004614", "created_by": "Evangelos_Christakou"}
