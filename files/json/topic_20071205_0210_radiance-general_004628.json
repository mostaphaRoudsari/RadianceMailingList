Anyone can let me know which would be the best way to model it. Some questions I have regarding this are:\n\n\n- Is there any material readily available that I can try to use and validate in my case? As I am not very expert in Radiance materials, this would help me to learn things.\n- Which Radiance material would define a 'prismatic diffuser' well ? \n- Is there any good reference or text to understand well the Trans, Transdata, BRTDFunc etc. etc. diffuser related matters ??\n\n\nAny suggestion would be fine ....\n\n\nThanks,\nSharif\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004628.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004628", "created_by": "Shariful_Shikder"}
