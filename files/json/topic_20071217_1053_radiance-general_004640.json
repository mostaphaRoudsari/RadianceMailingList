Is it possible to do it with RADIANCE\nsomehow? I've been looking into the archive, and I know that some people\nhave been working with blue light as an alternative. However, is it possible\nto go beyond the spectrum towards the ultraviolet by applying some\nmathematical method (for example)? Does anyone have any suggestion?\n\n\nMany thanks in advance!\nAdriana Lira\n\n\n\n\nDr. Adriana Lira-Oliver\nDDes I MDes I Barch\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004640.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004640", "created_by": "Adriana_Lira"}
