I have an HDRShop 2.0 license for \nacademic purposes and I havetried to install it on my new Windows Vista \nmachine. No luck. I get an error message from Microsoft Foundation Class \n... I have tried to contact the USC people behind HDRShop, but so far no \nresponse. Then I thought \"hey, maybe some of the Radiance users know \nsomething ...\"\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-December/004641.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004641", "created_by": "Claus_B._Madsen"}
