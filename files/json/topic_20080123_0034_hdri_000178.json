Who can help me with that topic ?\n\n\nThanks a lot\n\n\nMagali\n\n\n***********************************************************************************************************************************\nMagali Bodart\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher\nUniversit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain\nBelgium\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-January/000178.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000178", "created_by": "Bodart_Magali"}
