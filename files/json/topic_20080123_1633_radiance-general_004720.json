When I render I don't 'see' the lights so I ran objline and objpict to check that the geometry of fixtures are there\nand get the following errors:\n\n\n$ objline Scene_1.rad | x11meta\nfatal - cannot open file \"/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/vchars.mta\", mode \"r\"\n\n\n$ objpict Scene_1.rad | ximage\noconv: system - cannot open scene file \"/usr/local/lib/ray/lib/testroom\": No such file or directory\n\n\n\n\nSO I guess I have a  two part question:\n\n\n1- My setenv variables don't point to the directories  shown above..so why is objline and objpict calling those locations\nand\n2-Could someone clarify the visibility of lighting distributions in  radiance. below is the fixture rad file\n\n\n\n\n#\n_________________________________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-January/004720.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004720", "created_by": "steve_michel"}
