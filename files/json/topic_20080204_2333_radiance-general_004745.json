Daysim will\ntherefore interpret all illuminance sensors as workplane sensors, i.e.\nDaysim assumes that the core workplane extends over all illuminance sensors\nin your lighting zone. (Note: To select a work plane sensor, go to\nANALYSIS>>'SPECIFY WORKPLANE'.) \"\n\n\nin my case i have selected two sensors , one at 2 meters and the other at a\ndepth of 6 meters ,among the 105 sensors. and when i hit the start day\nlighting analysis, daysim is treating all the sensors as work plane in spite\nof specifying them initially . this is   problem is giving me\nincorrect blind setting profile. could any one please suggest me an solution\nto this.\n\n\nthank you,\n\n\nregards,\n\n\n\n\nAditya Potipireddi\nMS Building Design ( Energy & Climate)\nArizona State University\ntel. 480.544.4936\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004745.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004745", "created_by": "aditya_potipireddi"}
