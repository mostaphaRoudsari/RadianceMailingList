It is a fluorescent light.\n\n\nI converted it to radiance format from ies format (previously translated from eulumdat format) using ies2rad with no specific value. Then I calculated illuminance on road surface visualizing isolux scheme.\n\n\nThen I converted the same light with the \"-t white\" option. And calculated illuminance's isolux as before. \n\n\nThe two isolux schemes are different, being value for the white case almost 10 % bigger.\n\n\nShouldn't them be equal?\n\n\nI tried simulating same case in dialux and calculux, and they do report  almost same values as the white case. \n\n\nWhat's wrong? Am I missing some knowledge / trick / anything? \n\n\nLucio\n\n\nPs : I also discovered some problems both in ies2tab and in eulumcnv. The second, badly converting photometry (some dark circles appear in the lighted scene as missing photometric values), the first badly converting geometry (flipping x and y definitions). But I have to check this things a little more.\n\n\n\n\n.. Caminante no hay camino, solo se hace camino al andar ..\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004747.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004747", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti"}
