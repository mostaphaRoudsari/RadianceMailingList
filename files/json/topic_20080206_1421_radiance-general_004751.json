(due to ies2tab and not to ies2rad). But I could be wrong...\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n.Hope this helps.\n.-Greg\n.\n.>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004751.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004751", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti"}
