I tried to solve them (it seemed it was gcc problems) but the only result was that my system became very unstable and finally didn't even boot, so I had to reinstall the system and feel satisfied of binaries.. !\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n.Hi Lucio,\n.\n.The lamp color data also includes depreciation factors, which  \n.probably account for the 10% difference.  I assume the \"white\" value  \n.is larger.\n.\n.A long-standing bug has been recently pointed out by Zack Rogers  \n.related to the orientation of full photometric distributions, and has  \n.been included in the latest HEAD available from radiance-online.org.   \n.A statement has also been added to clarify the assignment of the  \n.width (along y) and length (along x) axes.\n.\n.Hope this helps.\n.-Greg\n.\n.>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004758.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004758", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti"}
