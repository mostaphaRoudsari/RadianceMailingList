I'm sorry.. !! \n\n\nSome time ago, if I didn't just dream it, I run into some explanation on how to monitor rpict progress status. If I remember well, it was achieved with a light kill message to rpict process. In fact when killing it, it returns the rpict progress. It was a way to achieve same information without actually killing it. I thought I found this information in Axel Jacobs' tutorials, but I'm not able to find it any more.\n\n\nCan someone help me ?\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.. Caminante no hay camino, solo se hace camino al andar ..\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004763.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004763", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti"}
