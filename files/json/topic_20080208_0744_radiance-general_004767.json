I'm sorry.. !! \n\n\nSome time ago, if I didn't just dream it, I run into some explanation on how to monitor rpict progress status. If I remember well, it was achieved with a light kill message to rpict process. In fact when killing it, it returns the rpict progress. It was a way to achieve same information without actually killing it. I thought I found this information in Axel Jacobs' tutorials, but I'm not able to find it any more.\n\n\nCan someone help me ?\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..
