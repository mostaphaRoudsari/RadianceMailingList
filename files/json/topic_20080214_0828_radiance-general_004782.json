I just double check to make sure it's meeting the\nLEED criteria of 75% of space meeting 25 fc at noon on June 21 under clear\nsky conditions and it almost never does (I use the standard clear sky in IES\nRadiance for that).\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the standard clear sky and sunny sky models\nwithin IES Radiance? In the rendered image, I never see solar penetration\ninto the space under clear sky conditions, what am I missing?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nRamana Koti, LEED AP\nSustainable Building Analyst\n\n\nELEMENTS division of BNIM architects\n106 W. 14th Street Suite 200\nKansas City, Missouri 64105\n\n\np 816.783.1635 f 816.783.1501\nwww.bnim.com| elements.bnim.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004782.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004782", "created_by": "Ramana_Koti"}
