When I use rtrace in an\nattempt to reproduce the phenomemon, I find 0 for g and b as I'd expect.\n\n\nI'd be grateful if somebody could share her/his insight\n\n\nps - random observations:\n\n\n- I have experimented with program options, but even though the defaults\nof rtrace and rpict differ slightly, they seem to not be able to explain\nrpict's behavior\n\n\n- A colleague at Fraunhofer ISE checked the pic-file and mentioned to\nme that the non-zero contributions are present in the rpict output and\nare not created later by pvalue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefan Schwarzer\nFraunhofer-Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Messtechnik IPM\nOptische Fertigungsmesstechnik\nHeidenhofstr. 8, 79110 Freiburg, Germany\nTelefon: +49-(0)761-8857-366\nstefan.schwarzer at ipm.fraunhofer.de\nhttp://www.ipm.fraunhofer.de\n\n\n\n\nIst Ihr Browser Vista-kompatibel?
