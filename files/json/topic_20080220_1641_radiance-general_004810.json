I am new to UNIX, so the process has been a bit rocky - but - makeall install and makeall library worked out (mostly) fine, and I changed the /etc/profile file to include RAYPATH, and everything seemed to be working fine.  Commands like genprism work and the .oct file built OK.  However, when I went to run rview I get this error:\n\n\nrview: cannot open X-windows; DISPLAY variable set?\nrview: fatal - cannot initialize x11\n\n\nI have tried setting DISPLAY=0 and no effect.  I even went so far as to write this little ditty into  /etc/profile on  the advice of a radiance-general user:\n\n\nif [ -z \"${DISPLAY}\" ];then echo -n\nexport DISPLAY=':0'\nfi\n\n\nalso, no luck.  So, now I am begging the wisdom of more advanced users.\n\n\nany advice?\n\n\nthanks a million\n\n\nDave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004810.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004810", "created_by": "Dave_Bosworth"}
