As part of this project, I am modelling 3 existing internal courtyard spaces, one of which is the Annenberg Court at the National Gallery. This has a single pillow, ETFE rooflight - has anyone ever modelled ETFE on RADIANCE before? If so, please could you let me know how you did it?\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nAmy\n_________________________________________________________________\nTelly addicts unite!\nhttp://www.searchgamesbox.com/tvtown.shtml\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004823.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004823", "created_by": "Amy_Ruffles"}
