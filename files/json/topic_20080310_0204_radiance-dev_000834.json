The OS version was Mac OSX Leopard.\n\n\nI have Tiger here but I see the same problem.\n\n\nI just googled and man-paged a bit and it seems that wish is not started\ncorrectly. If you can call wish directly with trad as argument and it  \nworks\nthat might be your problem, too. Try\n\n\n\twish /usr/local/bin/trad    # or wherever trad is installed\n\n\nThis might be enough on it's own for you. If you want to allow students\nto type simply 'trad' at the command prompt replace the #!/usr/bin/wish\nline in trad with\n\n\n\t#!/bin/sh\n         # the next line restarts using wish \\\n         exec wish \"$0\" \"$@\"\n\n\nThis is straight out of the man page. It starts the GUI but I haven't\nused trad in a long time and I haven't tested if it crashes further down\nthe line.\n\n\nLet your students test it. That's what they're there for.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-March/000834.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000834", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
