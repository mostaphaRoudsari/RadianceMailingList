Sounds like \nyou're running Windows, in which case you might want to check out \nDesktop Radiance, which is a windows version of an older variant of \nRadiance running behind an Autocad GUI.  Francesco Anselmo (a regular on \nthis list) also maintains a set of Windows binaries based on the latest \nversion of Radiance, but unfortunately that one does not include any of \nthe graphical programs that you really need to start learning and using \nRadiance.\n\n\nBe advised, there is no \"radiance.exe\" that you double-click and get a \nsplash screen and a menu.  Radiance is more of a collection of programs \nthat you can string together to get various results.  It's far from \nintuitive, but it is the most capable lighting visualization/simulation \noption out there.  This list's archive is a good place to start getting \na feel for what's possible (and what isn't), and there are some great \n(GREAT) tutorials here:\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/radtutorial_basic.pdf\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/radtutorial_advanced.pdf\n\n\n\n\nSome more links for ya:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/deskrad/\nhttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004839.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004839", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
