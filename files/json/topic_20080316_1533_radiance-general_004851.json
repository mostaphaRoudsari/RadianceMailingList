Thanks for implementing\nthis, Greg!\n\n\nSo here we go:\n\n\nI have the honor to announce a new fisheye view type for Radiance. It\nis called the 'stereographic' or 'planispheric' projection. It is\nparticularly useful for sun path diagrams, as commonly used in\ndaylighting and overshadowing studies. Yes, it's true: no more messin'\nabout with .cal files--it's a native implementation. The option to\nrvu/rpict/trace is -vts.\n\n\nI've put together a little comparison of the three fisheye views:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/projections.pdf\nThis will eventually be merged into the Advanced Tutorial, but I don't\nhave the time for this right now.\n\n\nIf you feel like doing a little exercise with pen and paper (like our\nstudents do), get a sun path diagram from here:\nhttp://luxal.eu/resources/daylighting/sunpath.shtml,\n\n\nand follow Andrew's the instructions on the SquareOne web site:\nhttp://squ1.org/wiki/Sun-Path/Overshadowing\n\n\nGood projections to you all\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004851.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004851", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
