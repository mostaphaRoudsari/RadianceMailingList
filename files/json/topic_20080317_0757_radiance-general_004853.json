I'm a quite new user of Radiance and I'm\ninterested in energy performance of buildings. I would like to know if\nit is possible to calculate the performance of a shading system\n(venetian blinds, light shelf, etc.) in terms of reducing solar\nradiation. Does Radiance consider all the spectrum in calculating\nirradiance? My aim is to try different shading systems in a office\nroom and to analyse their bahaviour in terms of shading coefficient.\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance,\nValeria\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004853.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004853", "created_by": "Valeria_De_Giuli"}
