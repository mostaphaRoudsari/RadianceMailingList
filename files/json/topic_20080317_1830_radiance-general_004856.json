The \"mirror\" type is the one to use, and you can  \naccount for the effect of angle on reflection by including an  \nappropriate brightfunc pattern.  Assuming standard 88% transmittance  \nglass, this would be:\n\n\nvoid glass glass_alt_mat\n0\n0\n3 0.96 0.96 0.96\n\n\nvoid brightfunc glass_angular_effect\n2 A1+(1-A1)*(exp(-5.85*Rdot)-0.00287989916) .\n0\n1 0.08\n\n\nglass_angular_effect mirror glass_mat\n1 glass_alt_mat\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nThe Fresnel approximation for unpolarized light was lifted out of src/ \nrt/normal.c.  To change the reflectance of your glazing, you have to  \nchange both the glass_alt_mat definition and the 0.08 normal  \nreflectance value in glass_angular_effect.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004856.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004856", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
