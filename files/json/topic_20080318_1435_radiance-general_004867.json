Really thank you Greg and Axel !!!\n\n\nThen, I would like to ask a question. \n\n\nI'm in need of representing in Radiance a shiny peinture. And I've no idea on how to measure or where to collect appropriate values for specularity and roughness. \n\n\nDoes exist any library? The libraries I know have only lambertian peintures. \n\n\nHow could those values be calculated? Or, better: how could them be estimated? What I need to do is to choose reasonable values and justify them in my thesis.. Any suggestion?\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.. Caminante no hay\ncamino, solo se hace\ncamino al andar .. \n\n\n\n\n          ---   o\nmeglio   --- \n\n\n.. Caminante el\ndestino no es al\nfinal de el viaje,\npero en todo el\nandar ..\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004867.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004867", "created_by": "Stefano_Ponzetti"}
