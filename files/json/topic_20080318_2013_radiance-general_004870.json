Typically, all fisheye\nprojections are used with a -vh and -vv of 180. The difference is the\nprojection of the hemisphere onto a flat surface. Let me know where\nthe PDF needs some more clarifications.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004870.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004870", "created_by": "Charles_Ehrlich"}
