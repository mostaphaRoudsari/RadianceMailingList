Both ways worked very well (using jitter = 0.7\nor sligthly disslocated suns).\nNow I'm facing a new problem. I want to simulatate a window with a\npattern for sun protection. In the archive I found something like the\nfollowing:\n\n\nvoid plastic-10 pattern_10\n0\n0\n5 .1 . 1 .1 .03 .02\n\n\nvoid mixfunc pattern_round \n4 pattern_10 void result r_hole.cal \n0\n2 .003 .002\n\n\n\n\nThis is the r_hole.cal file:\n\n\n{\n  square holes\n  A1 = length\n  A2 = distance\n\n\n}\n\n\na=A1+A2;\nresult=if(zhole,0,1);\nnext_dotx= a /2-mod(U,a);\nnext_doty= a /2-mod(V,a);\nzhole=if(sq(arg(1)/2)-sq(next_dotx)-sq(next_doty),1,0);\n\n\n\n\npattern_round polygon window_with_pattern\n0\n0\n12\n......\n\n\n\n\nThis functions works properly for vertical and horizontal surfaces. For\ntilted surfaces the pattern is getting smaller all the more you tilt a\nvertical to a horizontal surface. I tried to play around the r_hole.cal\nfile but I was not  able to figure out, what screw I had to rotate.\nHopefully, there is someone out there who can give me a hand.\n\n\nThanks and best regards,\nKai\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-March/004883.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004883", "created_by": "Kai_Babetzki"}
