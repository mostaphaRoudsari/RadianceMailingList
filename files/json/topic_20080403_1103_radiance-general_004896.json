The first issue for me was that many of\nthe exe files were not in the bin directory, but nicely organized under\nsrc (source?) and several sub-directories eg util. I compared the\ndirectories to the ones that were compiled with Francesco Anselmo's\nbinaries for Cygwin (yes, I did that too) and the directories are very\ndifferent. I am now confused as how to set up the PATH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond issue was that the rvu.exe file was not installed at all. I did\ncopy the rvu.exe (into bin) file from Anselmo's Cygwin installation, as\nwell as the bash_profile file where he sets up the different PATHS (into\nCygwin directory). I did of course change the file to my setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks for any help offered - (please)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004896.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004896", "created_by": "Angela_Giladi"}
