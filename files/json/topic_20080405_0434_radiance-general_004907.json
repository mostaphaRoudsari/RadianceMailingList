I had some sort of conversion\nworking but the closest match is achieved by using the RGB values\ndirectly in Radiance (without any of the -> XYZ -> xyY -> etc steps).\n\n\nSo I'm wondering: Do you have to convert the colour triples at\nall to get a visual match in Radiance? And if so, has anyone\nalready written a script for this or can point out a simple\ndocumentation on the process?\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004907.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004907", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
