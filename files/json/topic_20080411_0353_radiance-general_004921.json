My problem has to do with the installation of fluoroscent lamps in\nEcotect. I know it is not a major concern of this list, but i would really\nappreciate any kind of help, because I must finish my diploma thesis soon.\nLet me analyze the problem:\n\n\nI have a building with many offices. Every office has 6 squares on the roof,\nwith 4 fluoroscent lamps in each square. Drawing in Ecotect I have to enter\na first point and a last point.\nThis points represents the last and the first of the lamp or something else?\n\n\n\n\nHow can a fluoroscent have a cut-off angle or a hot-spot since this lamp\nworks in 180 angles?\n\n\nLast but not least: The first and the last point should be on x,y axis\nrepresenting the length of the lamp, or on z axis representing the height of\nthe lamp.\n\n\nThank you in advance for you time.\n\n\nSotiris Papantoniou\nSenior Student\nEnvironmental Engineering Department\nTechnical University of Crete, Greece\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004921.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004921", "created_by": "\u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2_\u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5"}
