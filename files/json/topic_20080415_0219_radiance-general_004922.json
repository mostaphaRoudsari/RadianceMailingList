I cannot use Radiance yet, but I am just\ninterested in the code, if it is possible. I would just like to use Radiance\nto compare how different luminaires render color differently, and how\nvarying surfaces appear differently under those lighting conditions. So you\ncan see I am not interested in the RGB values of the light leaving the\nsource, but rather the RGB values of the surface which we see.\n\n\nThanks,\nNick Calcagni\n\n\nI hope that makes sense...\n\n\nHi\n\n\nIt may be possible to estimate the color temperature from the RGB\nRadiance channels by:\n1) transforming the RGB values into xyz trilinear coordinates\n\n\n2) using an approximate formula relating xyz to color temperature.\nSee for instance this paper:\nMcCamy, Calvin S. (April 1992). \"Correlated color temperature as an\nexplicit function of chromaticity coordinates\".
