I know \nit's possible, but I'm having trouble.  I finally have MINGW and MSYS \ninstalled on my computer and gcc as well.  That all works, I can get a \nrunning bash shell on my computer.  Problem is the makeall script is a \ncsh script (MSYS, short for Minimal SYStem, is indeed a minimal cygwin \ninstallation). \n\n\nPlan B was simply to go into the /src/util directory and call \"make \nrsensor\".  But even after changing the rmakefile to read CC = gcc from C \n= cc, I still get an error saying cc not found.  Not sure why it's still \ntrying to use cc instead of gcc; gcc is installed and in the search path. \n\n\nSo plan C was simply to call gcc directly but the Rmake file references \na .o file and I only have your rsensor.c file.  So I'm missing one or \nmore steps that apparently happen ahead of this Rmakefile.  Can anyone \nhelp or suggest a way to get this utility to compile?(???????????)\n\n\n*rsensor is a utility that Architectural Energy Corp. contracted Greg to \ncreate.  It's essentially a modified version of rtrace, to be used to \nread the spatial sensitivity of a photosensor, which Zack is \nincorporating in to his SPOT program (hence my need to get this to \ncompile for Windows). It's still in test phase, but it's in the HEAD \nrelease in the spirit of open source.\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-April/000841.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000841", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
