In a scene with some \nthousand sources, it takes three hours until rpict writes the first \npixels (same is true for rtrace) - than it is going on fine. Is there \nanything I could do to speed up this phase of the rendering?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004928.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004928", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
