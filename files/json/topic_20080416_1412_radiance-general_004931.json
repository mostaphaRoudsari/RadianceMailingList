I have \nexperienced those a lot when using this kind of \"optimization\", which \nled me to many many restarts of interrupted renderings, and solved the \nproblem using a new compile with more standard-friendly parameters.\n\n\nJust a hint... CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004931.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004931", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
