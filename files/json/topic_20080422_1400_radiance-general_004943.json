So for your amusement and in the hope someone \nenjoys to show me the worst of my misunderstandings, I post how I try to \nmodel a light source, which is to represent an oil lamp.\n\n\nI estimate a flame with 2cm diameter, 10 lumen,1900 K black body \ntemperature.\n\n\nI derive rgb 1.00 0.23 0.00 from the color temperature. This is only for \nthe chromacity, and to be honest I did not do the CIE transformations \nbut looked up in a table for 1900K.\n\n\nI add a line to lamp.tab reading\n\n\n/oil lamp/\t.54 .41 .95\n\n\nso that I can use lampcolor and reuse my guesses later.\n\n\nNo I run lampcolor, for the lamp type I enter my freshly defined oild \nlamp, I use meters as length unit, to model the flame I use a sphere \ngeometry, and I give my estimated 0.01m radius for the flame (resulting \nin a luminaire sphere of 2cm diameter). My guessed total luminous flux \nis 10 lumens, leading to:\n\n\nLamp color (RGB) 28.93 8.62 0.0\n\n\nDoes this make sense? Am I totally wrong? I would apply a light modifier \ncreated with these values to a 1cm radius sphere now.\n\n\nThanks, CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004943.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004943", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
