When I ran it, the system responded:\n\n\n  bash: ./makeall: /bin/csh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\n\n  I then searched for any csh files and found two files under a folder called 'etc'.  These files are:\n\n\n  etc/csh.login\n  etc/csh.cshrc\n\n\n  Are they the files that \"makeall\" was looking for?   If so, how can I make it work?\n\n\n  Thanks a lot for your help!\n\n\n  Cheers, \n  Kam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile.
