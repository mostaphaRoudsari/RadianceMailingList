Tom Muertens of CSAIL at MIT has been kind enough to  \npermit the distribution of his 3-D scanned models, shown here:\n\n\n\thttp://people.csail.mit.edu/tmertens/textransfer/data/\n\n\nI have converted some (not all) of these into Radiance triangle  \nmeshes, which I made available on radsite and announced by in  \nDecember 2006:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006- \nDecember/004134.html\n\n\nThe thing is, they take up quite a bit of space (about 41 MBytes),  \nand I am debating whether or not to include them in the standard  \n\"supplemental\" materials tarball.  The last tarball was about 14  \nMBytes, but with the CSAIL models included, the size goes up to 53  \nMBytes.  Since this data is available separately, we could simply  \nsuggest those who are interested to pick up the other one if they  \nwant it.  On the other hand, most users just grab stuff and look  \nthrough it later (if ever), in which case having the data when you  \nneed a nice object to insert into your interior for some flair will  \nbe a bonus.\n\n\nSo, I'm asking for opinions.  If you feel strongly one way or the  \nother, and can state your preference politely so as not to start a  \nflame war, please respond.  If no one speaks up, I'll probably just  \nend up including the data, since it's less work for me.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-April/004966.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004966", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
