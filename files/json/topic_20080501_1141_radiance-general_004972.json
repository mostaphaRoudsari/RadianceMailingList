I only heard one \"nay\" vote about including the CSAIL library  \nobjects, but all the same I made a smaller distribution available for  \nlike-minded disk curmudgeons.  The download from the original LBNL site:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html\n\n\nby default is missing the CSAIL objects.  These can easily be added  \nvia the \"objects\" link lower on the same page.  On the other site,  \nradiance-online includes the CSAIL objects in its distribution files:\n\n\n\thttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/\n\n\nBoth sites link to compiled binaries for Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,  \nand MINGW (thanks to Francesco Anselmo and James Lee).  I need to  \nwork with Peter Apian-Bennewitz to update the scripts so the patches  \nbeing provided are relative to the new release, since he's the  \nmastermind for those.\n\n\nPlease inform me of any broken links, compile problems, or masspillings.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/004972.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_004972", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
