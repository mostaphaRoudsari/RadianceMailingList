If anybody else would\nbe interested in git access, I'd setup the repository, if not, I'll just\npull the patch when I need it.\n(As I don't have direct access to the CVS I'd just pull the patch every\nnight and apply it, being able to use git-cvs would be better, of course).\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\nP.S. Radiance 3R9 will be shipped with Debian Lenny, I'm almost done\nwith it and the upload should happen this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-May/000869.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000869", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz"}
