It \nis a simple tool to visualize Radiance images on Windows and Linux. It \nallows to view images, luminance and illuminance values, correct \nexposition, etc.\n\n\nIt also allows to make false color images and to adjust the color scale \nrather easily.\n\n\nIt is mainly written in Python. It uses a few Radiance programs from \nGreg's original distribution on Linux and Francesco's binaries on Windows.\n\n\nIt is released under GPL license so feel free to use it. We'd like very \nmuch to have your feedback at raddisplay at deluminaelab.com\n\n\nIt is available at http://www.deluminaelab.com/en/tools.html\n\n\nWe hope you'll like it.\n\n\nJeanDo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005001.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005001", "created_by": "jeando"}
