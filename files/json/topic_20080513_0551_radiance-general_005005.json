The first step is to calculate the LT-value correctly without external shading. I failed on that :)\n\n\nI followed the steps described in the \"Basic Radiance Tutorial\" by Axel Jakobs. Here is the data i used.\n\n\nCoordinates in IllumKoordinater.pts\n\n\n6.216 0.00 1.8 0 -1 0 (window)\n6.216 0.05 1.8 0 -1 0 (black wall located 0.05 m behind the window - in fact all walls are black)\n\n\nThe Window (LT=0,72):\nvoid glass window_glass\n0\n0\n3 .78 .78 .78\n\n\ncat IllumKoordinater.pts | rtrace -I -ab 4 -h -w -oov kontor.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$2;$2=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)' > lux.dat\n\n\nOutput\n-1       4883.69\n-0.95  3049.70\n\n\nTwo things worth noticing here. The output coordinates are not listed correctly which gives me the suspicion that lux-values are is not calculated for the correct coordinates. Furthermore the ratio between the output are not according to the entered LT-value for the window (0,62 vs. 0,72)\n\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of what can be wrong here?\n\n\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nPer Hauagaard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________\n\n\nPer Haugaard,\nGriffenfeldsgade 33, 2.tv\n2200 K\u00f8benhavn N\nDenmark\n\n\nmobil:  +45 26 39 06 40\nE-mail: perhaugaard at yahoo.dk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tr\u00e6nger du til at se det store billede?
