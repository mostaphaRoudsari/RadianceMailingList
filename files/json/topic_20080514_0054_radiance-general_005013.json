But it still troubles me why I cannot get the correct ratio between the output and the entered LT-value for the window. Please refer to the below.\n\n\n  > 6.216 0.00 1.8 0 -1 0 (window)\n  > 6.216 0.05 1.8 0 -1 0 (black wall located 0.05 m behind the window  \n  > - in fact all walls are black)\n  > \n  > The Window (LT=0.72):\n  > void glass window_glass\n  > 0\n  > 0\n  > 3 .78 .78 .78\n  > \n  > cat IllumKoordinater.pts | rtrace -I -ab 4 -h -w -oov kontor.oct |  \n  > rcalc -e '$1=$2;$2=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)' > lux.dat\n  > \n  > Output\n  > -1       4883.69\n  > -0.95  3049.70\n\n\n  > If I understand the above correctly you are calculating two points:\n > one in front of the window, one behind it.

I am interested in, later on, to calculate the transmitted light through the window with external shading based on a CIE-standard overcast sky.\n\n\n > Two improvements:\n\n\n > 1) Move the wall further back or place your second point at ie. 0.04. If\n > the calculation point coincides with the wall everything is possible.\n\n\n\n\n  When I calculate the transmitted light at any other point in the room e.g. 0.04 (away from the black wall) the calculation coincides with the window (LT=1). \n\n\n > 2) Don't use a box at all.

I appreciate any help on solving why the ratio between the output and the entered LT-value for the window (0,62 vs. 0,72) differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\n\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________\n\n\nPer Haugaard,\nGriffenfeldsgade 33, 2.tv\n2200 K\u00f8benhavn N\nDenmark\n\n\nmobil:  +45 26 39 06 40\nE-mail: perhaugaard at yahoo.dk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tr\u00e6nger du til at se det store billede?
