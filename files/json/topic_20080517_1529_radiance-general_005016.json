Does any of you have an example \navailable of  a picture mapped on a polygon using texture coordinates?\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005016.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005016", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
