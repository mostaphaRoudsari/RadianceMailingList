{"topic": "a bug with rtcontrib?", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Pavlina Akritas", "created_at": "May 22, 2008 at 02:26AM", "body": "Hello everyone,\n\n\nI am trying to run 'rtcontrib' with the latest Radiance version to\ncompute the illuminance contributions according to a Tregenza sky. \n\n\nThe code that I am using looks like this:\n\n\nrtcontrib -w- -h- -I+ -ad 1000 -as 500 -ab 1 -V -b tbin -o\nresults/sky/%s$i.data -m skyglow -b 0 -o results/ground/%s$i.data -m\ngroundglow -f tregenza.cal model.oct < grid/grid.grd\n\n\nThe code works fine when the grid used points up (+z). However, I would\nlike to find the illuminance on a wall grid, thus the grid points must\npoint in either +y, -y, +x or -x. When I run 'rtcontrib' in this case\nthe number of columns varies between 438 and 435 (since rtcontrib\noutputs r g b values). Thus, 'rtcontrib' seems to be skipping a patch\nevery now and then. I have tried also to increasing the settings but the\nsame problem occured.  \n\n\nIs it possible to resolve this problem somehow so that the number of\ncolumns is consistent all the time (i.e. 438 including the ground)? If\nyes, how?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nPavlina Akritas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005032.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005032", "created_by": "Pavlina_Akritas"}
