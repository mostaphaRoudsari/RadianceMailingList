But I was referring to the IES files from lighting\nmanufacturers as Greg said. Sorry for not being clear... ies2rad seems to be\nexactly what I'm looking for.\n\n\nShould the following be a new topic?\n\n\nFor something like the following (which is part of a converted IES file, I\nthink). But regardless, \"glow\" requires you to specify \"red\" \"green\" and\n\"blue\" values. In the following they are equal: 9477... for each.\n\n\nlamp_glow glow lamp\n0\n0\n4 9477.696528 9477.697093 9477.697093    0\nSo what units are these values in? This ratio of R to G to B shows up in\nother parameters too (light, illum). Is there a max value to these RGB\nvalues or for their total? That's one basic thing I've always been confused\nabout.\nThank you,\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005034.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005034", "created_by": "Nick_Calcagni"}
