When I try to convert the \nrendering I get the obvious \"errror reading Radiance picture\" error. \nDoes anybody has a workaround for this situation? In other words, is \nthere any way to convert an unfinished rendering?\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005039.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005039", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
