IIRC that was a  \nmaterial\nthat was visible but did not influence the lighting calculations. If  \nthis is true\nyou can create a cylinder around your scene without compromising the sky\ndistribution.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005054.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005054", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
