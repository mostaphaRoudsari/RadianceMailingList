To solve the clipping I was thinking \nto use normtiff  or pcond in combination with a Photoshop ICC profile \n(.icm files), which I a received from the printer operator. Regretably I \ndon't understand the meaning of the parameters of normtiff and pcond \nenough, not even enough to get started . Does anybody have an idea if \nand how the data from ICC profiles can be used by normtiff?\nThe lines below are copy/paste from an .icm file, and i wonder if these \ncan be of any use in tonemapping. Are the the tabular organized XYZ_X   \nXYZ_Y   XYZ_Z valuable for this kind of application?\n\n\nAny hints are very much appreciated,\n\n\nIebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATED    \"1/12/2007\"  # Time: 16:17\nINSTRUMENTATION    \"SpectroScan\"\nMEASUREMENT_SOURCE    \"Illumination=D50    ObserverAngle=2\u00a1    \nWhiteBase=Abs    Filter=Unknown\"\nKEYWORD    \"SampleID\"\nKEYWORD    \"SAMPLE_NAME\"\nNUMBER_OF_FIELDS    8\nBEGIN_DATA_FORMAT\nSampleID    SAMPLE_NAME    XYZ_X    XYZ_Y    XYZ_Z    LAB_L    LAB_A    \nLAB_B\nEND_DATA_FORMAT\nNUMBER_OF_SETS    918\nBEGIN_DATA\n1    A1    2.48    2.52    1.96    18.00    1.10    1.12\n2    A2    3.04    3.14    2.53    20.61    0.15    0.53\n3    A3    3.64    4.17    3.21    24.23    -5.73    1.61\n4    A4    4.11    5.21    3.74    27.32    -12.11    3.35\n5    A5    4.73    6.79    4.55    31.32    -20.99    5.45\n6    A6    5.26    8.53    5.03    35.06    -30.46    9.31\netc...\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005058.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005058", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
