This is\nfine, as long as images are small - just redirect to a file, and the\nvalues can be read according to the coordinates written at the beginning\nof the lines.\n\n\nNow, for large images, this becomes a pain. E.g. if I want to get the\nvalues of 64pixels, with known coordinates, I cannot read out these with\npvalue, but first must transform the complete image to a pvalue\nformatted text file. These files can become hundreds of MB in size with\nhigher resolutions.\n\n\nIs there an easier and more efficient way to go? E.g. cropping the image\nfirst to the pixels wanted? I guess the only way to do so is pcomb,\nright?\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005059.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005059", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
