How would I go about modeling an upside-down bowl? (Or\nan upper hemisphere, or a rounded lampshade, whatever helps you picture it\nbest). It seems like \"genrev\" would be the way to do this, but I don't quite\nunderstand what z(t) and r(t) do. If the input for a 2 foot wide hemisphere\n(surface normals inward) isn't too complicated, perhaps someone could paste\nit here and I could backwards-determine what the functions represent.\n\n\nHere's another question: can we simply make a \"bubble\" and cut it in half?\n(discarding half of it, of course)\n\n\nThanks!\nNick Calcagni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005072.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005072", "created_by": "Nick_Calcagni"}
