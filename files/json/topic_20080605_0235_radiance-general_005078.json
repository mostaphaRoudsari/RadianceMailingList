What I am \ntrying to do is to gauge the range of numbers one can get and the \ndifferences in different part of the building so I have a basis to speak \nto the engineer.\n\n\nTo do this I generate my Radiance model with only one material to start \nwith with 50% reflectance. I generate a 1/2 hour series of renderings \n(with -i switch on).\nAfterwards I add up the irradiances with pcomb to get one picture from \nwhich to get the falsecolor scale in kWh / m2.\n\n\nI'm using falsecolor with -m = 0.001 to get the output in kWh / m2 to \nget daily cumulative irradiances. Is this approach correct?\n\n\nI'm doing this because RADMAP for windows fails to work (even the \nexample files that come with it) so I wanted to play around with \nradiance and learn something on the way.\n\n\n\n\nI guess my next step is to feed real irradiance data into radiance and \nfoloow the procedure outlined before, Am I in the proper direction?\n\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\n\nIv\u00e1n Pajares\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005078.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005078", "created_by": "Iv\u00e1n_Pajares_S\u00e1nchez"}
