Therefore the macros MADV_SEQUENTIAL and MADV_NORMAL are\nnot replaced by correct values by the preprocessor simply because no\ndefinitions of the macros exist in the included header file.\n\n\nAs it can be seen this leads to a situation where the target 'install'\nis not remade completely by Make leading to all sorts of strange\nfaults if the already built binaries are attempted used.\n\n\nI have no suggestions for a resolution to the fault at the moment\nsince I have never developed anything for Cygwin and therefore I have\nno knowledge about the internals of Cygwin. I have however been able\nto identify a file in the cygwin tree where a definition of an\nenumeration containing the needed macros are given. I don't know if\nthis is useful in any way.\n\n\nI have been unable to locate a bug reporting system on your homepage\nwhy I am writing this list instead. I hope this is all right.\n\n\nBest regards\nEsben Rugbjerg\nM.Sc. in engineering (software)\n\n\n\n\ncand.polyt\nEsben Rugbjerg\nGuldborgvej 44, 3.th.\n2000 Frederiksberg\nDanmark\nemail: esbenrugbjerg at gmail.com\nmobil-tlf.: +45 28715166\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000870.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000870", "created_by": "Esben_Rugbjerg"}
