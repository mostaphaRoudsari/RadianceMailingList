To do so, I would like\nto know what the six values per line are. I guess with that info, I\nshould be able to plot a run using Paul E. Debevec's and Jitendra\nMalik's algorithm as published.\n\n\nI guess that the lines correspond to the sensor's channels, but\neverything else is unknown to me right now...\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-June/000187.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000187", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
