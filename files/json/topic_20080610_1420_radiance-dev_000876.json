The CP4R is still purely experimental. I've\nnot had enough feedback to release it to the big wide world. I have\nactually been breeding over a rather serious question which might\npotentially question the whole idea behind it. But do read on...\n\n\nLet's just say that somebody has gone through the exercise of\nmeasuring all RAL colours with a chroma meter, based on a set of\ncolour swatches. The readings are presented in XYZ format. Let's\nfurther assume, just for the sake of the argument, that this somebody\nhas written a little script to convert those XYZ readings to RGB,\nusing Radiance's xyz_rgb.cal. Here is an example:\n\n\n-- this guy's ---\n#Radiance rgb values for RAL colors converted from X Y Z color coordinates\n#X Y Z values measured with Minolta CM-2600D Illuminant D65 observer 10 degree\n# RAL 8023  orangebraun\n# X=18.9 Y=14.6 Z=3.2\n# reflectance 0.1460\n void plastic RAL8023\n 0\n 0\n 5  0.3017 0.0971 0.0150 0 0\n\n\n-- from Radiance colour picker (data from the Internet, don't remember\nwhere from) --\n# RAL colour: 8023 Orange brown\n# Reflectance: rho=0.476\nvoid plastic identifier\n0\n0\n5  0.676 0.426 0.176  0 0\n\n\n-- from Radiance colour picker (converted from XYZ data) --\n# Imported from XYZ: ( 18.9, 14.6, 3.2 )\n# Reflectance: rho=0.404\nvoid plastic identifier\n0\n0\n5  0.644 0.335 0.126  0 0\n\n\nChecked against this web site:\nhttp://easyrgb.com/index.php?X=CALC\nwhich gives pretty much the same results: (0.64380, 0.33552, 0.12613)\nAlso compare:\nhttp://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_XYZ_to_RGB.html\n\n\nYour will appreciate that the measured values, converted to RGB are\nwayyyyyy off mark.\n\n\nI understand from this thread:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n8_1b.html\nthat the conversion algo is taken from:\n\"Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics\" by David Rodgers (McGraw Hill),\nwhich is sitting right next to me.\n\n\nI have not gone through it yet to check for typos in yxz_rgb.cal, but\nI find it unlikely that Greg has made such a mistake. It's far more\nlikely that I'm missing something here. One possible explanation would\nbe the primaries: xyz_rgb.cal uses the standard CRT primaries, whereas\nit's unclear as to what the others are assuming.\n\n\nAny enlightenment on the issue would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks for your feedback on this issue\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-June/000876.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000876", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
