I have looked up the archive posts for\nhelp but need a little bit more guidance on the modeling of the glazing. I\nam modeling the white translucent glazing with about 50% transmittance using\nthe following parameters:\n\n\nvoid trans translucent panel\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 0.5 0.2\n\n\nI would like to know if I am correct in my assumptions. \n\n\nThe second issue which I have not been able to figure out is how to show\nthis trans material inside the space in the final rendering in Radiance as\nit is essentially invisible.\n\n\nAny help on this will be appreciated.\n\n\nRegards,\nNik\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005112.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005112", "created_by": "Nikhil_Kapur"}
