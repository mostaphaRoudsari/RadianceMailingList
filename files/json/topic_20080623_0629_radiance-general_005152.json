But in my case, the transition between the  \ndielectric and the print color is different to the transition from  \ndielectric to vacuum. And since I'll have the printed stripes on  \ndifferent layers, the difference is significant.\n\n\nMy purpose is to simulate with Radiance a laminated glass with fritted\nstripes on the surface in-between the two laminated glass sheets. I  \nwant to check the view to the outside and the transmission of such  \nfritted glass.\n\n\nI already modeled the stripe as a plastic surface with a very small gap\nbetween the two panes of glass. But I obtained wrong result because of  \nthe air gap between the stripe and the dielectric (glass) panes.\n\n\nAny idea how to model this correctly?\n\n\nWhat happens, if the dielectric is not completely \"boxed\", but parts  \nof the \"box\" replaced by plastic material?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Frontini\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-June/005152.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005152", "created_by": "Francesco_Frontini"}
