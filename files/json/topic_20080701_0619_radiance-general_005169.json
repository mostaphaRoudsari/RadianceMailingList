I've used Radmap\nbefore, to get estimations on PV array feasibility. However, I was\nrecently asked about the feasibility of landscaping in a dense urban\nenvironment. After a lot of searching, I could not find what I had hoped\nto find - a categorical list of what grows given a quantity of light, in\nterms of light energy, light power*time, illuminance*time, or something\nalong those lines. I'm left with finding spaces with similar geometry\nand determining what is growing and what is not. The only reference I\ncould find with respect to Radiance was from 1995, with Greg suggesting\nthat replacing the RGB channels with some quantities that were better\nsuited to the response of plants. I know it's a stretch to hope that\nthere are any horticulturists on the list, but has anybody else come\nacross information or situations involving photosynthetically active\nradiation? Any insight is appreciated.\n\n\nAlso, I use Linux on a VirtualPC (Microsoft freeware) in Windows\n(Intel). It's sort of like VMWare where a computer is virtualized and\nsimulated in a \"sandbox\". It's a clumsy and resource hogging amalgam,\nbut does let you play around with some of the more fun features of the\n*nix versions without a whole lot of hardware and setup hassle. cat\n/proc/cpuinfo gives the specs of the main processor, so I wonder what\nhappens when you run it on a VirtualPC/AMD combination...\n\n\n--Dave Smith\n\n\n\n\nThis message has been scanned by MailController - www.MailController.altohiway.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005169.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005169", "created_by": "David_Smith"}
