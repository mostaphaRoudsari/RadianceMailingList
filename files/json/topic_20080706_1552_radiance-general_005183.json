I've only used Windows before, and I have no\nprogramming background so I'm sure I'm just looking at this the wrong way.\nThat aside...\n\n\nI downloaded and extracted \"rad3R9_linux.tar.gz\" to the folder\n\"rad3R9_linux\" to my desktop. I'm using the Ubuntu GUI called Gnome (I\nthink). I just installed the Ubuntu LTS Desktop Edition version 8.04.\n\n\nInside the rad3R9 folder seems to be no installation file (again, I'm\nthinking like a Windows user). I understand there should be some time of\ncommand line for Ubuntu... can someone get me started with a few steps or\npoint me to a link that might have some step-by-step instructions for the\nUbuntu/Radiance novice?\n\n\nThank you,\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005183.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005183", "created_by": "Nick_Calcagni"}
