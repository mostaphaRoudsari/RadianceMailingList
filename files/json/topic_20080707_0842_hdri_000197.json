In certain circles, especially on the Flickr website,\nfolks are using tone reproduction operators not only for dynamic\nrange reduction, but also to achieve a certain 'look'. The problem\nI have with this, is that there is now a seemingly large community\nthat equates HDR with that specific look. This is wrong.\n\n\nIn an attempt to explain what is going on here, I have developed\na micro-site with some comparisons. It is strictly informal, and\ngives my personal take on where the photography community appears\nto have gone wrong. It is located here:\n\n\n   http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~reinhard/tm_comp/\n\n\nMy aim was to write it such that it will be easy to understand for\na non-technical audience.\n\n\nI hope that this will be useful to some.\n\n\nCheers,\nErik\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-July/000197.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000197", "created_by": "E._Reinhard"}
