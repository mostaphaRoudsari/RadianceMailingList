(However I tried all of them).\n\n\nBasically, after typing in \"sudo apt-get install radiance\" what do I type\nnext in order to open Radiance? (so I can start inputting the scenes from\nthe \"Rendering With Radiance\"\n tutorial).\n\n\nThanks,\nNick\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 7, 2008 at 3:00 PM, <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005185.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005185", "created_by": "Nick_Calcagni"}
