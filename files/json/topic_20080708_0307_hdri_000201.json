When I start the camera the EOS Utility Programm starts and sees the camera, so I think there is a connection.\n\n\nThe README.txt says : ... Be shure to set it in the \"PC cponnect\" mode ... I am sorry, but I have no idea how to handle that.\n\n\nThank you very much for any ideas\nMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-July/000201.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000201", "created_by": "Martin_Klingler"}
