But I also did get a chuckle from the\n\"double click the Radiance icon\" comment from Rob G. :)\n\n\nSo I think I successfully installed Radiance, because the tools seem to be\nresponding, however I can't get very far into the tutorial\n\n\n<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/tutorial.html>\n\n\nI created a text file with the exact parameters from the tutorial, but named\nroom2.rad (room.rad I messed up by opening it twice and editing while it was\nstill open elsewhere)\n\n\nThis is what I typed, and received from within Terminal:\n\n\nnick at nick-desktop:~$ oconv room2.rad > test2.oct\nnick at nick-desktop:~$ getinfo test2.oct\ntest2.oct:\n    #?RADIANCE\n    oconv room2.rad\n    FORMAT=Radiance_octree\n\n\nnick at nick-desktop:~$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5\ntest2.oct\nVIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan 31 2008 11:53:56)\nUnknown option argument: \"-.125\"\nMore info with: \"vim -h\"\nnick at nick-desktop:~$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -av .5 .5 .5\ntest2.oct\nVIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan 31 2008 11:53:56)\nUnknown option argument: \"-av\"\nMore info with: \"vim -h\"\nnick at nick-desktop:~$\n\n\nIt seems as though when I use rview, the 8th parameter (-.125 the first time\nI tried it, then for experiment's sake I took -.125 out, and then it said\n\"-av\" was unknown) produces an error.\n\n\nAt your suggestion, I tried \"rpict\" with the same parameters as the \"rview\"\nabove from the tutorial, and Terminal spits back hundreds of lines of\nunrecognizable characters to me.
