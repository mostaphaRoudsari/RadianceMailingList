I find calculated\nilluminances of 6 days is basically close to the measured data. But1 day is\nexceptional, there is a big difference between calculated illuminances and\nmeaured ones. That1 day is a very clear sky because that day has a highest\ndirect and diffuse radiation of those 7days, but the measured illuminance is\nmuch lower than other six days. Anybody can tell why? and how to modifiy?\n\n\nThank you for your time.\nZZ\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005212.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005212", "created_by": "ZZ"}
