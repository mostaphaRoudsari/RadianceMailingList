Details: see README file of the package.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nYou can download the actual code (small changes included, that it \ncompiles under linux and cygwin) including the revised  README  at:\n\n\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance\n\n\nFor the evalglare users: Also a new version of evalglare is available at \nthe same location. If you are using a version older than 0.6 you should \nupdate, some errors were fixed.\n\n\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDipl.-Ing.
