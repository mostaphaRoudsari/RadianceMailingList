The re-write was carried out by my colleague Denis Fan.\nCanonHDRcap is now supported under the Canon EDSDK version 2.4, and  \nhas been compiled under Mac OS X version 10.5.4 as an universal  \nbinary, backwards compatible up to Mac OS X version 10.4.x. Some  \nmodification of the CanonHDRcap are described as follows:\n(a) The aperture size by default is set to 4 when it executes;\n(b) LDR images are downloaded after the sequence of captures, rather  \nthan during the sequence;\n(c) The ability of downloading both jpeg and raw data from the camera  \nafter the sequence of captures. If you use this option, by default  \ncanoncap would only execute hdrgen to generate the HDR image using the  \njpeg sequences.\nOtherwise, the operation is as described in the original notes  \n(included in the package).\nDownload it from here:\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/resources.html\n-John\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-July/000203.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000203", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
