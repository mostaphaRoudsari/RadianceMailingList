Just run 4 processes in the background?\nHow does an ambient file works using rpiece? Do I just need one, or as many as there are \"pieces\"?\nWhere are temporary files stored, so I can check their progress?\n\n\n-Iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005244.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005244", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
