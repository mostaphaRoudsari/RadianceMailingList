Section 5.1.9 (p304-307) of the Radiance book shows how it  \ncan be done.  Is this method still used, and if so could you post/ \nemail the scripts spct2xyz.csh and xyz2rgb.csh?\n\n\nAny tips/pointers not already covered in Section 5.1.9 would be much  \nappreciated.  We'll be using a Konica/Minolta CM-2600d portable  \nspectrophotometer.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nSenior Research Fellow\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005250.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005250", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
