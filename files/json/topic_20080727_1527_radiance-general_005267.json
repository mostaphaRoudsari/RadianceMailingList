Seen from the \nrendering viewpoint the polygons in the model overlap quite a lot, so one \nray might have to \"look\" through about 50 \"transparant\" polygons or even \nmore before actually \"see\" something. I think this is why this particular \nmodel renders amazingly slow, even with -ab set to 0, -st 0 and -lr 1. Is \nthere another parameter in control that might speed up the rendering in such \ncase?\n\n\n-Iebele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid plastic material_17999\n0 0 5\n0.757813 0.773438 0.753906\n0.01 0.01\n\n\nmaterial_17999 colorpict colormap_17999\n7 noneg noneg noneg ./D2P_0595.pic tmesh.cal u v\n0\n7\n2\n   -0.01410693     0.02148561   -19.61004639\n   -0.00179046    -0.00117557     3.75267568\n\n\nvoid mixpict transmap_17999\n7 colormap_17999 void green\n./a_D2P_0595.pic tmesh.cal u v\n0\n7\n2\n   -0.01410693     0.02148561   -19.61004639\n   -0.00179046    -0.00117557     3.75267568\n\n\ntransmap_17999 polygon polygon_17999\n0 0 9\n634.194214 1375.645264 90.465210\n655.547729 1343.122681 90.465210\n1045.819336 1599.365479 90.465210\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005267.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005267", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
