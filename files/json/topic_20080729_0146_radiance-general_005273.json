It may be interesting in Radiance world, so that is why I \npost the link here. A lot is about animation-related issues, but there \nare some more general topics of 3d models covered.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-July/005273.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005273", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
