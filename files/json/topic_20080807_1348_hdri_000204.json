I am aware of Brightside, which was acquired by Dolby.  I\nhave tried getting in touch with Dolby, but their response was that they\nare not manufacturing displays for sale, only licensing the technology\nto display manufacturers.  It does not seem that any manufacturers have\nproduced one for market yet though.  Any help on locating one would be\nappreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________\nMatt Franks, PE, LEED AP\nSenior Lighting Consultant \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArup Lighting\n155 Avenue of the Americas New York NY 10013\ntel: 1 212 896 3127\nfax: 1 212 229 1056\nmatt.franks at arup.com <blocked::mailto:matt.franks at arup.com> \nwww.arup.com/lighting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-August/000204.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000204", "created_by": "Matt_Franks"}
