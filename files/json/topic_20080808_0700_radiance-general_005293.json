So\nrpiece can take rpict arguments, and -PP is an rpict argument telling\nit to fork as necessary, is it a good idea to pass that along to\nrpiece?\n\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried running enough rpiece -PP commands for each\nprocessor and wound up with a bunch of rpieces running but only one of\nthose had rpicts that were actually doing anything. Additionally, I\nthink rpict thought it as doing a sequence of frames. The images\nappear to be rendering, but is this the proper method? Are rpict -PP\nand rpiece mutually exclusive on platforms that support both?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n--Dave\n\n\n\n\nP.S. - Here's the process tree from htop:\n\n\n`[...two more rpiece's like the first two below]\n|\n|\n|\n`- rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @arguments\n|   `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n|       `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @arguments\n|   `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n|       `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n`- rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @arguments\n    `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n        `- rpict -S 1 -PP pp -w -i [...]\n            `- rpict -PP pp -w -i [...]\n                `- rpict -PP pp -w -i [...]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005293.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005293", "created_by": "David_Smith"}
