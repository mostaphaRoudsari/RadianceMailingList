I suppose if the solid has uniformly oriented \nnormals then the glass geometry could use a dielectric material, but I \nam not sure how negatively this might impact simulation time.\n\n\nAny Revit users out there, thoughts on modifying a window \"family\" to do \nthis?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\n# Jack de Valpine\n# president\n#\n# visarc incorporated\n# http://www.visarc.com\n#\n# channeling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005295.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005295", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
