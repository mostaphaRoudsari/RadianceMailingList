So far, we have titles  \nfrom a handful of presenters, and abstracts from just a few.  It  \nseems to happen this way every year, but the sooner we get these  \nmaterials, the better everyone's experience will be.  So, if at all  \npossible, please send a complete abstract via e-mail to Rapha\u00ebl  \nCompagnon <Raphael.Compagnon at hefr.ch> and myself  \n<gregoryjward at gmail.com> by this Friday, August 15th.\n\n\nThank you.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005304.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005304", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
