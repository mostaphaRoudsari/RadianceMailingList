I'll have to upload\na fix soon for Lenny, otherwise the package will be removed.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-August/000890.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000890", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz"}
