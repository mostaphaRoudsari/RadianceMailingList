I would\nlike to confirm if the maximum value for specularity is 1.0 (or maybe more?)\nand if the maximum value for roughness is 0.5 (although I have found in some\nweb links that roughness values greater than 0.2 are not realistic)\n\n\n2) I need to create 2 metallic materials.\n\n\n     a)   The product data for the first metal is the following:\n\n\n    -  Minimum % Total Reflectivity:    95\n    -  Image Clarity:                           95\n    -  % Diffuse Reflection:                 <12\n    -  Specular reflictivity%:                  90\n\n\nI'm assuming that this material can best described as follows:\n\n\nvoid metal metal_1\n0\n0\n5  .95  .95  .95  .90 .10\n\n\n     b)   The product data for the second metal is the following:\n\n\n    -  Total Reflection %:                    94\n    -  Total Reflection:                        94\n    -  % Diffuse Reflection:                 80-90\n    -  Specular reflictivity%:                  90\n\n\nI'm assuming that this material can best described as follows:\n\n\nvoid metal metal_2\n0\n0\n5  .94  .94  .94  .90 .85\n\n\n\n\nCould someone confirm if I'm on the right track?\n\n\nThank you so much in advance!\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nAdriana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Adriana Lira-Oliver\nDDes I MDes I Barch\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005312.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005312", "created_by": "Adriana_Lira"}
