The rpict is eats up 4.6 GB initially, but \neven with \"-aa 0\" (turns off ambient caching, right?) I am still \nseeing my VIRT and RES memory sizes growing. They are at 5.3 GB \nafter only 10 minutes of rendering. I am worried that I will not \nbe able to render high-resolution images of this scene now. How \ncan I prevent this?\n\n\nFYI: the scene is composed of a sky and 407 \"instance\"s of \nseparately-compiled octrees, each with 20k-100k primitives.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-August/005332.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005332", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
