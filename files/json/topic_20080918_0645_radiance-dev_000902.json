I think I  \njust need to remove it, and clear the related dependencies from px/ \nRmakefile.  I'm pretty sure libtiff is included in most modern OS's,  \nthough I could use some verification on that point.  I'm copying this  \ndiscussion to the dev list, and we'll sort it out there.\n\n\nMeanwhile, you should be able to get the px tools to compile by  \nsubstituting the attached px/Rmakefile and running \"rmake install\" in  \nthe px directory.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-September/000902.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000902", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
