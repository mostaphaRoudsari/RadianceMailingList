But I'm exporting from Ecotect using a\n100lux overcast sky, rendering with the -i option to get a daylight\nfactor image.  I've narrowed it down to something that looks like\nself-luminous ceiling soffits (I've rendered the scene with all the\nother objects apart from the floor slabs and it's fine) - tracing the\nilluminance value on the roof gives 100Lux as expected, but the floor\nslabs are ablaze with light (>1kLux).  The image\n(http://ndoylend.fastmail.fm/temp/test0_c5.jpg) looks pretty cool, but\nit's absolutely useless.\n\n\nCan anyone shed some light (sorry) on this one?\n\n\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005386.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005386", "created_by": "Nick_Doylend"}
