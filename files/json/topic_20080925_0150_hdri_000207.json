It turns out that i can't control any of the key parameters needed\nto take bracketed images (shutter speed, download/delete images etc.)\n\n\nIs anyone aware of a good digital camera who's settings are controllable\nfrom ptpcam (or similar programs)?\n\n\nit appears that the Nikon D70 works, as it was implemented at:\n\n\nhttp://www.hdrfc.com/software\n\n\nBut the D70 is quite expensive.... Ideally i am looking for the cheapest\ncamera i can get ($100-150?)\n\n\nbest,\n\n\nKyle\n\n\n******************************************\nKyle Konis\nPhD Student\nLawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)\nUC Berkeley Center for the Built Environment (CBE)\n206.303.9786\n******************************************\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2008-September/000207.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000207", "created_by": "Kyle_Konis"}
