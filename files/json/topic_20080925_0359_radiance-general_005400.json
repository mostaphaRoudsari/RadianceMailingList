I've created a scene and view file in  \nRadiance and I'm now trying to create the exact geometric model in  \nreal life.\n\n\nI have the focal length and image resolution, so can compute the -vh  \nand -vv angle values but the main problem is trying to compute the -vp  \nand -vd parameters.\n\n\nI have the 3x3 Rotation matrix and 3x1 Translation vector from using  \nthe Bouget Camera Calibration Toolbox in Matlab. The axes are the same  \nas for my Radiance scene but I need to translate the camera reference  \nframe origin to the geometric world scene origin.\n\n\nAlso I'd like to know how to do the Rotation as well for other images  \nI have whereby after calibration,  the axes may not be aligned.\nI've been looking in a few books but find some things ambiguous and  \ngetting a bit confused, so just wondering if somebody has a quick  \nsolution.\n\n\nI've considered 'cheating' by re-writing the geometry in the .rad file  \nso that the camera reference frame origin is at the geometric world  \norigin, but I'd prefer not to do this.\n\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nTarik\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Edinburgh is a charitable body, registered in\nScotland, with registration number SC005336.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-September/005400.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005400", "created_by": "Tarik_Rahman"}
