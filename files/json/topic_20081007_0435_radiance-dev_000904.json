I didn't have time yet to investigate the necessary code changes for this new option but I would like to ask if there is a chance that we'll see a similar feature for rpict in the (near) future? I know about and have used ranimate but a simple rpict -n sure does make parallel rendering easier.\n\n\n Erwin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-October/000904.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000904", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler"}
