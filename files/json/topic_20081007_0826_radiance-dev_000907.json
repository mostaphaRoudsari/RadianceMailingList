When compiling the latest HEAD everything works just fine, all executables are built.\nAfter running a few tests I discovered, that 3ds2mgf seems to be broken. This is the content of rmake:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nexec make \"SPECIAL=\" \\\n        \"OPT=-O2\" \\\n        \"MACH=-Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO\" \\\n        ARCH=IBMPC \"COMPAT=erf.o\" \\\n        INSTDIR=/opt/ray/bin \\\n        LIBDIR=/opt/ray/lib \\\n        ESUFFIX= \\\n        CC=gcc \"$@\" -f Rmakefile\n\n\n\"3ds2mgf file.3ds\" only produces \"file.mgf\" with this content:\n\n\nc R =\n        cxy 0.640 0.330\nc G =\n        cxy 0.290 0.600\nc B =\n        cxy 0.150 0.060\n\n\ni file.inc\n\n\nand \"file.inc\" is empty. Can anyone reproduce this or maybe even better has a hint as to where I can start debugging this problem? \nIt seems all 32bit versions (older compiles) run fine on the same systems, i.e. they produce the expected output.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n Erwin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-October/000907.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000907", "created_by": "Erwin_Zierler"}
