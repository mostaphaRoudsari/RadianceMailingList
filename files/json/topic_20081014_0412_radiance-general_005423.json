I am at the beginning of my understanding of all things Unix based and installing Radiance was a steep hill.  Can anyone give me an idiots guide on what I need to do to install Radzilla?  So far I have installed QT4 okay and I have Xcode tools installed.  However the Radzilla install completes with a number of errors...\n\n\nAny pointers will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nDan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005423.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005423", "created_by": "Dan_Fitzpatrick"}
