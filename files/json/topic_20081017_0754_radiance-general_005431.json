We use Bernd's\nofficial Radiance packages. Please get it, test it, and send any\nfeedback off-list directly to me. Note that some of the documentation\nhas not been updated, e.g. the Getting Started Guide and Luisa's ESP-r\ntutorial.\n\n\nAlthough some seemingly unmaintained or non-functional packages have\nbeen dropped, we are happy to announce that Andreas' radview, as well\nas Ilya's mt tools have made it into LEARNIX.\n\n\nThere are a number of test scripts under /usr/local/share/learnix\nwhich are designed to verify the functionality of Radiance and\nadd-ons. We would greatly appreciate if you could give any feedback\nand/or suggestions on them, too.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005431.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005431", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
