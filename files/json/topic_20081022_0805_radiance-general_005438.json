This part  \nworks fine.\n\n\nI also want to texture-map my cube,  and the texture should scale  \ntogether with the geometry. I tried this several ways using brightfunc  \n(with a modified version of  Mark Stock's checker.cal) and colorpict,  \nhowever all my animations look similar to this:\n\n\nhttp://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~katja/cube.html\n\n\nInstead of what you see I would like the texture to \"squeeze\" (i.e.  \nstripes getting thinner in z-direction) as the object shrinks in height.\n\n\nIf any one could point me to information that helps me solving this  \nproblem, that would be most appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\nKind Regards,\n\n\nKatja Doerschner\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005438.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005438", "created_by": "Katja_Doerschner"}
