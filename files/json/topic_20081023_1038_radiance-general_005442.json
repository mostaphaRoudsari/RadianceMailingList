The scripts are simple and  \ngenerally follow the library model used in makeall. They work with the  \ncurrent Radiance head and are very alpha--the scripts do not install  \nthe built files and there are other limitations--but I think they  \nmight be interesting for experimentation. If anyone is interested in  \nexperimenting with them, I would be delighted to share them.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005442.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005442", "created_by": "R_Fritz"}
