I personally still use trad a\nlot--it's convenient, fast, and doesn't get in the way.\n\n\ntrad still puts the old .pic extension on image files. The general\nconsensus nowadays seems to be to use .hdr. Since it's a quick\nfind-and-replace jobbie, may I propose to use this convention for rad\nand trad as well. I'd be happy to send you patch.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-October/005448.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005448", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
