The original curtain wall cladding is a\nwhite/grey marble and glass spandrel panels with a white patterned frit\nare proposed for the retrofit. This is my first time using the software\nand I am using Radiance in IES' Virtual Environment Program. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have some questions about determining/selecting material properties,\nspecifically deciding what material type (plastic/metal) and secularity\nto use for the two cladding options. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarble - Originally white, but panels have become grey with dirt over\ntime, not polished, dull finish\n\n\nType:                Plastic\n\n\nColour:             (0.91, 0.91, 0.83) \n\n\nSpecularity:       ?????? (I think this may be low because it is not\npolished marble)\n\n\nRoughness:      0.05 (???) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlass Frit - Composed of: Clear glass, 60% coverage white frit, clear\nglass, 100% coverage white frit. From Window 6, I estimate the solar\nreflectance of the system to be around 25-35%. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyple:               Metal ??? (Does the frit have specular and diffuse\nreflection of light?)\n\n\nColour:             (1.0,1.0, 1.0)\n\n\nSpecularity:       ????? (Clean polished glass)\n\n\nRoughness:      0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone has information from doing a similar simulation or has any\nsuggestion on what specularity values I should use to model these\nmaterials it would be very much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNastassja\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005461.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005461", "created_by": "Nastassja_Pearson"}
