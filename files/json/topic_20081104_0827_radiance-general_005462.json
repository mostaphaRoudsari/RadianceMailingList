I've always assumed that the\ncamera for parallel views was at infinity and everything in the scene\nwas visible to it. I've included an example below that clips the\ncorner of a rectangle. Is there a workaround to this, say, a simple\nconversion to a parallel view from very far away? Am I overlooking\nsomething? I'm using Radiance 3.8, by the way.\n\n\nThanks in advance. Cheers,\n--Dave\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView file:------------------\nrview -vtl -vp 33.4282 -12.544 6.49047 -vd -0.813537 0.363387 -0.45399\n-vu -0.489383 -0.00613896 0.872047 -vh 100 -vv 100 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0\n-vl 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRad file:-------------------\n!gensky 4 1 12\n\n\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5 1 1 1 0 0\n\n\nwhite polygon plane\n0\n0\n12\n   45   -15  0\n   45   15   0\n   -45  15   0\n   -45  -15  0\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005462.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005462", "created_by": "David_Smith"}
