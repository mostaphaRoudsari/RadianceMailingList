I've avoided  \nlooking at other file types, at least for the moment. Here's some of  \nmy notes on this:\n\n\n1. Since 2005, only a standards body can register an unqualified type;  \nimage/hdr, say. So we'd probably best come in as a \"vendor\" (broadly  \nconstrued) type; image/vnd.radiance, perhaps. (I can make a case for  \nvnd.radiance.hdr, but it seems like overkill).\n\n\n2. We're encouraged (but not required) to submit information about the  \nformat of our files. I think it would be a good idea to submit the  \nRadiance picture file format, possibly lightly edited and expanded.  \nI'll sign up for the ietf-types at iana.org mailing list and see what we  \nmight submit.\n\n\n3. We need to conduct a security analysis, though I don't think we  \nhave major issues here. The main one is that .pic format does use  \ncompression, which might be used in a resource-denial attack.\n\n\n...to be continued...\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nOn Oct 25, 2008, at 2:51 PM, R Fritz wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-November/000922.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000922", "created_by": "R_Fritz"}
