Daylight in atria: a comparison of measurement, theory and simulation: \u00a0Proceedings Lux Europa. Amsterdam, 1997.\"\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Littlefair P. Daylight prediction in atrium buildings. Solar Energy, 2002; 73: 105-109.\",\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Radiance underestimated the reflected light (Internal reflected component) in atria with high reflectance (some measurements in the paper used a reflectance 0.85 and got the biggest discrepancy in IRC\u00a0was 4.87). My some simulations\u00a0 got the similar results: simulations underestimated the measurement with reflectance 0.6 and 0.8 and\u00a0 the higher of surface reflectance the bigger is the discrepancy. All the studies used overcast sky model and set a higher ambient parameter setting.\n\u00a0\nCould you help me explain the\u00a0divergence from high reflectance simulation using Radiance. Also, if these demonstrate Radiance simulation could bring some bigger errors to the dayligthing simulation in high reflectance environment?\n\u00a0\nBTW, I will appreciate it very much if you could share some experience or knowledge\u00a0 and give some suggestion about higher reflectance simulations.\n\u00a0\nCheers\n\u00a0\nJiangtao\n\u00a0\nPhD student in University of Sheffield\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005501.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005501", "created_by": "Jiangtao_Du"}
