Listed as many apps as I can find which work with the format.\n2. Added the \"rgbe\" and \"xyze\" extensions.\n3. Added a notes section at the end which indicates that the \"pic\"  \nextension is deprecated, and explains that \"?RADIANCE\\n\" is not a  \nreliable identifier, as indeed no magic number is.\n\n\nFor the moment I am leaving Greg's email off the form; Greg, if you  \nwant direct e-mails on this, let me know and I'll add it. Once the  \nspec is submitted, you'll be the change controller, with the final  \nword on the format, but unless you really want the work, I don't see  \nany reason for you to be getting direct e-mails.\n\n\nNext to edit the specification, which may take a while because I am  \nbusy with other matters.\n\n\nMeantime, yes, Axel go ahead and forward the proposal to the pfstools  \nlist. The username/password may stay in; the point is to keep the  \nthing from showing up in Google searches, not to keep it truly secret.\n\n\nDo keep in mind that the registration form is not the place for  \nspecification of the file format; there's only so much it can contain  \nor, customarily, does contain.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-November/000926.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000926", "created_by": "R_Fritz"}
