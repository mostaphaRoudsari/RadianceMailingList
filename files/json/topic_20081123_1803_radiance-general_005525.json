I am calculation Illuminance values and Daylight \nGlare Index values (DGI) values at different reference points \nstarting from close to the window to the back wall.\n\n\nI am getting Illuminance values ranging from 4500 lux to 600 lux, \nbut the glare Index values are coming out to be zero for all \npoints. I don't know if these are normal values or not. I am \nattaching the output file along. I would like to know your \ncomments,\n\n\nThank you.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005525.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005525", "created_by": "G_V_DEEPAK"}
