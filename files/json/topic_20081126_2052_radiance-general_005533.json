The window sill height is 3'.\n\n\nI am observing that the illuminance levels inside the room (at the \nsensor point close to the window) are higher with the interior \nVenetian blinds placed in the model (4500? lux) as compared to the \nmodel without the blinds (3000 ?lux).\nAlso even though the illuminance levels are much higher (at the \nlevel of 4500 lux close to the window) there is no glare index \nobserved (that is value of Daylight glare index DGI is equal to \nzero).\n\n\nI am attaching a compressed file folder containing all the input \nfiles and the octree files. I might sound very naive to you, \nplease excuse me for any ignorance on my part, I am very new to \nthe Radiance as well as UNIX. I have used the PICO text editor as \nvi text editor was having some problems in my system. There is a \nfile named command, in the folder attached, it has all the \ncommands that I have used in compiling and generating different \ncomponents of the model. finalmultiplesim1.csh is the shell script \nused and January.out is the output file.\n\n\nI would appreciate some suggestions as to where I might be going \nwrong with the simulations.\n\n\nThank you.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-November/005533.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005533", "created_by": "G_V_DEEPAK"}
