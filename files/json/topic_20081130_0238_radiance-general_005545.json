Therefore I hope this is the right forum to post such a question :)\n\n\nI am using Ubuntu v. 8.10.\n\n\nI have downloaded and installed Radiance and ESP-r. Both programmes seems to work but there might be missing some libaries to Ubuntu. In order to make the coupling between ESP-r and Radiance, Gendaylit needs to be installed. I have done so by changing the makefile in the Gendaylit package to:\n\n\nCCOPTS= -g\n#CCOPTS= -Ae -g \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 # HPUX\n\n\nCC=gcc\n#CC=cc\n\n\nand issued the command 'make'. I have copied the file 'Gendaylit' to '/opt/radiance/bin'\u00a0 and 'coeff_perez.dat', 'defangle.dat' and 'perezlum.cal' to '/opt/radiance/lib'\n\n\nTo test the Gendaylit file one can issue 'make skyview'. I have done so both as root and as PHA and I get the following errors:\n\n\noconv -f sky.rad outside.rad > sky.oct\n/bin/sh: oconv: not found\nmake: *** [skyview] Error 127\n\n\nor\n\n\noconv -f sky.rad outside.rad > sky.oct\n/bin/sh: cannot create sky.oct: Permission denied\nmake: *** [skyview] Error 2\n\n\nI must also say that I have added the following to both '.profile'-files in '/home/pha' and in '/root'\n\n\n#Set PATH for ESP-r and Radiance\nRAYPATH= .:/lib:/opt/radiance/lib:/opt/radiance/bin\nPATH=$PATH:/opt/esru/bin:/opt/esru/esp-r/bin:/opt/radiance/lib:/opt/radiance/bin\n\n\nexport PATH RAYPATH\nunset USERNAME\n\n\nI suspect that there is something wrong with '/bin/sh' which is listed in Ubuntu 8.10 as symlink 'sh -> dash' and 'sh.distrib -> bash'.\n\n\nI am afried to make any changes to the linux destribution because I am not that familiar with linux.\n\n\nCan anybody spot a solution to my problem?\n\n\nAny help is appresiated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n______________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Haugaard,\n\n\nGriffenfeldsgade 33, 2.tv\n\n\n2200 K\u00f8benhavn N\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmobil:  +45 26 39 06 40\n\n\nE-mail: perhaugaard at yahoo.dk\n\n\n\n\n      Tr\u00e6nger du til at se det store billede?
