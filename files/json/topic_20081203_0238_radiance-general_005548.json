The -aa 0 setting is  \nappropriate when you have a lot of small geometry that isn't safe to  \nleave out of the ambient calculation (using the -ae or -aE options),  \nor for special applications such as mkillum or rtcontrib.  Turning  \noff the ambient cache is NOT a good idea when what you care about is  \nindividual ray accuracy, such as when you are using rtrace to  \nevaluate radiance or irradiance values in a space.  It can be done  \nwith -aa 0, but you have to pay close attention to your other  \nparameter settings (such as -ad, -as, -lw, and -lr) and alter them  \nappropriately.  The -ar setting has no effect with -aa 0.  Ditto for - \naw.\n\n\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005548.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005548", "created_by": "Kam_Shing_Leung"}
