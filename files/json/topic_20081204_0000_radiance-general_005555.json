I know the qt-movie from the workshop,\nbut I did not get it - and it seams that I know noone except Greg who\ngot it so far ;-)\n\n\nThank You & CU, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005555.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005555", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
