So modelling a glazing with\nintegrated blinds, anything acting like a prisma etc. as brtf would not\nmake too much sense, while for glass and most homogenous materials there\nshould not arise any problems...?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005576.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005576", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
