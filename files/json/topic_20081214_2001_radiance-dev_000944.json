While doing so I was wondering if a little\nREADME.linux in the ray directory would have solved this problem. It's\nvery straight-forward to install the development libs for libtiff\n(libtiff-dev/libtiff-devel) on a LINUX system thanks to the excellent\npackage managers under Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu etc.\n\n\nBernd has been doing a fantastic job packaging Radiance for\nDebian/Ubuntu. Any chance of having a little README.linux in the\nofficial tar ball that would explain how to use the distro's native\nlibtiff-devel to compile Radiance? It's been 'documented' on the\nmailing list, but that's not quite the same as a README. Greg, I know\nyou made the decision to ship the tiff libs with Radiance a long time\nago because there were too many problems in relying on the native\nones. Is this still the case, or has libtiff somewhat settled down a\nbit?\n\n\nAs a sidenote, two of my students this year are proud owners of\nMacBooks. Although the LEARNIX live CD-ROM works hunky-dory with the\nIntel Mac hardware, one of the students expressed an interest in\ninstalling Radiance on his MacBook. Since I know nothing about the\npackage management in MacOSX, or about compiling anything I could not\ngive him any advice. I understand he did spend some time trying to\nwork it all out, and managed to install the requirement (I don't even\nknow what to call it... Some Apple compiler/runtime thingy). Anyhow he\ndid not succeed in his endeavour. So I'm afraid other than \"it didn't\nwork for him\", I can't really describe the issues and problems. Many\nof you guys are using Radiance on MacOS. Could one of you beam\nyourself back in time to when your shiny new MacBook arrived on your\ndoorstep, and somehow document exactly what you did to get this\nRadiance thing working? Kinda a Dummy's guide to installing Radiance\non a MacBook. This would be great to have on the web site, or even the\ntar ball.\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2008-December/000944.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000944", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
