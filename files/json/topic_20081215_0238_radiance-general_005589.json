Below is a small guide to compile and install Radiance in Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon. I hope that someone finds it useful.\n\n\nRegards,\nJP\n\n\nInstall Radiance R3.9 in Ubuntu (7.10) Gutsy Gibbon\n\n\n\n\nA step-by-step guide (1st Draft)\n\n\n\n\nDec 15, 2008\n\n\nFirst, I am a relatively new user of Radiance and Ubuntu. I would like to help newbies like me to get Radiance working on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon with as little\npain as possible.\n\n\nWhy?\na) For using Radiance on older machines.\nb) I find Ubuntu 7.10 perfect for my needs and am reluctant to upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10.\n\n\nThere may be others like me, so this small guide is intended for them.\n\n\nWe will install Radiance from source, but there are alternatives though like:\n\n\n1) change your distro or upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10\n2) try intrepid (Ubuntu 8.10) packages by using backports\n\n\n Binary files for Ubuntu 8.10 are available for download\n        at the following site:\n\n\n https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/radiance/3R9+20080530-4\n\n\n3) get live CD, learnix-2008-1_beta.iso (which uses Ubuntu 8.10) from: \n\n\n       ftp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pub/learnix/learnix-2008-1_beta.iso\n\n\n\n\nOK, let's start the process to compile radiance from source package:\n\n\n\n\nFirst Step:\n\n\n\n\nWe need to download the required packages and their dependencies to compile using synaptic package manager:\n\n\n -   tcsh\n -   libtiff\n -   g++\n -   g++4.1\n -   tcl8.5\n -   tk8.4\n -   libc6-dev\n -   libx11-dev\n\n\nor type following in terminal:\n# sudo apt-get install tcsh libtiff g++ g++4.1 tcl8.5 tk8.4 libc6-dev libx11-dev\n\n\nDepending on your internet connection and your machine this may take some time.\n\n\n\n\nSecond Step:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the Radiance for compiling\nCreate a directory in your HOME directory:\n# mkdir build\n\n\nChange the working directory to it:\n# cd build\n\n\nDownload Radiance sources:\n# wget http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download/rad3R9all.tar.gz\n\n\nUnpack it:\n# tar -xvf rad3R9all.tar.gz\n\n\nChange the working directory to the source directory:\n# cd ray\n\n\n\n\nThird Step:\n\n\nCompiling it:\nThis generates the necessary files and checks your system:\n\n\n#sudo tcsh makeall install\n\n\nGive following answers to the queries generated by the install script:\nQ1. Default editor [vi]?\nAns: y\n\n\nQ2. Install to location usr/local/bin:\nAns. y\n\n\nQ3. Read the license agreement ...\nAns. Scroll down using space bar. At the end it will ask:\n   q. Do you agree [n]:\n   ans. y\n\n\nQ4. Type of install? Choose from Sun, Sparc, Linux, etc. \n    Linux is listed at number 6\nAns. 6\n\n\nQ5. Copy library files to 'usr/local/lib/ray'?\nAns. y\n\n\nQ6. Install library files now?\nAns. y\n\n\nQ7. Current rmake command is \n    #!bin/sh\n    ....\n    Do you want to change it?\nAns. n\n\n\n\n\nThe programs and libraries are copied to usr/local/bin and \nusr/local/lib/ray respectively.\n\n\nThe environment variable Raypath is automatically set.\n\n\nIf all goes well you will have a working installation of Radiance. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n1) In my case, the installation ended with the message \n   \"there were some errors\"\n   As far as I was able to make out, this was because: \n\n\n   - libtiff was not compiled due to some compiler sanity check\n\n\n   - However, since latest libtiff was already downloaded and installed in\n     first Step in Ubuntu, this did not cause a problem.\n\n\n2) Some binary files from installation directory:\n\n\n     i.e. /build/ray/src/px\n\n\n     like macbethcal, pcomb, pfilt, ra-bmp, ... ttyimage, etc.\n     were not automatically copied to the /usr/local/bin directory.\n\n\n     - So I manually copied the files using the nautilus file manager\n       as root by using the following command:\n\n\n       sudo nautilus\n\n\n    Note: copy the files whose icons are a rotated square with gears\n          to the /usr/local/bin directory\n\n\n3)  For more details about the errors please refer to a file\n    named as config.log. You can search for this file from the desktop\n    menu:\n        Places--->\n                Search for files (with magnifying glass icon)\n\n\n    The config.log file in my case was located at:\n        ubuntu/build/ray/src/px/tiff/config.log \n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\n\nI hope that this guide is helpful. It has been written with the best of intentions. There may be errors, so I request advanced users to kindly review it and update the same.\n\n\nWishing you all the best.\nJiten\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-February/004779.html\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005589.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005589", "created_by": "EncaseIndia"}
