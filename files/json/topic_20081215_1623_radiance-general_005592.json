I want to find the total difference in illuminance values between two .pic files, summed for each point in the .pic. \n\n\nBasically, this would allow me to take two .pic files and fingure out the total difference in illuminance between the two scenes. Of course, the two .pic files are the same view of the same scene, only the source and reflectance characteristics are changing.\n\n\nIt should be noted that I'm looking for a way to calculate a single value for the whole .pic, not a difference image or something of that sort.\n\n\nThanks for any help you can offer!\n\n\n - Matt Brugman\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSend e-mail anywhere.
