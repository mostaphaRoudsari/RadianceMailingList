Still, as their is no \nspace between the panes, I choose number of panes=1, and I am pretty \nsure that this is the right way to do this - am I wrong? Next, I have to \neither define the outer and inner surfaces (s1, s2). I choosed s1=clear \nglass and s2=laminated pvb, according to the rule that all glass \nmaterials are defined from the viewer's side. Still this is not really \nclear, so I would like to ask if I am doing something completely wrong \nhere or if I understood the script right?\n\n\nTIA, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005594.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005594", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
