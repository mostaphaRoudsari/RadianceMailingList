On p. 9 the manual says:\n\n\n\"The incident flux from distant sources is evaluated at each port\nand the sources are checked for occlusion. However, no interreflection \ncalculation\nis made; ports differ from illums in this respect. Photons are scattered \nby the port\nupon emission as if they had passed through it.\"\n\n\nThe general approach rendering a typical architectural scene would be to \nuse surfaces at the windows as photon ports. To account for any kind of \nshading devices, I would have to place the photon port surface outside \nthese devices.\n\n\nStill, almost every architectural simulation includes obstruction from \nnearby building, trees etc. Now, as far as I understand the manual, \nthese obstructions would only influence my scene following a visibility \ntest (so either blocking light or not), but e.g. the surface \ncharacteristics of geometry such as reflectance would be neglected. Is \nthis the case?\n\n\nThank you, CU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005609.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005609", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
