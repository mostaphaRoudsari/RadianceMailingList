Is similar parallelization\npossible in rtrace program?\nI've found \"-PP pfile\" option but I'm not sure how to use it. I supposed\nthat \"pfile\" should be empty so program can write into it some control\nvariables. When I started rtrace with -PP option 2 processes are created:\none for my  rtrace and one child rtrace process with the same parameters.\nWhen I tried to explore running processes it seems that only the first one\nis really running, while the second one is sleeping - so I don't have real\nparalellization here.\n\n\nI suppose I haven't understood something well, so if someone has the\nexperience with rtace running on multiprocessor machines, please send me\nsome ideas/hints.\n\n\nHappy holidays to all list members and their families,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005616.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005616", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
