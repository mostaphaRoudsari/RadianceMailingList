When I export from Ecotect to Radiance with the above values the Radiance 'light' object has RGB values of 1416.6, but lampcolor produces 131.6 (for a ring of .254m radius (10\") and 15000 lm).\n\n\nSo I have to 'fake' out Radiance by entering a much lower value for total lumens in Ecotect so it will generate the correct (131.6 RGB values), a value of 1400 lumens in Ecotect gets close (132 RGB value).\n\n\nThere is the first question, why do I have to use 1400 lumens when it should be 15000?\n\n\nProblem #2\nThen, the second problem, even using 1400 lm I still get lux values in Radiance which are about 3 times greater than the electric light simulations in Ecotect!\n\n\nSo, what am I doing wrong?\n\n\nthank you in advanced for any feedback.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005626.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005626", "created_by": "reichj_skyhibroadband"}
