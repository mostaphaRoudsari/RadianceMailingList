To simplify a model, where direct sunlight is not important and \ndaylight can be considered as a hemispherical light source (uniform \nsky), I would like to do manually what mkillum does when producing a \nlight modifier (not the default illum modifier). The surface to be \nmodified is a horizontal flat rectangular face of, say, 1sqm. If I would \nnormalize the sky source in a way that I would get a horizontal \nilluminance of, lets say, 1000 lux, ignoring obstructions, how would I \ncalculate the 1 sqm light source's modifier that would replace the sky \nin my scene? Is mkillum basically calcultating an iradiance image here?\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005632.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005632", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
