First, the results of rtrace illuminance with a sky dome defined \nas light are more or less random. So the fact that I got a result close \nto what I expected only led me to the wrong direction.\n\n\nDefining glow, there is no need for multiplying anything for the \ncolorimetric balance, as I assume a neutral white light source. The \nmultiplication only has to be done when getting from radiance (which is \nin RGB channels) to illuminance. So I have either to use a glow with RGB \n1 1 1 and modify it with the brightfunc from gensky (as is usually done) \nor directly use the (neutral white) radiance calculated dividing \nluminance by 179 for the glow material in case of an uniform sky (RGB \n17.8 17.8 17.8).\n\n\nResults are fine (9998.5 for the simple glow and 9987.6 for the skyfunc \nsky), I forget about my light-modified source, and hope that noone else \nspent time on my rather silly question...\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-December/005637.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005637", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
