I've been using Daysim and am trying to  \nscratch my head around what exactly it's doing in the background.  My  \nunderstanding so far is that Daysim uses a modified Rtrace routine,  \nand I'm interested in how the more recent Rtcontrib can be used in its  \nplace. Thanks.\n\n\nChris H\nBerkeley, CA USA\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005655.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005655", "created_by": "Christian_Humann"}
