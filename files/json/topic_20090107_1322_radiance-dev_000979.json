Would it be feasible to implement an option to call rpiece via rad?\nMaybe -p option similar to the -N option for rad could call multiple\nrpiece commands for each view instead of a rendering a view on each\nprocessor. This would be useful for speeding up single views or when\ngetting that first output quickly is preferred.\n\n\nMy little experience with rpiece has produces sometimes spotty results,\nso I don't know if this might make errors trickier to troubleshoot.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-January/000979.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000979", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush"}
