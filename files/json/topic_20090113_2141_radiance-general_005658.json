This distance depends on\nthe angle under which the ray hits the surface, and will be shortest if\nhit perpendicular. Is this correctly modeled by the glass modifier,\nwhich does not know the thickness (but the refraction of the material)?\nOr do I need a 'solid' glass body to model this, with dielectric?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005658.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005658", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
