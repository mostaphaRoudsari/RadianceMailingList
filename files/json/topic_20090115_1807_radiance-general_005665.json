{"topic": "Radiance-general Digest, Vol 59, Issue 8", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Jack de Valpine", "created_at": "January 15, 2009 at 06:07PM", "body": "Hi Galen,\n\n\nNo problem.\n\n\nRegarding the header\n\n\n    * Rc<r,g,b> - these are the rgb components for the reflectance on\n      the \"coated\" side of the monolithic glass\n    * Rg<r,g,b> - these are the rgb components for the reflectance on\n      the non-coated side of the monolithic glass\n    * T<r,g,b> - these are the rgb components for the transmittance for\n      the monolithic glass\n    * Part - this is a boolean value\n          o 0 means this is a regular glass\n          o 1 means this is a frit - if this is the case the \"coated\"\n            side reflectance needs to represent the reflectance of the\n            frit at 100% coverage which should be possible to extract\n            from the glazing manufacturer\n\n\nThe RGB values are extracted from the file generated for a \"radiance\" \nexport from Optics. This should be for a single pane monolithic glass \ndescription (not a multi-layer make-up). The file will have three \nRadiance material definitions, the two BRDTfunc definitions are the ones \nto pay attention to. The makeup is something like the following:\n\n\n    void BRTDfunc some.glass.front\n    10\n\n\n        Rfr Rfg Rfb\n        Tr Tg Tb\n        0   0   0\n        .\n\n\n    9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n    void BRTDfunc some.glass.back\n    10\n\n\n        Rbr Rbg Rbb\n        Tr Tg Tb\n        0   0   0\n        .\n\n\n    9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nSo you need to take the two rgb triples for reflectance and one for \ntransmittance. So an entry in the data file could look like this (you \nwill need to figure which represents the coated side if needed):\n\n\n    Surface Tr      Tg      Tb      Rcr     Rcg     Rcb     Rgr     Rgg     Rgb     Part\n    <name>  Tr\tTg\tTb\tRfr\tRfg\tRfb\tRbr\tRbg\tRbb\t0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA file for a double pane insulating unit might look like the following:\n\n\n    Surface Tr      Tg      Tb      Rcr     Rcg     Rcb     Rgr     Rgg     Rgb     Part\n    green-lowe  Tr\tTg\tTb\tRfr\tRfg\tRfb\tRbr\tRbg\tRbb\t0\n\n\n\n\nThe glaze script contains a default \"clear\" glass. I seem to recall that \nthis is required for the script to output a material description (eg it \nmust have a \"clear\" glass description\"). If this is not suitable the \nscript requires some modification, which I think I can offer some \nguidance on so that you can include your own \"clear\" glass description.\n\n\nI would suggest before you do anything else you should test out the \nscript as is with the built in values. This will let you see how it \nworks. You will assign different materials to different layers to build \nup the composite unit.\n\n\nTry it out and let me know if you have more questions.\n\n\n-Jack\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005665.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005665", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
