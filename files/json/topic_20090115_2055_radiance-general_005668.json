Your \ndiscussion so far seems rather relevant to the issue with which I am \nconcerned. I have little familiarity with Radiance or writing scripts for \nRadiance, however.\n\n\nI am doing a comparative study of glazing types for illuminance levels on \nthe interior of a large atrium space lighted by a barrel vaulted skylight. \nI am using Ecotect and exporting to Radiance, allowing Radiance to render \nthe image and then re-importing the point data back into Ecotect for \ngraphic representation and interpretation. The specific glass types I am \ntrying to model are Viracon's VE340, VE340 with 30% grey frit and VE340 \nwith 50% grey frit. Viracon provided the .rad files from Optics, but the \nresults I am obtaining don't seem to correlate. I suspect it has something \nto do with the Optics output and how it deals with a frit. I have attached \nthe files and was hoping you could provide some insight.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nTed Biro\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005668.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005668", "created_by": "Ted_Biro"}
