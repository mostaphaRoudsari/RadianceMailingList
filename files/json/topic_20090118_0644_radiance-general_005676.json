This is still a test version\nand should not be used in a production environment!\n\n\nThe big news: It works on Windows, too!\n\n\nOther changes:\n\n\n     * (nearly) feature complete interface\n     * material assignment via drag'n'drop (in JavaScript!)\n     * advanced view settings like fisheye projections\n     * materials from Radiance scene files can be used\n\n\nI hope you will provide me with feedback on the usability\nor usefulness of the features so far.\n\n\nI have only tested it on SketchUp 7 so you are advised to\nupgrade. The script works on the free version ('Google Sketchup')\nso there is no need to buy new licenses. Note that SU7 files do\nnot open in SU6!\n\n\n\n\nDownload and Installation\n\n\n\n\nPlease read the introduction and comments on\n\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/su2rad/1-0-alpha\n\n\n\n\nThe download for the zip file is:\n\n\nhttp://su2rad.googlecode.com/files/su2rad_1.0.alpha.zip\n\n\n\n\nAs always, extract the zip file, copy 'su2rad.rb' and\n'su2radlib' into the SketchUp 'plugins' folder and you're\ngood to go.\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to come back with comments.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005676.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005676", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
