Even when I\nrun command \"rad\", it does not give any message that this commend not\nfound or something, simply nothing happens.\n\n\nFurther I tried to run the examples files .rad using rad program, it\ndid not run.\n\n\nCan I expect some help?\n\n\nThank you\nRegards\nChandrayee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandrayee Basu (M.Tech)\nSchr\u00f6felhofstra\u00dfe 12, WG 07/02\n81375 M\u00fcnchen\n+49-89-289-22403\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005684.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005684", "created_by": "Chandrayee_Basu"}
