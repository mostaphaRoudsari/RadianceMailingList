I can take \nall pixels which have not a value of exactly 0 (as this should never \nexist for a valid material), but this seams to be not very accurate. I \nknow that I can test if a pixel is inside the field of view using pcomb, \nwhich defines S(n) as zero for pixels outside the view, but I do not \nknow how to access this value to count pixels inside the view. At the \nmoment, the easiest way for me would be to render a fisheye pointing \ntowards a 180 degree source without any geometry and count all \nnone-black pixels, but I am sure that there must be a better way to test \nfor the pixels' validity.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005712.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005712", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
