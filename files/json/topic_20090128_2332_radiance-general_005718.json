Does it just sample one ray at\nthe input point <xorg yorg zorg> in the direction <xdir ydir zdir> and\ncalculate the light gained from that direction, or it will sample many\nrays through the hemisphere and calculate all the light that reaches\nthe hemisphere? In the second case, the input direction <xdir ydir\nzdir> is the normal at point <xorg yorg zorg>.\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nYu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005718.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005718", "created_by": "Sheng_Yu"}
