However, I don't have a good method of turning that ASCII text  \nback into an image (aside from PIL, ImageMagick, and the ra_* commands). Is  \nthere a way to take a series of numbers/values and convert it to a Radiance  \npicture, like rpict with the ability to input data instead of a scene? If  \nso, which values would I need?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005723.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005723", "created_by": "Dave_B"}
