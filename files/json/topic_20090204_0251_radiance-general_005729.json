I have a room which is lid by a light pipe, and \nto simulate this I use radiance 3.7 with the pmap extension. Everything \nworks rather fine. Now I wanted to put some diffusing body under that \nlight pipe, and I chosed the trans material to do so. The material \ndefinition I used should result in a simple diffuse transmitting box:\n\n\nvoid trans genericDiffusor\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 .5 0\n\n\nAnd I applied this to a box:\n\n\n!genbox genericDiffusor Diffusor60x60 .3 .3 .01 | xform -t -.3 -.3 0\n\n\nThe opening is .6x.6m and centred at the origin, so that my diffusor \ncovers only part of it. I want to see the effect of the material... And \nthe effect is - somewhat unexpected. The \"diffusor\"-box appears black in \nmy rendering. So is there anything completely wrong in my scene? Is \nthere anything I got wrong about trans and surface normals, is it the \ncombination of trans and pmap?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005729.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005729", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
