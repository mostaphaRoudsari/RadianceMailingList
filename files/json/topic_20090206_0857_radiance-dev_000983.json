Please respond from that list.\n\n\nThere is no call to explicitly kill child processes in raypcalls, but  \nyou could add one.  It would also be possible to modify the ray_pclose \n() call to explicitly kill its children rather than waiting for them  \nto return after end-of-input.  We wouldn't be able to report status,  \nbut it would be unusual (and probably irrelevant) for an error to  \noccur during process termination, anyway.\n\n\nIn a command-line program, using Control-C normally kills all  \nprocesses in a group, and so would lead to early termination for  \nchildren without the wait.  In the latest version of rvu, rather than  \nkilling the child processes when the user begins input, I take their  \ninput while the children crank away in the background, then process  \nthe user command after waiting for the remaining rays.  Normally, the  \ndelay is not noticeable with this approach.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-February/000983.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000983", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
