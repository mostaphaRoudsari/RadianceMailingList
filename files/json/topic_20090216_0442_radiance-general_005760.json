The default COPTS is -Ae -g. Will it work with the gcc of linux.\nI had specified '-o' COPTS for linux and it says the undefined reference to\nthe trigonometric functions and to 'main'. Is it necessary to use a HP-UX\ngcc compiler? Will it work if I use the ILP32 hp-gcc?\n\n\nThank you\nChandrayee\n\n\n\n\nChandrayee Basu (M.Tech)\nSchr\u00f6felhofstra\u00dfe 12, WG 07/02\n81375 M\u00fcnchen\n+49-89-289-22403\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005760.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005760", "created_by": "Chandrayee_Basu"}
