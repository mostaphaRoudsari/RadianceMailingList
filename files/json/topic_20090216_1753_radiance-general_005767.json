Rhino is very popular with\narchitects, and is the second result in a Yahoo search for NURBS\n(third in Google).\n\n\nIt is written in RhinoScript and exports any file, by layer,\ncontaining surfaces capable of being opened in Rhino as Radiance\ngeometry. The file should be saved by Rhino first.\n\n\nThis is early, early alpha, by the way. I'm looking for feedback and\napp utility. Many more features will follow.\n\n\nLink: http://auror.us/radiance/rhino2rad.php\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005767.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005767", "created_by": "David_Smith"}
