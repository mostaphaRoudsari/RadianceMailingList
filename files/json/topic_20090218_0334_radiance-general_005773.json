So what does \nthis mean, are the values related to the way the reflectance is measured \nand calculated using different procedures according to standards?\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005773.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005773", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
