Quite\nan odd question, I'm thinking.\n\n\nHere's an image to get you started, showing half the sky, latitude lines,\n\"former longitude\" lines, ground, and a sun, projected onto a 2D circle:\nhttp://auror.us/radiance/skyout.png .\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005786.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005786", "created_by": "David_Smith"}
