Now, I know I have a patchy\nsystem here and some libs might be outdated but does pinterp\nneed an update to support this?\n\n\nBTW: I think this use of pinterp is worth mentioning in the\n      man page. I wouldn't have thought of this feature after\n      reading the current man page twice.\n\n\nThanks,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005791.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005791", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
