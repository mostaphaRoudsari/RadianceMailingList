If somebody needs packages for Etch,\nplease let me know.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                           Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n GPG Fingerprint: 06C8 C9A2 EAAD E37E 5B2C BE93 067A AD04 C93B FF79\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-February/005794.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005794", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz"}
