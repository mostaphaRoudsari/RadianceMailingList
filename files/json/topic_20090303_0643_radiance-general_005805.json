Unfortunately, my office only had a dual core machine available for my use, so I need to get Radiance running some parallel processes on the two cores. I've been reading up on the -N option for rad, but whenever I use \"-N 2\" as a parameter, only one of the cores is running rad. Does the -N option actually work, or do I need to use rpiece for running radiance on both processors. \n\n\nThanks,\nMatthew Brugman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nHotmail\u00ae is up to 70% faster.
