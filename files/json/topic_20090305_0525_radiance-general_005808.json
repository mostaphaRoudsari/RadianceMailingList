The school is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nwhich is part of the Boston Metropolitan Area. Logan Airport is the\nclosest international airport. The International Radiance Workshops are\nannual gatherings of developers and users of the Radiance backward\nraytracer. The workshop consists of a series of presentations that in\nthe past included case studies on the use of Radiance in lighting and/or\ndaylighting projects, recent advanced in glare detection, visual comfort\nand energy savings from lighting controls as well as the use of Radiance\nin Art and Design. At least one session is typically also dedicated to\ntechnical advances that have been made within the Radiance engine over\nthe past year. Presentations from previous workshops can be downloaded\nfrom http://www.radiance-online.org/. \n\n\nWe are planning to split the workshop into an 'application day'\n(Thursday) and a more 'technical day' (Friday). Workshop fees have not\nbeen determined, yet, but should be within the $250 to $300 range. We\nwill offer a reduced student registration fee. I will soon send out\nanother email with registration details and a call for presentations.\nFor now, mark your calendars! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI look forward to welcoming you in Cambridge,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing. \n\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\n\nGund Hall 331b, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu> \n\n\nDaylighting Design: www.daylight1-2-3.com\n<http://www.daylight1-2-3.com/>  (entry level); www.daysim.com\n<http://www.daysim.com/>  (advanced)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005808.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005808", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
