By normal map\nI mean a floating point RGB image, where the RGB values of each pixel\ncorrespond to the xyz coordinates of the surface normal in scene\ncoordinates. More precisely, for example for the red channel:\n\n\n     R = (Nx + 1)/2\n\n\nwhere Nx is the surface normal (in scene coordinates, not camera\ncoordinates) of the primary ray intersection point for a given ray. With\nthe expression given above the resulting pixel values should be in the\nrange from 0 to 1.\n\n\nI have been working with making my own normal.cal function, since Nx,\nNy, and Nz are available in rayinit.cal, so it should be dead easy, I\njust can't figure out how to return the offset/scaled N values as RGB\nvalues directly, so as to completely bypass any lighting computations.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005813.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005813", "created_by": "Claus_B._Madsen"}
