I have a question for the \nsecond pass of rtcontrib. If I understand correctly, the input for rtcontrib is the tregsamp.dat\n file but modified by rcalc. The modofication applies to the rays origin which from 0,0,0 I think \nthat they are distributed 1.7m off the facade of the building. It looks that the directions \nremain the same. In adittion, if one tries to actually plot the file it looks that all these rays are directed to the facade of the building.\n\n\n\n\nThe description for this step within the readme file was \"The second stage computes the incidence of sky \nillumination on these portholes, and the results are combined\".\n\n\nCould somebody throw a little bit of light on this step as I can not figure out the logic behind. Hopefully, \nI have not misunderstood what's going on and this email does make a bit of sense. \n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________ \n\u03a7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5 Yahoo!; \n\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 (spam); \u03a4\u03bf Yahoo!
