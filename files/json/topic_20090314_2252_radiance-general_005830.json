The cylindrical lamps has 32mm in diameter and 540mm in\nlength and The radiance of 44W/sr/m2 calculated with the UV output of the\nlamps (7.5W) was applied to the lamps. Before calculating the small box\nmodel I checked irradiance values with an experiment measuring UV intensity\nat the distance of 1 m and compared that with the same simple RADIANCE\ncalculation and the result was reasonable. However, the calculation\nresults are higher than those of experiments by 2~4 times with the small box\nmodel. The small box is not simple but not so complicated. I have modeled\nthe lamp both as a cylinder and 72 polygons  but there were not so much\nchanges. Only one channel was used to calculate irradiances of UV from\nmodeling to issuing results and only diffused reflections were assumed.\nGeometric errors or abnormal radiance distributions of lamps could be\nassumed to cause the discrepancy, but 2~5 times are too large\nHere is my rtrace options.\n\n\ncat pts_sensor.pts | rtrace -I -oov -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2 -ds 0.02\nuv.oct > uv.dat\n\n\nIt would be appreciated if anyone give me advice.\n\n\n\n\nSung\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005830.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005830", "created_by": "Minki_Sung"}
