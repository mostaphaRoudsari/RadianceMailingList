As you said, the reflectance for UV is usually\nlower than that for visible light. Actually, the box is an air handling unit\nand the materials are mostly galvanized copper plates and the reflectance of\nit for UV is referred from other reference. I thought the result might be\ncaused by incorrect reflectance so I have checked the values when only\ndirect components were calculated by deleting -ab option. The values dropped\neventually but were higher than those of experiment yet. I'm checking if\nthere are problems with the lamp model.\n\n\nSung\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Sun, 15 Mar 2009 23:18:57 +0800\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005834.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005834", "created_by": "Minki_sung"}
