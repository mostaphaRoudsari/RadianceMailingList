As only radiance(W/m2sr) or irradiance(W/m2)\nvalues are being dealt with from modeling to results lamp color does not\nmake problem as Lars said and radiance value also has no problem as 0.032m\nis diameter, which Lars might already know. But the aging of lamps might\nneed to be checked, that means all the conditions of experiment should be\nchecked again as the experiment was done at the field, in case there is no\nproblem in RADIANCE calculation.\n\n\nSung\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Mon, 16 Mar 2009 16:30:30 +0800\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005838.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005838", "created_by": "Minki_sung"}
