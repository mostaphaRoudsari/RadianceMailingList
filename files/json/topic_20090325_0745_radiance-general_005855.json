The aim with\nmy simulations is to obtain the light transmittance of the glass blinds, and\nfor the entire system (blinds + window).\n\n\nThe blinds are modeled as polygons with the trans material. This means that\nthe blinds have no thickness in the model, but the reflectance and\ntransmittance values correspond to the information from the glass\nmanufacturer (r=0.31 and LT=0.65).\n\n\nMy approach is to obtain illuminance at three different locations:\n\n\n1) Before the blinds, externally;\n\n\n2) Between the blinds and the window, externally;\n\n\n3) After the window, internally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have therefore made a grid of points in these locations. The orientation\nof my measuring points is outwards, perpendicular to the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n\nMy results show that the illuminance level is increased at loaction 2\ncompared to location 1, which is a result I do not find reliable! I have\nplaced calculation points in the entire height of the window with a spacing\nof 0.01, to be sure not to have the result affected by high illuminance\nlevels locally. I would have expected higher illuminance levels locally due\nto the redirecting of light in the glass blinds, but I would not have\nexpected a higher average illuminance level.  My simulation approach is\ngiven below  \u2013 please let me know if you can find any mistakes.\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n/Anne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# /az 30,\n\n\n#Room.rad includes room geometry,\n\n\n#LamelSystem.rad includes geometry of the blinds,\n\n\n#Syst2.rad includes geometry of the window system for mkillum\n\n\n\n\noconv materials.mat CIE.sky Room.rad LamelSystem30.rad Syst2.rad >\n./profil30az0alt30/scene_window_prof30alt30az0.oct\n\n\ncat Syst2.rad | mkillum -ab 4\n./profil30az0alt30/scene_window_prof30alt30az0.oct\n>./profil30az0alt30/scene_window_prof30alt30az0_i.rad\n\n\noconv materials.mat Room.rad\n./profil30az0alt30/scene_window_prof30alt30az0_i.rad CIE.sky >\n./profil30az0alt30/window_ii.oct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#points in grid inside the room\ncat points.xyz | rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 3 -aa 0.1 -ad 1026 -as 256 -ar 512 -ds\n.3 -oov ./profil30az0alt30/window_2ii.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=179*($4*0.265+$5*0.670+$6*0.065)' >\n./profil30az0alt30/prof30al30az0_2.dat\n\n\n#points before and after the blind\ncat extpoints.xyz | rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 3 -aa 0.1 -ad 1026 -as 256 -ar 512\n-ds .3 -oov ./profil30az0alt30/window_2ii.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=179*($4*0.265+$5*0.670+$6*0.065)' >\n./profil30az0alt30/prof30al30az0_2ext.dat\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005855.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005855", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen"}
