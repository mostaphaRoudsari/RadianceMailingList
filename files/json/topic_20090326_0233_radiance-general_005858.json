For both approaches, when\nchecking the material under a glow sky, I get the reflectance 0.31 when\nlooking down on the glass and I get the transmittance 0.65 when looking in\nthe direction upwards.\n\n\nI have listed my discription of trans below - looking forward to hearing\nyour comments.\n\n\nBr\nAnne\n\n\n\n\nThe trans data is defined as:\n# a1, a2 og a3 = 1, due to the color of the glass is included in the\ntransmittance end reflectance given by the manufacturer\n# a4 = 0,31\n# a5 = 0\n# a6 = trans, determined from t_s=a6*a7(1-a4), where t_s is 0.65 and a7=1\n# a7 = 1\n\n\nvoid trans lamel_trans\n0\n0\n7  1 1 1 0.31 0 0.942028986 1\n\n\nI have also tried to define my trans material according to the description\nin http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html.\n#Spec=Light reflectance = 0.31\n#The color of the glass is determined from:\n#Absorptance=(1-spec)(1-color) -> 0.04 = (1-0.31)(1-color), from where the\ncolor is found to be 0.94\n#Transmittance = (1-spec) *color* trans, transmittance is 0.65 and trans can\nthen be found to be 1\n#Rough is set to 0, as the material is glass\n#Tr-spec is set to 1, as the glass is a clear glass material\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid trans lamel_transrayfront\n0\n0\n7  0.94 0.94 0.94 0.31 0 1 1\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005858.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005858", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen"}
