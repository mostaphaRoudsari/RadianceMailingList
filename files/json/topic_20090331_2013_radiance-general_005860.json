Obviously it is not printed, even if multiple orders go in, as I \nread about others who also ordered during these last months.\n\n\nIs there any possibility that the book will be printed again in the \nfuture? If not, has it been considered to provide it as a digital copy, \nlike in ps or pdf format? I guess that even the smallest amount to be \ncharged for download would result in better monetary benefit for the \nauthors then a printed edition, which is listed at a higher price, but \nnot sold because noone is printing it. Right now, the information \ncollected in the book is simply lost for anyone starting to work with \nRadiance, only libraries that purchased a copy years ago have still some \nof the books available.\n\n\nI feel that it is a pity to have this book, that is refered to in every \nsecond mail on the list, and probably the only source of information \ncovering really more or less any aspect of Radiance, is currently \ndisappearing from the library shelves and cannot be replaced, and of \ncourse will prevent radiance from playing a role in new programmes that \ncannot use it if no documentation is available.\n\n\nCU Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-March/005860.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005860", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
