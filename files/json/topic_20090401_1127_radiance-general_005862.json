Unfortunately, the illuminance\nvalues calculated with Radiance are different from measured values,\nespecially when the sensor is near the lamp or  the incident angles are high\n(K~O).\n\n\nLink image <http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test.gif>\n\n\nWhat can be supposed as the cause of the discrepancy?\n\n\nrtrace command was as follow.\ncat pts.pts | rtrace -I -oov -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2 -ds 0.02 test.oct\n> test.dat\n\n\nand all the walls, floor and ceiling was covered with non-glossy black\npaper.
