This is\nunder a number of aspect quite convenient because being an architect,\nall of the other software I use is pc-based and I am totally unnfamiliar\nwith the linux os. I hope you can help me bearing in mind my type of use\nof the software.\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n\nI understand radiance calculates irradiance and then uses a standard\nconversion factor Kr=179 lumens/watt. Hence it should be possible to use\nit for solar irradiation calculation as well as for light analysis.\nMy question is, how can I display directly watts/m2 instead of lux?\n\n\nAs well, in order to perform irradiation analysis a sky generated\nfollowing the perez-all weather model would be more accurate than just\nusing the standardCIE skies supported by gensky. I understand there is\nan application called gendaylit that does exectly this. From where can I\ndownload a windows version? \n\n\nThanks for your help,\n\n\nGiovanni Betti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005880.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005880", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti"}
