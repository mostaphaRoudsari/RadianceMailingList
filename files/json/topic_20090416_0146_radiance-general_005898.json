I am aware of several models for creating color gradients, but \nI could not find anything that has been applied to Radiance. Of course I \nam aware of Mark Stock's skycolor.cal, but that one takes known colors \nas an input. Does anyone else have information on the topic, how to set \nextend radiance brightness distribution by color models for the sky dome?\n\n\nThanks!!! Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005898.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005898", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
