Am I correct in thinking that although this calculation may not\ngreatly effect the result, for maximum accuracy when spectral rendering we\nshould render only one waveband at a time (R=B=G) and do it 81 rather than\n27 times?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlen Harding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlen Harding\n\n\nBradford School of Optometry and Vision Sciences\n\n\nUniversity of Bradford \n\n\nBD7 1DP\n\n\nTel: 07969 797391\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005918.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005918", "created_by": "G_HARDING"}
