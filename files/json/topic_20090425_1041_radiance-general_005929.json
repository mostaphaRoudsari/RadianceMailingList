Some of the interesting features of VIPS are that concurrency comes\nfree, it reads / writes radiance HDR files natively, and operates\ntile-based, such that unreasonably large image are processed\nefficiently. Given the complete API, its an incredibly effective way\nof processing HDR data.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005929.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005929", "created_by": "jelle_feringa"}
