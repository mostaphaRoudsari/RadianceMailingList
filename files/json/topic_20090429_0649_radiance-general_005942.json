With the objective in daylight calculations and daylight efficiency\nof materials I try to simulate, so accurate as possible, a doble glazing\nfacade with the next composition:\n\n\n9mm laminated glass with spectrally selective interlayer -- 16mm air --\n4mm float glass \n\n\nAll the papers I've read describe the glass geometry as polygon as follows:\n\n\nmod polygon id\n0\n0\n3n    x1    y1    z1\n    x2    y2    z2\n    ...\n    xn    yn    zn\n\n\n In my case, with such a glass system, would be this geometry\ndescription of the glass right and accurate? or should I define the\nradiance geometry like the contructed geometry?\n\n\n\n\n2-. The second question is about the material description.\nI have measured the transmittance of this doble glazing material sample\nwith a Spectrometer and an accessory for external measurements and\ncomputed its transmissivity.\nThe complete definition of the material that I get is as follows:\n\n\nmod glass id\n0\n0\n3 rtn gtn btn\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand I have exported in Radiance format from the software\nOptics5 a similar glass, also with sun protection interlayer, and the\nmaterial description is much complexer. It is as follows:\n\n\nvoid  glass       sunstop-t-silver-20_glass\n0\n0\n3     0,205     0,222     0,239\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    sunstop-t-silver-20_front\n10\n      0,325     0,281     0,197\n      0,188     0,203     0,219\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nvoid  BRTDfunc    sunstop-t-silver-20_back\n10\n      0,259     0,289     0,307\n      0,188     0,203     0,219\n      0 0 0\n      .\n0\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nMy question is if the description I did is complete and will give an\naccurate calculation.\nIn case it is not, how can I get the hole description with the BRTD\ninformation if I just have the glass sample and the Spektrometer to\nstart and this glass is not in the IGDB?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\nMarina\n\n\n\n\nDipl. -Ing.
