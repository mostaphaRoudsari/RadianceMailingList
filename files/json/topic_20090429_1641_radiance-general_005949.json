Distressingly, it turns out that some of the files are  \neither damaged or in now-unreadable formats.  I cannot untar the  \nPostScript version of the paper at <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg94.1/paper.tar.Z \n >--I'm not sure if this is a format problem or a damaged file.  And,  \nit turns out, figure 12, <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg94.1/fig12.gif \n > has also become unreadable.\n\n\nAnyone know who maintains the site at this time?  I have copied the  \nwebmaster link on this e-mail, as well, but I wonder if anyone is  \nactually reading that mailbox.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-April/005949.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005949", "created_by": "R_Fritz"}
