My understanding is that I will need a CCD\ncamera, a wide-angle/fisheye lense and a luminance meter to calibrate\nthe camera. Could anybody recommend any specific products that I should\nbuy? Has anybody compiled Photosphere under Windows (sorry GregJ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing. \n\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\n\nGund Hall 331b, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu> \n\n\nDaylighting Design: Rules of Thumb\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDay\nlightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf> , Simulation\n<http://www.daysim.com/> , Executive Education\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01683>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005982.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005982", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
