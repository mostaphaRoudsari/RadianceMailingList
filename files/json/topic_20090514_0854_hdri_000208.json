I'm not sure where that project stands, to be honest.  I  \nknow it is possible to compile the command-line tool hdrgen under  \nWindows with some effort, but it hasn't been done for many a year.\n\n\nThe Canon 5D camera with Sigma fisheye is a good choice, and Sigma  \nhas a 180-degree fisheye that works on APS sensors now as well, so  \nyou could get a Nikon D90 (or whatever) and use that as a lower-cost  \nalternative.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-May/000208.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000208", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
