The ideal EOS model, Canon 5D is quite expensive, so we look for\nother (much) low-cost models, such as Canon EOS450D or Canon EOS40D.\n\n\nAnyone has any idea does they 're matched for Photosphere?\n\n\nI asked Canon supplier bringing the cameras soon for testing with HDRcapOSX\nsoftware (developed by Greg Ward and re-written by Denis Fan). Unfortunately,\nwe do not have yet an updated Mac OSX 10.4 to run this software, we cannot yet\ntest with the inexpensive EOS models. If I test it and have any result, I will\nkeep you list on posted.\n\n\nCheers,\nApiparn\n\n\nQuoting \"hdri-request at radiance-online.org\" <hdri-request at radiance-online.org>:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-May/000211.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000211", "created_by": "Apiparn_Borisuit"}
