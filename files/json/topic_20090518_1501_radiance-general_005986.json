I typically use IES Virtual Environment as the\ninterface for Radiance, and I find I like it a fair amount, in terms of\nease-of-use.  Since this is where I started using Radiance, I'm\nwondering if anyone has any insights into what IES Virtual Environment\ncan/cannot do when compared to scripting from scratch.  Anyone offering\ninsight here would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChien Si Harriman, LEED AP\n\n\nSenior Building Performance Engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG U T T M A N N & B L A E V O E T |  C o n s u l t i n g  E n g i n e e\nr s\n\n\n2351 Powell Street | San Francisco, CA 94133 \n\n\nCommitted to the 2030 Challenge <http://architecture2030.org/> \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect  415.655.4005 | Main  415.655.4000 | Fax  415.655.4001\nEmail charriman at gb-eng.com | www.gb-eng.com\n\n\n\n\nSan Francisco |  Sacramento |  Santa Rosa\nCertified Green Business, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Santa Rosa |\n2007 Sacramento Sustainable Business of the Year Award Recipient\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/005986.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_005986", "created_by": "Chien_Si_Harriman"}
