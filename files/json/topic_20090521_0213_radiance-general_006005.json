I calculated it by hands\naccording to the rules and methods from Tutorial. I found it is different\nfrom the result of Daysim.\n\n\n2, User Behaviour,   \"Active\" means \"A user who operates the electric\nlighting in relation to ambient daylight conditions\"  I donot understand\nwhat does \"the ambient daylight conditions\" mean here?  For blinds, If there\nis no blinds or other shading devices in my building, how can i set this for\nblinds?\n\n\n3, Lighting and Shading control system.  For blinds control, I really donot\nknow what is the difference between set in \"User Behaviour - blinds use\" and\n\"Lighting and Shading control system - blinds control\" ?  Likewise, if there\nis no blinds how can i set it?  For lighting control, i tried the frist\nthree types, which are \"Manual on/off switch near the door\",  \" Switch off\noccupancy sensor\", and \"switch on/off occupancy sensor\"  i didnot find any\ndifference of the results between the three.\n\n\n4 in my building the electric lighting is only used when the daylight does\nnot meet the 300 lux requirement. so who can i select the lighting control\ntype?  is the \" Photosensor controlled dimming system? apropriate for my\nsituation?\n\n\n5 what is the function of \"work plan sensor\"\n\n\ni am new to Daysim so i have many questions  Hope you can help!  Thank you\nvery much!\n\n\nBest Regards!\n\n\nvictor\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-May/006005.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006005", "created_by": "Victor_Li"}
