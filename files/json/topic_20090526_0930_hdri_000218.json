You need to make sure that you send from the same  \naccount you receive the list on, otherwise your e-mail gets  \nquarantined until the list manager (me) has a chance to look at it.   \nAs there's been a sudden surge in spam on the list, I have been  \nputting off looking at blocked messages, and didn't notice these were  \nin the queue.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-May/000218.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000218", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
