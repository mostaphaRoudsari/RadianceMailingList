Not interested at this point in the rendering functions. Very interested in using HDR photography for luminance measurements. Would appreciate any references covering these topics. Unix and Matlab naive, although I suppose I could learn!\n\n\nI have reviewed several articles including Inanici & Galvin 2004 and Beltran and Mogo 2005.\n\n\nPS There is an useful program, ImageJ, developed at the National Institutes of Health that allows for luminance calibration of pixel values and arbitary selection of image areas for computation of average luminance and other functions. I have used this successfully for contrast measurements of scene objects; however it is limited to LDR images. It is a free download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenneth Ziedman, Ph.
