Ecotect has a button that creates the batch process in a semi automated way, but you can not input the -B and -R parameters. I'll be happy to do it with command line scripting but I am not sure from where to start (the only thing I've managed to do so far in the command line was to use pcomb... not much I guess...).\nCan you give me some help on that?\n\n\nThanks a lot for your time,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006051.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006051", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti"}
