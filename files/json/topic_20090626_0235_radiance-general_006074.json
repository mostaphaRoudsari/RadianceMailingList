Is there some \nother, easier way available to modify the \"metadata\"?\n\n\nThank you, cheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-June/006074.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006074", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
