I have access to a fairly new Mac quad core box with the icc compiler and was wondering if anyone has used it. I hear some significant increases can be made, but I also hear the icc user's guide is 250 pages long. =)  Wondering if anyone on the list has tried it out. Didn't see any listings on Mark Stock's benchmark page.\n\n\nRobert Guglielmetti  IES, LEED AP\nBuilding Energy Efficiency Engineer\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n1617 Cole Blvd, MS-5202\nGolden, CO 80401\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n303.275.4319\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-June/000991.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000991", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
