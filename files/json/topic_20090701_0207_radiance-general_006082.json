Select an arbitrary zenith radiance, Z (eg. 100 W/m2/sr).\"\n\n\nWhat is the meaning of arbitrary here? The value is used later by the \ncal-file creating the distribution. I was hoping to create a \ndistribution from the coefficients and the horizontal illuminance, but I \ndo not know where to get data on zenith luminance.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006082.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006082", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
