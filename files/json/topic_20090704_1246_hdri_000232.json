If we know the each camera ISO value, shutter Speed and f-stop value and the HDR pixel value of the images produced by them then what is the relationship between them with respect to captured outdoor scene radiance value or how one can compare the radiance value captured by both camera. I will appreciate if one can give some mathematical relationship or formula. \n\n\nBest Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-July/000232.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000232", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal"}
