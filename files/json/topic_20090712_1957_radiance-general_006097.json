Workshop details and a call for presentations can now be\nfound under http://projects.gsd.harvard.edu/radiance2009/. The\nInternational Radiance Workshops are annual, two-day gatherings of\nRadiance developers and users. The workshops consist of a series of\npresentations that in the past included case studies on the use of\nRadiance in lighting and/or daylighting projects, recent advances in\nmodeling glare and energy savings from lighting controls as well as the\nuse of Radiance in Art and Design. Presentations from previous workshops\ncan be downloaded from http://www.radiance-online.org/.  We are planning\nto split the workshop into an 'application day' (Thursday) and a\n'technical day' (Friday). There will also be a full day pre-workshop\ncourse on 'HDR Photography and Glare Analysis' given by Professor\nMehlika Inanici (University of Washington) and Dr. Jan Wienold\n(Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems) on Wednesday, October 21\n, also at the GSD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in presenting at the workshop please send us a\nworking title and a brief abstract to reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu and\nklagios at gsd.harvard.edu. Same as in the past we will be making all\npresentations freely available after the workshop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking forward to receiving your abstracts and welcoming you to\nCambridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart and Kera Lagios\n\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\n\nGund Hall, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006097.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006097", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
