So I try to \nuse it, and since today mkpmap drives me crazy with \"consistency - \nunexpected object call for polygon ...\"-messages.\n\n\nI have a rather complex model here, and this may be some memory problem. \nI have tried commenting out the geometry given in the error message, but \nthat led me only to the next error message with some other surface. If I \nreduce the number of photons to be distributed to a very low value (such \nas 10) I get along with it, but that renders the whole idea useless.\n\n\nAre there any known memory problems or any kind of overflows in the pmap \ncode?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006101.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006101", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
