You should recompile with the -g option and crash it again.\n\n\nWell, this is the ONE time that I had not compiled myself, so I will see\nwhether I can reproduce this.\n\n\n> Just as a guess, you wouldn't happen to have any strings longer than 127\n> characters in your material descriptions, would you?\n\n\nNo, but possibly in file names included by xform, in mesh objects and\nsuch. Errrrr does your question mean that there is no overflow\nprotection for modifier names that exceed the maximum string length?\n\n\nCurrently downloading the latest snapshot for a -g build ;-)\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2009-July/000994.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_000994", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
