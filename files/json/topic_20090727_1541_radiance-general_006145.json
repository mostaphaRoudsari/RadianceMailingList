I have a box with a\nsquare hole, 1/3 x 1/3 the width of the box, to allow sunlight into my room.\n\n\nI am using the following gensky to attempt to only light the room using\nsunlight.\n!gensky 6 21 12:00EST -a 40.77 -o 73.967 -g 0.0 +s\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 0 0 0 0\n\n\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nThis picture was rendered using -ab 1\nhttp://i639.photobucket.com/albums/uu111/radiancebox/radiance.jpg\nYou'll note on this image, that there is a strange shadow on the ceiling. \nI am unable to figure out why.\n\n\nIf I instead place a light in the room, also 1/3x 1/3 the size of the\nbox, I do not have this problem. This picture is taken from the \"back\" of \nthe box, with the light on the ceiling instead of the floor. There is no\ngensky used on this picture.\n\n\nhttp://i639.photobucket.com/albums/uu111/radiancebox/Light.jpgThis picture was rendered using -ab 0\n\n\nChanging the camera angle doesn't effect the shadow seen in the first\npicture. I have determined that the shape of the window is not causing\nthe shadow, instead the highlight on the floor causes the shadow on the\nceiling.\n\n\nIf anyone can help clear this up for me, I would appreciate it.\n\n\n--John\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-July/006145.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006145", "created_by": "John_Schwartz"}
