This\nmeans that i can not use the poolcoords.cal formula as it is and i need to\nmake some necessary changes. The part of formula i don't understand, but i\nthink can not work as it is, is the following:\n\n\n\"floor_bin = floor(FloorXres*(Px - FloorOrigX)/FloorWidth) +\nfloor(FloorYres*(1 - (Py - FloorOrigY)/FloorLength))*FloorXres;\"\n\n\nIn this formula 3 more parameters must be added in my opinion: FloorOrigZ,\nFloorZres, FloorDepth.\n\n\nThe role of the this formula is to calculate how many points (bins) should\nbe used for calculating how much energy falls on them,\n\n\nIf someone can explain how the specific formula works [ floor(...) , Px, Py\n], or give me directly a new one with the parameters of depth in it, I\nwhould be grateful.\n\n\nThank you in advance for your time\n\n\nSotiris Papantoniou\nWelsh School of Architecture\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-August/006169.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006169", "created_by": "\u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2_\u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5"}
