You can freely download it from:\n\n\nhttp://www.coolhall.com/homepage/bracket/bracket.html\n\n\nThere is a possibility that the application might not be working on Snow\nLeopard -- since I don't have a new enough mac to install that beauty I\ncould not try it myself. I've personally verified it to be working on\nXP/Vista/Win7 for Windows, Tiger and Leopard for Mac, and Ubuntu 9.04 and\nSuse 11.0 for Linux.\n\n\nI'm eager to hear your comments. Please contact me for any bug reports,\nfeature requests, or any thoughts and ideas.\n\n\nBest,\nOguz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-September/000239.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000239", "created_by": "Oguz_Akyuz"}
