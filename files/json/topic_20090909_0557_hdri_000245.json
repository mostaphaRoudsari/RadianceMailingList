In fact, quite often the same image\nhas values both above and below \n\n\nThere's indeed considerable contrast in my scenes, in some cases\ncomposed of dark corridors and rooflights. Some of them also have direct\nsunlight getting into the spaces. \n\n\nHowever, I'm surprised for not being able to get a single image within\nthose limits from a range of 15 exposures. \n\n\nI used a Cannon EOS 20D and my White Balance was set to Daylight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have the same experience of trying to make HDR images of\n(shall I call it) \"extremely\" daylit spaces and coming to the same\nproblem?\n\n\nIs there a range of luminances that would deliver \n\n\nDoes this mean that these images are not good to be converted to HDR? \n\n\nAlso, would like to know if the above mentioned limits are general\nthresholds or just applicable to HDR images generated using hdrgen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nRaquel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-September/000245.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000245", "created_by": "Raquel_Viula"}
