I had put \n\"metal halide\" into the [LAMP]-line of the ies, in the hope that \nradiance would match the HMI-type then.\n\n\nNow I am wondering how to interpret the results. In general, I would \nassume the results of a Radiance simulation to be in W/m2, and the \nconversion to happen at the beginning, so in the lamp.tab-look-up by \nies2rad in my case. So am I correct using the results without further \nconversion, and having -m 1 -l W/m2 as falsecolor's parameters?\n\n\nThank you, cheers\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006239.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006239", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
