When I execute this file (source xxx.cal) All the output files have a (?) added to the file type (e.g. grid.xyz? instead of grid.xyz). Furthermore I cannot use \\ as line separation in my file anymore.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with these types of errors?\n\n\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Find din nye laptop p\u00e5 kelkoo.dk.
