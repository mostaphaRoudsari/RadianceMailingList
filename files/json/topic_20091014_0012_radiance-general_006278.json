Except from one orientation the results look valid. But the illuminination entering from the north facing window is over estimated. I get a DF above 10 up til 15 m from the facade. It looks like north wall is not taken into account in the calculation. There are no problems when I excluce the north window.\n\n\nHere is data extrated from my geometry file:\n\n\n# north wall\nwhite_paint polygon t_2_0\n0\n0\n36\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 115.981526\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 0.000000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 115.981526\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 28.000000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.000000\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 28.000000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.000000\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 12.800000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17.292543\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 12.800000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.528300\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 18.200000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 115.477026\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 18.200000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 115.477026\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 19.850000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.528300\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 19.850000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.528300\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 18.200000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17.292543\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 12.800000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17.292543\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 0.000000\n\n\n# North window\nLT70 t_33_0\n0\n0\n12\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 115.477026\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 19.850000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.528300\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 19.850000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.528300\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 18.200000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 115.477026\u00a0 75.891011\u00a0 18.200000\n\n\nI have debugged the geometry and calculation procedure and found no mismatch. Have anybody experienced the same illumination mismatch before? \n\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n/Per\n\n\n\n\n      Tr\u00e6nger du til at se det store billede?
