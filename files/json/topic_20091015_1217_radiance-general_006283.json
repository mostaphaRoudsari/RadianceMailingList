I was thinking\nthat I could build a radiance model of panelite and use rtconrib to generate\na BSDF of sorts.  Is this a terrible idea?\n\n\nChallenge 2 \u00ad Writing a rtcontrib expression to separate contributions\naccording to exiting direction from the portal.  Can I use directions from\ntreganza.cal?  Is there some reason that this isn\u00b9t a good idea?  Klems\ndirections has been mentioned.  I have no knowledge of klems directions.  Is\nthat a better alternative?\n\n\nAnd I guess the overall questions:  Are there more challenges I have yet to\ndiscover?  Is anyone who has done this willing to share experiences?  Would\nI be better off creating a model with thousands of cylinders between glass\npanes and using rtcontrib + brute force?  Is there an even better method\nthat I haven\u00b9t discovered trolling through archives?\n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006283.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006283", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
