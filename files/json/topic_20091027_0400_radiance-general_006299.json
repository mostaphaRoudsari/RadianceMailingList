The sunlight is passing to the room through glazed partitions both from an 'atrium' and from the facade. \n\n\nThis is the first time I am doing this types of studies. I know sunlight passing between zones in ESP-r/Radiance is treated as a diffuse source. How is this treated in Radiance?\n\n\nI am in particular interested in hearing if there is any special parameters that I have to include when using rtrace, rcalc and rpict for this type of studies. \n\n\nAny input is appreciated :)\n\n\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nPer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Tr\u00e6nger du til at se det store billede?
