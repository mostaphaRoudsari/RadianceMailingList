A summary of my first foray into  \nthe use of illums on a project, this page dates back to 2003 (right  \nbefore meeting many of you at that year's workshop in Berkeley, in  \nfact). I've been told it's helpful, so I thought I'd get it back  \nonline with all my other crap. Here's the link, which begs to be cut &  \npasted:\n\n\nhttp://www.rumblestrip.org/interests/light/using-the-illum-material-for-smoother-renderings-in-radiance/\n\n\nI hope to add more stuff soon, but right now my dog & I are gonna go  \nplay in the snow!\n\n\n- Rob Guglielmetti\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006303.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006303", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
