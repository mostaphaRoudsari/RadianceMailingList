I am\ntrying to model a series of openings in a screen using antimatter and I\nam getting really confused.\nThe screen is modelled as a single surface intersected by a number of\ncubes. As in the antimatter description I read:\n\"The viewpoint must be outside all volumes concerned for a correct\nrendering.\" I assume that means that the camera should not be inside one\nof the cubes and that (I guess) the cube normals should point outward. \nDone that, I am able to see through the cubes but I do not see the\npattern of light coming through the antimatter holes, I just have a big\nsolid shadow...\n\n\nIs that how it is supposed to behave? Does anybody have any clue about\nwhat I am doing wrong?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nBest,\n\n\nGiovanni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-October/006306.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006306", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti"}
