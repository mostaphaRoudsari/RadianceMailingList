I\nwould like to avoid having to define discrete sensor points as this would\neither require an \"infinite\" number of such points or lead to too large gaps\nin the information, IMO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been unable to find any reference to such a possibility. If anybody\nhere has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks and best regards\n\n\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYuanda-Europe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006346.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006346", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler"}
