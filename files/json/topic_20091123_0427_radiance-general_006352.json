Usually, when you define an IBL sky it's better to use a source object instead of a sphere (just like when you define a normal sky with gensky). That is probably also why adding the sun source is not making any difference, if you are measuring from inside the sphere (the source is outside).\nYou can try:\nenv_glow source sphereenv\n0\n0\n4 0 1 0 180   <--- (replace with appropriate vector for the chrome ball orientation, and angle covered)\nDoes this make sense, or am I missing something?\nRegards,\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006352.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006352", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres"}
