First I tried \nCarsten's eulum2ies, but it crashes - I guess due to the hight \nresolution in 1 degree steps for my files. Then I found something quite \ninteresting:\n\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/qlumedit/\n\n\nIt is a QT-based tool, loading eulumdat files, processing the content so \nthat it can be displayed and edited in tables, creates some plot, and - \nconverts to IES!\n\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to compile the QT3-sources, my knowledge on \nQT is limited. But at least the Windows-binary runs without any problems \nunder Wine here.\n\n\nSo maybe someone finds this useful, cheers,\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006356.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006356", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
