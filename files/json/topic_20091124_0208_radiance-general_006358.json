To me it seems strange to get 360 degree information only from one image, but I've never used a chrome sphere for ibl. Anyway, it seems strange that the image is white (did you change the exposure) You can check the .cal file to find why is it giving a division by zero, or you can post it to the list?\n\n\nAlso, note that mksource ignores any local geometry (i.e. it considers only source objects), which makes sense because otherwise you'd have to define the viewpoint origin. That's why it was ignoring the sphere, so you should have no problems now.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nSantiago\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006358.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006358", "created_by": "Santiago_Torres"}
