That is, instead of using a clipping plane, is there a means to \"hide\" specific surfaces?  I need to pull off certain surfaces and look into the room, but the plan is sort of squiggley, and a simple cutting plane doesn't do a very good job.\n\n\nthank you,\n\n\ndave bosworth\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-November/006364.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006364", "created_by": "Dave_Bosworth"}
