Also, is the number in\n.obj or .rad file specified in cm? Attached please find the .obj file\nof the sphere.\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\nBei\n\n\n\n\nDaily quote:\n\n\n\"Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present. \"\n\n\n-Albert Camus\n\n\nBei Xiao, PhD\nPostdoctoral Scientist\nThe Smith-Kettlewell Eye Institute\n2318 Fillmore Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94115\n(415) 3452149\nflickr:www.flickr.com/photos/slowtempo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006370.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006370", "created_by": "Bei_Xiao"}
