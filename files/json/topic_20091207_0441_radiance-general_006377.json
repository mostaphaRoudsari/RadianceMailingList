So far I have used the \n'mirrorball closeup' format in HDRShop but found this to be the wrong \nmapping yielding incorrect lat-long mappings. I have now understood the \nentire geometrical issue and just need a piece of software to warp \nhemisphere images to lat-longs ... perhaps a plugin for HDRShop?\n\n\nA couple of years ago I raised this issue with the people who wrote \nHDRShop but they claimed the Sigma lens should be treated as mirror ball \ncloseup when re-mapping in HDRShop. I am now convinced this is not true \nafter having tested it  extensively.\n\n\nSincerely,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006377.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006377", "created_by": "Claus_B._Madsen"}
