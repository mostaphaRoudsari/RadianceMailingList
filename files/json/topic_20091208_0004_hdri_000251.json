I have taken high-res images\nof the sky  with the lens pointing straight up and wish to convert these \nimages to lat-long mapping (with 180 degree field-of-view this will give \nme data for the upper half of the 360x180 degree long-lat map)\n\n\nSo far I have used the 'mirrorball closeup' option in HDRShop when \nconverting, but I  have now made several experiments and measurements \nwhich show that interpreting the fish-eye-lens image as \"mirrorball \ncloseup\" is incorrect. In fact the fish-eye-lens image seems to be \nidentical to the hemispherical mapping used by RADIANCE when rendering \nwith the -vth option.\n\n\nI am searching for a piece of software which can convert from (cropped) \nfish-eye-lens image to mirrorball closeup (or directly to lat-long). \nPerhaps a plugin for HDRShop?\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-December/000251.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000251", "created_by": "Claus_B._Madsen"}
