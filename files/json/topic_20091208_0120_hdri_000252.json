The FEL imaging geometry does not conform \nto \"mirror ball closeup\" and the resulting lat-long mapping is \nincorrect. For example: when I take FEL images of the sky, and manually \nmeasure the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, the elevation \nmatches if I interpret the FEL image as a hemispherical mapping. If I \nconvert (using the mirror ball closeup option) the FEL image to lat long \nin HDRShop the elevation is not correct anymore (e.g, 7 degrees in \nlat-long map, 20 degrees in reality).\n\n\nI am searching for a program that can convert my FEL images (produced \nwith the Sigma 8mm FEL) correctly into lat-long format. Can anyone help?\n\n\nOr put more precisely: I wish to convert hemispherical images into \nlatitude-longitude format.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2009-December/000252.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000252", "created_by": "Claus_B._Madsen"}
