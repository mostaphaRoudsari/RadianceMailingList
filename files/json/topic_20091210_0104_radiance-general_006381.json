Thus,\na daylight factor of 5% on an internal surface means that it received only\n1/20th of the maximum available natural light.\n\n\nso we can calculate daylight factor by RADIANCE with a overcast sky. Then i\ncalculated the illuminance under overcast sky. I found the distribution of\nilluminance and skyfactor in the room is different. For example, in the room\nratio of minimum to average of daylight and illuminance are quite different.\nWould you tell me the reason?\n\n\nBest Regards!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006381.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006381", "created_by": "Victor_Li"}
