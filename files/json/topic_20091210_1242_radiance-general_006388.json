If I\ndo it the other way I think it omits the bsdf data.  Am I missing a trick?\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006388.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006388", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
