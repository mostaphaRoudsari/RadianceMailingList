It should work on all multicore Unix (Linux, Mac OS X) machines.   \nDownload the HEAD from www.radiance-online.org and give it a whirl.   \nGetting the -I option working was the real trick, so let me know of  \nany differences you spot in your results if you use it.\n\n\nThe only major caveat is that the -o*t* (trace tree) options won't  \nwork properly, as all the output will be randomly interleaved.  Not  \nmuch I can do about that, I'm afraid.\n\n\nPlease don't ask when -n will be added to rpict.  It won't.  I have  \nspent some time looking at it, and we're stuck with rpiece for the  \nforseeable future.  The good news is that rpiece works just fine on  \nmulticore machines.  It's only when you open it up to a network of  \nmachines that it starts to be troublesome, and a -n option in rpict  \nwouldn't help that situation, anyway.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006405.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006405", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
