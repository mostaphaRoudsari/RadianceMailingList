A usual, the notes advance at a leisurely pace, trying to make \none little mistake or discovery a time, rather than doing them all at once.\n\n\nI have put up some very early notes (really only just scribble with some \nimages) here:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/rtcontrib_lesson.html\nand would be grateful for any feedback.\n\n\nThis is what's there at the moment:\n\n\n- show that rpict is simply a convenient way of calling rtrace to \nproduce an image\n- show that rtcontrib is a souped-up version of rtrace (bear with me \nbefore banging your head against the wall over this one)\n- show how rtcontrib produces individual images based on light source \nmodifiers\n- show how this can be extended to different 'zones' using binning, e.g. \nfor daylight coefficients\n\n\nI have not looked at the mkillum-like functionality of rtcontrib yet \n(pseudo-forward-raytracer?), and the model you see in the images doesn't \neven have a window pane.\n\n\nAll images under a glow sky (not the ones with circular 11deg light \nsources) have an overcast distribution. Eventually, this should probably \nbe a simple glow without any distribution assigned to it, but I've used \na gensky material for now to be able to compare the absolute values of \nthe combined results which should match the rpict ones.\n\n\nThe big show stopper so far is that I don't get the absolute values \nright for a glow sky with Tregenza subdivisions. You will also see just \nhow weird the sky hemisphere looks in this simulation after the 145 \npatches have been combined.\n\n\nAny hints are very welcome.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-January/006471.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006471", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
