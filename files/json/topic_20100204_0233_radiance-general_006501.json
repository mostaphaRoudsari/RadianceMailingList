If I \nreproduce your steps until here, all I get is an oct-file called 5.oct. \nYou did not even run any simulation according to your description. I do \nnot know what the meaning is of \"and run again\".\n\n\nDo not take this as unfriendly, but if you expect people on this list to \nspend time thinking about your problem and helping out, the least you \ncould do is to take your time to describe the problem and the steps that \nled you there. By the way, after having the typo in the subject line for \nhow many posts, I corrected it. Please be a bit careful with what you \npost here. There are lots of quite busy professionals on this list, who \nwill always do their best to help out if they get asked in a proper way.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006501.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006501", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
