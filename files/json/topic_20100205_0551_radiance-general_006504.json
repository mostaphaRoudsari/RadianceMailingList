This is the 21st\nannual event in the series of very successful Eurographics Symposia on\nRendering and Eurographics Workshops on Rendering.\n\n\nThe local organizers are Karol Myszkowski and Elmar Eisemann and the\nprogram chairs are Jason Lawrence and Marc Stamminger.  Up-to-date\ninformation about the conference is available on the official EGSR\n2010 web site:\n\n\n      http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/egsr2010/\n\n\n\n\nConference Topics\n\n\n\n\nConference topics include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n- Global illumination\n- Reflectance, volumetric scattering and translucency\n- Representations of material appearance\n- Human perception and error measures\n- Rendering hardware and its application\n- Computational photography\n- Rendering dynamic/animated environments\n- Shadows and visibility\n- Monte Carlo techniques\n- Finite element techniques\n- Sampling, filtering, and anti-aliasing\n- Texture models, analysis, and synthesis\n- Non-photorealistic rendering\n- Image-based measurement and rendering\n- Sensing for graphics\n- Point-based rendering\n- Real-time rendering and real-time ray tracing\n- Systems and software architecture for rendering\n- Virtual/augmented reality and interactive systems\n- Audio/sound rendering\n\n\n\n\nThe proceedings of EGSR will be a special issue of the journal Computer\nGraphics Forum. Because of this there will be a brief second review\ncycle for any papers that require changes to be accepted; such papers\nwill only be accepted after the changes have been confirmed by the\nprogram committee.\n\n\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\n\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 p.m., US Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4).\n\n\nAbstract submission deadline: Friday, April 9\nPaper submission deadline: Tuesday, April 13\nAuthor notification: Friday, May 14\nRevisions due: Wednesday, May 26\nFinal PDF files due for printing: Friday, May 28\nSymposium: June 28 - 30\n\n\nThe EGSR review and publication process is very short, and to achieve\nthis quick turnaround all deadlines must be strictly observed. In\nparticular, final PDF files for printing must be finished on time.\n\n\n\n\nKeynote Speakers\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Drettakis, REVES/INRIA Sophia-Antipolis (FR)\nKari Pulli, Nokia Research (US)\n\n\n\n\nInternational Program Committee\n\n\n\n\nProgram Chairs: Jason Lawrence (US) and Marc Stamminger (DE)\n\n\nInternational Program Committee:\n\n\n   Aseem Agarwala (US)          Marcus Magnor (DE)\n   Timo Aila (FI)               Bill Mark (US)\n   Thomas Annen (US)            Diego Nehab (US)\n   Okan Arikan (US)             Sylvain Paris (US)\n   Philippe Bekaert (BE)        Pieter Peers (US)\n   Jiri Bittner (CZ)            Kari Pulli (US)\n   Volker Blanz (DE)            Eric Reinhard (UK)\n   Per Christensen (US)         Holly Rushmeier (US)\n   Yiorgos Chrysanthou (CY)     Szymon Rusinkiewicz (US)\n   Paolo Cignoni (IT)           Pedro Sander (HK)\n   Carsten Dachsbacher (DE)     Mateu Sbert (ES)\n   Oliver Deussen (DE)          Pete Shirley (US)\n   Craig Donner (US)            Peter-Pike Sloan (US)\n   Philip Dutre (BE)            Philipp Slusallek (DE)\n   Elmar Eisemann (FR)          Brian Smits (US)\n   Raanan Fattal (IL)           Laszlo Szirmay-Kalos (HU)\n   Vlastimil Havran (CZ)        Bruce Walter (US)\n   Wolfgang Heidrich (CA)       Rui Wang (US)\n   Nicolas Holzschuch (FR)      Greg Ward (CA)\n   Wojciech Jarosz (CH)         Tim Weyrich (UK)\n   Henrik Wann Jensen (US)      Alexander Wilkie (CZ)\n   Stefan Jeschke (AT)          Andrew Willmot (US)\n   Janne Kontkanen (US)         Chris Wyman (US)\n   Samuli Laine (FI)            Kun Zhou (CN)\n   Sylvain Lefebvre (FR)        Matthias Zwicker (CH)\n   Jaakko Lehtinen (US)\n\n\n\n\nLocal Organizing Chairs: Elmar Eisemann (DE) and Karol Myszkowski (DE)\n\n\n\n\nInstructions for Submission\n\n\n\n\nAll contributions submitted to the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering\n2010 must be original, unpublished work. Any work that has previously\nbeen published or simultaneously been submitted in substantially\nsimilar form to any other conference or journal will be\nrejected. Contributions must be written and presented in English.\n\n\nOnly electronic submissions will be accepted. Submitted manuscripts\nshould be formatted using the Eurographics publication style\nproceedings templates, and be anonymized for the double-blind\nreviewing process.\n\n\nPapers should be as long as their content requires, but not\nlonger. Papers with average length requirements are expected to be 8\nformatted pages long, including references and all figures; up to 10\npages will be allowed only where justified. During the review process,\neach paper's contribution will be judged in proportion to its length:\na solid contribution described clearly and succinctly is more likely\nto be accepted than the same result submitted in a longer paper.\n\n\nAll submissions must be made through the Eurographics Submission and\nReview Management system, using the following URL.\n\n\n  http://egmcp1.cgv.tugraz.at/SRM_SR2010\n\n\nThe submission deadlines will be strictly enforced.  The authors of\neach accepted paper need to complete and return the EG Copyright\nAssignment Form before the paper can be published.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006504.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006504", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
