I \nhave been trying to model this room with a film of translucent white \nplastic on the window, and am really really stuck and need help \nurgently, any advice would help a lot! \n\n\nFirstly,  I have a translucent white plastic material with a \nreflectivity value of 0.518 and Transmissivity value 0.046, how would \nyou do the parameters for this material? \n\n\nsecondly, I have a model set up, and I really need to get a working \nplane with lux values on it, how do you do this in either Control Panel \nor radiance itself? I have tried to use Ecotect, but it doesnt seem to \nbe able to model a translucent material very accurately. \n\n\nThank you for your time in advance, \nSasa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006520.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006520", "created_by": "Sasa_Cemesova"}
