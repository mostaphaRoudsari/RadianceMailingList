As an initial test, I\nused gensky while providing explicitly the direct normal radiation and\ndiffuse horizontal radiation from the weather file.\nThere was no actual geometry in the scene, just the sun, sky, skyglow,\netc. I then tested the illuminance with rtrace -I for a sensor\ndirected in the +Z direction as well as looking directly at the sun\nwhere ever it was at that time.\n\n\nWhat I found was that at the end of the day, the sensor point directly\nfacing the sun spikes dramatically. I've tried it with two different\nweather files with similar results. Also, other sensor points pointed\nin the general direction of the sunset spike correspondingly.\n\n\nHere are links to two images, each showing the hourly averages for the\nmonth of June:\n\n\nAbu Dhabi: http://i49.tinypic.com/cnuhw.png\nNew York: http://i47.tinypic.com/20gz991.png\n\n\nDoes anybody have any insight to what may be causing this?\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\n--Dave\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-February/006566.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006566", "created_by": "David_Smith"}
