No need for a screen, k/b, wireless  \nnetwork or any intervention by the user (other than plugging it in and  \nswitching it on).\n\n\nDescribed on the HDRcapOSX page:\n\n\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:hdrcaposx\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-March/000255.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000255", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
