(It's not so much that we're asking for everyone to vote  \ntheir favorite.)  If you do know of a significant conflict with either  \nset of dates, please write to the list for further discussion.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006603.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006603", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
