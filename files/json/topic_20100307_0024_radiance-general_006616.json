The cheapest price for \"Rendering with \nRadiance\" at amazon.com as of today is 1000$ for a used copy. Booksurge \ngives 0 results on a search. I wonder whether making the book available \nas a paid pdf would not be better then not having it at all. This is a \nbig problem for application of the software, as anyone using it gets \npointed to this book as a reference, but no one could buy it. I have \nbeen trying to buy a copy for an institute here for one year without any \nsuccess. Besides preventing potential users from starting with Radiance, \nthis increases the amount of beginners questions, that had been answered \nin the book.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006616.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006616", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
