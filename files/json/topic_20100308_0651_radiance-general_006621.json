Assume the remote workstation is called remote\n2. The remote username is testuser\n3. The master usernmae is masteruser\n4. I have commented out the localuser host as this works\n5. ssh has been set up using RSA keys pairings\n   Setup ssh key pairs:\n   On the host system: ssh-keygen -t rsa (use enter for no passhrase)\n   ssh-copy-id -i /home/masteruser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub testuser at remote\n6. Samba mount:\n   ssh testuser at remote\n   smbmount //master/masteruser ~/test -o username=masteruser\n\n\nOn the host system I start the process with:\nranimate test.ran >& animation_process_network/anim.err\n\n\nThe anim.err file shows:\nProcess started on remote\nremote: Error output from: rpict @animation_process_network/render.opt -vp -505.575 812.796 321.761 -vd 0.608355 -0.458502 -0.436495 -vu 0.396724 -0.283029 0.873215 -vh 56.547 -vv 41.1546 -w0 -o animation_process_network/frame%03d.unf -x 3708 -y 1644 -S 1 octrees/test.oct < animation_process_network/anim.vf\nbash: line 0: cd: ~masteruser: No such file or directory\nbash: animation_process_network/anim.vf: No such file or directory\nranimate: error rendering frames 1 through 3\n\n\n1. What is confusing is where does the 'masteruser' come from (it is the username on the master workstation) when processing on the remote workstation the username is testuser!\n2. Is the 'local directory' parameter on the host line (parameter 3) suppose to point to the same folder as the test.ran file is located (ie the same location as in the localhost line). Obviously on the remote workstation this folder 'smbmount' at some point x in the local filesystem.\n3. The rpict command when run on the remote workstation works quite happily in the same folder.\n\n\nI am using Linux - specifically Kubuntu 9.10 and radiance-3R9+20090811-1 (latest version)\n\n\nRegards \nTerrance Mc Minn\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006621.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006621", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn"}
