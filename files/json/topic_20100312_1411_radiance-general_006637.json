I don't have it fully working yet, but I do have useful \nradiance geometry exports that i can use with our existing radiance \n(linux) setup. Now I just need to get results back into SketchUp. I see \nthat su2rad can import \"numeric results,\" but what format are these \nsupposed to be? I'm not running radiance from sketchup yet, but I ought \nto be able to reformat the results I do have to view in SketchUp (if \nit's plain text). Can anyone out there tell me what file type/format I \nneed to be using, and maybe send a sample file so I can see the \ncontents? Or do I really need to get the windows-based radiance side of \nthings up and running? I may be trying to put a square peg into a round \nhole...\n\n\nThanks,\nCmamer\n\n\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth at transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth at transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in \nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006637.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006637", "created_by": "Cramer_Silkworth"}
