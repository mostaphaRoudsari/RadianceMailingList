(Be sure to use static linking if possible.)\n\n\nThe major changes in this version are listed below, with a complete  \nlist to be found at:\n\n\n\thttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/ReleaseNotes.html\n\n\nI will get around to updating the official release on www.radiance-online.org \n  a little later.  As always, the HEAD release with the most recent  \nchanges and bug fixes will post there.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Greg\n\n\n\n\nMajor updates in 4.0\n\n\n\n\nAdded -n option to rvu to provide parallel rendering.\n\n\n****** COMPATIBILITY CHANGE ********\nChanged \".pic\" extension to \".hdr\" in all sources and documentation\nto improve interoperability with other software, since this has become\nthe de facto extension for Radiance RGBE and XYZE pictures.\n\n\nAdded -N option to objview to support multiprocessing.\n\n\nImproved sampling of circular sources (source, sphere, ring types) with\nquite a bit of help from David Geisler-Moroder.\n\n\nAdded \"rpict\" and \"rvu\" variables to rad, and made these as well as\nthe \"oconv\", \"mkillum\" and \"pfilt\" variables accept an alternate\ncommand path in each case.  Change suggested by Lars Grobe based\non similar Radzilla (radz) facility by Carsten Bauer.\n\n\nAdded gendaylit to distribution (finally).\n\n\nCreated genklemsamp(1) utility to generate samples suitable for\nBSDF-based annual calculations.  This is the first Perl script to\nbe added to Radiance.  Hopefully, others will follow.\n\n\nAdded klems_int.cal file to compute Klems bins for windows.\n\n\nCreated genskyvec  utility to sample a particular sky and\nevaluate average radiance over the standard Tregenza sky patches.\n\n\nCreated dctimestep program to compute a set of sensor values or\na combined image for a particular time using the daylight\ncoefficient method.\n\n\nAdded -n option to rtrace for executing on multiple cores.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006645.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006645", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
