I am looking for a way to merge\nthem and to be able to adjust their intensity. I tried to load them into\nPhotoshop, but I am not sure how to overlay (lighten?) them, and the\nPhotoshop layers are not working. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there programs where I can easily do that (The one I know  is\nVivaldi from Zumtobel - is that any good?)? If I can do this in\nPhotoshop, how can I put the images onto different layers to be able to\nmix them? How can I produce a little animation of fading in and out of\ntwo images?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnselm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006655.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006655", "created_by": "Anselm_von_Held"}
