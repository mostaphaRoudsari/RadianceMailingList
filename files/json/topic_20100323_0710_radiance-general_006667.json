I\u00b4m using ecotect from wicht I export\nto daysim and when it\u00b4s finish I import the results into ecotect again.\nI receiveng 0% DA near a window and 100% inside a close space with no\nwindows. This seems to happen only when I create a grid inside a space with\na lot of internal subdivisions  like walls and pillars. Also seems to happen\nonly when the grid covers multiple orientations. When is only one (north,\nsouth, etc) this does\u00b4n happen either.\nDoes anyone else experience this using daysim true ecotect????\nAnyone knows the problem?\n\n\n\n\nALEJANDRO CASTRO HERNANDEZ\nArchitect | Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile\nSantiago, Chile\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006667.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006667", "created_by": "Alejandro_Castro_Hernandez"}
