The simulation process remains the same and i have to\nchange only the geometry and the data of the light source or something\ncompletely different is required ?\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nSotiris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-March/006680.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006680", "created_by": "\u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2_\u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5"}
