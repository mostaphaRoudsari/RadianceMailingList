The script\nuses pcomb, psign and pcompos just like the original falsecolor\nscript. As always it works fine on Mac/Unix but Windows need further\ncare:\n\n\nThe images I get look all right to me but when I try to open them in\nximage (or the Windows equivalent) I get the message that the image is\nnot a valid file format. It seems to be related to the resolution\nstring. However that is present and the image basically is created by\npcompos.\n\n\nMy wild guess is that the information in the head with all it's back\nslashes and quoting interferes with the format of the image file. If\nthat was the case I could remove the offending lines if I could\nidentify them.\n\n\nIt's also entirely possible that the binary data of the image gets\nmessed up in the last step. I tried to keep the default output to\nstdout, so I have to read the image data from the pcompos and write it\nto stdout. That works on Unix but I'm not sure about Windows.\n\n\nYou can find 2 sample picture files as \"attachments\" at the end of this site:\n\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2\n\n\n\"fc_mac.hdr\" was created on a Mac, \"fc_win.hdr\" on Windows. The images\nhave no relation to the web-site, but it's the easiest way for me to\nupload these two tiny files.\n\n\nI hope someone can make sense out of this.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-March/001012.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001012", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
