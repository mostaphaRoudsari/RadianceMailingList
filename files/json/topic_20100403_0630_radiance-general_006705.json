For getting a daylighting output, I usually prepare a model in Ecotect and\u00a0 export it to radiance, which gives me\u00a0 the randered image. I realized that ,If I could\u00a0install Desktop Radiance from the website than total process could be shorter and could give me more realistic simulation output.\u00a0For installing Desktop Radiance, I require AutoCAD R14 or 2002 version. I have the latar version of AutoCAD , but dont have earlier version. Can anyone\u00a0give me a clue\u00a0for getting that AutoCAD R14 or how can I install Desktop Radiance .\n\u00a0\nThanks for your help.\n\n\nMah\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006705.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006705", "created_by": "Mahbub_Hassa"}
