Then I transform my picture (.pic) with ra_tiff to obtain a tiff\npicture.\n\n\nDoes somebody know which function is applied in ra_tiff to transform a .pic\nin a .tif ? It seems that my picture in .tif has a mean luminance greater\nthan my .pic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoralie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoralie Cauwerts\n\n\nFNRS Research Fellow | Ir Architect\n\n\nUniversite catholique de Louvain\n\n\nBelgium\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006713.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006713", "created_by": "Coralie_Cauwerts"}
