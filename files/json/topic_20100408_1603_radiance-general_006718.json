I\ncan look at images with ximage, and can look at certain octrees in rvu, but\nthe office model (ray/obj/office) crashes with the seg fault. If I load the\noctree with no view, I get the rvu window, but if I load the standard view\nthat's in the Makefile it crashes. I initially used the Intel compiler and\nsome aggressive optimizations, but I recompiled with gcc and -O2 and still\nhave the same issue.\n\n\nHas anyone else seen this?\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006718.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006718", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
