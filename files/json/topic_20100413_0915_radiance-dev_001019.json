However, the latest release of Radiance 4.0 is giving me a lot more trouble.  There is a typo in 'build_utils/find_libs.py' where 'v = env.FindFile('Verdana.fnt', './lib')' should be 'v = env.FindFile('Veerdana.fnt', './lib')'; this leads me to believe that the SCons scripts weren't even tested for this release, is that right?  Getting past the minor issues there seem to be some deeper problems for Windows (use of timegm function is where I stopped this function is not in the standard <time.h>).  So my question is, is anyone planning on trying to get Radiance 4.0 compiling using SCons on Windows (either MSVC or MinGW) without requiring cygwin?\n\n\nThanks a lot,\nDan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-April/001019.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001019", "created_by": "Daniel_Macumber"}
