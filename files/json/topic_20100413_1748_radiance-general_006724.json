Is there a way to tell the program that\nthere are no blinds?  How can I compare a model with blinds to a model\nwithout?\n\n\nThanks,\n-Taylor Sharpe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006724.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006724", "created_by": "Taylor_Sharpe"}
