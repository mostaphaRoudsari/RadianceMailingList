It much simpler to use the source files on these platforms\ndirectly. A Radiance installation is required (pcomb, pvalue, ra_bmp\netc).\n\n\n\n\nI had no time to write documentation yet but I think it's use is\nintuitive enough. The *.exe file allows drag and drop on the\nexecutable and once the app is open on the image area. Once you have\nopened an image you can convert it to a falsecolor image and save the\nresult as *.bmp.\n\n\nYou can also display the values of the pixel under the cursor. Check\nthe \"show values\" checkbox and the image data will be read and\nconverted (this can take some seconds). RGB and Lux values (only for\n-i images) are shown in the status bar when you move the cursor over\nthe image.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006747.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006747", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
