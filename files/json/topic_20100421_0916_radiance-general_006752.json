I am\nreplicating a Warema blind that has an opaque surface (grey) on the convex\nside and a chrome surface (93% reflective) on the concave side. To minimize\nthe amount of geometry I was hoping there is an easy way to apply two\nmaterials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than\ndouble the geometry.\n\n\nI have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking\nfor. I hope there is an easy way to do this. \n\n\nFor instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side\nis the opaque material.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nNick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006752.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006752", "created_by": "Nick_Hubof"}
