As the images display a wide range of\npossible values I am trying to figure out a method for automatically\nadjust the scale.\n\n\nThe manual page of falsecolor reads: \"If the argument given to -s begins\nwith an \"a\" for \"auto,\" then the maximum is used for scaling the\nresult.\" Which is exactly what I need, unfortunately it does not work\nfor me: no error is thrown but the scale is always the standard 0 to\n1000.\n\n\nThis is the syntax that I am using:\n\n\n\" Falsecolor -ip mypic.hdr -s a -n 10 -l Lux > mypic_fc.hdr \"\n\n\nI am using Radiance 3.9 on Windows, which might be the reason.\n\n\nI have also tried this on the real useful falsecolor2 by Thomas Bleicher\n(thanks!!) and in this case I receive the error 'bad option'.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion/clue?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nBest,\n\n\nGiovanni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006833.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006833", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti"}
