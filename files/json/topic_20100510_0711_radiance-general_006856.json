Greg Ward has recently  \ndemonstrated the rtcontrib-BSDF approach that seems to offer similar  \nfunctionality.\n\n\nSo, are we being presented with a fork in the road ahead?  If so, how  \nwill we decide which path to take?  Is now perhaps the right time to  \nconsider working-up a checklist of capabilities/strengths/weaknesses  \nfor the two approaches?\n\n\nI don't believe that we are too far away from seeing metrics founded  \non climate-based daylight modelling appearing in guidelines such as  \nLEED etc.  In which case, there could be something of a scramble as  \npotentially many, many new Radiance users join what is still a fairly  \nsmall bunch of 'enthusiasts' doing annual simulations.  It think it  \nwould be useful to get this discussion on the go sooner rather than  \nlater.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-John\n\n\n\n\nDr. John Mardaljevic\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway\nLeicester\nLE1 9BH, UK\n+44 (0) 116 257 7972\n+44 (0) 116 257 7981 (fax)\n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006856.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006856", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
