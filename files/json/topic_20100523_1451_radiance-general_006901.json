I would like \nthis pattern to be visible to the camera, but use a normal gensky \ngenerated sky for all sample rays.\n\n\nConceptually, this is similar to the illum type where a different \nmaterial is applied when the object (the sky in my case) is viewed directly.\n\n\nI did try with illum:\n\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4  1 1 1  0\n\n\nskyglow brightfunc bracelet\n2 band bracelet.cal\n0\n0\n\n\nskyfunc illum skymat\n1 bracelet\n0\n3  1 1 1\n\n\nskymat source sky\n0\n0\n4  0 0 1  180\n\n\nThis works, but results in about twice the horizontal illuminance \ncompared to a normal glow sky. The sky now takes part in the direct \ncalculation (this works with -ab 0), and all light expectedly emenates \nfrom the zenith. So using illum is not an option.\n\n\nMany thanks for your ideas\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006901.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006901", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
