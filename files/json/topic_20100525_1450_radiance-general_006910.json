Especially one that is geared toward the consultant? I am aware of the Daylighting Collaborative at the Energy Center of Wisconsin, however their membership pricing structure does not seem to be geared toward the independent consultant, but more toward larger manufacturers. I have asked them about changing their pricing structure, but they do not seem to want to budge. \n\n\nWould anyone be interested in starting such a group with me? Or in persuading the Daylighting Collaborative into changing their pricing structure? Email me directly at jilldalglish at yahoo.com \n\n\nThanks \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJill Dalglish, EIT, LEED AP \nwww.dalglishdaylighting.com \nDalglish Daylighting, LLC \n\n\n\n\njilldalglish at yahoo.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006910.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006910", "created_by": "Jill_Dalglish"}
