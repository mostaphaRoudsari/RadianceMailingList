During the three days we will be covering a range of daylighting\ndesign analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to\nstate-of-the-art Radiance simulations and high dynamic range photography\nfor glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be\nRhinoceros, SketchUp, and/or Ecotect for CAD modeling as well as\nRadiance, Daysim, Evalglare, and Photosphere for climate-based daylight\nmodeling, glare analysis and solar radiation assessments. To those who\nknow Grasshopper, we will be showing you how to generate animated\nRadiance/Daysim simulations such as the ones on our web site\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. Program\nparticipants will further get a paper copy of a new, 50 page document on\ndaylight simulations. You can sign up for the program at\nhttp://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10\n1838. Feel free to contact me for any content-related questions. Please\ncontact Ms. Margaret Moore De Chicojay\n(margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu) for any administrational\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFYI. There was a long debate on climate-based daylighting metrics at a\nrecent two day Daylighting Forum in Las Vegas which was attended by\nrepresentative from IESNA, AHSRAE, USGBC and other organizations. It\nseems likely that some of these organizations will soon introduce such\nmetrics into their standards and guidelines. So, sign up and stay\ncompetitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing. \n\n\nAssociate Professor of Architectural Technology\n\n\nGraduate School of Design - Harvard University\n\n\nGund Hall 331, 48 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\n\nt: 617 384 7269, f: 617 495 8916, reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu\n<mailto:reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu> \n\n\nResearch <http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/> , Sustainable\nDesign Workflows\n<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/tutorials.html>\nExecutive Education on Daylighting: July 14 - 16\n<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1\n01838>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-May/006927.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006927", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
