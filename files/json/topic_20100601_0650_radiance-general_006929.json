Is this possible? I\nknow that by using the -dr option, Radiance will create virtual light\nsources to account for specular reflections of direct light from the sun.\nHowever, since the daylight coefficients are calculated using a blank sky\nhaving a uniform luminance distribution, there is no sun for the -dr option\nto find. I believe this would make the sky patch coefficients come out lower\nthan they should be because the specular direct reflection of the sun would\nnot be included, but my understanding of how the program works may not be\ncorrect.\n\n\nCan the daylight coefficient method be made to work with specular\nreflections in Radiance, or is this not possible given the way the program\nis implemented?\n\n\nThanks,\nKevin Thuot\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006929.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006929", "created_by": "Kevin_Thuot"}
