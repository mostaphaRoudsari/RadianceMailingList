The article \"A Perceptually Validated Model for Surface\nDepth Hallucination\" says ''Once we have an albedo map and a depth map for\nour surface, virtually any rendering algorithm may be applied. We use\nthe *Radiance\n*physically-based renderer.\" Are there software or resources available which\ndescribe in more detail how albedo and depth maps can be achieved and used\nin Radiance?\n\n\nMy best,\n\n\nIebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006941.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006941", "created_by": "Iebele_Abel"}
