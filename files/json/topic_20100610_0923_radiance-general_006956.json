Without having to run\nrpict again, is there a way of dropping down the sky luminance using a\nmultiplier OR to uniformly drop down the light in the scene by combining\nthe pic (using pcomb) with pic file of a screen of a specific\ntransmittance? In other words, can I just filter down the light levels\nuniformly in the scene without having to run rpict again.\nThanks.\nAutif\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006956.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006956", "created_by": "Autif_Sayyed"}
