I can use Python to\nexecute in batch those most fundamental radiance commands like getinfo,\ngensky, genbox, oconv, rpict, rvu, etc. with images displaying correctly.\n\n\nSo, can anybody help to point out what's wrong here and how to fix it?\n\n\nBoth my Mac OS X system and my Radiance are fresh installation.\n\n\nI install the latest Radiance following the guide from the this website\nafter I tried and failed by following the README file in the installation\nfolder of Rad4R0.\nhttp://www.designcommunity.com/forum/8756.html\n\n\nIs it because my Radiance is not properly installed?\n\n\nReally appreciate your help!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/006962.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_006962", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang_\u5f20\u5180"}
