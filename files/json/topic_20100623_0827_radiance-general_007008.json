I keep updating \nit, fixing small typos and inconsistencies, but have not felt the need \nto reflect the recent changes to gensky's turbidity.\n\n\nBoth, CIE clear and overcast are extremes that are fairly unlikely to \noccur in reality. As Greg said, you really need to feed in measurements, \nand also have a good guess at the turbidity if you are concerned about \naccuracy. If you can supply diffuse and direct irradiation, you might \nwant to use gendaylit instead.\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/007008.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007008", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
