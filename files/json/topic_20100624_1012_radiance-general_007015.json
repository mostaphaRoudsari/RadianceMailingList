The first \nthing I noticed - and this is a problem I encountered a couple weeks ago \nwhen first attempting R4 - is that it seems to scan my entire \nmaterials.rad file, even for materials not used in the current octree. \nIt was crashing at missing cal files referenced in my materials.rad file \n(the material defs for which I deleted, now it runs fine). Does this \nsound right? Does R4 check all the materials, even if they aren't being \nused?\n\n\nThanks,\nCramer\n\n\n*Cramer Silkworth\n212 219 2255 | silkworth at transsolar.com <mailto:silkworth at transsolar.com>\nTranssolar Inc. | 134 Spring Street Suite 601 | New York, NY 10012\n\n\nTranssolar Climate Engineering\nTechnical consulting for energy efficiency and environmental quality in \nbuildings.\nNew York - Stuttgart - Munich*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/007015.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007015", "created_by": "Cramer_Silkworth"}
