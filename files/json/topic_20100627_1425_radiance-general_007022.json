As far as I\nunderstand, the default in the simple dynamic shading device model is a\nsimplified model which transmits 25% of diffuse radiation when the shading\nis closed. Is there a way to modify this transmittance so that it matches\nthe transmittance of a specific fabric?\n\n\nOr would it be better to use the advanced shading device model? If it is the\nlatter, can the *.rad files required for input into the model both be\nmaterial rad files as opposesed to geometry rad files (since I am only\nseeking to change the material properties of the interior shades, not\nlooking to define a complex geometry)?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nKrystyna Zelenay\n\n\nGraduate Student Researcher\nCenter for the Built Environment\nDepartment of Architecture\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nkzelenay at berkeley.edu\n*\n\n\n\n\n*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/007022.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007022", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay"}
