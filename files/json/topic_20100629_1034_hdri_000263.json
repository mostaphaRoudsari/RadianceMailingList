Everything was working very well.  \n\n\nThen I got a new Canon 5D Mark II camera, and it doesn't work.  I think the problem is that the new Mark II  camera doesn't have the ability to select between PC-connect and PTP/print connection.  The CanonHDRcap program used by John's script requires PC-connect (as noted in Greg's original documentation).  When I connect the new Mark II camera I notice a PTPcamera program running in activity monitor.  So I assume the camera uses PTP to connect with the PC.\n\n\nMy questions: \nHas anyone used a Canon 5D Mark II camera with CanonHDRcap?\nDoes anyone know of a way to get the Mark II camera to connect via PCConnect instead of PTP?\n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-June/000263.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000263", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
