Axel's tutorial or the gensky menu?\n\n\n\n\nOr more specifically, for \"Formula 4\" in Axel Jacob's \"Radiance Tutorial\" p.\n24 that specify the relationship between zenith brightness and horizontal\nilluminance: R_zenith = (9/7)*(E_horiz/179/PI)\n\n\nWhat are the units for \"R_zenith\" and \"E_horiz\" exactly?\n\n\nIf the unit for \"R_zenith\" is watts/steradian/m2, then it's a \"radiance\"\nvalue.\n\n\nBut if the unit for \"R_zenith\" is watts/m2, then it's a \"irradiance\" value.\n\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-June/007027.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007027", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
