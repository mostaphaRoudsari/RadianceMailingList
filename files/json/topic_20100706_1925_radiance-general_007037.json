I know\ntwo places: Colar picker at http://luxal.eu/resources/radiance/index.shtml\nand Ecotect which provides some examples, but RBG values are not 0-1, should\nI divide the RBG value by 255?\n\n\n(2) When typing \"man texfunc\", I can not find the command. Is that my\ninstallation problem?  I use ubuntu and Radiance version 4.0.\n\n\n(3) Is that right I can add texture and pattern by using procedural\nfunctions (e.g. wrinkle.cal) and bitmaps accoring to\nhttp://www.artifice.com/radiance/rad_materials.html ?  If I have an image\nwith an .png extension, how can I add the image as the the pattern ?\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007037.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007037", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
