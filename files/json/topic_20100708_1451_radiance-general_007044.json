It has a good feature. But I am a little confused with\nseveral variable settings\n\n\n*rad* [ *-s* ][ *-n|-N* *npr* ][ *-t* ][ *-e* ][ *-V* ][ *-w* ][ *-v* *view*][\n*-o* *device* ]  *rfile* [ *VAR=value* *..*  ]\n\n\n(1) is that right the option [-v view] and \"view\" variable in .rif have the\nsame function?\n\n\n(2)  For three sets (1) \"OCTREE\", (2)\"scene\" (3) \"object\" and \"materials\" ,\nif I change files in \"object\" and \"material\", will .oct be updated when I\nrun \"rad -t sample.rif\" ?  Similarly, if I change files indicated in\n\"scene\", the oct. will be updated even if \"OCTREE\" is not changed?\n\n\nCheers,\nJia\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 8, 2010 at 3:18 PM, Christopher Rush\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007044.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007044", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
