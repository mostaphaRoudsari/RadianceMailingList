The rad2mgf program doesn't check to make sure \n> identifiers are legal in MGF, so this is the problem.  You need to \n> rename material and modifier names that don't begin with a letter, or I \n> need to update rad2mgf to fix identifiers.\n\n\nThank you, Greg.\n\n\nRandolph Fritz \u2022 RFritz at lbl.gov\nEnvironmental Energy Technologies Division \u2022 Lawrence Berkeley Labs\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007079.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007079", "created_by": "R_Fritz"}
