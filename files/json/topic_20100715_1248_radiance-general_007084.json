What is your practice of adding or revising geometry in\nRadiance?\n\n\nThank you for sharing your experience,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007084.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007084", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
