So I should be able to understand \nthe header. However I am not really sure whether I am doing the right \nthing here. Take an example:\n\n\n2\n1.041667 0.041667 13\n0.000000 6.283185 39\n\n\n  1.504918e+00 1.530097e+00 1.525389e+00 1.501599e+00 1.505246e+00\n  1.461270e+00 1.463038e+00 1.489136e+00 1.481565e+00 1.451201e+00\n  1.374334e+00 1.296027e+00 1.410817e+00 1.343876e+00 1.477319e+00\n  1.365996e+00 1.366200e+00 1.397315e+00 1.407394e+00 1.484092e+00\n  1.482776e+00 1.570183e+00 1.525340e+00 1.572320e+00 1.561935e+00\n  1.576046e+00 1.486079e+00 1.629394e+00 1.528797e+00 1.621227e+00\n[...]\n\n\nMy understanding:\n\n\n1) I have a two-dimensional array (line 1) of 13 rows and 39 columns \n(lines 2, 3), right?\n\n\n2) The rows are counted down from 1 to 0 (the 0.041667 probably is some \nerror to avoid 0), thus in steps of 1/13=-0.0769 .\n\n\n3) The columns are counted up from 0 to 2*pi in steps of 6.2832/39=0.1611 .\n\n\n4) This means that the columns represent the \"azimuth angle\" (the angle \nin the plane of the illum surface) from 0 to 2*pi radians, the rows are \nrelated to.... what? If it were the elevation angle (the angle to the \nsurface normal of the mkillum surface), why is it not counted beyond 1 \nradians? Or what else is it?\n\n\nIn illum.cal which is referred to by the illum-modifier generated by \nmkillum, I find these comments:\n\n\nFor the hemispherical case, A1-A9 are the unit vectors for the\nhemisphere's coordinate system:\n\n\nil_alth         - Altitude (1 to 0) for hemispherical coordinates\nil_azih         - Azimuth (0 to 2*PI) for hemisphere\n\n\nIt would be great if anyone could shed some light onto this...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-July/007105.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007105", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
