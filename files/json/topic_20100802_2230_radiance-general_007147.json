The scene file, sensor\nfile, rtrace command parameters are all the same.\n\n\nHowever, the result seems to be different when run the same rtrace command\nin Unix and Windows, although the difference is not that much (0.11 to 0.13\nin terms of daylight factor).\n\n\nI've already used a \"-u-\" option for rtrace.\n\n\nThe Radiance in Unix is version 3.9 (installed via Ubuntu software centre)\n\n\nThe Radiance in Windows is version 3.7 (downloaded from\nhttp://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/software/)\n\n\nMay I ask whether it's the Radiance version difference that caused the\ndifferent results?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007147.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007147", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
