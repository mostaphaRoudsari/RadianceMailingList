The plug-in, called DIVA-for-Rhino, supports a series of\nperformance evaluations including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)\n\n\n- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)\n\n\n- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)\n\n\n- Glare analysis (Evalglare)\n\n\n- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plug-in offers a highly optimized simulation workflow within\nRhinoceros and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in\norder to generate animated Radiance/Daysim simulations.   \n\n\nMore information can be found at\nwww.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. You can download the\nplug-in from www.diva-for-rhino.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy simulations!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec, Kera Lagios and Jeff Niemasz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007151.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007151", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
