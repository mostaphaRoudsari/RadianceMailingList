I\u00b4ve been working with hdrgen but I was recentely able to try photosphere and loved it!\n\n\nI saw an older topic in this meiling list regarding the posibility of using photosphere on linux or windows.Any news I missed? As a radiance user  I really prefer working on linux, also knowing that both - Mac and linux are Unix systems I  think it wouldnt be too hard to do that (if you know how..)\n\n\nIs it posible to get the source code of photosphere and compile it on linux? What can I do to use photosphere on linux? \nthanks,\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2010-August/000281.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000281", "created_by": "Roberto_German_Rodriguez"}
