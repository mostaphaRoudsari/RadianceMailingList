{"topic": "Single pane vs Double pane geometry", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Nick Hubof", "created_at": "August 12, 2010 at 03:31PM", "body": "All,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince I started using radiance I have always modeled a single plane to\nrepresent a window pane (single or double). The RAD material of course would\ngive the plane the correct VLT. \n\n\nHowever, when I model two planes the light is decreased because the first\npane lets in X% (vlt) and then the second pane further reduces it by X%\nagain. \n\n\nI would like a material that takes into account that there are two planes\nphysically modeled. Reason being I am importing a significant amount of\nwindows from a revit model consuming of many family objects all containing\nwindows with physically two planes of geometry glazing.\n\n\nI don't know all the tricks to writing material definitions, so I ask is\nthere a material function that will take into account the extra plane of\ngeometry and still give me the correct VLT? Or is it just a simple\nmathematical formula that will equal the VLT I need. (e.g. 85% + 85% =\n72.25%).\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007189.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007189", "created_by": "Nick_Hubof"}
