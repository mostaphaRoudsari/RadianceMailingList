A falsecolor image generated from an irradiance image (-i  \noption to rpict: rif file has line 'render= -i') gives an illuminance  \nof around 400 lux in the middle of the room. Using rtrace I get an  \nilluminance of about 210 lux in the middle of the room. (I'm using an  \nirradiance image for the -i option in falsecolor and a radiance image  \nfor the -p option).\n\n\nThe rtrace I'm using is as per Axel Jacobs tutorial: echo \"61.292  \n27.490 0 0 0 1' | rtrace -I -h -ov octrees/south.oct | rcalc -e  \n'$1=179*$1' This should work with the octree- same as what I generated  \nthe image from-  should it not?\n\n\nJohn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN FORD\n\n\nBLUEBOTTLE\nFORTY THREE STAWELL STREET\nNORTH MELBOURNE 3051\nPHONE  03 9329 0709\nFAX 03 9329 1780\n\n\nWWW.BB3.NET.AU\nJOHNFORD at BB3.NET.AU\nMOBILE 0411 519 738\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007192.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007192", "created_by": "John_Ford"}
