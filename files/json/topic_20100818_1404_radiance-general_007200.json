In a diffuse transmission situation I think it should be Luminance (cd/m2) = Back Face Incident Flux (lm/m2) * Diffuse Transmission (%) / Pi...   if your 18W CFL have degraded to 1000 lumens each then 4 * 1000 / 1 m2 * 50% / Pi = 636 cd/m2. Maybe your light box is smaller than 1 m2 but the diffusing surface is probably less than 50% transmission.\n> \n> Ideally you should try to find a luminance meter you can use to verify your camera calibration in photosphere.\n\n\nThanks Christopher!\nThat really helps; its confidence inspiring if you can post-rationalize data \"manually\".\n\n\n I will do that, the idea of my camera being able to capture cd/m2 is just awe inspiring ;)\n\n\nThanks again,\n\n\n-jelle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007200.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007200", "created_by": "Jelle_Feringa"}
