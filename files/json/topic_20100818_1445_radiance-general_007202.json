I get treg[000-145].hdr in my images/patches directory. This is\ngood. \n\n\nBut if I try to put the same construct into a Ruby script (note slightly\ndifferent variable names), the following command...\n\n\nvwrays -ff #{vw} | rtcontrib #{rtc} -n 15 -ffc $(vwrays -d #{vw}) -fo -f\ntregenza.cal -b tbin -o #{Dir.pwd}/output/dc/test/treg%03d.hdr -m sky_glow\nmodel_dc.oct\"\n\n\n...does not work. Fail. Boo. What I end up with is just a single\ntreg000.hdr. Any ideas why? I have a feeling the system doesn't like the\nvwrays call inside of the rtcontrib call. Anyone know how to pass this\nthrough from Ruby without a problem?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007202.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007202", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
