I run\nrtrace in a  computer with 4 processors and use: rtrace -w -h -I -ab 7 -n 4\n-af cachingFile.ca -ad 2048 -as 512 -aa 0.10 office.oct < points.inp | rcalc\n-e '$1=47.4*$1+ 120*$2+11.6*$3'>> output.out.\n\n\nI tried to run it but it took long time. My question is that whether there\nare ways of improving the rtrace command to reduce the runtime?\n\n\nCheers,\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007221.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007221", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
