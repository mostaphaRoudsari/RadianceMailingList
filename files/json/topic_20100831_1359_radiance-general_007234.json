You may recall I was asking\nwhy my Ruby script was not parsing the rtcontrib command to write out the\n146 tregenza patch images. All the variables were being passed and expanded\nout correctly. Problem was the view file I was handing it was bogus, and\n*this* error message does not make it back to the STDERR. Lesson learned.\n\n\nThat resolved, I am testing further, and am finding that for a given\nrtcontrib run, I don't always get 146 image files. Some views yield 142,\nsome 144. Any ideas on that?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-August/007234.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007234", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
