But in order to get the illuminance\nfalling on the sensor I need to know the reflectances of the surfaces in the\nimage in order to convert from luminance to illuminance. And the\nreflectances might vary, so I was wondering if I could use another approach.\n..hmm..and I am not that familiar with all the handy tools ;o)...but maybe\nthere is a chance that we can discuss this at the workshop next week.\n\n\nAnne\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007274.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007274", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen"}
