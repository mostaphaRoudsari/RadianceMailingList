They have a multilingual GUI,  \nso you can't go wrong. I'd recommend them over buying the ticket on board  \n from the conductor, as it incurs a surcharge... and the machine is often  \nfriendlier. ;^)\n\n\n> if your take a RE or RB it will be some small banlieu-train, avoid it!\n\n\nDefinitely. Unless you wanna experience the dregs of western society at  \nplay AND vandals at work. Plus it will take you 1/2 day/night to reach  \nyour destination (IF you reach your destination), since they stop every 10  \nmins at cowtowns you won't even find on the map! Repeat: do NOT take RE/RB!\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSystem Administrator\nInstitute for Applied Mathematics\nBonn University\nEndenicher Allee 60\n53115 Bonn\nGermany\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007275.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007275", "created_by": "Roland_Schregle"}
