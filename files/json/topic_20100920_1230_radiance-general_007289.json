They were very helpful.\n\n\nI installed Radiance for windows. I used the instruction file \"A\nsurvival guide to\nRadiance on Windows \" from the 7th International RADIANCE Workshop in\n2008.\n\n\nCould you recommend any tutorials and manuals to start with Radiance?\n\n\nI'm not sure, how I will start to introduce myself in Radiance.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nMarion Kerl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007289.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007289", "created_by": "Marion_Kerl"}
