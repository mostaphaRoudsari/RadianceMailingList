I think it will takes a long time, when I want to generate\nthe hole building with these rad.-files.\nIs it possible to accelerate these process? Are there any tools\navailable, which can input the CAD data in RADIANCE?\n\n\nAnother topic are the lamps in RADIANCE: How is it possible to get lamp\ninformation in RADIANCE? Exits there any tools, too?\n\n\nI hope anybody have answers of these questions. May be you can recommend\nsome documents or tutorial to gain more knowledge in these topics.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\nMarion Kerl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007298.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007298", "created_by": "Marion_Kerl"}
