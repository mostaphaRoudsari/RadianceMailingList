Does something like\nthis exist? At the NRC we had a $10,000 Minolta spectrometer that\nmeasured wavelength dependant diffuse reflectances as well as overall\nspecular reflectance. Are there any more affordable devices? What are\nyou using for light sources?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristoph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007306.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007306", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
