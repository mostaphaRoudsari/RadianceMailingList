On the really long exposures, you can actually see the back end of\nthe lens and I guess some of the internals of the camera body itself. While\nthis is exceedingly cool/interesting, I wonder if this is impacting the\nvalidity of the HDRs. When I create a Radiance HDR image (-vth) I get these\nnice round images with totally black corners. With the camera, I end up with\na rectangular image and as I said some luminous pixels on the long\nexposures. Is this a problem, and how do folks deal with this in practice?\nEven if it's not a problem from an accuracy standpoint, aesthetically it's\nnice to produce photos that look like the Radiance fisheye output.\n\n\nThanks...\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nwww.rumblestrip.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-September/007317.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007317", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
