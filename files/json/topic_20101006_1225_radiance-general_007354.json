My environment variable RAYPATH is .:/opt/radiance/lib.\nDo you mean I have to change the direction of the RAYPATH to execute the gendaylit command successfully?\n\n\nAlso I'm not sure which parameter I have to use for the -W parameter. I used -W 280 280, but maybe this is my mistake.\nCan you explain me what is the meaning of these two values?\n\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n\nMarion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007354.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007354", "created_by": "Marion_Kerl"}
