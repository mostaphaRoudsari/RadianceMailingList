To get accurate results I turned to Optics5 to build the\nlaminate. I would expect that the right kind of material definition\nwould be a trans or transdata, but Optics keep on returning glass and 2\nBRTDfunc (front face and back face). As per my understanding the\nBRTDfunc will only affect the front and back reflectance, and contains\nno information about diffusion.\nAs I am interested in assessing the effects of different levels of\ndiffusion in the interlayer, I was wondering if any of you could suggest\nwhat would be the most reliable approach.\n\n\nAlso I was wondering how people go about simulating fritting; if the\nglass is far enough to make the fritting not visible, is it common\npractice reducing the transmissivity by the percentage cover of the\nfritting or there are more sophisticated (and accurate) approaches?\n\n\nThanks in advance for the help,\n\n\nGiovanni\n\n\n\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////\nGiovanni Betti\nEnvironmental Design Analyst\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-October/007420.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007420", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti"}
