I am very confused with the\ndaylighting matrix.  Daylighting matrix should be a matrix with size of\n KlemsDivision* SkyPatches. Is that right D-matrix tells me\nthe contributions of  each sky patch to each Klems division (each angle?)?\nIf so, different point in the window area should have different D-matrix\nbecause the sky patches' contributions to the same direction in different\npositions of window are different, in other words, the D matrix is\ndifferent. But in fact, there is only one D matrix for a window. Could\nsomeone explain how daylighting matrix works?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007426.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007426", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
