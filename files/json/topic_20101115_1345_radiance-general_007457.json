So a lot of sky is visible below what would be the \nhorizon on a level site.  So far as I can tell, the only way to \nsimulate this correctly (if the ground reflectance and sky light is \nsignificant) is to give the model an actual elevation, z = 700 feet or \nwhatever.  Do I have that right?\n\n\n\n\nRandolph M.
