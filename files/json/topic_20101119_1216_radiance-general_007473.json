We have a windows 7 and the linux version of\nradiance is accessed virtually. I am getting stuck with using the software,\nand operating with the command lines, and would greatly appreciate if anyone\ncould suggest a workshop or online training sessions or some basics. Sorry\nfor such beginner questions but can I also know what language and supporting\nsoftware should I work with to be able to write the commands.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\nVidya Gowda,\nvidyacg at vt.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007473.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007473", "created_by": "vidya_gowda"}
