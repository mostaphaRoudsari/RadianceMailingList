It works after I add \".\\\" in front of the \nfile name. \n\n\n\n\nMay I ask a couple of follow-up questions?\n\n\nQ1. I tried to generate cumulative skies for direct radiation\u00a0(binned) for \ndifferent periods of time in a year.\u00a0 They all give the same results.\u00a0 Is it not \npossible to specify the time and day period for direct radiation?\n\n\nQ2. I created angular fisheye views of the sky dome (180-deg spread with the \ncentre at the zenith)\u00a0and found some\u00a0anomaly that I can't explain:\n\n\nDirect - \n\n\na. All sun paths are found within approx. 45 degrees from the\u00a0zenith.\u00a0 It \nlooks\u00a0like a\u00a0normal\u00a0sunpath diagram being \"cropped\", leaving a circular area in \nthe middle.\u00a0 I changed the view direct (-vd) and it's still the case (i.e. not a \nview setting problem)\n\n\nb.\u00a0The sun paths are almost continuous rather than in form 5-degree \"bins\"\n\n\nDiffuse -\n\n\na. The lowest row of the 145-patch sky dome is particularly\u00a0bright on the left \nand right sides (i.e. west and east sides, respectively)\u00a0.\u00a0 It appears under \nboth Singaporean and San Francisco skies.\u00a0 Would it be related to the limitation \non <6 degrees sun angle?\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nThanks\u00a0in advance for bearing with this long list of question.\u00a0 It would be \ngreat if there is a \"manual\" that can be made available - it's\u00a0a useful tool!\n\n\nCheers, \nKam\u00a0\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-November/007504.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007504", "created_by": "Kam_Shing_Leung"}
