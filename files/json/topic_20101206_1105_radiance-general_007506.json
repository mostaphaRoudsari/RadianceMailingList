The final results out of 60 responses was a predicted attendance at each venue of:\n\n\n34\t@ LBNL, Berkeley, California (57%)\n26\t@ NREL, Lakewood, Colorado (44%)\n14\t@ SERI, Singapore (23%)\n\n\nFrom these data and our prior stipulation, the Radiance Workshop will be held next year at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.  The organizers are currently looking into available spaces in the August-September time frame, and will get back with more details in the next couple of months.\n\n\nGiven the responses, I'm guessing that NREL will be a good place to hold a future workshop.\n\n\nThanks to Daniel Fuller for setting up the site, and to everyone who voted.  We hope to see you next year!\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007506.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007506", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
