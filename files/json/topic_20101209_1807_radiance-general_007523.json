I'm up to the first use of tregenza.cal to generate sky patches (command below) and finding that the first image, p000.hdr, is corrupted somehow. Preview crashes when I try to open the image and when I even select it in the Finder, the Finder behaves very strangely (I think it's crashing and restarting all in the space of about two seconds). Getinfo reports what looks like a correct header, comparing the headers of p000.hdr and p001.hdr. The files are all the same size. The other images, p001.hdr to p145.hdr all open fine. \n\n\n$vwrays -ff $vw |rtcontrib @rtc.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d $vw) -V+ -f tregenza.cal -b tbin -o images/patches/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow testroom_whitesky.oct\n\n\nAny hints?\n\n\nJohn Ford.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007523.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007523", "created_by": "John_Ford"}
