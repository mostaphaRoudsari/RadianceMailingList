I am surprised that pvalue and Photosphere come up\nwith different values, though. Greg is probably the best to comment\non this. I myself have never used Photosphere.\n\n\nThe size related popup is just gives you the option to skip the pvalue\nstep when the image is loaded. It can take a while (especially for large\nimage) and for most of the features it is not necessary.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Dec 12, 2010 at 11:36 PM, Mehmedalp Tural <mtural at asu.edu> wrote:\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-December/007530.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007530", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
