After\nmaking this change to ezxml.h:\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_mailinglists/general/2010-October/007397.html\nit compiled but with errors.\n\n\nThe first error I could find was:\n\n\npersist.c:42: error: conflicting types for \u2018sighandler_t\u2019\n/usr/include/signal.h:11: error: previous declaration of \u2018sighandler_t\u2019\nwas here\nmake: *** [persist.o] Error 1\n\n\nSame as Claus had here\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_mailinglists/general/2010-October/007402.html\n\n\nWas there ever a resolution?\n\n\nAs a fix, would it be reasonable to merge a full set of Cygwin Radiance\n3R7 bin and lib files with a partial set of 4.0 files, and just keep the\n4.0 files where duplicates occur? Looks like the non-duplicates were\nlookamb, rpict, rtrace, rview, and rvu. Also, rayinit.cal and\nglazing.cal were not in the lib directory. Although, these are some\npretty major files not to have compile, I just ran oconv and rpict on an\nold project and it seemed to work fine.\n\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n\nMark de la Fuente\n\n\n[{--Wm.
