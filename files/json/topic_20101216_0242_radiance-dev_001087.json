Since method it is mixture of shell command + cal files and various\nfunctions inside them, I couldn't determine how is exactly defined \"width\"\nof contour bands.\n\n\nI understand that idea is to color areas in image with radiance in some\nrange above and below each radiance value in the scale.\nFor example if blue color is defined with 500lux, on final image in blue\nwill be colored areas with luminance ranging *from 500-x to 500+y *values.\nQuestion is how *x and y* values are calculated? I suppose they depend on\nmaximal scale value and number of color, but cant determine exact equation\nfrom falsecolor script.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2010-December/001087.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001087", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
