When I try to generate a falsecolor image without a legend (by setting -lw 0 or -lh 0), I get an error: \"/tmp/<temp dir>/scol.hdr: bad picture size\"\nIf I try to run the same command on the same image using the official 4R0 release I also have compiled, I do not get this error and the falsecolor image is successfully generated without a legend.\n\n\nCan anyone else replicate this error? Or is it possible that I have a compiling error somewhere along the way? Any help/insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nChris M.
