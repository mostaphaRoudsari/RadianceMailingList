The results are looking pretty good, but as \nsoon as I put the blinds into the model, single-case simulation times \nwent up to 2.5-3.5 hours.  Does anyone have any feeling for these \ntimes?  Are they reasonable for a na\u00efve model or too high?  The \nprocessor used is a quad-core AMD Opteron 2376 (2300 MHz) and I've been \nusing Delaunay's implementation of the Perez sky model, gendaylit, and \ncalculating five ambient bounces.\n\n\nPossible lines of attack on the problem:\n-- Using genBSDF/mkillum (suggested by a colleague.)\n-- Simplify the blind model; use flat rather than curved slats.\n-- Review the rtrace parameters I am using.  I'm rereading John \nMardaljevic's chapter in RwR on Daylight Simulation, looking for hints, \nbut Mardaljevic (are you out there?) was primarily working with \novercast skies, which aren't adequate for glare models, so I'm not sure \nhow much of his advice still applies.  I'm also going to be sweeping \nthe archives of this mailing list for ideas.\n\n\nAnyone have additional suggestions?  Any thoughts on which to try \nfirst?  Are there particular articles it might be helpful to look at?\n\n\nRandolph M.
