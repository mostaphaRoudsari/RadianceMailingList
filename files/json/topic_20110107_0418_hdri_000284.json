The research is carried out as part of a Master\u2019s thesis by\nRashida Mogri, Graduate School of Design at Harvard University (GSD). The\noutcome of the survey will be used to\n\n\n\u2022    identify established methods of glare study\n\u2022    better understand design practitioners\u2019 understanding of HDR\nphotography\n\u2022    judge viability of HDR photography as a tool for glare analysis in\nfuture design projects\n\n\nWe would like you to fill out an online questionnaire about your design\nexperience particularly how it relates to glare analysis through new\ndevelopments in high dynamic range photography. Please respond to all\nquestions as openly and honestly as possible. There are no right or wrong\nanswers; it is only your opinions that are important.\n\n\nAll of the information that we obtain from you through this survey will be\nkept confidential.
