How can I upsample a radiance image with a factor of 2 (or 4 or 8 ...) on the command line? It is easy to do in HDRShop but I need the functionality embedded in a large script.\n\n\nI don't any fancy bi-linear interpolation ... simply nearest neighbour will do (i.e., repeating the same pixel four times in the upsampled output image).\n\n\nI am doing compositing and I wish to composite a high res render with a low res real image. I want to do the compositing in high res, and subsample (using pfilt) afterwards to achieve a little blurring at the edges of the rendered objects ... sort of to feather them into the  image.\n\n\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007626.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007626", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen"}
