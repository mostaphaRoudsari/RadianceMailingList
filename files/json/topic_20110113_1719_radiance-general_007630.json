This update fixes a bug which led to wrong\ncalculation of average luminance values for scaled images.\n\n\nI recommend that all users update to the new version asap.\n\n\nFurther changes:\n* improved feedback for loading of large images\n* images zoom level is displayed in the lower left corner\n* resizing of the frame (and image) is done in steps now to reduce\n   the CPU load from recalculating every new image size. This is\n   a temporary hack until I find a better solution for the problem.\n\n\nDirect download link:\n\n\nhttp://pyrat.googlecode.com/files/wxfalsecolor.exe\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007630.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007630", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
