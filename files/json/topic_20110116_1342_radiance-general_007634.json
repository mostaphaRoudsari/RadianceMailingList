The primitives are defined in src/common/color.h:\n\n\n0.640 0.330 (red)\n0.290 0.600 (green)\n0.150 0.060 (blue)\n0.333 0.333 (white)\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/radiance_xy_primaries_with_lines_med.png\n\n\nI then determined the dominant wavelength for r,g,b by projecting the \nx,y coordinates from the white point onto the perimeter of the \nhorseshoe. This was rounded to the nearest 5 nm, because the data I had \nfor the v(lambda) curve only had a 5 nm resolution:\n\n\nhttp://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/primaries_vlambda.png\n\n\nThe dominant wavelengths of the r,g,b primaries are drawn as arrows. The \nlittle coloured rings are the weighting coefficient as used by Radiance.\n\n\nSince 1 = r + g + b, I normalised the values I got (where the little \narrows hit the v(lambda) curve).\n\n\nL = 0.326R + 0.635G + 0.039B\n\n\nThe derived coefficients are qualitatively similar to the Radiance ones \nin the sense that b < r < g, but I would have liked them to be closer in \ntheir absolute values, too. Although the methodology and drawings are a \nbit crude, I was hoping to get a better match.\n\n\nCan anybody suggest a better solution?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007634.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007634", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
