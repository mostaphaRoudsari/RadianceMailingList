Very useful tool to have, it also\nsupports Radiance's hdr format (as long as you use its -gamma\nparameter), so you can e.g. directly convert from HDR to PNG or JPG (not\na lossless operation of course...).\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007643.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007643", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
