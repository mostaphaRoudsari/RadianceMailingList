How do i declare the variable for light vectors and update the light vectors \nin the scene file ?\n2. What are the steps to do it ? \n\n\n( I am still using 3.9 version)\nBest Regards, \nBrajesh Lal\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007646.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007646", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal"}
