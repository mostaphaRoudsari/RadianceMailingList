Any suggestions?\n\n\nTim. I hope you are looking just for a way to import distribution data\ninto Ecotect.\n\n\nIn that case, IES is your friend. IIRC you define it as a type of\nmaterial in Ecotect. If you go through the materials you should find\nsome examples for \"light materials\" which should get you going.\n\n\nIf you want to roll your own IES file ...\n\n\nAre you sure about this? If you have a fitting that's safety-tested\nenough to go in a stadium you should be able to get an IES file. If\nnot I would still look for a distribution file of a similar fitting\nbefore I start to hack together my own IES file.\n\n\nIf you really want to dive into it I recommend \"Thinking\nPhotometrically (II)\" by Ian Ashdown as first start:\n\n\nhttp://www.dial.de/CMS/German/Articles/Licht/Service/Downloads/Thinking_Photometrically_II.pdf\n\n\nGood luck,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-January/007654.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007654", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
