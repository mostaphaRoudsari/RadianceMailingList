Then I started seeing ps\noutput like this:\n\n\n 6589 ?        S      0:00 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6592 ?        R     29:32 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6593 ?        R     29:32 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6594 ?        R     29:32 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6595 ?        R     29:32 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6596 ?        R     29:32 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6597 ?        R     29:32 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6598 ?        S     41:03 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n 6599 ?        S     49:48 rtrace -n 8 -h -I @sensparm.opt ot-3.oct\n\n\nAnd it slowed down by a factor of three. My impression is that there has been an\nOS glitch and it is in fact only using one core.  Anyone else seen this?\n\n\nHead Debian build of Radiance, Ubuntu 10.10, most current version.\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007664.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007664", "created_by": "Randolph_M._Fritz"}
