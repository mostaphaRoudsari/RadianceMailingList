I'm puzzled by an error i get when using\ndctimestep & rtcontrib with sky subdivisions > 1.\n\n\nThis is the command i'm issuing:\nvwrays -ff -x 400 -y 400 -vf fisheye.vf | \\\nrtcontrib $options -ffc `vwrays -d -x 400 -y 400 -vf fisheye.vf` -fo -e MF:2 \\\n-f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -o tmp/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w \noctrees/geom_sky.oct\n\n\nthen to combine these for a particular sky:\n\n\ngendaylit $month $day $hour -W $radiation | genskyvec -m 2 | dctimestep\ntmp/p%03d.hdr > temp.hdr\n\n\nthis command always results in the following error:\nsystem - error reading picture 'tmp/p000.hdr'\n\n\ntmp/p000.hdr does exist, as do all the other 248 images (for MF:2).  They\nare all only 4 kb however, which of course is wrong.\n\n\nEverything works fine with the tregenza sky, for example:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -x 400 -y 400 -vf fisheye.vf | \\\nrtcontrib $options -ffc `vwrays -d -x 400 -y 400 -vf fisheye.vf` -fo \\\n-f tregenza.cal -b tbin -bn Ntbins -o tmp/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w\noctrees/geom_sky.oct\n\n\n\n\nOr even:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -x 400 -y 400 -vf fisheye.vf | \\\nrtcontrib $options -ffc `vwrays -d -x 400 -y 400 -vf fisheye.vf` -fo -e\nMF:1 \\\n-f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -o tmp/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w\noctrees/geom_sky.oct\n\n\n...And using 'genskyvec -m 1' in the next command.\n\n\nI have a feeling it's something obvious and hoping another set of eyes\nwill help me find it.\n\n\nThanks!\nGalen\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007682.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007682", "created_by": "Galen_Burrell"}
