The main workshop will be Aug. 25th and 26th.  A pre-workshop seminar day will occur on Aug. 24th.\n\n\nWe've decided to hold the workshop in August to allow more participation from academic institutions.  I hope the date is suitable for everyone.  I know August is a common time for family vacations, so I'll also mention that the Northern California is a common vacation destination.\n\n\nAndy\n\n\n\n\nAndy McNeil\nWindows & Daylighting Research Group\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007684.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007684", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
