Is there a way of forcing radiance\nto return only a yes/no type of value?\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGiovanni\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-February/007688.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007688", "created_by": "Giovanni_Betti"}
