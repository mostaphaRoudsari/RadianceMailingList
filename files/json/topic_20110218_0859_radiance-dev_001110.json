The issue should be\nfixed in some way, though.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n Bernd Zeimetz                            Debian GNU/Linux Developer\n http://bzed.de                                http://www.debian.org\n GPG Fingerprint: ECA1 E3F2 8E11 2432 D485  DD95 EB36 171A 6FF9 435F\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2011-February/001110.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001110", "created_by": "Bernd_Zeimetz"}
