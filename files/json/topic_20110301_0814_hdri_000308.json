Here are the commands you want:\n\n\necho \"VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 0 -vd 1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1\" > corrected.hdr\nra_xyze -r -o -u orig.hdr | pcompos -x 1200 - -200 0 >> corrected.hdr\n\n\nThe first one puts the view information you want in the header.  The ra_xyze command undoes the exposure on the image before passing it to pcompos, which does the cropping and appends it to the view header.\n\n\nHope this works.\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-March/000308.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000308", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
