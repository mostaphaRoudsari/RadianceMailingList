I tried to use Grag's compiled\nversion and it is working. My problem was that I was not aware that I did\nnot copied the compiled version to the /usr/local/bin.\n\n\nI guess I also get it compiled by self, so I can share it with the list.\nThe probelem was that makefile can not locate GL/gl.h directory which is\nprobably called OpenGL on OSX after searching google. However I could get\nthe GL/gl.h and just copied it either to /usr/include or to unpacked\nevalglare into geometry directory.\n\n\nThen in \"makefile\" I changed\nCFLAGS     = -g -DMSDOS  -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3 $(DEBOPT) -Wall\n\n\nto\n\n\nCFLAGS     = -g -fnested-functions -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3 $(DEBOPT)\n-Wall\n\n\nand it seems that it got program compiled. I did not tested because I think\nit is better to use Grag's compiled version.\n\n\nProbably there will be more correct and elegant way to do it but I guess\nthis is working to.\n\n\nThank you\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-March/007731.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007731", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld"}
