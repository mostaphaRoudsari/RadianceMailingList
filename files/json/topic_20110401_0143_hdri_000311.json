This is the 22nd annual event in the series of very successful Eurographics Symposia on Rendering and Eurographics Workshops on Rendering.\n\n\nConference topics include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\t\u2022 Global illumination\n\t\u2022 Reflectance, volumetric scattering and translucency\n\t\u2022 Representations of material appearance\n\t\u2022 Human perception and error measures\n\t\u2022 Rendering hardware and its application\n\t\u2022 Rendering dynamic/animated environments\n\t\u2022 Shadows and visibility\n\t\u2022 Monte Carlo techniques\n\t\u2022 Finite element techniques\n\t\u2022 Sampling, filtering, and anti-aliasing\n\t\u2022 Texture models, analysis, and synthesis\n\t\u2022 Non-photorealistic rendering\n\t\u2022 Image-based measurement and rendering\n\t\u2022 Acquisition of appearance\n\t\u2022 Point-based rendering\n\t\u2022 Real-time rendering and real-time ray tracing\n\t\u2022 Systems and software architecture for rendering\n\t\u2022 Audio/sound rendering\n\n\nThe proceedings of EGSR will be a special issue of the journal Computer Graphics Forum. Because of this there will be a brief second review cycle for any papers that require changes to be accepted; such papers will only be accepted after the changes have been confirmed by the program committee.\n\n\nPromising papers that require more significant revisions may be referred to Computer Graphics Forum for an expedited review.\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\nAll deadlines are 11:00 p.m. Central European Daylight Saving Time (9:00 p.m. UTC).\n\t\u2022 Abstract submission deadline: Tuesday, April 5\n\t\u2022 Paper submission deadline: Friday, April 8\n\t\u2022 Author notification: Saturday, May 14\n\t\u2022 Revised papers due: Tuesday, May 24\n\t\u2022 Camera ready due: Friday, May 27\n\t\u2022 Symposium: June 27 - June 29 (Monday - Wednesday)\n\n\nThe EGSR review and publication process is very short, and to achieve this quick turnaround all deadlines must be strictly observed.\n\n\nInstructions for Submission\n\n\nAll contributions submitted to the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2011 must be original, unpublished work. Any work that has previously been published or simultaneously been submitted in substantially similar form to any other conference or journal will be rejected. Contributions must be written and presented in English.\nOnly electronic submissions will be accepted. Submitted manuscripts should be formatted using the Eurographics publication style proceedings templates, and be anonymized for the double-blind reviewing process.\nPapers should be as long as their content requires, but not longer. Papers with average length requirements are expected to be 8 formatted pages long, including references and all figures; up to 10 pages will be allowed only where justified. During the review process, each paper's contribution will be judged in proportion to its length: a solid contribution described clearly and succinctly is more likely to be accepted than the same result submitted in a longer paper.\nAll submissions must be made through the Eurographics Submission and Review Management system, using the following URL: https://srm.eg.org/SRM_SR201.\n\n\nThe submission deadlines will be strictly enforced. The authors of each accepted paper need to complete and return the EG Copyright Assignment Form before the paper can be published.\n\n\nKeynote Speakers:\n\n\nPeter Shirley, University of Utah / NVIDIA (US)\nMarc Pollefeys, ETH Zurich (CH)\n\n\nProgram Chairs:\n\n\nRavi Ramamoorthi (US)\nErik Reinhard (UK)\n\n\nLocal Organising Chairs:\n\n\nJaroslav K\u0159iv\u00e1nek (CZ),\nJosef Pelik\u00e1n (CZ),\nAlexander Wilkie (CZ)\n\n\n___________________\n\n\n Erik Reinhard\n reinhard at cs.bris.ac.uk\n___________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-April/000311.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000311", "created_by": "Erik_Reinhard"}
