I took \nit as an opportunity to dig deep into my archives and share some \nof the tricks and techniques that I've learned over the last ~14 \nyears of using Radiance (and reading this list).\n\n\nThe talk was today, and for the benefit of his students and you, \nhere are the slides and my speaking notes. I hope you can all \nlearn at least a little something from this, if only what *not* \nto do.\n\n\nhttp://markjstock.com/gsd_talk_11_notes.pdf\n(93 slides, 26 MB)\n\n\nMark\nmstock at umich.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007736.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007736", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
