I have tried a million different things in SketchUp to try to get rid of the uv-mapping problem which is very evident in the attach render.\n\n\nAny suggestions? When exporting a more complicated (sculpture) model, textured with a single \"marble\" albedo map, the same uv-mapping problem is experienced.\n\n\nBest,\nClaus\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image001.jpg at 01CBFDC8.9A35E160]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-April/007768.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007768", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen"}
