You can\ntry to install an older package or use the source from the official website\n(see below).\n\n\nIf you use another system (OS X or Windows) you should check that your\nRAYPATH environment variable is set. Then check that the file is not in the\nfolders listed in RAYPATH.\n\n\nIf you are sure that you don't have the file grab the Radiance source code\nfrom here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/software/rad4R0all.tar.gz\n\n\nExtract the archive, search for the file and place it in one of the folders\nlisted in your RAYPATH. That should do it.\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011/5/4 \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 <sotos.enveng at gmail.com>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007805.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007805", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
