It seems that the\nday when the measurements were obtained was very clear and I would like to\ndecrease the turbidity in gensky to get higher global and vertical\nilluminance.\nWhen I decreased the turbidity from the default of 2.45 to 1 then the\nilluminance decrease, while when I increase -t option then the illuminance\nincrease too. I would actually expect opposite, and that the illuminance\nwill increase with lower turbidity since the turbidity should scattered\nlight more and thus block the direct contribution and increase the diffuse\ncontribution form the sky.\n\n\nHere is the gensky command I am using:\ngensky 9 5 $(printf \"%02d:%02d\" $h $m)CEST -a 55.964875 -o -12.4934 -m -15\n+s -t 1\n\n\nDoes someone have had this problem before? Or is this as gensky should\nworks?\n\n\nThank you\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007806.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007806", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld"}
