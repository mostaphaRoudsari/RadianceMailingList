To save disk space (I have a solid state disk) I have opted not to install X11 for Cygwin, since I will not need ximage or any other X related feature.\n\n\nI am going through the noX11.help file and applying the \"fixes\". Ran into problems (the noX11.help is not quite up to date with the actual line numbers of the Rmakefiles etc. but I can abstract from that) ... concerning the fix I need to apply to src/rt/devtable.c\n\n\nI need to make minor modifications to the code, but I do know what to write instead of \"x11\" when I do not have a Sun nor an SGI machine.\n\n\nBest\nClaus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007812.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007812", "created_by": "Claus_Br\u00f8ndgaard_Madsen"}
