There are lots of options to create geometry for use with \nRadiance. Autocad is one, if you e.g. export dxf and use one of the \navailable converters (see radiance-online.org, strongly recommended!). \nThere are lots of modelers with great support for Radiance, e.g. Blender \nor Sketchup. And anything that exports obj can be used, too.\n\n\n2) For viewers, if you want to view Radiance scenes (octrees), the \ncommonly used tool is rvu (rview). The great thing is that it also \nunderstands all parameters rpict knows. An alternative tool is Peter's \nrshow, but you need to install it first. It should also be listed on \nradiance-online.org. When viewing rendered luminance or illuminance maps \n(aka images), there is a bunch of tools available supporting Radiance's \nrgbe format, which is kind of a standard for high dynamic range imaging \n(HDRI).\n\n\n3) Ecotect: is another (commercial) software. Maybe it used Radiance, \nbut that does not mean that all Radiance users use Ecotect. As you paid \nfor an Ecotect license, you should expect the provider of that tool to \nsupport it, not the community of another, open-source software.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007854.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007854", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
