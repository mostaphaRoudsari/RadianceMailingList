I have a very simple problem that I can't seem to\nsolve, as I'm trying to create the impostor surface.  I'm following the\nexample given in Chapter 5 of the Radiance Bible.  Pg 319 describes the\nuse of ies2rad.  I cannot get ies2rad to work!  I've tried everything I\ncan think of...I've tried putting my IES file in my installation folder,\nI've tried copying ies2rad into a local temporary file and then copied\nmy IES files into the same directory, and running ies2rad.  Everytime, I\nget an error\n\n\nI'm running windows 7.  At the command prompt, I am typing:\n\n\nies2rad -t white -i .56419 LLM154T5.ies\n\n\nthe program always responds:\n<null> No such file or directory\n\n\nI believe ies2rad is working.  If I type in ies2rad I get the following\nresponse:\nies2rad: missing output file specification\n\n\n\n\nI know this is a basic question, but new to me.  Any help would be\nappreciated!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007860.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007860", "created_by": "Chien_Si_Harriman"}
