The rtcontrib command is as\nfollowing. I have run this several times because I split the grid and run\nmore simulations, and it was without problems even running several parallel\nsimulations in same time using same octree. I am submitting calculations on\nour cluster which operating on Sun machines and using GridEngine.\n\n\nrtcontrib @parameters/vmx_illum.opt -f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -fo -o\nresults/vmx_test_grid_illum/%s.vmx \\\n-b kbinW @parameters/west.modifier -b kbinS @parameters/south.modifier -I+\noct/model_vmx.oct < sensors/grid/vmx_grid_test_illum.pts\n\n\nThank you for any suggestions\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007861.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007861", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld"}
