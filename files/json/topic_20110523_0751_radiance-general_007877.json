I generated BSDF matrix by genBSDF.\nI guess that I can still use it but is this message saying that it could be\nwrong or is it more just like a statement that there is literally more light\ncoming to direction 142.\nI generated more of BSDF matrexis and I kept same geometry and changed only\none material which has higher reflectance. I guess that it can be reason but\nI would like to be sure that the BSDF matrix is still reliable.\n\n\nHere is the material description for OLD and NEW (with warning message when\nused)\nNEW material is generated by \"optics2rad\"\nOLD material is generated by script \"glaze\" and \"optics2glazedb\"\n\n\nThank you very much I very appreciate your help\nDavid\n\n\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc OLD\n10\n    sr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b\n    st_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b\n    0 0 0\n    glaze1.cal\n0\n11\n0.0564\n0.0492\n0.051\n0.126\n0.126\n0.126\n0.054\n0.054\n0.054\n    1    .6\n\n\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc NEW\n10\n    rR_clear rG_clear rB_clear\n    0.678*tR_clear   0.655*tG_clear   0.576*tB_clear\n     0 0 0\n     window.cal\n0\n15 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0.267       0.321    0.395\n    0.24        0.306    0.368\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-May/007877.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007877", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld"}
