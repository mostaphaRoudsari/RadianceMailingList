I'm using mingw radiance with a matlab wrapper to make \nstereo stimuli for perceptual experiments. Up until now my illumination \nhas been made by specifying a hemifield of small lights. I'm beginning \nto prepare an experiment which will involve the creation of a larger \nnumber of images, hence I'm trying to speed up my rendering. One option \nseems to be to use gensky to specify a more natural illumination field, \nthis seems to halve my rendering times.\n\n\nHowever, I only get satisfactory reproduction of the shadows when I use \nlow values of ambient accuracy (not surprising). Shadows created with \nnon zero ambient accuracy seem to be interpolated to a certain extent. \nBecause my rendered images form a stereo pair, the differences between \nthe shadows become very noticeable as irregularities in the surface \ndepth, rather than as changes in brightness, this is a problem. I get \nmuch better rendering of the shadows when I  specify an 'aa' value of \nzero. But when I do this the reflectances seem to get messed up. The \nattached images include a series of monochrome tiles towards the bottom, \nthese are linearly spaced in reflectance from 0.2 to 0.8. However for \nthe gensky rendered image with aa set to 0 the darkest tile seems too \ndark. This jump in radiance disappears when I increase aa to 0.1, it \nalso disappears when I change to multiple spherical lights and leave aa \nat zero.\n\n\nSome example images:\n\n\nhttp://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff431/GeorgeLovell/RadianceProblems/SkyType_sphere200Lights_aa_000_ar_0256.png\n\n\n   - Things seem fine, though the rendering takes 780 seconds\n\n\n\n\nhttp://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff431/GeorgeLovell/RadianceProblems/SkyType_gensky_aa_010_ar_0256.png\n\n\n    - Rendering is quicker with gensky but with an aa value of .1 there \nare problems with the shadows.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff431/GeorgeLovell/RadianceProblems/SkyType_gensky_aa_000_ar_0256.png\n\n\n    - Here the darkest tile along the bottom of the image is too dark.\n\n\n\n\nFor reference: the leftmost and middle images form a cross-fuseable \nstereo pair, i.e. you cross your eyes when you look at them left eye \nlooks at the middle image and the right eye looks at the leftmost image \n(this can give you a headache!). The rightmost image can be viewed using \nred/green glasses.\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have a clue why setting aa to zero seems to change the \nbrightness of the darkest tile?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Psychology, University of St Andrews\n\n\n      RM 1.05 (The white room).\n      Phone      (01334) 462090\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007890.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007890", "created_by": "P_George_Lovell"}
