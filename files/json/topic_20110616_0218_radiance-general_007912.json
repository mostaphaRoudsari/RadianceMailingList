Does this mean the\"-n\"  and\"-N npr\"  options are mutually exclusive?\n\n\nSomehow - if you do not do any processing (-n), no processes can be \nstarted (-N npr)... somehow it is confusing, maybe separating the two in \nthe manpage would be clearer. -n also affects all other options in the \nsame way ;-)\n\n\n> 2. Does\"-N 3\"  mean the task to generate an .hdr image will be split into 3 parallel rendering processes by Radiance behind the scene regardless of the number of CPUs and number of\"cores\"  within each CPU of the computer?\n\n\nRadiance does not take your decisions. People on 4core-machines may have \ngood reasons to render on two (and keep the remaining two cores busy \nwith other tasks). So Radiance listens to you and will start as many \nrender processes as you specify by -N 3.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n\n\nNote: I changed the subject line to match the topic.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007912.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007912", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
