I have fixed exposure to 1, brightness\nto 0, gain to 0, and turned the frame rate off.  I have then run multiple\nexposures (10-12) using shutter speeds from 1ms to 8000ms excluding\ncompletely saturated exposures.   I have a fisheye lens attached but have\nnot been able to run vignetting correction yet since I do not trust my\nresponse curve. I have been running accuracy comparisons to my Canon which I\ntrust with poor comparisons.  It is successfully resolving in Photosphere,\nbut only after I manually write the EXIF header since the camera actually\ndoes not write an EXIF header.   I have written camera make, model, f stop,\nand shutter into header.\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nI would be happy to ftp exposures etc if it would help.\n\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Van Den Wymelenberg\nIntegrated Design Lab \u00ad Boise, Director\nCollege of Art & Architecture, Assistant Professor\nUniversity of Idaho \u00ad Boise Center\nwww.uidaho.edu/idl \n\n\nph. 208.724.9456                    fx. 208.343.0001                    306\nS. 6th Street                    Boise, ID  83702\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-June/000330.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000330", "created_by": "Kevin_Van_Den_Wymelenberg"}
