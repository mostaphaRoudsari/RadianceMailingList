I would like to crop the .pic file so that it corresponds to\nimages with a 60 and 120 degree cone of vision to in order to\ncalculate luminance ratios for the task and surround area,\nrespectively. In other words, I was just thinking of cropping the 180\ndegree fisheye view to two smaller circles.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nKrystyna\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007924.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007924", "created_by": "Krystyna_Zelenay"}
