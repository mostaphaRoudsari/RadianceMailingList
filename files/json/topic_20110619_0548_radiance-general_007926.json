During this period, you can do nothing in the Python Shell...\n\n\nSo, is there a way to use Python to call the Terminal and \"paste\" the rad\ncommand string into the Terminal and then run rad? In this way, Python is\nfreed from the rad rendering process once it's be activated in the Terminal.\n\n\n\n\nAppreciate your advices!\n\n\n(using Mac OS 10.6.7, Radiance 4, and Python 2.6.5)\n\n\nJi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-June/007926.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007926", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
