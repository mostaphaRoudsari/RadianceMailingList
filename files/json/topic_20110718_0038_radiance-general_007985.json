Postgraduate students. Need your help on installing RADIANCE into my laptop. I'm using MacBook Mac OS X 10.6.7. \n\n\nRead and follow instruction from RAdsite lbnl website and various forum and other websites showing instruction on installing the software. Unfortunately i'm lost and totally black out. \n\n\nHonestly I do not know where to start, such as... where to type a command... Have tried XAMPP command as suggested but failed to execute or unzip the mentioned files/folder. \n\n\nI've done the very first part of downloading the rad4R0all.tar.gz. (is it as simple as clicking the address, then it goes to your \"downloads\" folder, then double click, so from rad4r0_macosx-1.tar turn to a folder of rad4R0_macosx). Then? How to unpack or to be specific where to type this unzip<rad4roall.tar.gz....... \n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulitta Yunus\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007985.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_007985", "created_by": "Julitta_Yunus"}
