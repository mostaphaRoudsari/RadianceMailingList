Perhaps you need to log off and log on again to get the\n> effect of the new settings. Try that first. If that doesn't help we can move\n> your installation to \"/usr/local\". That's works just as well and it's\n> already in your $PATH.\n\n\nYes I already log off and log on again. Then, i repeat each command\necho $PATHwhich rtrace\nI got the same result as yesterday. What should I do now?\n\n\nTQJulitta\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008006.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008006", "created_by": "Julitta_Y"}
