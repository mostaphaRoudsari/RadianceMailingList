I do not have \na Mac available right now.\n\n\nAlso, do you type commands into the window opening when you start the \nX11 application, or do you type in the Terminal application window? I \nthink Thomas posted a great Mac-specific tutorial, which may vary from \nmy more generic unix-like experiences. So these details may be of \nimportance here.\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008011.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008011", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
