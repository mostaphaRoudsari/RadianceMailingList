{"topic": "Does the \"direct horizontal irradiance\" in GenCumulativeSky mean the \"direct normal radiation\" in .epw weather file?", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "July 21, 2011 at 03:41AM", "body": "Dear Radiance experts,\n\n\nAccording to the \"Solar Irradiation Modeling\" document inside the\nGenCumulativeSky package (downloaded from\nhttps://documents.epfl.ch/groups/u/ur/urbansimulation/www/GenCumSky/GenCumSky.zip),\nthe GenCumulativeSky.exe program needs a climate file containing two columns\nof data, the first column being either the \"global horizontal irradiance\" or\n\"direct horizontal irradiance\" and the second column being the \"diffused\nhorizontal irradiance\".\n\n\nIn a typical EnergyPlus weather file (.epw file), there's the hourly data on\n\"global horizontal radiation\", \"direct normal radiation\" and \"diffuse\nhorizontal radiation\".\n\n\nMay I ask:* Is the \"direct horizontal irradiance\" as required by\nGenCumulativeSky the same as the \"direct normal radiation\" as recorded in\nthe EnergyPlus weather file?*\n\n\n\n\nTo my understanding, the \"direct normal radiation\" means the \"amount of\nsolar radiation in Wh/m2 received within a 5.7\u00b0 field of view centered on\nthe sun\" (refer to http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/tab3-2.html).\n\n\nSo, the \"effective\" direct horizontal irradiance, or the effective solar\nradiation falling vertically on a horizontal surface, should be a\ncosine-weighted \"direct normal radiation\" according to the solar elevation\nangle at a given time. Therefore, the \"direct horizontal irradiance\" as\nrequired by GenCumulativeSky does NOT mean the same as the \"direct normal\nradiation\" as recorded in the EnergyPlus weather file.\n\n\nClarification is appreciated!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008024.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008024", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
