We are developing a   \u201chazard  detection\u201d module,  for use by designers and architects, which is now in the validation phase.  Automated results, based on Radiance renderings and data sets, are being correlated with live subject experiments.\n            I have exhausted the modest sized, detailed models which I have built over the past decades and seek additional models which include features such as arches, columns, steps, ramps, furniture,  interesting patterns, etc. Images will be produced for presentation to subjects and for analysis. These will remain in-house unless we request permission for publication.\n\n\nPlease contact me directly if you are able to contribute to the project. Ideally a data set includes all scene and lighting descriptions,  a RIF file,   a few images of the environment and an overview to your data structure.\n\n\nshakespe at indiana.edu\n\n\nThis work is supported by the National Eye Institute of the NIH 1 R01 EY017835-01.\n\n\nThanks! See you at the 2011 workshop.\n\n\nRob\n\n\nRob Shakespeare, Professor of Lighting Design\nHead of Design and Technology\nDepartment of Theatre and Drama\nIndiana University\n275 North Jordan Avenue\nBloomington, IN 47405\n\n\nshakespe at indiana.edu\n812-855-4367\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/008026.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008026", "created_by": "Robert_A._Shakespeare"}
