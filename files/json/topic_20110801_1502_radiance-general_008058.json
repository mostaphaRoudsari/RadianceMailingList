(A bit to my\nsupprise.)\n\n\nI have: Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits.\n\n\nI followed the guideline on the Radiance Wiki site:\n./makeall install in ray folder\nchosing ~/radiance/bin installs on Windows in C:\\user\\yourname\\radiance\\bin\nI choose option 2) Linux (seems to be the best option).\n\n\nI encountered three problems, here are they, with solution.\n\n\nProblem 1: (Seems to be related to 64 bit system with 32 bit gcc and 64 bit\nor wrong archiver)\nThis is the error:\nError code 127\nAR_LIBRARIAN environment variable\n\n\nSolution:\nAdd: export PATH=\"/opt/gcc.4.2/bin:${PATH}\" to\nC:\\windows\\SUA\\etc\\profile.lcl\nAlso see: http://www.suacommunity.com/forum/tm.aspx?m=16624 for more\ndetailled info.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2:\nMaking programs...\n/dev/fs/C/Windows/SUA/usr/examples/radiance/ray/src/common\n/dev/fs/C/Windows/SUA\n/usr/examples/radiance/ray/src\nIn directory common...\ngcc -Dlinux -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/lib/x86 -L/usr/lib/x86\n-L/usr/local/li\nb/ray -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO -O2 -c ezxml.c\nezxml.c: In function 'ezxml_parse_fd':\nezxml.c:647: error: '_SC_PAGESIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)\nezxml.c:647: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once\nezxml.c:647: error: for each function it appears in.)\n*** Error code 1 (continuing)\n`install' not remade because of errors.\n\n\nSolution: Included: #define EZXML_NOMMAP in ezxml.c\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3:\nIn directory rt...\ngcc -I../common -L../lib -O2 -Dlinux -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/lib/x86\n-L/us\nr/lib/x86 -L/usr/local/lib/ray -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO -o ./rtrace\nrtmain.\no rtrace.o duphead.o persist.o ../lib/libraycalls.a ../lib/libradiance.a\n-lrtrad\n -lm\n../lib/librtrad.a(header.o):header.c:(.text+0x5b4): undefined reference to\n`_tim\negm'\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n*** Error code 1 (continuing)\n\n\nSolution: Included timegm.o in src/common/Rmakefile\nLike:\nUTLOBJ = ezxml.o ccolor.o ccyrgb.o bsdf.o bsdf_m.o bsdf_t.o loadbsdf.o \\\n disk2square.o hilbert.o timegm.o\n\n\nThat's all, after that I ran gendaylit and Mark Stock's benchmark test\nsuite, and all works.\n\n\nStill need to install an XServer (Xming) and a NFS server (included in\nWindows 7 Ultimate).\nAnd run some more tests including rvu, trad, falsecolor, rpiece.\n\n\nI hope this is usefull,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008058.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008058", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen"}
