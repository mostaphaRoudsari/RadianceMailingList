HDR panos are generated with Hugin, and Blender is chosen\nfor the modelling and rendering. To facilitate HDR rendering in\nBlender, they devoloped the LiVi plug-in for Blender, which does work\nwith the latest version of Blender.\n\n\nThe project is well documented, and there are even some video\ntutorials on their site that demonstated how HDR panos are created,\nand how the LiVi Radiance rendering works.\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008063.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008063", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
