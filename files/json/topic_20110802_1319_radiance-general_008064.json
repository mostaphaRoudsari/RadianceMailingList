The reason why I am doing this is because I need to keep the model simple and easy to model parametrically. The aim is to get something similar to what is shown in picture example.tiff.\n\n\nThe idea is to use cutoff angles to decide whether or not light goes through the plan (as it does with the actual mesh).\n\n\nIn order to achieve this I set up a vertical plan and gave to it the following material definition which calls the attached cal file (mesh.cal):\n\n\nvoid BRTDfunc test\n10\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\ntest_combo test_combo test_combo\ntest.cal\n0\n9\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\n\nBut it doesn't seem to work.\n\n\nI played with all sort of parameters but it seems to  behave always the same regardless of different cutoff angles declared in the calc file.\n\n\nI also tried with this material definition:\n\n\nvoid plasfunc test\n2 test_combo test.cal\n0\n4 0 0 0 1\n\n\nAnd it works as expected, hence, the calc file seems to work.\n\n\nAny idea on what I am doing wrong or I am missing? Any idea on how to achieve the desired result?\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\n\nLucio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008064.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008064", "created_by": "Lucio_Boscolo"}
