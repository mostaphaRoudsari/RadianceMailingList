Anyways, even from the schedule, \nit is really nice to see a coherent terminology finally - no more \nBTDF/BRDF/BRTDF (or all of these without F), just BSDF everywhere. \nSomehow I do not like the F (as the abbrevation is usually not used to \ndescribe a function but discrete data, as Jacob just demonstrated when \ntalking about measurements), but it is still less confusing like that. \nMaybe the Radiance community will be the first having such a stringent \nterminology :-) I am excited to see the coming presentations...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-August/008123.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008123", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
