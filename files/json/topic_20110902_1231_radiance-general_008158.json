Currently our office uses Vectorworks  (we are a MAC based office), and we would like to convert 3D models to use for daylighting studies with Radiance software. I am unsure how to convert to a file that Radiance can use. Are you aware of how I can explore the file? Have others ran into this issue before? I have heard people have used sketchup models to be used with Radiance. \n\n\nAny information you could provide me with would be VERY VERY helpful.\n\n\nRachelle Lemieux\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008158.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008158", "created_by": "Rachelle_Lemieux"}
