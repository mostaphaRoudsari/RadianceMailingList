The update was compiled under 10.6.8 but seems to work under 10.7.2.  \n\n\nTwo versions are in the package: \n\n\n(a) Version 2.0\nThis version has been updated and supported under Canon EOS SDK version 2.9. The package has been compiled under Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) as an universal binary, BACKWARDS compatible up to Mac OS X version 10.4.x (Tiger). Compatible to latest camera model up to EOS 60D, NOT EOS 600D and EOS 1100D.\n\n\n(b) Version 2.1\nThis version has been updated and supported under Canon EOS SDK version 2.10. The package has been compiled under Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) as an universal binary, BACKWARDS compatible up to Mac OS X version 10.5.x (Leopard). Compatible to latest camera model up to EOS 600D and EOS 1100D.\n\n\nTesting has been limited so please report successes and failures to Denis Fan and John Mardaljevic - include camera model number in any reports.  HDRcapOSX Version 2.1 was (briefly) tested under 10.7.2 with a Canon EOS 400D and seemed to work fine.\n\n\nDownload here:\nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:hdrcaposx\n\n\nBest\nJohn Mardaljevic\n\n\nReader in Daylight Modelling\nInstitute of Energy and Sustainable Development\nDe Montfort University\nThe Gateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, UK\nTel: +44 (0) 116 257 7972   \n\n\njm at dmu.ac.uk   \nhttp://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm\nhttp://dmu.academia.edu/JohnMardaljevic\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2011-October/000336.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000336", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
