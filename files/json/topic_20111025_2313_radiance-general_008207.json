Firstly, the images combined with dctimestep are very speckly, and many of the patch images are very speckly as well, some with only a handful of dots. Do I need to direct rays from the sky patch directly to the windows and ignore all other directions? How can I do that? I'm unsure which parameters affect this most. \n\n\nThe other issue is that there are strange colours in different rays. The combined result has bands of colour whereas the model has almost no colour in it at all. The materials are all grey. What might cause this? Command sequence and image below. \n\n\nvwrays -ff -vf views/EIn.vf -x 800 -y 800 | rtcontrib -i -ab 4 -ds 0.05 -dj .7 -ad 4096 -lw 2e-4 -n 2 -ffc $(vwrays -d -vf views/EIn.vf -x 800 -y 800) -e MF:2 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -V+ -fo -o images/patchesEI/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w octrees/top1.oct \n\n\nThird issue: I've been running this successfully, but sometimes when I run it, the patch images are created, but then nothing seems to happen. There is one rtcontrib process and four rtrace processes visible in the activity monitor, but none of them are using any of the CPUs and the patch images are stuck on 4KB. Normally when I run it I get two rtrace processes using about 95% of the CPUs. (This is on a MacBook Pro with two cores). I cntrl-C out and then try again and get the same thing. \n\n\nThanks in advance. \n\n\nJohn.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-October/008207.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008207", "created_by": "John_Ford"}
