I seem to only be able to get direct horizontal irradiance (Ees, according to the glossary) rather than direct normal irradiance (Eesn) from the Satel-light database. \n\n\nCan I just divide the direct horizontal irradiance by cos(altitude) to get the direct normal irradiance? Is that valid?\n\n\nJohn Ford.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008216.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008216", "created_by": "John_Ford"}
