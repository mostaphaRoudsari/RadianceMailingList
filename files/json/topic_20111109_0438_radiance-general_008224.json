I tried to understand\nsomething from manpage but no sucess.\n\n\nIs this the right way to model complex blind lamela (it has few curvatures\nand w shape etc.)?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008224.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008224", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
