Should these blinds be treated as\none unit and calculated common BSDF for them; or separated and then\nseparate BSDF surfaces included in Radiance model?\n\n\n#######\nIn BSDF material definition\n\n\nmod BSDF id\n6+ thick BSDFfile ux uy uz funcfile transform\n0\n0|3|6|9 rfdif gfdif bfdif rbdif gbdif bbdif rtdif gtdif btdif\n\n\n\"An optional 'transform' is used to scale the thickness and reorient\nthe up vector. \" What does this exactly mean?\n\n\nFor example if input to genBSDF was defined in cm and my scene is in\nm, which units should be used for thickness and what should be put as\ntransformation.\n\n\n\n\nHope my questions are clear enough :)\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008247.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008247", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
