Do\nwe have any scale for that or all the studies target the interior spaces so\nfar.\n\n\nOne way came to my mind is to start from the adjacent buildings and then\ncalculate backward. Is there a better way to do that?\n\n\nBest,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008255.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008255", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
