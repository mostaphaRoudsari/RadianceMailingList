I would like to model them transmitting about 20% of light and make the canopy 40% reflective.\n\t* Can I do this by using a translucent material?\u00a0\n\t* If so, can you point me to a tutorial?\n\t* Will this be compatible with the 3-phase method of daylighting analysis? (I.e., daylight coefficient method with the 3-phase method and a BSDF for the window).\n\n\nThanks for any help,\nTim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008268.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008268", "created_by": "Tim_Perry"}
