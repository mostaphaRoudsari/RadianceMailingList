I generated\nimages by three phase method, unfortunately header of those images does not\ninclude view information, which I think that evalglare looks for\nexplicitly.\nI have tried to change the image header just in text editor but it  did not\nwork and demage the image. I would like to ask how to change the header, I\nknow that it may be trivial but I did spend some time on it already and did\nnot find how to do it yet.\n\n\nThank you for all advices.\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008280.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008280", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld"}
