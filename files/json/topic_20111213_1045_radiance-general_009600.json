I will be expanding my research focus to the awakening field of urban energy modeling, working on a coherent theory and toolset for architects, urban planners and policymakers. We have started this process last term in a class in which we developed a new Rhino based tool that calculates operational energy use for multiple buildings using E+ along with scripts to calculate walkscore and urban daylight availability distributions. I will be sharing links to the tool as well as selected student projects in late January.\n\n\nThere is a lot of work to be done so, if you know any creative minds interested in doing graduate work at the interface between design and building science, please make them aware of our program.\n\n\nWarm regards and season's greetings,\n\n\nChristoph\n\n\nStarting January 2012\nChristoph Reinhart, Dr. Ing.\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 1876, f: 617 253 6152, tito_ at mit.edu<mailto:tito_ at mit.edu>\nHome<http://architecture.mit.edu/user/christoph-reinhart> | DIVA<http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://www.daysim.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/009600.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009600", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
