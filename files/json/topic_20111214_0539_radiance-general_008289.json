Output geometry is made of\n'light' material\n\n\nmkillum -ab 0:\n*-which sky/sun/reflected components are taken as input for mkillum?*\n\n\nmkillum -ab 1:\n-direct light from sky is included\n-indirect solar component (once reflected from ground or some other object)\n\n\nmkillum -av 0 0 0:\n-what does this give us (I know that -av should be 'ground ambient level'\nfrom gensky?\n\n\n####\nTo explain why do I need such strange mkillum parameters\n\n\nMy idea is to get light patch, coming from the sun and reflected from\nspecular deflector surface into the room, but to exclude all other\ninfluences  - direct light coming from sky or sun, or reflected light from\noutside/inside surfaces.\nI modeled deflector as mirror with alternative metal material with\nappropriate reflectance/specularity.\n\n\n*I want to get completely black image with reflected light patch only, so I\ncan sum images from various time moments during day/year and show light\npatch moving for some period of time.*\n\n\nTo get image with specularly reflected light only:\n1. I defined sky with sun only (no diffuse sky or ground sources)\n2. Calculated mkillum -ab 0 -av 0 0 0 (l+ option) for my deflector surface\n3. Used mkillum output in new octree as only light source (removed sun\ndefinition)\n4. Calculated image with rpict -ab 0 -av 0 0 0\nProblem is that beside direct light patch inside  the test room, I still\nget some light on surfaces above/below my deflector surface.\n\n\nEven when I repeat calculation for sun behind my surface (so no direct\nlight on surface), my output from mkillum has some small radiance, and I\nget some luminance on surfaces below/above deflector.\n\n\nAny ideas are welcome?\n\n\nI hope I managed to explain what I want, and which method I try to use to\nget results (unsuccessfully for now :( )\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008289.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008289", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
