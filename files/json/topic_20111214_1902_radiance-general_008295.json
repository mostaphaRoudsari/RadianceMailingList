I think it might be\npossible if the cosine-correction process for light meter is modifiable. Do\nyou have any idea?\n\n\nBest,\nMinki\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-December/008295.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008295", "created_by": "Minki_Sung"}
