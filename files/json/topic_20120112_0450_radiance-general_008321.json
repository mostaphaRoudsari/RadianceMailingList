My\nmodel was built and imported into Ecotect and then exported to Radiance for\nlighting analysis. The Radiance-calculated value for luminance (cdm-2) are\nsimilar to what I measured on-site. However, once I exported my model to\nRadiance for illuminance calculations (lux),  the lux values were ten times\nhigher than what I measured from the site! Can anyone advise what might go\nwrong with my simulation? The simulation was conducted for a night time\nscenario and with artificial lighting only. Does Radiance take into account\nthe luminous efficacy of the lamps? I read other threads too and it seems\nthat the default luminous efficacy value is set to 179 and that is for\ndaylit condition. However, a general efficacy value for, say, incandescent\nlamp is 14. I do not know where to set the luminous efficacy in\nEcotect/Radiance and I am not sure if this is the reason why the computed\nlux values are approximately ten times higher than in the reality?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Thanks,\n\n\nvil\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008321.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008321", "created_by": "Villian_Wing-Lam_LO"}
