Is this histogram RGB applying the weighting factor\n( R*0.2651 + G* 0.6701 + B*0.0648) to determine the Minimum and Maximum\nvalues reported?\n\n\n2) Does Photosphere expect the multiple exposures to be loaded sequentially\nfrom the brightest (longest shutter speed) to the darkest (shortest shutter\nspeed) or vice versa?  Will the accuracy be compromised in any manner\ndepending on the order in which the exposures are loaded?\n\n\nThank you, \n\n\n\n\nKevin Van Den Wymelenberg\nIntegrated Design Lab \u00ad Boise, Director\nCollege of Art & Architecture, Assistant Professor\nUniversity of Idaho \u00ad Boise Center\nwww.uidaho.edu/idl \n\n\nph. 208.724.9456                    fx. 208.343.0001                    306\nS. 6th Street                    Boise, ID  83702\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-January/000341.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000341", "created_by": "Kevin_Van_Den_Wymelenberg"}
