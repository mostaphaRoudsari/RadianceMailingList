When rpict is run\nthrough rpiece, the image is split up into tiles, each of which is\nrendered in a separate thread. The tiles are then pcomposed into the\nfinal image. The width of the final image is xdim = tilex * xdiv,\nwhere tilex is computed by rpiece. Since tilex needs to be an int, it\nis actually calculated as floor(xdim / xdiv). If the requested xdim is\nnot divisible by xdiv, xdim of an image generated by rpiece will be\nsmaller than xdim of an image with exactly the same -v*, -x and -y\ngenerated by rpict. Same goes for the height of of the image...\n\n\nI have stumbled across this a few times now. Admittedly, I tend to use\nrpictmt from http://www.bakharev.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=38,\nwhich is a convenient wrapper around rpiece, although it makes no\ndifference to the problem at hand.\n\n\nSo my feature request is actually a warning request: Could rpiece\noutput a warning like:\n\"warning: requested image size of xdim x ydim reduced to xdim1 x\nydim1\" to stderr.\nIt would be even cooler if the last tile within a row had its tilex\nadjusted so that the final image comes out exacly like an rpict one\n(ditto for tiley for all tiles within the last row), but this is\nprobably more difficult to implement, otherwise I guess you would have\ndone it already.\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-January/001160.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001160", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
