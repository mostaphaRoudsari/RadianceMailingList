I am using a version of esp-r compiled from the source code and I can open a radiance desktop from there, however that does not seem to work properly at the moment. Does any of you know what the problem may be? I am thinking of installing a window version of radiance, do you know how to make it work with esp-r? Let me know, I look forward to hearing from you,\n\n\nRegards,\nArianna\n\n\nArianna Sdei\nArchitect, MPhil (Cantab)\nUniversity of Brighton\nResearch Fellow, IFORE Project\nPhD Fellow\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008325.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008325", "created_by": "Arianna_Sdei"}
