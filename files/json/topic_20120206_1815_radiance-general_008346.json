Is there a way that we can use these \nimages for glare analysis in evalglare? The evalglare description says \nthat it only accepts fisheye images. There is a tutorial from Harvard \nGSD (Doyle and Reihart) that shows a non-fisheye photo in evalglare: \nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/HDR_III_Evalglare.pdf\n\n\nI am wondering whether this can be done at all.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nEry\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008346.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008346", "created_by": "Ery_Djunaedy"}
