It would be great if you\ncan offer your insights.\n\n\nQ1. I am trying to use MinGW version of Radiance in Windows (XP-vpc/7).\nEverything seems to work as expected but protate command. The command\nerrors out with a \"read error\". This command seems to work fine and dumps\nout expected results when I use it from Desktop Radiance installation. Has\nanyone faced such issues with protate and is there a solution for MinGW\ninstallation? Or am I missing something?\n\n\nQ2. I was wondering if I can use pinterp to translate an angular\nprojection/fisheye image to a panorama. If yes, what should I watch out for\nand how can this be done? If not, why not?\n\n\nThanks,\nViswanathan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008356.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008356", "created_by": "Viswanathan_Kumaragurubaran"}
