The \nimage that I have is a rectangular image, with the fisheye circle in the \nmiddle. When I use the above command, the result is always a square.\n\n\nMy question: is the interpolation also applied to the black region on \nthe left and right side of the fisheye circle?\n\n\nI tried to crop the input hdr to square with the following command (from \n5616x3744 to 3744x3744 pixels):\n\n\nra_xyze -r -u -o fisheye.hdr | pcompos -x 3744 - -936 0 > fisheye_crop.hdr\n\n\nBut when I use fisheye_crop.hdr as an input to the pinterp command, it \ngives a \"bad view file\"error. Does this simply confirm that man page \nthat the output of pcompos cannot be used with pinterp?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nEry\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008363.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008363", "created_by": "Ery_Djunaedy"}
