(version \n1.0).\n\n\nFollowing main changes are included (see also the short documentation \nwhich is included in the package) :\n\n\n-all current view types will be supported (except parallel view) - that \nmeans also -vth !\n-valid view is checked (many problems occurred, because often users \ntreat the image with programs like pcompos before putting into \nevalglare. But then, the view got lost and a wrong view leads to totally \nwrong results! Now this will be handled by the new evalglare )\n-view options can be provided also per command line option\n-disability glare is also calculated\n-cut-out the \"Guth\" visual field\n-extension of the DGP equation for low-brightness scenes (Ev<380lux) , \nbased on new user assessments\n\n\nThe main routines for glare source detection and calculation of the \nglare values are not changed.\n\n\nAnyhow I strongly recommend to use from now on only the new version, \nbecause the issue with non valid views can cause many troubles and wrong \nvalues.\n(and I guess many people use it and run into that problem and got wrong \nvalues without knowing it!!).\n\n\nYou can download the new version here:\n\n\nhttp://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance\n\n\ngood luck and an always glare free environment... ,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
