My questions are:\n\n\n\n\n-          Is Radiance the best simulation tool available for the object I want to simulate?\n\n\n-          How would you conceptually implement a louvered skylights with motion?\n\n\nThanks for your attention,\nand Best Regards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefano Moret\nCalifornia Lighting Technology Center<http://cltc.ucdavis.edu/>\nUniversity of California, Davis\n633 Pena Drive\nDavis, CA 95618\n\n\n510-520-7923\nsmoret at ucdavis.edu<mailto:smoret at ad3.ucdavis.edu>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-February/008429.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008429", "created_by": "Stefano_Moret"}
