But it seems like there are many uncertainties.\n\n\nIn HDRI second edition book it says \"The darkest exposure should have no\nRGB values greater than 200 or so, and the lightest exposure should have no\nRGB values less than 20 or so. Do NOT include an excess of exposures beyond\nthis range, as it will do nothing to help with the response recovery and\nmay hurt.\"\nI assume it is the same for any HDRI sequence, not only for response curve.\n\n\nI have plenty of photos of dark exposures that have no values greater than\n200, same with the light exposures and 20.If somebody can clarify what\nphotos should be included or have any other suggestions that would be great\n\n\nThank you,\n*Yulia *\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000385.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000385", "created_by": "Yulia_Tyukhova"}
