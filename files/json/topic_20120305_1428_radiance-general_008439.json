The website will replace the existing radiance-online.org and will absorb radsite.lbl.gov.  \n\n\nThe beta version of the new site is http://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/  (this is a non-standard port, so it may be blocked by your company's firewall - if so try accessing it from home).\n\n\nLBNL has no funding for this activity, it is officially a community generated site.  We've worked on our own time to get a decent framework.  To speed things up I ask for your help to add content and develop the site further.  The site uses Plone, users can register themselves.  If you are interested in adding content let me know and I will promote you to contributor.\n\n\nAlso, I appreciate recommendations for platforms that allow sharing files (ie models, scripts etc.) with comments and ratings.  I'm not satisfied with Plone's capability in this area. \n\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008439.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008439", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
