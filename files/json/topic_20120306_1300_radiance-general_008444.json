Or better yet, anyone out there with greater math skills than I know how to derive disk luminance from direct normal radiation found in a weather file? \n\n\nThanks! \n\n\nMike\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008444.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008444", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez"}
