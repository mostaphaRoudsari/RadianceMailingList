How could I extract the luminance values from image.hdr?\n\n\nWith the pvalue tool I get RGB values. And in August 2007 thread Greg\nmentioned this (to get L):\n% pvalue -h -H -b render.pic \\\n\n\n\t\t| rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=179*$3'\n\n\nBut I would assume this is for .pic files. Is there a way how I can get it\nfrom .hdr that was already calibrated in Photosphere?\n\n\n2. How is a standard deviation calculated in Photosphere? What does 1.1x\nmean? I would expect to see number closer to the luminance value displayed\nin the image.\n\n\n3. In June 2009 thread there was a discussion on averaging luminance values\nwithing the circular area. From anybody's experience, what is the easiest\nway to get average L value from hdr image within the circle area?\n\n\nThank you for all your help,\n*Yulia*\n*\n*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-March/000399.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000399", "created_by": "Yulia_Tyukhova"}
