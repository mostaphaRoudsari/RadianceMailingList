I'm not well versed in the usage of  \n'pcomb' but I'm assuming I'll need to somehow create a mask based on  \nboth color and brightness thresholds.  It seems from my archive search  \nthat a call to 'pgblur' with a high radius might help in defining  \nsharper boundaries between clouds and blue sky.
