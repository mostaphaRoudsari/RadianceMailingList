I just wanted to get a scale -s 100 -n 10 (i.e.\n5, 15, ..., 95)\nand here the last line \"5\" (the only digit in this case) is removed.\n\n\nI don't work with perl and thus don't really have a clue what's going on.\nHowever,\nreplacing the lines 280-282\n\n\n    open PSIGN, \"| psign -s -.15 -cf 1 1 1 -cb 0 0 0 -h $sheight > $slabpic\";\n    print PSIGN \"$text\";\n    close PSIGN;\n\n\nwith the lines as in the version before (v. 2.5)\n\n\n    $cmd = \"echo '$text' | psign -s -.15 -cf 1 1 1 -cb 0 0 0\";\n    $cmd .= \" -h $sheight > $slabpic\";\n    system $cmd;\n\n\n\n\nsolves the problem...\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-March/001193.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001193", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder"}
