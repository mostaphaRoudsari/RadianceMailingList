I am getting the following\nerror message in the dos window:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"rtrace: fatal - command line error at '-sj'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich then results in no data being written to the grid file. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition I cannot recall how to reinstall everything to its original\nstate as it was operating before installing DIVA for Rhino. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny help with this would be appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nBayanda\n\n\nBAS (UCT)\n\n\nGreen Star SA Accredited Professional\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPJ Carew Consulting\n\n\n3rd floor 71 buitengraght Cape Town 8001\n\n\ntel: 021 426 4051  fax: 021 426 5050  cell: 083 335 9365\n\n\n <mailto:bayanda at pjc.co.za> bayanda at pjc.co.za    <http://www.pjc.co.za/>\nwww.pjc.co.za\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008482.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008482", "created_by": "Bayanda_Mpauli"}
