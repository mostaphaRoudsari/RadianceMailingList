The new one is more quantitative, which should help \ngetting the message to folks not so familiar with BRDFs. Feedback as to \nthat aim is appreciated, on- or off-list.\n\n\nFor those newer on the list, here's last year's talk which mentions the \nbme data:  \nhttp://www.pab-opto.de/radiance/vortrag_september_2011/brtf-talk-2011.web.pdf \n\n\n\n\nAnd while we're at it: Anyone actually used that data to motivate or \ntest other BSDF models in Radiance (or other renderers) ?\n\n\nthanks, best\nPeter\n\n\n\n\npab advanced technologies Ltd, http://www.pab.eu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001200.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001200", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
