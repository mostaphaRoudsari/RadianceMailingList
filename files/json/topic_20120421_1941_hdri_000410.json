Both methods seem to work although  \nI'm still a bit confused on the ASA setting.\n\n\nGreg, in your comment:\n> Usually the only information missing is the ASA, and this can  \n> usually be solved by choosing an ASA that is 1 EV higher.\n\n\nDo you have an example you might be able to offer that I can work  \nfrom?  I'm not sure how to work out an ASA from an exposure value.   \nWould the ASA value change with each bracketed exposure?  I'm still  \nscratching my brain cells around some of this and am not sure yet how  \nto interrupt sensor sensitivity from these Machine Video cameras and  \nthe various settings the interface allows one to control.\n\n\nThanks again!\n\n\nCheers,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-April/000410.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000410", "created_by": "Christian_Humann"}
