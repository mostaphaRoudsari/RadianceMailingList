I checked\nif using the else-branch there (i.e. \"mmap failed, read file into memory\")\nsolves the problem --\nyes and no. The process throws other errors then:\n\n\n*rvu: warning - Illegal argument: BSDF \"test\": unsupported\nIncidentDataStructure for BSDF \"tst\"*\n(for a Klems matrix BSDF)\n\n\n*rvu: warning - Illegal argument for BSDF \"test\"*\n(for a variable resolution BSDF isotropic and anisotropic)\n\n\nThe line numbers refer to the current head version...\n\n\nAny clue what's going on here??\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-April/001202.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001202", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder"}
