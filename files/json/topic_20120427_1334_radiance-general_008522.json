The obtained effect is a uniform and diffuse light transmittance. The only technical data that I have are: 30% of direct visible transmittance  and 15% of diffuse visible transmittance. I think I should model it with \"trans\" material, but I don't know which parameters I have to use. Does anybody has an idea?\nThanks in advance. Best regards,\nValeria\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-April/008522.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008522", "created_by": "Valeria_De_Giuli"}
