I really like the new rvu on Windows.\n\n\nI just tried it on Windows 7 64 bits\n\n\nA few remarks:\n\n\nIn rvu\n\n\n-selecting load view (file viewpoint.vp) contents: -vp -.5 -5 1.15 -vd 0.5\n5 0 doesn't set the viewparameters (it doesn't do anything).\n\n\nAfter manually setting a view\n-selecting load view and pressing cancel 'resets' the view and rvu\nrecalculates from a random viewpoint, doing it again (select load view and\npress cancel) goes back to the manually entered view before and\nrecalculates.\n\n\n-selecting file -> Load .rif doesn't do anything.\n\n\n-selecting parameter: some values could be expained a bit more, for example\nte first tab ambient has in the first column value: 0 0 0 (I don't know\nwhich values are required).\n\n\nIt looks like it is possible to set the environmental path on Windows\ndirectly in the NSIS installer:\n\n\nhttp://nsis.sourceforge.net/Environmental_Variables:_append,_prepend,_and_remove_entries\n(The old MnGW installer offered at: http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ did\nalso set the environment variables).\n\n\nOne question: are you sure you want to include rpiece in the\nWindows installer? Since for Windows at compile-time the only message\npossible by rpiece is the one about the missing NFS-manager.\nTo get rpiece working on Windows one would have rewrite (at least) the part\nabout file locking since Windows does this differently from other OS.\n(It would be great to see rpiece working on Windows too!).\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nGuy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-May/001225.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001225", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen"}
