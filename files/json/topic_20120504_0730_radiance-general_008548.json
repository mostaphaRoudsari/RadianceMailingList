I would like to use a brightfunc with a cal-file that returns a value depending on an environment variable set by a script. I want the evaluation based on that variable to happen at render time, so I cannot use sed to modify my files directly. I tried to use command expansion (third line of my brightdata as ! echo \"1 $ALPHA\"), but that does not work. I could generate the whole modifier definition by an echo command (!echo \"void brightdata myBDModifier \u2026 1 $ALPHA), but that would become an ugly scene file\u2026\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008548.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008548", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
