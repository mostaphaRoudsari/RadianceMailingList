When I visualize an octree with rvu I usually set -av and -ab as first parameters.\nAs far as I understand, the \"ambient value\" should set the brightness of the scene, but I don't see any change by setting it to different values, and to get a nice image I usually use the -pe option to set the exposure.\nCould you please enlighten me on the usage of \"ambient vale\" option to get a good exposure in my images?\n\n\nThanks,\nStefano\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefano Moret\nCalifornia Lighting Technology Center<http://cltc.ucdavis.edu/>\nUniversity of California, Davis\n633 Pena Drive\nDavis, CA 95618\n\n\n530-747-3846\nsmoret at ucdavis.edu<mailto:smoret at ad3.ucdavis.edu>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008561.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008561", "created_by": "Stefano_Moret"}
