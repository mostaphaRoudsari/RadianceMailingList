How exactly is that done??\nUnfortunately I did\nnot have time yet to dig deeper into the BSDF-code to find that out...\n\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-May/001229.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001229", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder"}
