This value should be between 1 and 80, where 1 takes the\nlongest and produces the best results in small areas of the image.\"\nSo I've chosen 20, as some optimal value to get good gif images and not too\nlong time.\nI thought that lower -n values would require more memory, but in this case\nthey give correct results, and higher values give memory error.\n\n\nNot sure what can be the source of the problem.\n\n\nAny ideas?\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008570.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008570", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
