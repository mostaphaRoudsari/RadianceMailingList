A user\npointed out to us that the essential files in ray/src/cal/cal were not\nmaking it into the installation directory -- apologies all around. Greg\nWard also made a recent change to one of the MGF converters, so that code\nchange is reflected in all of the packages as well. You can find all of\nNREL's Radiance package offerings at:\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia\nnce\n\n\nTrace on, people. \n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nCommercial Buildings Research Group - Tools Section\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-May/008572.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008572", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
