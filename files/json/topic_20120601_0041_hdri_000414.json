Some may have seen the light box developed to display the Radiance renderings of Hagia Sophia (presented on the Radiance workshops). That is a rather static approach fitting to exactly one image, made for exhibitions, but less useful for displaying changing content. I am aware of techniques based on custom-made projector setups and some few commercial products. Still I wonder whether anyone here actually has experience with a commercial product or did some custom setup which does not require rocket-science skills or gigantic bank account\u2026\n\n\nSome displays I found:\n\n\nDolby reference display, mostly for color, no info on dynamic range, based on brightside displays:\nhttp://www.dolby.com/us/en/professional/hardware/video-monitors/prm-4200-professional-reference-monitor.html\n\n\nI heard rumors that these achieve up to 1:200,000 contrast\u2026\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-June/000414.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000414", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
