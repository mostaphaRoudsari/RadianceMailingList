I thought about leak light, but i tried to change the construction of my view (add the thickness of walls, make walls crossing on the corners), but nothing change this result.\n\n\nDid somebody have already notice this? Do you know this problem? \n\n\nThanks\n\n\nJulien\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008629.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008629", "created_by": "Julien_Boutillier"}
