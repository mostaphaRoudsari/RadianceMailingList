Does it really need a long time\nto create the image, or Have I miss anything here?\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2:\non page 17, I changed the script as suggested by changing the \"-f\" option\nto \"-fo\" to overwrite the existing hdr files:\n\n\nvwrays -ff -x 600 -y 600 -vf ./views/back.vf \\\n|rtcontrib -ab 3 -ad 4096 -ar 256 -aa .1 -lw 0.0003 -n 2 \\\n-ffc `vwrays -d -x 600 -y 600 -vf ./views/back.vf` -fo tregenza.cal -b tbin\n\\\n-o ./patches_copy/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w \\\n./testroom_whitesky.oct\n\n\nHowever, I got the following error message:\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at 'tregenza.cal'\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at 'tregenza.cal'\n\n\nCan anybody help to advise what the options for rtcontrib I should use\nhere?\n\n\n\n\nThanks!\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008637.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008637", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
