Usually the results of Radiance\nsimulation of illuminance levels gives a spread of lines and values\nby using colors or colored contours lines graphic representations. \nI want to ask if there is\nanyway to transform the results from a color based presentations, to\nBlack and White presentations? Transforming the usual color result\ninto greyscale presentation do not give the responding scale of grey\nvalues - for example \u2013 red is usually the color used for high\nvalues, where once greyscaled, it gets a grey which is a middle hue\nin relation to the others. \n\n\nI will be very happy for an\nadvice for how to make a fit in between a color scale of values and a\ngrey scale of values for a pic result ? \n\n\nThank you very much!!\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008648.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008648", "created_by": "david_behar"}
