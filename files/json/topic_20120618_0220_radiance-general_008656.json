However, I am \ncurious how people are actually still finding a way to work around.\n\n\nWhat are you actually using as a sky model for simulations aiming at \nLEED? Just the output of gensky clear without sun? Some available \nirradiance weather data for the given march / september days as an input \nfor gensky? Anything else?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008656.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008656", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
