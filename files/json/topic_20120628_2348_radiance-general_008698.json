I'm using tregenza.cal, which, from the header of the file, has patch one at North and progresses eastwards for 30 patches.  I'd like to rotate the sky 8 degrees counterclockwise. I could rotate the objects and the views, but it would be nice to just move the sky. Is there a simple way to do this?\n\n\nThanks, \n\n\nJohn.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008698.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008698", "created_by": "John_Ford"}
