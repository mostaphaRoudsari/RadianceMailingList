The compiled PDFs are dated 1994 and refer to rview not rvu. Is there a more recent compilation of these commands? If not, is there anything else I should be aware of that has changed for the commands?\n\n\nI also downloaded the man_pages.tar.gz file with all the HTML pages of commands, but as they're separate files printing would be much more tedious. (FYI the original link is broken http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/man_html.tar.gz)\n\n\nHere is the complete PDF:\nhttp://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/manpages.pdf\n\n\nAnd here is the rvu manual page dated 2004\nhttp://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rvu.pdf\n\n\nIf I'm going to print out 179 pages as an office reference manual, I want to make sure they're the right ones!\n\n\nThanks all for the feedback so far. The knowledge contained in this community is fantastic.\n\n\nKind regards,\nAlex\n\n\n\n\nAlex Krickx, LEED AP\nProject Engineer\n________________________________\nI N T E G R A L\n                          GROUP\n\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247\nakrickx at integralgroup.com<mailto:akrickx at integralgroup.com>\nwww.integralgroup.com<http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n\n\nDEEP GREEN Engineering.\n_______________________________\n\n\n [cid:image001.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=3830399>  [cid:image002.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Integral-Group-Inc/213422145352140>  [cid:image003.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://twitter.com/#!/IntegralGroupCA>  [cid:image004.png at 01CD55E4.E59B7F50] <http://www.youtube.com/user/IntegralGroupOakland>  [cid:image007.jpg at 01CD55EE.0D955400] <http://www.integralgroup.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-June/008706.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008706", "created_by": "Alex_Krickx"}
