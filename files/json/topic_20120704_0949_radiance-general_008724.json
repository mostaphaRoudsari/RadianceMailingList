Right at the beginning when trying to view the sphere (page 14) using the following command \"objline objects/things.rad | x11meta\", all I get is a mesh without surfaces and an error saying:\n\n\n\"X connection to /tmp/launch-VcMFzD/org.x:0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).\"\n\n\nNow I'm not sure if the mesh is all that I'm in fact supposed to see at this stage but I think that this error message is not a good sign.\n\n\nAny thoughts on what this could mean and how to solve the problem?\n\n\nBest regards,\nMichael\n\n\nPS.: I'm running Radiance on Mac OS Snow Leopard using the latest snapshot of Radiance. I followed the installation instructions suggested  here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68\n\n\n\n\nMichael Bannert, Dipl.-Psych.\nVision & Cognition Lab, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Univ. of T\u00fcbingen & BCCN T\u00fcbingen\nOtfried-M\u00fcller-Str. 25, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany\nPhone: +49 - (0)7071 / 29 - 89031\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008724.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008724", "created_by": "Michael_Bannert"}
