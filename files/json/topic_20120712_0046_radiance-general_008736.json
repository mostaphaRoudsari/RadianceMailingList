I realised the generated\nresults are for one day. In our office we are using the .EPW to generate\nthe results for the whole year. (as used in the tutorial in rtcontrib). Is\nit possible with BSDF somehow? if yes, Is there any hints or tips to insert\nthe .xml format generated by window7beta into the rtcontrib process?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nN.Nassif\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 6:21 PM, <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008736.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008736", "created_by": "nassif_nassif"}
