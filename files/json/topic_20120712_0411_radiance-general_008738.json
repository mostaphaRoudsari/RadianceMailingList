I know How to calculate the diffuse horizontal, or any titled surface of the whole sky, but in my case I wanted to compare in a patch-based mode. So I need to simulate a patch-based contribution of diffuse component in horizontal or any titled surface.\u00a0\n\n\nI thank you in advance,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\u00a0\n\n\nSokol\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDr. techn.
