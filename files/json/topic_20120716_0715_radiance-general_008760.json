How can we put it in the room in a specific location? I know, you will tell me that xform is a command that allows this funtion. The problems is that i used xform for the design of the chair itself and it's a bit difficult to use it again to move each element of the chair in the desired location. Is there a command in radiance to create a block called chair ?It will be easy after this to use xform to move the bloc chair in the desired location.\nThank you\nIm\u00e8ne\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nCuisine, salon, chambre enfant\u2026 Les promos pour changer votre mobilier sont sur Voila.fr http://shopping.voila.fr/vitrine/meubles\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008760.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008760", "created_by": "Imen_Slama"}
