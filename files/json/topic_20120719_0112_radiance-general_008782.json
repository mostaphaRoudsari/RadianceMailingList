So I create geometries : room.rad, chair.rad, table.rad. In the end of the file room.rad, I wrote:\n!xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad\n!xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 table.rad\nto put the chair and the table in desired place in the room\nSo When I wrote : objline objects/room.rad |x11meta, I saw the room with chair and table in desired place but when i wrote :\noconv materials/course.mat skies/sky.rad objects/room.rad > scene.oct\nI get this message :\nxform: cannot find file \"chair.rad\"\noconv: warning - (| xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad): empty file\nxform : cannot find file \"table.rad\"\noconv: warning - (| xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 table.rad) : empty file\nI don't understand why did i have this message? knowing that I put all geometries (chair.rad, table.rad and room.rad) in the same file named objects. when the room is without furnitre, i can make easily a sene.oct but when i have furniture like chair and table, i can't make this\nPlease can someone explain me how to resolve this problem? \nThank you\nIm\u00e8ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nCuisine, salon, chambre enfant\u2026 Les promos pour changer votre mobilier sont sur Voila.fr http://shopping.voila.fr/vitrine/meubles\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008782.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008782", "created_by": "Imen_Slama"}
