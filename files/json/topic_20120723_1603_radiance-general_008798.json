In case I calculate at the same point and in \nthe same direction the illuminance with rtrace -I, I get zero \ncontribution.  Is just the center of the source description tested in \nthat case? Any solution for this for rtrace?\nI just look for the sun, no sky description and use only direct \ncalculation (-ab 0) .\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
