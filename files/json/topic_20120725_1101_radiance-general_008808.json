While genskyvec.pl\nworks fine with piped input from the command line on Windows7, when it's\ncalled from within my Ruby script, I get the same error that Ryan Southall\nreported with his Python script\n(http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008758\n.html). \n\n\nGreg, I tried your suggestion again as well:\n\n\n>I can't test it for you, but I suspect the line:\n> } elsif (/\\sskyfunc\\s*$/) {\n>is the problem.  Try removing the final '\\s*' to make it:\n>\t} elsif (/\\sskyfunc$/) {\n\n\n...but no luck. \n\n\nRyan, have you made any more progress with this issue? Anyone else?\nBueller?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti  IESNA, LEED AP\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008808.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008808", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
