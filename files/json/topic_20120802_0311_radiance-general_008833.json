This mirror will stand for a metal sheet\nwith high specularity - but also some diffuse reflectance. First it\nseams to be obvious, but the more I think about it the less sure I am\nabout it.\n\n\nI defined a mirror material referencing a metal material, which includes\nboth the absolute reflectance and the specularity.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nvoid metal mySheetMetal\n0\n0\n5 .9 .9 .9 .8 0\n\n\nThat should lead to a specular reflectance of .9 * .8 = .72\n\n\n(Typically, one would know the specular and absolute reflectance from\nmeasurements and have to calculate the specularity from it - the other\nway around.)\n\n\nIs it this specular reflectance value of .72 that I have to use in my\nmirror materials definition? Like\n\n\nvoid mirror mySheetMirror\n1 mySheetMetal\n0\n3 .72 .72 .72\n\n\nMy understanding is that the virtual source should have the value of the\noriginal source times the specular reflectance, while for all rays not\nhitting the sheet at an angle leading to the source in mirror direction\nwould lead to ambient sampling according to the metal definition.\n\n\nIs this correct, do the metal and the mirror material match each other\nin my example?\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-August/008833.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008833", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
