Is it\ncalled 'rcontrib' or 'rtcontrib'?\n\n\n\n\nRob, for Windows binaries I see there are rcontrib and rtcontrib.\nSo rcontrib calls new version and rtcontrib old version. Right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-August/008838.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008838", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
