As Radiance integration efforts continue around\nDaysim and OpenStudio, we thought it might be nice to offer these focused\nmailing lists where users can post Radiance questions in the context of\nthese two applications. You can subscribe and browse the new lists here:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists\n\n\nI would encourage OpenStudio users to continue to post to the OpenStudio\nForums (https://openstudio.nrel.gov/forum) as well, but I believe these\nnew lists here could attract lots of Radiance folks and collectively\nprovide a richer knowledge base than I am currently capable of doing on\nthe OpenStudio forum. I can't speak for Christoph, but I expect he feels\nthe same way about his Daysim & DIVA forums.\n\n\nBig thanks to Andy McNeil, Greg Ward, Christoph Reinhart, Rick Mistrick,\nand Jan Wienold for coordinating this, and to Danny Fuller and LBNL for\nhosting the lists.\n\n\nOK, bye.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nP.S.\nWhen you do go to the radiance-online.org site, how about offering up some\nprops to Danny and Andy once again, for the new improved look! =8-)\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-August/008860.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008860", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
