I have taken six photos ranging from \u20133 to +3 and have tried to fuse these in Photosphere, however I am getting a \u201ccannot solve for response function\u201d message. Does anyone know how I can create a response curve or what I am missing to create the response curve? I can create a HDR image using the generic response curve, but for my thesis I would need all the HDRIs to be as accurate as possible. \n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n\nKind regards,\nPeony\n\n\n\n\n- - \nPeony Au\nMasters of Building Science Candidate\nVictoria University of Wellington\nNew Zealand\n\n\nMobile (+64) (0)277514389\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-August/000418.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000418", "created_by": "Peony_Au"}
