I \nfound the possibility to run a whole-building energy performance according to the daylighting and \nelectric lighting control response based on Radiance-calculated daylight distributions very\ninteresting.\n\n\nI\u00b4m not so confident with the Radiance functionality, I\u00b4ve only installed the Radiance binaries \ndownloaded from the NREL OpenStudio website.\nI closely followed the tutorial and I was able to run the ModelToRad.rb and the DaylightSim.rb \nwith --dc option. Next, running \u2013dcts option, a microsoft error message dealing with gendaylit.exe \nappears. The calculation begins (just like in your video) but for each new day this error turns \nup.\n\n\nI will be very grateful for any kind of advice!\n\n\nSilvia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narch.
