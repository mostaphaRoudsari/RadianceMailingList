I have extracted \nRuby.zip from OpenStudio website in C:\\Ruby and put C:\\Ruby\\bin in the PATH.\n\n\nNote that I would love to work in Linux, but apparently OpenStudio can \nonly work with boost 1.40. The default on mine is 1.46, so OpenStudio \nwould not install. It would be great if there is a how-to on downgrading \nboost just for OpenStudio.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nEry\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-August/000028.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000028", "created_by": "Ery_Djunaedy"}
