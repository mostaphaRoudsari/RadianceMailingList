Currently I\u00b4ve updated my \nOpenStudio installation with the latest 0.8.4 version which directly integrates Radiance \nfunctionality within the graphical interface.\nI still keep getting an empy .ill file after the --dcts simulation. The error from the command \nline is \"Illegal division by zero at genskyvec.pl line 141, <> line 19\".\nDoes anyone have good advice about it?\n\n\nLooking forward to have news from you,\n\n\nbest\n\n\nSilvia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narch.
