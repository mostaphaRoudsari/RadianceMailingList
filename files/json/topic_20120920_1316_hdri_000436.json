Well, 'soon' is now:\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/hdr/webhdrtools/index.shtml\n\n\nAs per normal, it's work in progress, but I still hope that you find \nthem useful.\n\n\nWhen I embarked on my little glare measurement project, I thought that \nthe accurate calibration/characterisation of consumer digital cameras \nfor reliable luminance measurements (including glare) is relatively \neasily done, given a good calibration factor here, and a good dose of \nvignetting calibration there -- all wrapped up by Radiance's native \ntools such as findglare and glarendx. It turned out that this is not the \ncase. So if anyone is interested in pushing this further, please do get \nin touch through this mailing list. There are many un-answered questions...\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-September/000436.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000436", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
