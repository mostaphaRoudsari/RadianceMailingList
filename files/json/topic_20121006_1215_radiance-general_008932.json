These images are combined using pcomb:\n\n\npcomb img01.hdr img02.hdr img03.hdr \u2026 > combined.hdr \n\n\nUsing pcomb this way, the resulting image has higher radiance values as the input images. What I want is that the resulting image has the same radiance values as the input files. How can I do that? \n\n\nAny hints are most welcome, \n\n\nCheers, \n\n\n- iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008932.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008932", "created_by": "Iebele"}
