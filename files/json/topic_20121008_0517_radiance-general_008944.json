The system administrators warned me that this system differs from normal computers, so I thought I better check it with you first, \n\n\nCheers, \n\n\n- iebele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008944.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008944", "created_by": "Iebele"}
