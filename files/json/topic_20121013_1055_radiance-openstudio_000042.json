I prefer to use genBSDF because it is more flexible than\nWindow 6, which cannot run in command line (right?).  However, the\ncomputation time of genBSDF seems rather long compared to Window 6.  I\nbelieve the major reason is the algorithm is different.\n\n\nThe test file is given below.  The default parameter setting \"-ab 5\" is not\nhigh.  Besides increasing -n option in genBSDF, is there any way to reduce\nthe runtime with an similar accuracy level as Window 6? or is there any\nother tool that can simulate BSDF in command line?\n\n\nThe test file is:\n####### file: glazingBase.rad ######\nglazingRef_0.5 polygon glazing_1\n0\n0\n12\n2  0.0   3\n0.0   0.0   3\n0.0   0.0   0.0\n2  0.0   0.0\n\n\n########### file: basf.rad ###########\nvoid glass glazingRef_0.5\n0\n0\n3\n0.545168692741 0.545168692741 0.545168692741\n\n\nvoid plastic blindRef_0.2\n0\n0\n5\n0.2 0.2 0.2 0 0\n\n\n! genblinds blindRef_0.2 blinds_0.2 0.02 2 3 200 0 | xform -rz -90 -rx 90\n-t 0 0 -0.02\n!xform -rx 90 glazingBase.rad\n################ end ########\n\n\nIn Ubuntu, use \"genBSDF bsdf.rad  > test.xml\"\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-October/000042.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000042", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
