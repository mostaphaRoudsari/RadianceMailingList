I  test using BSDF files of Window 6 and genBSDF,  and find that it\nuses \"Transmission Back\" to calculate radiance. \"genBSDF +forward -backward\ntest.rad > test.xml\" gave zero illuminance.  So \"back\"  denotes from\noutside to inside (towards inside the room)?  that is, the incident ray\nfalls on the outside window surface?\n\n\nHowever, the three-phase daylight coefficient method  tutorial mentions\nthat Radiance uses \"front transmission\" data. In addition, in source code:\nbsdf.c, line 1343:\n\n\n                    # line 1343\nif (!strcasecmp(ezxml_txt(ezxml_child(wdb,\n\"WavelengthDataDirection\")),\n\"Transmission Front\"))\nbreak;\n\n\nIt looks using \"transmission front\".\n\n\nWhich (front or back) transmission does Radiance use?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008964.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008964", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
