Radiance is running on my\nmachine: I checked my scene before and had no issue with using oconv on my\nscenes and then using rvu to check out the octree. But once I set set up my\n.rif file and run \"rad summer.rif\" I get the following error:\n\n\noconv mod3.rad summer_sky.rad > summer.oct\noconv: system - cannot open scene file \"mod3.rad\": No such file or directory\nrad: error generating octree\nsummer.oct removed\n\n\nIf I change the filename in my .rif for mod3.rad I get a different error\n(\"no such file\") so it should be pointing to the right file. Any\nsuggestions? I'm running radiance on a Windows7 machine. I'm pretty sure I\ndownloaded the files from NREL's openstudio site. Any suggestions? I've\nattached my files - they're pretty simple.\n\n\nThanks,\nAlex Krickx\n\n\n*\n*\n\n\n*Alex Krickx, LEED AP*\nProject Engineer**\n\n\n*________________________________*****\n\n\nI N T E G R A L****\n\n\n*                         ** **GROUP*****\n\n\n** **\n\n\n427 13th Street, Oakland CA 94612\n510 663 2070 x 247****\n\n\nakrickx at integralgroup.com\nwww.integralgroup.com****\n\n\n** **\n\n\n*DEEP GREEN Engineering.*\n\n\n*_______________________________*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008974.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008974", "created_by": "Alex_Krickx"}
