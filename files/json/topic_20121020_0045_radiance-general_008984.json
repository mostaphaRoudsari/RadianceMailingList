I define a point at the centre of the window\nwith a viewing direction normal to the window, and I would like to\ncalculate how much (i.e. what %) of the sky dome is visible from that\npoint, assuming a 180 degree cone of vision.  Note that I do not want to\napply the cosine-law, and I want to treat each part of the sky dome\nequally. For a vertical window, the maximum value should be 50%, which\nwould mean that there are no obstructions.\n\n\nWhat is the best (i.e. fastest) way of calculating this?\n\n\nI tried rtrace (1 bounce, uniform sky)  but that applies the cosine law. I\nhave been looking at rsensor, but if I have lots of windows, it seems  I\nwould have to run rsensor lots of times, which would be rather slow. Any\nsuggestions?\n\n\nPatrick\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008984.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_008984", "created_by": "Patrick_Janssen"}
