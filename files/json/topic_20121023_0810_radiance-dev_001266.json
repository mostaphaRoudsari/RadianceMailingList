Untar src\n/> tar xvf radiance-HEAD-ecd3332.tar.gz\n\n\n2. change into directory and call cmake\n/>cd radiance-HEAD-ecd3332\n/>cmake src/\n\n\nEverything looks good, except for the following warning:\nCMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:\n  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as\n\n\n    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)\n\n\n  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower\n  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more\n  information run \"cmake --help-policy CMP0000\".\nThis warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.\n\n\n3. Build binaries from source\n/>make -i\n\n\n4. Install\n/>make install -i\n\n\n\n\nFollowing things I noticed:\n1. Build fails when not using -i with make, as there are many issues regarding \na missing Version.c file, like:\n:\n[ 37%] Built target genworm\n[ 37%] Generating /src/rt/Version.c\nCMake Error: Error processing file:/src/rt/create_version.cmake\nmake[2]: *** [/src/rt/Version.c] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [rt/CMakeFiles/radiance.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n\n\n2. There is no build/ directory created when building that holds the resulting \nbinaries etc.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n1. Is there anything obvious, I should do differently?\n2. How do I install executables etc. to /usr/ rather than /usr/local/ e.g \n/usr/bin or /usr/share/radiance/ etc. without patching the sources/cmake files?\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n\nDenny\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2012-October/001266.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001266", "created_by": "Denny_Beyer"}
