Sorry for my bad English, I am located in Austria.\n\n\nI try to setup Open Studio with the radiance functionality on my Macbook. After a series of trials with no success I start a new attempt and try to follow the available instructions as close as possible.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI just did a fresh installation of OSX 10.8 on a separate partition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. question: This is a German OSX version, could that lead to any problems?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. question: OSX 10.8 comes with Ruby 1.8.7. The \"Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf\" says \"Install RUBY 1.8.6\" so ist 1.8.6 required?\n\n\nIf yes, are there any hints how to downgrade to Ruby 1.8.6?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. question: The installation sequence according to \"Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf\" seems to be reverse to the sequence described in the \"Installation Instructions\" on the Open Studio Webpage. The notes for OS X on that webpage also tell that Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 is supported, which comes back to question number 2.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4. question: \"Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf\" tells to do a separate Perl installation (ActivePerl is recommended). Is this true also for OSX?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany thanks for any help on my way.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nMartin Klingler\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-October/000049.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000049", "created_by": "Martin_Klingler"}
