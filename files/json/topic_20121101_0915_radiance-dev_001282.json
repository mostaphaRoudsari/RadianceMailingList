Rotating the view to the right also removes the \"ghost\".\nThe commands we're running to generate the image are as follows:\n\n\noconv -f Monday.map Monday.rad > ghost_lum.oct\nrpict -w -t 2 -vtv -vp 6.300 8.100 1.800 -vd -2.800 -3.600 0.000 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 80.000 -vv 60.000 -x 1600 -y 1600 -x 64 -y 64 -ps 6 -pt 0.100 -pj 1.0 -dj 0.350 -ds 0.300 -dt 0.250 -dc 0.350 -dr 2 -dp 128 -st 0.500 -ab 2 -aa 0.150 -ar 64 -ad 128 -as 64 -lr 6 -lw 0.005 -av 0.000 0.000 0.000 -af temp.amb ghost_lum.oct >amb.raw\nrpict -w -t 2 -vtv -vp 6.300 8.100 1.800 -vd -2.800 -3.600 0.000 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 80.000 -vv 60.000 -x 1600 -y 1600 -ps 6 -pt 0.100 -pj 1.0 -dj 0.350 -ds 0.300 -dt 0.250 -dc 0.350 -dr 2 -dp 128 -st 0.500 -ab 2 -aa 0.150 -ar 64 -ad 128 -as 64 -lr 6 -lw 0.005 -av 0.000 0.000 0.000 -af temp.amb ghost_lum.oct >ghost_lum.raw\npfilt -m 0.25 -x /2 -y /2 ghost_lum.raw >ghost_lum.pic\n\n\nIf anyone has a few minutes to run this image on their systems & let me know if the \"ghost\" luminaire also appears for you it would be most appreciated (I'm using Radiance HEAD built from source on Windows 7 SP1).\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher \nSoftware Platform Engineer \nT: +44 (0) 141 945 8500\nF: +44 (0) 141 945 8501\nhttp://www.iesve.com \n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>** \nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
