Then the\ngenerated pic file I copy it in the command prompt starting file. There I\ncopy the following command that is the ulim\nthat is: fl2cd(v)=3.426*v;cd2fl(v)=0.292*v;ulim(La)=fl2cd(10^(5.731+(log10(cd2fl(La))+5)*(0.3376+(log10(cd2fl(La))+5)*0.0189)-6));\n\n\nThen I Type the following in the command prompt for my file that is called\n(ex2)\n\n\nfindglare -p ex2_c1.pic -t 100000|glarendx -h -t vert_ill|rcalc -f\nulim.cal -e '$1=ulim($2/PI)'\n\n\nThen I get the following message:\nfindglare: picture read error\n'$1=ulim($2/PI)'\n^ illegal variable name\n\n\nDo you have any idea why this is happening?\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\n\nMAria\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009033.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009033", "created_by": "Maria_Mandalaki"}
