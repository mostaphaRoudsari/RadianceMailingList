I mean available at the command line?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf yes, could anybody point me in the right direction? I would like to change the bsdf-data for the windows and run a further simulation. Is this possible from within OpenStudio?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThank you very much for any hint.\n\n\nMartin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000072.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000072", "created_by": "Martin_Klingler"}
