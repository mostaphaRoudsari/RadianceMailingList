I want\nto compare a model with light shelf with a model without shelf. I wonder If\nI should change the ambient bounces parameter in the no shelf model,\nbecause the  reflections decreases, or not,? The ab parameter that used for\nthe models with shelf is 3.\nThanks in advance\nSincerely\nShailan Zareiy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009052.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009052", "created_by": "shailan_zareiy"}
