I fixed it manually all the time by editing Version.c (which should be aut-generated by the makefile). As it just happened again to me, I wanted to share that the reason for the incomplete Version.c when installing on a standard Debian.\n\n\nRadiance depends on the editor \"ed\" to create it using a template file. If you install it, make install will hopefully pass without errors. So in case you expect such problems, type apt-get install ed (as superuser)...\n\n\nCheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009055.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009055", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
