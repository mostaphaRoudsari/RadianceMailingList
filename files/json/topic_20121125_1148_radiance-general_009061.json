On the mailing list I could find some information on how to\nmodel light pipes. However, I would like to know, if there is any standard,\nsimilar to \"EN 410 -  Glass in building - Determination of luminous and\nsolar characteristics of glazing\" for definition of light transmittance of\nlight pipes, which can be used for comparison of several light pipes. It\ndoes not have to be EN standard, actually any method which define how to\ncompare light transmittance of light pipes, by simulations or measurements,\nwould be good.\n\n\nThank you for all advices and comments.\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009061.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009061", "created_by": "David_Appelfeld"}
