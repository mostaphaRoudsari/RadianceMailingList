I started learning\nRadiance some time ago, and just an hour ago, a pretty obvious doubt came\nto my mind:\n\n\nIf RADIANCE uses the RGB optical properties (that is, visible spectrum, I\nsuppose); how comes that it calculates the Radiance instead of Illuminance?\nIf the materials change the spectrum of the radiation in every bounce, how\nis it possible to just use the classic \"179*(0,265*R+0,67*G+0,065*B)\" to\ncompute the illuminance?\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Molina\n\n\nPS: Sorry to bother with rookie questions, but I am the only person in my\nUniversity using RADIANCE.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-November/009067.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009067", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
