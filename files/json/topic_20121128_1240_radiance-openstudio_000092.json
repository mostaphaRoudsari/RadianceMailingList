I\nknow many of you over the last year or so have started using the Radiance\nbits we've added to OpenStudio, and I was wondering if anyone had some\ngood material for an OpenStudio case study for his book.\n\n\nLet me know! \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-November/000092.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000092", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
