In our\nexperience, countless hours have been saved in automating building\nsimulation tasks, allowing us to focus more on creating quality building\nmodels and accurate performance results.\n\n\nWe believe that Python is positioned to make a big difference in the\nbuilding simulation community. To get started, we have the following offer:\nSend us your scripting problems, and we will solve them for you!\n\n\nIn this phase, we are interested most in small well defined tasks. Example\nproblems would be;\n\n\n\"In my research, I need to parametrize 100 EnergyPlus files with different\nU-Values\"\n\"We need to convert 1000 files from format *.yyy to format *.qqq\"\n\"Our company produces a report for each project, we use Excel to calculate\nthe average Lux levels from radiance, it's easy but boring after 100\nprojects\"\nOr anything else where you think - \"I wish I had an intern do this for\nme...\" (Maybe you are this intern...)\n\n\nHelp us by defining your problem with steps taken and the desired result.\nSend them to:\nprojects at pythonpoweredbuilding.com\n\n\nFor all problems received, we will recommend ideas, methods, and modules.\nWe will furthermore select 3 projects to solve and feature in our Workshop\nduring the Building Simulation 2013 conference in France next August\nhttp://www.bs2013.fr/. We will also feature these problems on our website;\nhttp://www.pythonpoweredbuilding.com.\n\n\nProblems must therefore be free of any intellectual property and will be\nopen to all. For more information and more about us, please visit\nhttp://www.pythonpoweredbuilding.com. If you are already a convert and want\nto get involved, contact us at\ninfo at pythonpoweredbuilding.com.<info at pythonpoweredbuilding.com>\n\n\nPlease excuse cross posting, we will direct further updates primarily to\nBLDG-SIM.\n\n\nHappy simulating,\n\n\nMarcus Jones, Clayton Miller, and Alan Jackson - Python evangelists\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009083.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009083", "created_by": "info_info"}
