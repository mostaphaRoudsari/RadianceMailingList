Long story short, the NREL\nprecompiled Radiance for Windows returned only zeroes when dctimestep was\ncalled (Andy McNeil helped me to discard syntax errors ... THANKS FOR\nTHAT); Ubuntu used to give me no answer, then it took turns between\n\"reinhart.cal not found\" and some other similar things, and now it keep\nthrowing \"segmentation fault\" (my sky vector is not full of zeroes). I\nalready tried reinstalling my Linux distribution, compiling the Head\nversion (I think I did it ok), searching on the web, preinstalling x11 dev\nlibrary, and installing Learnix... but \"segmentation fault\" keeps there, in\nthe two PCs.\n\n\nanyway, until now, all my compilations \"have had some errors\" and\ndctimestep has worked some times, but I haven't been able to understand why\nsometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't... I am pretty stucked here. If\nthere is any trick for installing RADIANCE or getting the permissions to\navoid \"segmentation fault\", any advice would help a lot.\n\n\nTHANKS\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009090.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009090", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
