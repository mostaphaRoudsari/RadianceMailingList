I couldn't get a 300D to work, but could find no good reason why (updated the firmware to 1.1.1 but that didn't fix it).\n\n\nThere are no plans at present to update HDRcapOSX, and the download site is now:\n\n\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=resources:hdrcaposx\n\n\nCanon DSLR models after late 2011 *may* not work.  Suggest you get a (confirmed) working HDRcapOSX install on your laptop and try out the models in-store if unsure.\n\n\nI'll update the list of Canon DSLRs that work with HDRcapOSX with any confirmations that people care to send.\n\n\nBest\nJohn\n\n\nJohn Mardaljevic\nProfessor of Building Daylight Modelling\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLoughborough\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU, UK\n\n\nTel: +44 1509 222630 (Direct)\nTel: +44 1509 228529 (Pam Allen, secretary)\n\n\nj.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk\nhttp://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cv/staff/profile/367.html\n\n\nPersonal daylighting website:\nhttp://climate-based-daylighting.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2012-December/000444.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000444", "created_by": "John_Mardaljevic"}
