Any information regarding architectural field impact and the fields it penetrates, particularly in non-research environments, would also be most helpful.\nRather than clutter the list mailing, please send information directly to me, and if of general interest, I will post the accumulated list.\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nRob Shakespeare\nshakespe at indiana.edu<mailto:shakespe at indiana.edu>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009104.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009104", "created_by": "Robert_A._Shakespeare"}
