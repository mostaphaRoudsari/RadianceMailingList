I assume we can use *Xcode* to compile it as an executable program for\nthe Mac system. But I don't know how to do it ...\n\n\nCurrently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal\nand SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2\nfiles in Mac system with other Radiance program. It's just a little bit\ninconvenient...\n\n\nAdvices are greatly appreciated!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-December/009116.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009116", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
