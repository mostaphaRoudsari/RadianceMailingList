Specifically, here:\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia\nnce\n\n\nScroll down a tad, and you'll see a section called \"Download Radiance\nBinaries\". We offer Windows 32-bit, MacOS Universal, and Linux 32-bit and\nLinux 64-bit. \n\n\nChris Humann, I went back to dynamically linked libraries, so these won't\nwork for ya on OSX 10.5, sorry. There have been a bunch of updates and\nfixes to a lot of the three-phase stuff for Windows, so Windows users\nshould definitely grab themselves a copy. This round should also fix the\nQt Rvu for many users. Please let me know if you have any difficulties\nwith the new packages.\n\n\nHave a good weekend,\n\n\n/rpg\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS:RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401\n303.275.4319\nrobert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2012-December/000096.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000096", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
