{"topic": "why \"global horizontal illuminance\" is smaller than \"global horizontal radiation\" multiplied by 179 in epw file?", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ji Zhang", "created_at": "January 01, 2013 at 08:36AM", "body": "Dear list, Happy New Year!\n\n\nI have a simple question related to conversion from irradiance value to\nilluminance value, and pls correct me if I'm wrong:\n\n\nUsually we can estimate the *illuminance (lux)* for a given point by\nmultiplying the *irradiance (w/m2)* for the point as simulated via Radiacne\nby *179 (lm/w)* which is the luminous efficacy used in Radiance, or more\nstrictly (R*0.265+G*0.670+B*0.065)*179.\n\n\nHowever, it seems that in a epw weather file the* \"global horizontal\nilluminance\"* value is not equal to but smaller than the *\"global\nhorizontal radiation\" value multiplied by 179*.\n\n\nMay I ask:\n1. why there's such a large discrapency?\n2. Will this lead to over-estimation of illuminance when using cumulative\nsky derived from \"global horizontal radiation\" ?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n- Ji\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009135.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009135", "created_by": "Ji_Zhang"}
