I  \nthought I'd pestered the group enough times on 'pcomb' matters to  \nfigure this out using the many great responses I've received over the  \nyears, but the right syntax is eluding me now.\n\n\nAs always,\nThanks!!\n\n\nChristian Humann ~ Associate\nLOISOS + UBBELOHDE\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwww.coolshadow.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009173.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009173", "created_by": "Christian_Humann"}
