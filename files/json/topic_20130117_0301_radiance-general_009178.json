My idea was to keep Rd and Rs set to zero and only define the transmission. A simple example would be a surface with perfect lambertian transmission (Td=1, Ts=0) and no reflection at all (ok, hard to produce such a material, but I had reasons to separate transmission from reflection information). According to my understanding that would be:\n\n\nvoid trans puretransmission\n0\n0\n7\t1\t1\t1\n\t0\t0\n\t1\t0\n\n\nHowever, being lazy, I thought this might be a good time to try the widget for cross-checking. Which made me realize that Cr, Cb, Cg are not asked for. Instead, I seam to need a value > 0 for Rd, which means I can never achieve the above definition.\n\n\nAm I just doing it wrong? Did this problem never arise because noone else wanted such a strange trans model? Or - which would give me a headache - is my understanding of Cr, Cg, Cb wrong? I always understood A1-A3=1-absorption(r,g,b).\n\n\nThank you, cheers, Lars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009178.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009178", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
