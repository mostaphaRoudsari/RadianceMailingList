That way, a script called SL_presim\ngenerates the Daylight and View Matrices for each window, storing them in\nthe appropriate directory, for a posterior SL_sim script to simulate the\nyear out of an EnergyPlus weather file.\n\n\nAnyway, you can see a 3 min. video\nHERE<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er8gm1kusvQ&feature=youtu.be>,\nI had trouble with the audio.... and a web site\nHERE<https://www.sites.google.com/site/sunliteproject/home>\n.\n\n\nTHANKS EVERYONE,\n\n\nGerman\n\n\nPS: Just for you to know, for now, both the video and the webpage can only\nbe seen by the people who have the Link.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009185.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009185", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
