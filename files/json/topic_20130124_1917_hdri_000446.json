Still, pcomb writes a 65kb\noutput file with the name I defined. First I thought it could be a problem\nrelated to the path or installation so I tried to run including the full\npath of both input and output images but got the same result.\nI also tried the command on a Mac and got the same error. I checked the\npath on the Mac and it seems correct. Environmental variables and registry\nentries look ok on the windows machine, too. Every other command seem to\nwork fine.\n Am I missing something in the syntax?\nThank you,\n\n\nAlp\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-January/000446.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000446", "created_by": "Mehmedalp_Tural"}
