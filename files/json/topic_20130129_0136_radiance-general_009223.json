The \nviewer can then walk through the space and I can present updated views \nrelative to the current viewing location (I have 6 DOF head tracking). \nObviously this requires a lot of offline rendering and a relatively \nnarrow movement range - just to cut the rendering overhead.\n\n\nIt's easy enough to see how I might render images for presentation when \nviewer and the viewing target are positioned centrally within the world, \ni.e. looking straight forward towards the middle of the screen. What I \ndon't understand is how I render scenes for when the viewer has move \noff-centre to left or right. Firstly, perspective is going to make one \nside of the screen smaller than the other, I'd need to correct this so \nthat the screen image fits on the actual screen.\n\n\nI think I could build-in some markers that denote the corners of the \nlarge VR screen, then stretch the image so that these markers lie on the \ncorners of the screen - this seems a little clumsy.\n\n\nIs there a better way?\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n*<http://www.abertay.ac.uk/about/news/pickoftheweek/2010/name,5454,en.html>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr P.
