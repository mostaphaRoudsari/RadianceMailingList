I introduce horizontal direct irradiance and horizontal diffuse irradiance (-G parameter) which are computed from horizontal global irradiance (meteo data : full spectrum).\n\n\nI don't understand why sky irrandiance in Radiance is approximatively 60% of horizontal global irradiance. In my mind, the visible spectrum is approximatively 40-45% of full spectrum, is it wrong?\n\n\nExample gendaylit command : \n\n\n\tgendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -G 500 200\n\n\nThanks for your answer.\n\n\nCheers\nJulien\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009236.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009236", "created_by": "Julien_Boutillier"}
