I once or twice had to use it, but never for critical parts of a model.\n\n\nNow, I need to find the irradiance in (!) a glass pane on the second surface S2 in this simple sketch:\n\n\n|        |\n|        |\n| o      |    * source\n| sensor |\n|        |\n\n\nS2      S1\n\n\nThe glass material applied to a flat surface through S1 obviously does not work here, as it includes reflection at S2 into the plane through S1. That would lead to an underestimate of about 4% at normal incidence. What I did is to model S1 as a dielectric, S2 as plastic, and ran the rtrace command with the -i switch, location as marked by the o-letter in the sketch and the view vector towards S2.\n\n\n- My first question - is this a valid model in Radiance, with a volume having a dielectric interface on one, a plastic surface on the other side?\n\n\n- Second question, can I expect rtrace to calculate a valid irradiance reading under these circumstances?\n\n\n- Third question, and that is funny - how do I find the transmissivity parameters for a glass, as dielectric would expect them, if I have transmission T measured?\n\n\nIf someone here could share some insight how to find a valid dielectric description from a typical transmission measurement for the visible spectrum, that would be of great help for me....\n\n\nCheers and TIA,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-January/009238.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009238", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
