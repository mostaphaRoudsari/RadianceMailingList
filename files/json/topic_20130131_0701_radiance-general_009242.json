Since I am not comparing the lighting levels; I\nunderstand that the resolution should not be a problem, right?\n\n\nNow thinking that *\"there are not many cases where both the BRTDfunc and\nthe glass model as given by Optics make sense, but Optics will not take the\ndecision\"*, is there any documentation about modeling \"modern glazing\nsystems\"?; for example, I understand that BRTDfunc are oriented to one\nside... How can one deal with the inter-reflections between two glazings?\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\n2013/1/30 Lars O.
