As I understand transformations used\nare part of code Radiance code too.\nMy search on Internet was also futile (maybe wrong search keywords :)\n\n\nCan someone please point me to some site with such transformations or give\nsome equations here?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarija\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009271.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009271", "created_by": "Marija_Velickovic"}
