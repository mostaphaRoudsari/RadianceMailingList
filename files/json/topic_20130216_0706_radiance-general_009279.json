No surprise, the calculations\nseem to be really good, nevertheless, there are some important differences\non directly transmitted (specular) calculations. I am using the following\nparameters:\n\n\ngenBSDF -n 4 -c 4000 -r '-ab 4 -ad 512 -as 0 -aa 0 -ds 0.01 -dj 0'\nmaterial.mat geometry.rad > ../TMX/file.xml\n\n\nI tried modifying the -c option, but it did not show any improvements, so I\nstayed on 4000. Any suggestions from gurus?\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009279.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009279", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
