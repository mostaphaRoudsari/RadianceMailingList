Additionally, the\nlightning distribution around the room does not make sense. I have low\nvalues in some points and very high value in other.\n\n\nI am performing the analysis in a windows 7 (32bits) operative system. I\ndon't know if the operative system interfere with the results?\n\n\nI read something in your site about the optics 5 software. I have already\ninstall it and uninstall and the results remain awkward.\n\n\nCan you please tell me if I am doing something wrong?\n\n\nThank you very much,\nCatarina\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009303.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009303", "created_by": "Catarina_Ara\u00fajo"}
