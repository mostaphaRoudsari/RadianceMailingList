{"topic": "Randance and different sky descriptions", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Allison Bygott", "created_at": "February 26, 2013 at 04:31PM", "body": "Hello.\n\n\nI have been evaluating a couple of different software programs that interface with Radiance. Unfortunately, my \"standard\" test models aren't producing the same results in each software; the results are different by at least a factor of 2. I'm trying to understand how each software is separately using Radiance to come up with daylight results. I believe this requires an understanding of how the sky files are generated. I spent some time today poking around the Radiance-online mailing lists, looking for sky file content clues, but I suspect that some of these concepts are above me. I did review the gensky document dated 4/24/98 and I found it informative. I'm hoping that the community might provide some insight on the content of two \"comparable\" sky files; please see below:\n\n\nSoftware 1:\n\n\n!gensky 3 21 12.01 +s -a 40.03 -o 105.28 -m 105.00\n\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4  0.7  0.8  1.0 0\n\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nskyfunc glow grndglow\n0\n0\n4 0.05 0.1 0.07 0\n\n\ngrndglow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0 0 -1 180\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware 2:\n\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 11009526.873677 11009526.873677 11009526.873677\n\n\nsolar source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.039983 -0.647611 0.760921 0.5\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n2 skybr IES_skybright.cal\n0\n7 1 15.092265 18.041592 0.649859 0.039983 -0.647611 0.760921\n\n\nskyfunc glow skyglow\n0\n0\n4 0.989 0.989 1.159 0\n\n\nskyglow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0.0 0.0 1.0 180\n\n\nskyfunc glow groundglow\n0\n0\n4 1.0 1.0 1.0 0\n\n\ngroundglow source ground\n0\n0\n4 0.0 0.0 -1.0 180\n\n\n\n\nThank you.
