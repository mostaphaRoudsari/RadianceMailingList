Should the glare \nanalysis be done on raw images without \"pcond -h\"? ......although it was \nstated that \"pcond -h\" will create a view that mimic human responses.\n\n\nWould really appreciate any sharing or help on this!\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nAnn\nIf you are not the email's intended recipient, kindly inform the sender \nand delete it. \nThe email may contain confidential information which should not be \nretained, nor disclosed to another individual.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-February/009321.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009321", "created_by": "Sim_Swee_Ling_Annie"}
