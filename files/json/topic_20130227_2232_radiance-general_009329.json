Hence, does \nthat also meant the exposure settings should not be adjusted (for \ncomparison of clear and darker glass)? \n\n\nI am currently using the Desktop Radiance via Ecotect plug-in. Is there a \nrecommendation to which free tool available I can use that still allow me \nto do glare analysis for an Ecotect model with better accuracy? \n\n\nHave downloaded \"radiance-4.2.a-win32.exe\" but not too sure where to \nstart... What is the application difference with the Ecotect desktop \nradiance plug-in I am using now. Am I supposed to generate an image via \nEcotect and use command prompt to run the analysis or there is another \ntool I would need to download?\n\n\nCheers,\nAnn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your Ref\n\n\n\n\n Our Ref \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification :\n\n\nradiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n28/02/2013 01:56 AM\nPlease respond to radiance-general\n\n\nTo\nradiance-general at radiance-online.org\ncc\n\n\nSubject\nRadiance-general Digest, Vol 108, Issue 29\n\n\n\n\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\n                 radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n                 radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\n                 radiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n   1.
