Instead of adding 3 columns for each time step, it appears to be appending each time step to the end of the file.  This creates a problem when I try to run dctimestep, which gives me a \"system- header read error\".\n\n\nMy commands are something like this:\n\n\nepw2wea tacoma.epw  tacoma.wea\nrtcontrib -h- -faa -V+ -b tbin -bn 146 -m skyglow -f tregenza.cal < test.pts ${options} test.oct > daylightcoeffs.dc\ngendaymtx -m 1 -r -90 weather/tacoma.wea > weather/tacoma.smx\n| dctimestep -n 8760 daylightcoeffs.dc weather/tacoma.smx > test_illuminance.dat\n\n\nThanks for any insight on this nifty new tool.\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009338.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009338", "created_by": "Galen_Burrell"}
