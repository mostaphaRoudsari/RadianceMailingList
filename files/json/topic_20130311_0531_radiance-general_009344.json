I have been unsuccessful, so far, to generate  more than\ntwo reflections.  I would appreciate any help in generating the 3rd, 4th\nand subsequent reflections.  I would be happy to send images to anyone\ninterested.\n\n\nShamim Javed\nPhD Candidate\nCollege of Architecture and Urban Studies\nVirginia Tech\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009344.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009344", "created_by": "Shamim_Javed"}
