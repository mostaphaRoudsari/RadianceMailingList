Anyway, I was trying to\nshow the sky divisions, s I can see the differente between Tregenza, and\nReinhart's MF1 2 3 and 4. So I did this:\n*\n*\n*vsk=\"-x $DIMS -y $DIMS -vf views/sky.vf\"*\n*rm -f images/patches/**\n*vwrays -ff $vsk |rcontrib -n 4 @image.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d $vsk) -V+ -e\nMF:4 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -o images/patches/p%04d.hdr -m\nsky_glow \\ testroom_whitesky.oct*\n*\n*\nIt works very well for tregenza and MF1; but for the rest of them (MF2 and\ngreater), the image corresponding to patch 244 fails, with no output at all.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\nGerman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009348.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009348", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
