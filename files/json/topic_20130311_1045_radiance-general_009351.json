The best option I can think of\nis to use the trans material with 91% transmission and hope that it\nprovides about 50% haze. Does anyone have experience modeling film\nbased on haze? If so, any pointers? A tutorial I should look at?\n\n\nThanks,\nTim Perry\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009351.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009351", "created_by": "Tim_Perry"}
