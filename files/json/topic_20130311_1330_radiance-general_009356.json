Then, I made a DC matrix, created the\nsky matrix; and dctimesteped all together (the weather used is Montreal),\nand got THESE <https://sites.google.com/site/sunliteproject/comments>\n results.\n\n\nThe sensors were defined (North, South, East and West, respectively)\n\n\n0 3.1 1 0 1 0\n0 -3.1 1 0 -1 0\n3.1 0 1 1 0 0\n-3.1 0 1 -1 0 0\n\n\nAnyway; North and South seem to be ok to me (simetric along the day, and\nthe south has more \"sun\" than north). But West and East seem to be\ninverted...? and the east is more insolated in the afternoon? (I havent\nreally looked at the numbers themselves, but just to the tendency). *Can\nthere be a bug in the program??*\n\n\nOn the other hand... is there any plan on adding the -O option to\ngendaymtx, to get the solar intensities?\n\n\nTHANKS TO EVERYONE IN ADVANCE\n\n\nGerman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009356.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009356", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
