There is a halo around a black box on a grey background\nin a rendering, and I can't figure out how to get rid of it (because I\ncan't imagine that it's real).\n\n\nI am preparing renderings for an art submission, and I am simulating a\nlittle model mountain inside a small flat black frame on a light grey\nwall, in a room with an array of ceiling lights and one spot. Here is\nwhat happens (rpict and mountain-removed rvu):\n\n\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/whyTheHaloMaster.png\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/whyTheHalo.png\n\n\nThe black material is plastic with 0.0 specularity.\nThe halo is independent of the ambient parameters.\nThe halo is independent of -lw refinement.\nThe halo is still there if the black box touches the wall or is offset a little.\nThe halo doesn't go away when I render at high resolution.\n\n\nCan anyone tell me what is going on here? Unzip and run \"make\" on:\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/whatGives.zip\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009379.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009379", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
