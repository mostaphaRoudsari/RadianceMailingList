Perfectly black plastic material for avoid interreflection\n2. define glow color to surface.\n3. and a surface light source \u00a0pointing straight up\u00a0\n4. used rpict with -i for irradiance map and set set ambient bounce to 0;\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\nvoid plastic meshmaterial\n\u00a00\n\u00a00\n\u00a05 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0\n\n\nvoid glow irrad\n0\n0\n4 \u00a00.4 \u00a0 0.4 \u00a00 .4 \u00a0 0\n\n\nirrad source irradsphere\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180.0\n\n\n# Mesh details ......all are using meshmaterial\n\n\n\n\nwhen i render then rendered image does not show any scene (i.e. black scene image) ??\nWhat i am missing \u00a0conceptually ??\n\n\nMy camera position is correct as i get other maps such as depth or normal map correct.\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards,     Brajesh Lal\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009384.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009384", "created_by": "Brajesh_Lal"}
