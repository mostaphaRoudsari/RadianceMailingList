However, by the use of radiance  I noticed that Illuminance map size will have an effect on the results of the energy consumption of a building  (Energy Per Conditioned Building Area). I did not understand why the illuminance map will affect such results \u2026. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks all\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKhalid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2013-March/000107.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000107", "created_by": "Khalid"}
