Now, I'm doing the same simulation twice in order to get 2 outputs which takes a lot of time. Isn't it possible to create 2 outputs through only 1 simulation?\nIf not, could pvalue help me on this one? And if yes, how? Or would pvalue only would give me luminance values?\n\n\n\n\nFirst simulation:\necho \"     Rtrace illuminance \"\nvwrays -x $Dims -y $Dims -vf viewfile.vf \\\n| rcalc -e '$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=0.75; $4=$4; $5=$5; $6=1' \\\n| rtrace -w -ab 3 -fac -I -ov `vwrays -d -vf viewfile.vf -x $Dims -y $Dims` scene.oct >  Outcome.hdr\n\n\nSecond simulation:\necho \"     Rtrace illuminance values \"\nvwrays -x $Dimstable -y $Dimstable -vf viewfile.vf \\\n| rcalc -e '$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=$3; $4=$4; $5=$5; $6=1' \\\n| rtrace -w -I -h -ov -ab 2 `vwrays -d -vf viewfile.vf -x $Dims -y $Dims` scene.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$1*179' > Outcome.txt\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n\nBest regards,\nMirjam\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009436.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009436", "created_by": "M._van_Laarhoven"}
