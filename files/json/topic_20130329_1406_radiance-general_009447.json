So a sloped skylight for example. If I am \npassing the geometry for the glazing to genklemsamp, is all I need in \naddition, the normal for the surface? For example:\n\n\n    genklemsamp -vd 1 0 1 sloped_window.rad > samples.dat\n\n\nor do I need to specify view up?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n-Jack\n\n\n\n\nJack de Valpine\nPresident\n\n\nVisarc Incorporated\nwww.visarc.com\n\n\nchanneling technology for superior design and construction\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-March/009447.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009447", "created_by": "Jack_de_Valpine"}
