In this case, something more serious is going on and I just wrote to the administrator (/ business owner) to find out what.  Hopefully, we'll have it sorted out in a day or two.  Meanwhile, I will e-mail you a copy of Photosphere.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  This probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, so I'll cross-post my reply there.  Any follow-up should happen on HDRI.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-April/000459.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000459", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
