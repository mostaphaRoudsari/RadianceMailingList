Is that a\ngood result? or there is a problem with my modeling?\n\n\n2.- As can be seen in Image (the one that shows the interior of the\nbuilding, looking out), there are some weird effects, making my image to\nlook as it was painted with a brush or something. What is the parameter\nthat would help me reduce that?\n\n\nI am not sure why in Dropbox the images look much more darker than in my\nPC. They were created using rpict, and then filtered with \"pfilt -x /2 -y\n/2 image.hdr > image.tiff\"\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH\n\n\nGerman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009473.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009473", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
