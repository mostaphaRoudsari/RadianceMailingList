It took 17 hours to finish the rpict portion of the test. The\nbest serial time ever recorded was just under 18 minutes on an Intel\ni7-2600K from 1.5 years ago (57x faster). The peak SMP time is 3.5\nminutes, recorded earlier this year (296x faster). The Raspberry Pi's\ntime was similar to what we would expect from computers from 2001-2: a\nPentium II at about 250MHz, or a 400HMz Sun UltraSparc, both which\nregularly sported about 512MB of RAM, but obviously cost about 100x\nmore.\n\n\n100 Raspberry Pi machines, networked and working in parallel, would\nconsume 350W and cost $3500 (not counting networking hardware), both\nnumbers in the ballpark of the best current CPU-intensive\nsingle-workstation systems. Assuming perfect parallelization, it could\nfinish in a little over 10 minutes, but a more realistic guess would\nbe 15-20 minutes. I'm glad NREL decided to go with the Xeon Phi\ninstead of a cluster of RPis.\n\n\nMaybe I should start a Radiance \"speed\" test that measures the results\nin Joules instead of seconds.\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009482.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009482", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
