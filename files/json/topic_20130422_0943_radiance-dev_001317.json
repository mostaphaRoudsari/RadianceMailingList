(Same goes for others -- thanks!)\n\n\nThe data order in the file is a matrix running from smallest to largest Klems patches, with the columns (inner loop data) corresponding to the input directions.  This is verified by a tag in the \"DataDefinition\" section that says:\n\n\n\t<IncidentDataStructure>Columns</IncidentDataStructure>\n\n\nIf \"Rows\" appears there instead of Columns, then the outgoing directions are the inner loop, but this would be unusual and probably not supported by WINDOW.\n\n\nThe units of a BSDF are 1/steradians.\n\n\nIf you have the opportunity to link to C code, you may also use the existing BSDF parser library included in the Radiance source tree to do the data loading and interpretation.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-April/001317.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001317", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
