Looking deeper, it seems there is a script \"glaze\"\nthat can be used with Radiance but I couldn't find it\\used it.\n\n\nI am trying to follow these guidelines :\nhttp://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/devalpine_visarc_glazing.pdf\n\n\nThanks a lot for your feedback.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlivier Brouard\n\n\nobrouard at gmail.com\nt: + 1 (415) 373 7808\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009504.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009504", "created_by": "Olivier_Brouard"}
