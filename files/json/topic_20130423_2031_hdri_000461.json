My Nikon camera generates a .NEF file in RAW version however I was able to generate a .HDR file using .JPG of the same images in Photoshop. After I generated the .HDR file I tried running evalglare on it which gives me an error. I understand I need to have a fish eye lens to get the full view in order to get the correct results but the purpose of my experiment is to test the error in dgp using different lenses that are not fish eye lens. I am using the -vth command and have entered the -vv and -vh as calculated for the 35mm lens on a DX format camera (25.74degrees and 37.4degrees). This gives me an error pict_update_view: unknown view type and error: invalid view specified. Can anyone please let me know where I am going wrong.\n\n\nThanks,\nAvinash\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-April/000461.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000461", "created_by": "Avinash_Gautam"}
