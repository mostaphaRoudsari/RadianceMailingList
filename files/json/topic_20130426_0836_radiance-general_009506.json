I\nhave heard that material reflectivity is a very important parameter that.\nHow important are:\n\n\n- Color (I am pretty sure I read something in this list about grey-world\nsimulations... I think it was Rob).\n- Textures\n- Specularities\n- Patterns\netc.\n\n\nMy concern is that defining materials is actually not a very easy task, so\nI just wanted to know what are the most important things here.\n\n\nTHANKS VERY MUCH!\n\n\nGerman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-April/009506.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009506", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
