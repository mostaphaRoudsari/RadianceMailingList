Since OpenStudio's first allegiance is to EnergyPlus, materials are monochromatic and take absorptance rather than reflectance as a parameter. We need to work within the EnergyPlus worldview for now.\n\n\nRemember, in OpenStudio parlance, surfaces have *constructions* applied to them, which are made up of one or more materials. So the process is first you need to identify what construction is applied to your surface, then look at the makeup of the construction, to find the material that affects your light reflectance (absorptance). Make sense?\n\n\nIn the future we'd like to add direct entering of Radiance material parameters so you can include specularity and roughness (and color), but for now it's diffuse gray. =)\n\n\n- Rob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2013-April/000110.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000110", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
