(At today's currency\nexchange rates, 48 and 143 USD respectively.)\n\n\nHaving said this, most of the text is devoted to the mathematical\ndevelopment of the analytic tests and background information on the physical\nmodels. The tests themselves are reasonably well described in:\n\n\nhttp://www.dau.ca/ddci/files/Download/ReportonAGI32validationofCIE171_Compil\ned_070620.pdf\n\n\nwhich is freely available.\n\n\nIt would be best if both the test models (which are not subject to copyright\nlimitations) and the test results are made publicly available.\n\n\nIan Ashdown, P.
