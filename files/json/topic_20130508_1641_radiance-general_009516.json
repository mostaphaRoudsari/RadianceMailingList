I couldn't find an executable file for it in my  Radiance directory & a search online didn't bring up reference to it either.    The error I get when I try to run oconv is \"Can't find executable for \"cat\" .system - cannot execute \"!cat ./lib/table_1.rad\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.       Genprism - from page 53 in book - I can run genprism if I don't put in the final 4 extrusion factors.   What am I doing wrong?\nIf I run the command as written in the book:  genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_sw 4 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -1 0 0 2.5 > look.txt\nI get the following error:               Usage:  genprism material name { - | vfile | N v1 v2 .. vN} [-1 1vect] [-r radius] [-c][-e]\n\n\nIf I run the command without the extrusion vector (final 4 #'s) it creates the prism with the 'z' values at 1 which I'm guessing is the default.\n\n\nThank you for help!!\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nSandy Houck   LEED AP BD+C, LC\nBrummitt Energy Associates, Inc.\n619-531-1126\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-May/009516.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009516", "created_by": "Sandy_Houck"}
