It has all the other options available in gendaymtx,\nbut I added some new:\n\n\n- It allows interpolation for subhourly analysis.\n- Allows overwriting the latitude-longitude-timezone from the weather file.\n\n\nIn case someone wants to try it and check for bugs and that kind of stuff,\nlet me know! I compared a few cases, and it worked well.\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-June/009536.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009536", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
