The question I face is that when I manually generate an image using Photosphere I am able to calibrate the image using an illuminance meter which, when false colours are applied, generates one range of values.  If I duplicate this scene using canoncap an HDR image is output but one that gives very different  (like 3 times smaller) upper luminance values.   Is there a part to the method I have not accomplished and/or is there a way to calibrate the process in order to get these illuminance values to match the calibrated process?\n\n\nI am hoping this to be the case so I can set up a time-lapse situation like others have successfully done and process the images using evalglare.\n\n\nThanks for any assistance. \n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBrent \n\n\nBrent Huchuk\nCarleton University \nMASc Candidate\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-June/000480.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000480", "created_by": "Brent_Huchuk"}
