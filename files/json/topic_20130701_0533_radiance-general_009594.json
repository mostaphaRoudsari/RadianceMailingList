I want to build my own spatial mapping of illuminance values in\nanother visualization tool.  Sorry for the newbie question!\n\n\nHow would I do that?  Can anyone lend some hints of where I would look to\nsee this, files, etc?\n\n\nThanks,\nCS\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009594.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009594", "created_by": "Chien_Si_Harriman"}
