No need to install anything!\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIME_(command)\n\n\nThere even is a nice time bat-file on Stackoverflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/673523/how-to-measure-execution-time-of-command-in-windows-command-line\n\n\nTo run Mark Stock benchmark on windows you have to:\nStep 1:\ncopy xform.exe and rename it cat.exe\nOR\ninstall Mingw which seems to contain a cat.exe\n\n\nStep2:\ncreate a file called 'options' in the bench4 directory\nwith this contents:\n-pa 1.0 -pj 0.02 -ps 1\n-w+ -i- -bv+\n-dt 0.050 -dc 0.50 -dj 0.0 -ds 0.250 -dr 1 -dp 512 -dv+\n-st 0.150\n-ab 4 -ar 128 -ad 1500 -as 500 -aa 0.15 -av 0.0 0.0 0.0 -aw 0\n-lw 0.004\n-ss 1.0 -lr -10 -u- -pd 0.0\n\n\nStep3:\nCreate a .bat file with this contents:\n@echo off\necho %time%\nobj2mesh -n 15 -r 16384 lens.obj > lens.msh\noconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube2f.rad > cube2f_instance.oct\noconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube4f.rad > cube4f_instance.oct\noconv -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad scene.rad > scene.oct\nrpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o windows.unf scene.oct\npfilt -1 -e +0 -x /4 -y /4 -r .6 -m .15 windows.unf > windows.pic\nra_bmp windows.pic > windows.bmp\necho %time%\npause\n\n\nStep 4:\nRun the .bat file\n\n\nIf you don't want to calculate the time yourself you can use the .bat file\non Stackoverflow (I haven't tried it yet).\n\n\n-I believe Greg also mentioned a way to avoid the use of cat in Radiance,\nbut I didn't understood how. :)\n\n\nI guess that was all I had to change.\n\n\nBest Regards, Guy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-July/001367.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001367", "created_by": "Guy_Vaessen"}
