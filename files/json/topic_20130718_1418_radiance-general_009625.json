What is\nthe best way of modeling this system considering all the possible internal\nreflections? Is this a good case for three-phase method daylight simulation?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009625.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009625", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
