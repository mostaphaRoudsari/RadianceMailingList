LiVi is my add-on for Blender that acts as a pre/post-processor for Radiance. Major changes in this version are the use of gendaymtx for DDS, per-point numerical result display, and Radiance sky files can now be selected as a sky option. I've have done limited testing on linux (64bit) Windows 7 (64bit) and OS X 10.6/7 (32 & 64 bit).\nLiVi can be downloaded for the LiVi website at http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi. LiVi is released under a GPL version 2 license and the code can be checked out at the Google Code repository https://code.google.com/p/livi/. Bug reports can also be left there. Questions, feedback etc can be posted to the LiVi mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/livi-list.  \n\n\nFinally, have a super weekend.\n\n\nRyan  \n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nThis email has been scanned by MessageLabs' Email Security\nSystem on behalf of the University of Brighton.\nFor more information see http://www.brighton.ac.uk/is/spam/\n___________________________________________________________\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009628.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009628", "created_by": "Ryan_Southall"}
