If the resulting image looks right, - job done. However, that \nleaves the question why bother with Radiance and its complexity in the first \nplace, considering that other renderers are perceived as being much friendlier \nto the user.\n\n\nMeasurements on the light scattering (BSDF) of a material take out the guess \nwork, but are generally associated with costs. A number of companies sell \ndifferent equipment and a number of companies offer measurement services (me \nincluded). Choosing a Radiance material is then based on solid data and the \nresulting model comes with a known error budget.\n\n\nOr you can enquire about existing scattering data with the manufacturer of the \nproduct,- which you probably already have done in your case.\n\n\nOtherwise, LBNL is building a database on window materials, so your product may \nalready be in it.\n\n\nAnd, if I may say so, the recently posted review \n(http://www.pab.eu/docs/Review_of_simulating_four_classes_of_window_materials_for_daylighting_with_non-standard_BSDF_using_simulation_program_Radiance.pdf) \nhas all currently available Radiance window materials in one place. Including \nthe every-now-and-then asked question about the difference between trans and \ntransfunc. \"Window\" materials in this context means anything transmissive or \ntranslucent, so it is not specific to the usual coated, non-scattering panes . \nThis compilation was started in March, when I realized I had already asked the \nsame specific question to Greg in April 1995. So it started as a notebook to \nremind me of details, - maybe this list is useful to others too.\n\n\nhope that helps, have a nice weekend,\nbest\nPeter\n\n\n\n\nOn 07/19/13 10:16, Lars O.

There is an error in this, as the refractive index of ETFE is lower (should be 1.4) than that of glass, however, for a clear, thin ETFE film, this may be rather ok for near-normal angles.\n>\n> In some of the images, the ETFE did not seam to be clear. Probably it hat be printed, or some surface treatment had been applied to roughen it. In this case, you need to model the surface as it is, which has little to do with the pure material properties of ETFE. Probably you need some data on the transmission and reflection, provided by the manufacturer or by your own measurements. That would allow you to approximate a trans / transfunc material to your sample.\n>\n> If you want to model something like patterns, where parts of the surface are printed and others are not, you can use mixfunc and mix the surface material with a clear ETFE material.\n>\n> The multiple internal reflections would be accounted for when directly looking at the pillow. Bright spots by such reflections e.g. on a ceiling or wall would not appear. That would require secondary light sources (not very useful for the complex geometry), the pmap, or maybe a precalculated BSDF of one pillow.\n>\n> Cheers, Lars.\n> _______________________________________________\n> Radiance-general mailing list\n> Radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n> http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\n>\n\n\n\n\npab advanced technologies Ltd, http://www.pab.eu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009630.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009630", "created_by": "Peter_Apian-Bennewitz"}
