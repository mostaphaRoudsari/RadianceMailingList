Similar to the example 2\nin the three phase method tutorial, I have two sets of windows\n(clerestories and windows). I want to first calculate the annual\nilluminance levels on a 6 by 8 grid. Then filter the data by occupancy\n(normal working hours) and calculate the dynamic daylight metrics.\n\n\nSince is the shading device in my model is dynamic and has to change based\non the incident light, I have two BSDF files for each window (e.g.\ntinted.xml and untinted.xml).\n\n\nI have created the vmx, dmx, xml, and smx files. But I am confused on how\nto write the dctimestep and the rest of the calculations. Bellow is what I\nhave typed so far.  I'd truly appreciate it if you could help me from this\npoint on.\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nLeyla Sanati\n\n\noconv materials/room.mat objects/room.rad objects/windows.rad\nobjects/clerestories.rad objects/ground.rad > model_vmx.oct\n\n\nrcontrib -f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -fo -o results/photocells_%s.vmx -b\nkbinS -m windowglow_W -b kbinS -m windowglow_C -I+ -ab 12 -ad 50000 -lw\n2e-5 model_vmx.oct < data/photocells.pts\n\n\noconv materials/room.mat objects/room.rad objects/ground.rad\nobjects/sky_white1.rad > model_dmx.oct\n\n\ngenklemsamp -vd 0 -1 0 objects/windows.rad | rcontrib -c 1000 -e MF:4 -f\nreinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m sky_glow -faf model_dmx.oct >\nresults/windows.dmx\n\n\ngenklemsamp -vd 0 -1 0 objects/clerestories.rad | rcontrib -c 1000 -e MF:4\n-f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m sky_glow -faf model_dmx.oct >\nresults/clerestories.dmx\n\n\nepw2wea USA_WI_Milwaukee_TMY3.epw Milwaukee.wea\n\n\ngendaymtx -m 4 Milwaukee.wea > Milwaukee.smx\n\n\nrlam '!dctimestep -n 8760 results/photocells_windowglow_W.vmx\nxml/venetain80.xml results/windows.dmx Milwaukee.smx' '!dctimestep -n 8760\nresults/photocells_windowglow_C.vmx xml/tinted.xml results/clerestories.dmx\nMilwaukee.smx' > results/venetain80_tinted.dat\n\n\nrlam '!dctimestep -n 8760 results/photocells_windowglow_W.vmx\nxml/venetain80.xml results/windows.dmx Milwaukee.smx' '!dctimestep -n 8760\nresults/photocells_windowglow_C.vmx xml/untinted.xml\nresults/clerestories.dmx Milwaukee.smx' > results/venetain80_untinted.dat\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009637.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009637", "created_by": "Leyla_Sanati"}
