I am trying to simulate a project with dynamic\ndaylight simulation (dds / rcontrib)  but i am not able to say if the\nresults are correct or not.\n\n\nin other word, i need a reference so to check if the results (according to\nmy settings) i am getting are fine or not.\n\n\nthx in advance,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*N.Nassif\n\n\nLighting Designer***\n*PLDA Member\n\n\n\n\n*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009648.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009648", "created_by": "nassif_nassif"}
