During sunrise and\nsunset, gendaylit shows \"ERROR: Model parameters out of range\".   so I plan\nto use gensky to generate the sky model (-B b -R r), where b and r are\ncalculated by \"illumiance/179\". However,  I found the illuminance value at\n5 pm (calculated using gensky with default sky type) jumps a lot from illum\nat 4 pm (calculated using gendaylit). I changed the sky type to +i, which\ndecreases values.  My question is that how I should choose the sky type for\ngensky to avoid big change from gendaylit?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nJH\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-July/009668.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009668", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
