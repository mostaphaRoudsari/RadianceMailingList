Then I'm using rpict to generate the picture, and pcond -h to\nconvert it to a human visual response.\n\n\nBut I realized that if I use the default value of -O in gendaylit (output\nin radiance of the visible radiation W/m^2/sr) the picture looks less\nbright.\n\n\nSo I don't know which one is the right one to use in this case.\n\n\nI tried to find out if the default input when using pcond would be\nluminance rather than visible radiation, but couldn't find an answer for\nthat, or maybe there is another command other than pcond, that takes the\ninput in luminance values, then that would be the one I should use.\n\n\nOr maybe there is an additional step that I'm missing...\n\n\nI wonder if somebody can give me a hint about this, and/or where to look..\n:)\n\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n\nCh.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009675.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009675", "created_by": "minchaca"}
