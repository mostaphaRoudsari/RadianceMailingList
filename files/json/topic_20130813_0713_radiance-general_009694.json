In order to help move things along, let's all make sure we are good to go on the conferencing tools. \n\n\nYou need to log on to this url:\n\n\nhttp://www.mymeetings.com/nc/join.php?i=748078570&p=1653&t=c\n\n\n...and then enter this info:\nMeeting number:        748078570\nMeeting passcode:      1653\n\n\nThis will get you onto the webcast. You need to do this whether you are at NREL or remote. You need to have Java enabled, and you will need a plugin as well. Please try getting onto the site well before your presentation slot! Once you are on, we will be able to transfer control to you at the appropriate time. During Q&A, I will be transferring control to the next presenter's system, so we'll lose your slides. I'll try and wait till the last minute in case you need to reference your presentation during the Q&A. \n\n\nWe will do a better job of fielding questions from the webcast attendees as well. \n\n\nTo hear what's going on, call one of these numbers:\n1-210-516-8514           1-877-960-9637\n...and enter this code:\nPasscodes:\nParticipant: 8824531\n\n\nPlease mute your phones, if you are not presenting! (At any given time, that means, like, all of you.)\n\n\nWe'll be going live in a little bit, \"see\" you then. \n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009694.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009694", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
