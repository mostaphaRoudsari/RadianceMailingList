Recently, our daylight research lab bought Apple Mac Mini and Canon 60D DSLR cameras with fisheye lenses. HDRcapOSX will be the software to control the DSRL camera and capture HDRI. However, we are stuck on the error message of HDRcapOSX. (Error!! Cannot open control file. ) Do you know how can we solve this error message?\n\n\nThe OSX version of our Mac Mini is Mountain Lion and we tried latest version (October, 2011)of HDRcapOSX (2.0 and 2.1). Canon EOS utility was installed in Mac Mini and there was no trouble to download images from the camera via a usb cable in the EOS utility. The mode dial of the camera was manual. Please, let me know if you want to know more test environments to solve this issue.\n\n\nBest regards,\nJonghoon Kim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-August/000484.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000484", "created_by": "Jonghoon_Kim"}
