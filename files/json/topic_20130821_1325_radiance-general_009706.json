The entire 18 hours(!) of content can be accessed in order from the following playlist link:\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx\n\n\nUnfortunately the recording timed out early on some days, so Kera Lagios' DIVA for Rhino demo is unceremoniously halted about halfway through, and the OpenStudio demo does not appear at all. Jack DeValpine makes a fast exit at the end of day two as well. Apologies all around on that score. With compressed video and small type being what they are, you also might want to avail yourself of the high resolution copies of all the presenter slide decks Andy McNeil and LBNL have made available at radiance-online.org:\n\n\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co\n\n\nWe left the dead time during the coffee breaks in the streams, so you can pretend you were actually there. Just play back, and during the breaks make small talk about the 5-phase method with your cat. \n\n\nOne last time, I want to say it was a pleasure and an honor to be able to host the workshop this year. Enjoy!\n\n\n- Googs\n\n\n\n\nRob Guglielmetti\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\nCommercial Buildings Research Group\n15013 Denver West Parkway MS: RSF202\nGolden, CO 80401   --   303.275.4319\nrob.guglielmetti at nrel.gov\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009706.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009706", "created_by": "Rob_Guglielmetti"}
