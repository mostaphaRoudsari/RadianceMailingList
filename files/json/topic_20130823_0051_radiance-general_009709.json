Standard bash syntax doesn't seem to work in that case (i.e. xPos = 5 and $xPos).\n\n\nSpecifically, the coordinates of some of my objects change as a function of angle. So instead of recalculating all the x, y, and z coordinates by hand it would be really useful to just define a new angle and let Radiance's oconv program use the updated Cartesian coordinates.\n\n\nI somehow have this deep belief that this should be possible :)\n\n\nIf you know a clever way to do this, please let me know.\n\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Bannert, Dipl.-Psych.\nVision & Cognition Lab, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Univ. of T\u00fcbingen & BCCN T\u00fcbingen\nOtfried-M\u00fcller-Str. 25, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany\nPhone: +49 - (0)7071 / 29 - 89031\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009709.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009709", "created_by": "Michael_Bannert"}
