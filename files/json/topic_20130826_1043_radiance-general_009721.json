You need to have radiance installed, but that's about it.  The\nscript downloads geometry and files needed for the simulation.  It's\nwritten in bash so it should work on Mac or Linux (sorry windows).\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009721.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009721", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
