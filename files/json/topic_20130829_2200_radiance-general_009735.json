The properties of the\nglass are as follows:\n\n\nVisible Transmittance: 67%\nReflectance: 18%\nClarity (small-angle scattering): 4%\nThickness: 8mm\n\n\nTo generate accurate BSDF files, I thought I should model the blind slats\nas trans material, but I am struggling with translating above properties\ninto trans material modifiers.\nI'd appreciate it if you helped me with writing the blind material script.\nAlso, I am not sure where to include the glass thickness. genblinds does\nnot seem to have an option for blind thickness.\nDoes the glass thickness in this case affect the BSDF results?\n\n\nThanks,\nLeyla\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-August/009735.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009735", "created_by": "Leyla_Sanati"}
