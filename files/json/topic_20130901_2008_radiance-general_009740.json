You've never seen the Guggenheim quite like\nthis before, and as appreciators of light and its behavior, you will\nfind yourself both satisfied and intrigued by his installations.\n\n\nI've been working to recreate a few of them in Radiance, and am\nrunning into some difficulties. One piece, \"Afrum I (White)\", should\nlook like this:\nhttp://nyogalleristny.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/afrum1.jpg\n\n\nIt's a point light in a small box above the entryway to the room, a\nspecial 6-sided hole cut in the wall, and the light beams this\ncube-like shape onto the corner. The light patch illuminates the room.\n\n\nInstead, what I get looks like this:\nhttp://markjstock.org/transfer/img06.png\n\n\nHere are the relevant rendering parameters:\n-ds 0.02 -lw 1e-5 -ab 5 -aa 0.03 -ar 256 -ad 1024 -as 512\n\n\nI suspect that I simply need more ambient subsamples, as a few ambient\npoints are catching the patch and some are not. But increasing -ad and\n-as do nothing to improve quality.\n\n\nOr, WAIT, are those bright spots seeing the little hole (it's 6\" wide)\nthrough which the light is originally emerging? How can I prevent\nthat?\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009740.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009740", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
