I added this line to the code :\nvoid BSDF testmat6 0 bsdf_0c.xml 0 1 0 .00\nand I'm sure that my .xml file is working as I've tried it on a BSDF viewer and it worked.Once I run the simulation on Diva for Rhino an error appears in German language. What I assume that I've wrote something wrong in the material file so that's why I cannot run the simulation. But I can't find the error, can you help me out with it?\nI used the genBSDF function to convert the .rad file to an .xml file.\nSincerely,Islam Mashaly.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009747.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009747", "created_by": "Islam_Mashaly"}
