This utility enables\nusers to easily resize and transpose matrix data (text or binary).  The\nprogram was developed to ease the five-phase method workflow for\nilluminance sensor points.  It replaces awk and tr, which were only\navailable for unix type systems.  Now you can perform the entire five-phase\nmethod workflow on Windows.\n\n\nHere's the manpage:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rcollate.pdf\n\n\nThe five-phase tutorial has been updated to use the new utility and to\naddress a couple issues raised by Leyla (thanks!):\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf\n\n\nMany thanks to Greg!\n\n\nBest,\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009752.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009752", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
