I am using the HEAD version from about yesterday...\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009769.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009769", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
