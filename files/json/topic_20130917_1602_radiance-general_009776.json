I have modeled a window with\nvenetian blinds on the lower part and translucent louvers on the upper part\nof the window. I tried to run genBSDF with my geometry including the\nblinds, louvers, glazing and the window reveal, but I did not get any\nresults back after 14 hours.\n\n\nI know genBSDF runtime is long, but I wonder if I am doing something wrong,\nor if I could change anything in my model that could make genBSDF run\nfaster.\n\n\nAttached are the geometry files. Here is what I typed:\n\n\ngenBSDF -n 12 +f +b -geom meter -t4 5 reveal_glazing.rad venetian80.rad\nLChazed.rad > bsdf/v80_hazed_t45.xm\n\n\nBest,\nLeyla\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009776.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009776", "created_by": "Leyla_Sanati"}
