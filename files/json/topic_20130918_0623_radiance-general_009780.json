This works fine for example <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhsMeTtIPFA&list=HL1379509671&feature=mh_lolz>\n\n\nHowever, that's for my made-up illumination, I need to confirm that what I'm doing bears any relationship to \"real\" illumination, i.e. using gensky with \"+s\", \"-s\" etc.\n\n\nI've tried rendering the same scene while specifying the sun position using gensky, for example this works fine:\n\n\n% Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 +s\n%\n% # C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MinGW-Radiance\\bin\\gensky -ang 45 45 +s\n% # Ground ambient level: 14.8\n%\n% void light solar\n% 0\n% 0\n% 3 6.77e+006 6.77e+006 6.77e+006\n%\n% solar source sun\n% 0\n% 0\n% 4 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107 0.5\n%\n% void brightfunc skyfunc\n% 2 skybr skybright.cal\n% 0\n% 7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107\n%\n\n\nHowever, when I try with the -s sky:\n\n\n% Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 -s\n%\n% # C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MinGW-Radiance\\bin\\gensky -ang 45 45 -s\n% # Ground ambient level: 14.8\n%\n% void brightfunc skyfunc\n% 2 skybr skybright.cal\n% 0\n% 7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107\n\n\nIt just fails to render \"pfilt: picture too dark or too bright \". The -c -u -i skies also don't render.\n\n\nI'm running minGW radiance in windows (with a Matlab wrapper), the +s, -s, -c and -u skies work fine when I specify time and geographical location with gensky, but I want to specify the exact sun position.\n\n\nAnyone have any suggestions?\n\n\nbest wishes,\n\n\nGeorge\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009780.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009780", "created_by": "Paul_Lovell"}
