This is to show irradiance levels changing at a given point in a sequential animation. Anybody have a trick to do this, or something like it? \n\n\nThanks very much,\nMike\n\n\n\n\nMichael Martinez ~ Associate\nLOISOS + UBBELOHDE\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nwww.coolshadow.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-September/009797.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009797", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez"}
