And while using pfilt command to divide x and y by a\nnumber, it says pfilt is not recoznised as an internal or external command.\nIs there another command to resize the image that can be used with DOS\nwindow?\n2. How shall i install the evalglare application? When i run evalglare\napplication by right clicking the setup file,a plain dos screen appears.How\nshall i start with it?\n3. Will evalglare work well with hdr images other than fish-eye?\nPlease help me to solve these issues.\nThankyou\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-September/000487.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000487", "created_by": "nithya_merin"}
