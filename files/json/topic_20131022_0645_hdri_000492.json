Rendering the images for every 5\nminutes is not a problem, however, I stuck when trying to convert the HDRs\nto some tonemapped images. As far as I got it, In ra_jpeg/hdr2jpeg no\nexposure can be given at all, in ra_tiff/ra_bmp only relative exposures can\nbe applied.\n\n\nThus my question: is it possible to explicitly set the exposure used in the\ntonemapping process with any tool in Radiance?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\nDavid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2013-October/000492.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000492", "created_by": "David_Geisler-Moroder"}
