Although I have managed\nto find similar equations for clear sky, I haven't managed to find any for\nan overcast CIE sky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you lead me to any reference that can help me on this research?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSotiris Papantoniou\n\n\nPhD Candidate\n\n\nEnvironmental Engineering Dept.\n\n\nTechnical University of Crete\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-November/009865.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009865", "created_by": "Sotiris_Papantoniou"}
