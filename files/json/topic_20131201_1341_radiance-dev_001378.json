Still no luck.\n\n\necho %RAYPATH%\n.;C:\\Program Files\\Radiance\\lib\n\n\nI have found that there is a bit of inconsistency with file paths under \nWindows, so I also tried\n\n\nset RAYPATH=.;C:/Program Files/Radiance/lib\necho %RAYPATH%\n.;C:/Program Files/Radiance/lib\n\n\nbut again to no avail.\n\n\nMy questions therefore are:\na) Where does bgraph.exe look for line.plt?\nb) Windows radiance ships with bgraph.exe, but not with the \n$RAYPATH/meta dir. Does this mean that bgraph.exe (with psmeta and \nghostview, of course) isn't actually that useful? What can it do?\n\n\nMany thanks for your thoughts.\n\n\nHave a lovely Sunday evening\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-December/001378.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001378", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
