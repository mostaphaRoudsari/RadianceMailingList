Installing ruby.zip from the \nNREL web site (and making sure %PATH% picks it up) did not \nhelp--objview.rb kept complaining about missing input files. It appears \nthat somehow, ARGV is completely ignored by the parser once the options \nare dealt with. However, I know little about Ruby.\n\n\nSince I need a working objview next Friday, I finished the re-write of \nobjview in Perl, which I started some time ago, but never polished off.\n\n\nWhilst at it, I also completed a Perl port of objpict.csh.\n\n\nBoth appear to work under LINUX and Windows Vista. Zip archive with \nWindows exe files is here:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/win_objpict_objview.zip\n\n\nYour feedback would be much appreciated.\n\n\nSince the Windows objview.rb has some extra functionality over the UNIX \ncsh version (namely ltview), I started work on a x-plat ltview.pl, but \nhave I admit that I'm not sure what it is meant to do:\n\n\na) if ltview is meant to show the actual luminaire (or fixture for you \nnon-Europeans), then are not objview or objpict good enough?\n\n\nb) if, on the other hand, it is the actual photometric distribution that \nmatters, then would it not be better to extract the dat file of the \ndistribution, and suspend a little disk or square with that distribution \napplied to it. The command line parser could then be extended to\n- include an option that might cause it to put the disk inside a sphere \nrather than a box; and/or\n- render a -vta fisheye view from just below this disk, so that the \nentire photometric distribution might be appreciated.\n\n\nI'm happy enough to look into this if it is felt that the Windows \nversion of objview and the 'official' one should be based on the same \ncode. Would need some guidance, though as to what ltview should do.\n\n\nGood night and good luck\n\n\nAxel\n\n\nPS: I'd love to call it 'iesview', but this name is already taken by an \nadd-on to AGI32. Works pretty well, actually (under Windows).\n@Ian, we probably have to thank you for this little gem?\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-December/001379.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001379", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
