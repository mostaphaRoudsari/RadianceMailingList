I mean, to show the illuminance values (in\nan orthographic image of a plan created by a camera with parallel lens) at\nthe real position of the illuminance sensors (Rtrace/Rsensor).\n\n\nThe only way I could find is to use Psign to produce text's image, and then\nposition the produced text in the plan image by using Pcompos. Something\nlike this: psign 100 Lux | pcompos inp.hdr 0 0 +t .5 - 200 200 >\nout.hdr. However,\nPcompos takes input of the location of a pixel and places the text there.\nThis is not what I intend to achieve.\n\n\nAre there other ways to do this? Thank you in anticipation.\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaibhav Jain\nwww.vaibhavjain.co\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009901.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009901", "created_by": "Vaib"}
