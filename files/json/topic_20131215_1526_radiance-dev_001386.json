I \nam not entirely sure where this is from, but it is in the NREL version \nof Radiance for Windows.\n\n\nThere are three minor differences to the original Windows version:\n\n\na) there is a -c (as in 'CSV') option that simply dumps the entire file \nas a text spreadsheet with header. The delimiter defaults to ' ' \n(space), but can selected with the -d option. Please note that if you \nwish to have a tab-sep output, then '\\t' won't do. Still working out how \nto do this. For now, you'll need to give it -c 'CTRL-v TAB' to actually \ninsert a tab on the command line.\n\n\nI would like to think that a CSV dump of the EPW weather data will make \nit a little easier to do a bit of QA on the data. Hence this extra option.\n\n\nb) the 'meridian' bug of the original epw2wea is fixed. Places such as \nDelhi (GMT + 5:30 hrs) or Kathmandu (GMT +5:45 hrs) are correctly \nrepresented in the time_zone row of the wea header.\n\n\nc) input can be from STDIN\n\n\nepw2wea.pl is tested on LINUX and Windows Vista.\n\n\nAny feedback is very much appreciated. Particularly, I'd love to know \nyour preferred naming convention for the columns in the CSV output. The \nradiation stuff tends to follow CIE conventions. For instance, global \nhorizontal irradiance is headed as Eeg. I kinda improvised with others, \nbut tended to be rather verbose with those column headers that I would \nconsider a little obscure, for the simple reason that I don't tend to \nuse them. Please do get in touch if there are any other de-facto naming \nconvention that should be adapted.\n\n\ndev site:\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/devel/csh2perl/\n\n\nGood night to you all\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2013-December/001386.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001386", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
