Its not clear to me that I really need the .map file, \u00a0based on this comment \"The material names for the surfaces will assigned based on the mapping rules file given in the\u00a0\u2212m\u00a0option. If no mapping file is given, the identifiers given by the \"usemtl\" statements will be used as the material names.\" \u00a0Looking at the .obj file, it uses usemtl statements, which is why I don't necessarily think I need the .map? Sample from the .obj is below:\n\n\nmtllib light.obj.mtl\ns off\nv -0.279400 -0.006350 0.076200\nv -0.279400 -0.006350 0.003175\nv 0.482600 -0.006350 0.076200\nv 0.482600 -0.006350 0.003175\nvn 0.000000 -1.000000 -0.000000\nvn 0.000000 -1.000000 -0.000000\nusemtl appearance0\ng default\nf 1//1 2//1 3//1\nf 3//2 2//2 4//2\n\n\n\n\nNext I believe I need to convert the .obj.mtl file to a material .rad file. I found this comment\u00a0\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000727.html\n\n\nindicating there is not a direct translator. So, I believe I need to do this manually? Here is an example from the .obj.mtl file:\n\n\nnewmtl appearance0\nKa 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125\nKd 0.793125 0.793125 0.793125\nKs 0.119 0.119 0.119\nNs 119.04\nd 1\nillum 2\n\n\nIf this is the case, my next step would be to dig into both material descriptions. Any past experience would be appreciated!\n\n\nOne other question, is there a better output format than .obj that incorporates the material properties, or maybe I should be asking, has a more direct correlation between the material properties? I have a feeling its not that easy!\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nBrian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2013-December/009915.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009915", "created_by": "Brian_A_Karr"}
