I am involved in a project to assess the light output from light pipes. We are gonna simulate the light output of 2 types of light pipes and then compared them to the on site measurements. I would appreciate any guiding or advise on where to start the simulations. I am considering backward retracing as a more suitable option than forward retracing for this particular case, what do you think?\nThank you\nAle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-January/009931.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009931", "created_by": "Alejandro_Pacheco_Di\u00e9guez"}
