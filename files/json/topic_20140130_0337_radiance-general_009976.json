Which leads me to suppose that I must be doing something wrong. \nI'm using the commands in *Bold* which result in the world.rad files below.\n\n\n\n\nAnother question.\n\n\nI'm actually interested in simulating turbidity underwater, don't know \nif anyone can comment upon whether the turbidity numbers for air relate \nto those for water? Is there a better renderer for such things.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n============================ BORING DETAILS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*# C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MinGW-Radiance\\bin\\gensky -ang 10 -80 +s -B \n55.87 -t 0.00**\n*\n# Ground ambient level: 17.8\n\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 2.17e+006 2.17e+006 2.17e+006\n\n\nsolar source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.969846 -0.171010 0.173648 0.5\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n2 skybr skybright.cal\n0\n7 1 7.71e+000 4.99e+000 2.95e-001 0.969846 -0.171010 0.173648\nskyfunc glow skyglow 0 0 4 1.00 1.00 1.00 0\nskyglow source sky   0 0 4 0 0 1 180\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5    0.8    0.8    0.8    0.0    0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*# C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MinGW-Radiance\\bin\\gensky -ang 10 -80 +s -B \n55.87 -t 5.00**\n*# Ground ambient level: 17.8\n\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3 2.17e+006 2.17e+006 2.17e+006\n\n\nsolar source sun\n0\n0\n4 0.969846 -0.171010 0.173648 0.5\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n2 skybr skybright.cal\n0\n7 1 7.71e+000 4.99e+000 2.95e-001 0.969846 -0.171010 0.173648\nskyfunc glow skyglow 0 0 4 1.00 1.00 1.00 0\nskyglow source sky   0 0 4 0 0 1 180\nvoid plastic white\n0\n0\n5    0.8    0.8    0.8    0.0    0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr P.
