Can you please recommend some\nguidelines/best-practices/research-papers that have conducted\nsuch quantitative analysis, and came out with some methodologies for model\ncalibration, and their confidence intervals. My university had \"Rendering\nwith Radiance\", that could have been a good starter, but somehow it has\nmysteriously gone missing. It has become a rare book, if I guess right. :)\n\n\nMy experiment will be a controlled one, in which only the lights will be\nturned On or Off and I will check their influence on results. The major\nfactor for anomalies could be from Sky, as initially I will be using Gensky\nas the sky model.\n\n\nI look forward for your suggestions. Thank you!\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/009992.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_009992", "created_by": "Vaib"}
