This model has many polygons for surfaces such as walls, windows,\nluminaire, furniture etc.\n\n\nHow shall I develop a method/function that can parse this .rad file and\nreturn me back the room dimensions. I have no additional information, like\nwalls' name variable etc.\n\n\nI want to make a simple java method for that. I am not using any CAD API.\n\n\nIs it possible? Please don't bash me for my stupid question.. :P\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-February/001396.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001396", "created_by": "Vaib"}
