(I'm also trying to find the \"ray\" directory \nand the \"rad\" command, but that is secondary.)\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\n\n*Jill Dalglish, PE, LEED AP BD+C*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010056.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010056", "created_by": "Jill_Dalglish"}
