Both files are 8760 lines long. The\nmatrix contains grey illuminance readings and has as many columns as\nthere are sensors in the room.\n\n\nThe following doesn't actually do anything useful.  I'm simply running\nthe annual illuminance matrix through rlam:\n\n\nrlam $lmx | awk '{print NF}' |sort |uniq\n40\n\n\nas expected, this gives me a single number: the sensor count.  BUT\nthis only works with a small grid.  With a larger one (650 grid\npoints), I get\n\n\nrlam $lmx | awk '{print NF}' |sort |uniq -c\n      1 271\n      9 272\n    402 273\n   2400 274\n   1598 275\n     97 276\n      2 283\n     10 284\n     22 285\n     24 286\n     19 287\n      2 288\n      5 363\n     22 364\n     23 365\n     23 366\n      6 367\n    257 375\n   2237 376\n   1811 377\n    199 378\n      3 379\n   4174 650\n\n\nIt looks as if all the rows with only zeros (night time) are all\nright.  Daytime rows (longer lines) are truncated.\n\n\nIs there some rlam limitation wrt line length or column count that\nmight be causing this?\n\n\nLovely day to you all\n\n\nBest\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-February/001398.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001398", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
