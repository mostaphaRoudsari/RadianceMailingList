{"topic": "CIE Unified Glare Rating calculation - error in findglare", "category": "radiance-dev", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Ian Ashdown", "created_at": "February 18, 2014 at 02:54PM", "body": "The documentation for RADIANCE Visual Comfort Calculation\n(http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/glare.html) states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guth position index is used by this formula as well, and its calculation\nis described in [Levin75].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is true for  IESNA Visual Comfort Probability (VCP) calculations, but\nit is *not* true for CIE UGR calculations. Quoting from CIE 117-1995,\n\"Discomfort Glare in Interior Lighting,\" Section 4.5:  \"The position index\nis found by interpolating the data of Table 4.1 [Table of position\nindices].\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equation of Levin, R. E. 1975, \"Position Index in VCP Calculations,\"\nJournal of the IES, pp. 99-105, is based on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommittee on Recommendations of Quality and Quantity of Illumination of the\nIES, \"Outline of a Standard Procedure for Computing Visual Comfort Ratings\nfor Interior Lighting, Report No. 2 (1966), Illuminating Engineering, Vol.\n61, No. 10, October 1966, p. 643.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich shows a plot of the Guth position index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by Levin, \"The maximum difference between the basic Guth plot and\nEquation (6) is about 12 percent.\" An error plot shows that errors in excess\nof 5 percent occur over most of the range of the Guth position plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue aside, the RADIANCE documentation states:\n\n\nIf a single view direction is selected, findglare samples uniformly on the\nprojected hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, CIE 117-1995, Section 4.5, states: \"It is recommended that\nluminaires with T/R values outside the range of the table (0 to 3) be\nignored. It is further noted that some positions in the table at large H/R\nvalues are void. These correspond to positions hidden from observers by\neyebrows and foreheads, and accordingly to luminaires which do not add to\nthe UGR.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entries of Table 4.1 define an elliptical field of view measuring\napproximately 62 degrees vertical by 73 degrees horizontal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that by ignoring the shielding effect of eyebrows and\nforehead in the Guth position index (which regrettably assumes a Caucasian\nphysiognomy), the UGR values for narrow-beam luminaires with small luminous\nareas seen at high viewing angles can be grossly overestimated. In one\nstudy, the difference was 23 versus 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch errors typically occur within a range of less than 30 cm [12 inches]\nfor the observer position, but it remains that findglare does not appear to\nbe in full compliance with the requirements and recommendations of CIE\n117-1995. To do so would require replacing the Levin analytic equation with\nan interpolation of the Guth position indices table published therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This analysis is based on the above-referenced Visual Comfort Calculation\ndocument, dated 1992. I have not examined the current source code for\nfindglare to see whether it still applies.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Ashdown, P.
