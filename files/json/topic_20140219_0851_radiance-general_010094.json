I\nhave measured luminance values for the monitor showing white and black\nscreens in a dark room, as well as spectrophotometer reflectance data on\nthe screen while off.  Currently, I'm modeling it using a generic glass\nmaterial in front of a glow material, but this creates a lot of specular\nreflection in rpict renderings that doesn't match up with observations.\n Does anyone have suggestions for creating more accurate Radiance materials\nto model the monitor?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nNathaniel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010094.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010094", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones"}
