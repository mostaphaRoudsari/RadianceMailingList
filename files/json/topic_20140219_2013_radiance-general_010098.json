Should I use\n\"source\" identifier? The parallel light source is located in a room.\n\n\nWhat if I want to generate a parallel light beam (emitting from a tube)? I\nam currently using a tube and place a spheric shape light in that tube, but\nit may not be parallel emitting from the tube..\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010098.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010098", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
