Theoretically, this readings should be\n[cos(theta)*value of incident rays] hitting the sensor point (theta = angle\nbetween ray hitting the surface and sensor normal).  However,t our sensor\nis not this  relationship and I have to adjust the simualtion results to\nfit the actual sensor readings.\n\n\n\n\n   - one of the methods I can think of is to get directions of all the\n   incident rays hitting the sensor point and then calculate all the angles\n   between incident rays and sensor normal, and adjust the radiance values\n   before using rtrac to calculate the actual illuminance values.  Is that\n   feasible?   I notice there is a \"t\" option in rtrace, but it will return\n   all the rays, not just rays hitting the sensor points.\n   - Radiance traces only 1 ray from the sensor points or sample a number\n   of rays from sensor point? (my understaning was that rtrace first traces a\n   number of rays to check DIRECT light source and get the results, and then\n   traces a SINGLE ray following the sensor normal and then sampling more when\n   hitting a surface? if in this case, how can I determine the anges of direct\n   and indirect rays?)\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\njia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010100.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010100", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
