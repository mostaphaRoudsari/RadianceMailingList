If I use\nthree phase method to conduct annual simulation. My current method is to\nuse:  rsensor -h -vf view.vf . to generate the 10000 rays and use these\nrays to calcualte V matrix.  in other words, I am using three phase method\nto calculate 10000 sensor points. At the end, only a single sensor values\nare calculated.   Is there any better way?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nJia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-February/010110.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010110", "created_by": "Jia_Hu"}
