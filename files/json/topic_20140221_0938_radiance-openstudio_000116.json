Given that BTDF data is commonly used in\nRadiance I thought that here I could find someone to help.\n\n\n I'd appreciate your help in this issue. :)\n\n\nChantal.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-openstudio/2014-February/000116.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-openstudio_000116", "created_by": "minchaca"}
