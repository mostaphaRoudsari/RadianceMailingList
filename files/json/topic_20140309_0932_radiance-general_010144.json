I want to save the images I parse through pcomb for  \nlater analysis.\n\n\nThe small problem with this is that pcomb removes the view information  \n from the header. Right now the only option I can find is to manually  \nappend my original view information to the new file's header. Is there, by  \nchance, an option to maintain the view information when using pcomb? Its  \nnot a problem for me to automate this, but it is nice to stay within the  \nRadiance toolkit if possible.\n\n\nThanks very much,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010144.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010144", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec"}
