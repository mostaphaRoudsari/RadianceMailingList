The idea was to make Windows Radiance \neasier to install, without having to worry about a Perl interpreter as well.\n\n\nThe exe files were on my server for a while, but not realising that \nother Windows Radiance users might be interested in them too, I removed \nthem after my class was finished.\n\n\nSince I've been receiving a few emails enquiring about those exe files, \nI set up a web page where they can be downloaded:\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml\n\n\nHope this makes setting up Windows Radiance a little easier for some of you.\n\n\nIf you want to help with porting some of the old Radiance C shell \nscripts to Perl to make them work under Windows, please give me a shout.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-March/010145.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010145", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
