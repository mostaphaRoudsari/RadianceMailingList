Despite both using the same view point \ndefinitions my images differ between the two renders: (the scene shows a \ngreen rectangular panel, a green elipsoid, some sky, green ground).\n\n\n1) the rpict image (top in the attached file) seems to normalize the sky \nvalues so that they aren't too bright.\n2) the rtrace image has a subtly different viewpoint.\n\n\nThree questions:\n\n\n1) Can you tell me which command arguments determine the way that image \nvalues are clipped or remapped?\n2) Can I specify the same clipping in rtrace?\n3) Why are the views different despite using the same viewpoint?\n\n\n\n\nHere are the commands I'm running, in the sequence that they are executed.\n\n\nrpict -vf view.vf  -x 2400 -y 2400 -vh 28.07 -vv 28.07 -ps 2 -pt 0.03 \n-pj 0.95 -dj 0.85 -ds 0.09 -dt 0.03 -dc 0.75 -dr 5 -dp 0 -sj 0.85 -ab 5 \n-ar 64 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -lr 12 -lw 0.001 wholeScene.rpict\n\n\npfilt -x /1 -y /1 -rad 0.60 wholeScene.rpict > wholeScene.pic\n\n\nvwrays -vf view.vf -x 2400 -y 2400 >surfaces.txt\n\n\nrtrace -h -osv wholeScene.oct < surfaces.txt > rtrace_surfaces.txt\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\nGeorge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr P.
