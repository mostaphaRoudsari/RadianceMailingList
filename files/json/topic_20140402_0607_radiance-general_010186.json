The\nroom is a small hall (7mx9m), has white walls/ceilings, and only North\nfacing windows. I have measured reflectivity of all the surface to come\ncloser to the reality.\n\n\nNow I have to calibrate my simulation model to match its illuminance output\nwith the measured illuminance, for both daylight and artificial light\ncondition.\n\n\nFor daylight, gendaylit sky model is used (listed below), and all\nartificials lights are off. For this case, I have tried a number of ambient\nparameter combinations (listed below), but since all windows are facing\nNorth, the simulation model only results in 0 illuminance. When I rotated\nthe North offset, to face windows towards South then I get some\nilluminance. From this it seems that windows North orientation is the\nreason behind 0 illuminance. In measurements, these values are approx. 1500\nlux.\n\n\nMy question is: What ambient parameters should be tweaked so that the model\nbehaves reasonably (especially for daylight)?\n\n\nI am following Dr.John Mardaljevic's PhD for ambient parameters\ncombination. But I don't have much time to do an extensive parametric\nanalysis of these parameters.\n\n\nGlobal, and Diffuse irradiance (for gendaylit) are taken from weather\nstation in place.\n\n\nI have tried only rtrace. May be I shall use rsensor now ??\n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n\n\n*Ambient parameter combinations:*\n1. rtrace -w -as 512 -ar 512 -aa 0.15 -ab 2 -I -h foo.oct | rcalc -e\n'$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'\n\n\n2. cat allSens.txt | rtrace -w -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 32 -I -h foo.oct | rcalc\n-e '$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'\n\n\n3. cat allSens.txt | rtrace -w -ab 7 -ad 2048 -ar 2 -aa 0.10 -as 32 -I -h\nfoo.oct | rcalc -e '$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'\n\n\n4. cat allSens.txt | rtrace -w -ab 7 -ad 2048 -ar 64 -aa 0.15 -as 512 -I -h\nfoo.oct | rcalc -e '$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'\n\n\n*Gendaylit model for (12:00 time):*\n# xform -rz 30\n# gendaylit 03 22 12:00 -a 48.198724 -o -16.369458 -m -15.00 -W 967.3 187.2\n# Ground ambient level: 33.9\n\n\nvoid light solar\n0\n0\n3            7791000            7791000            7791000\n\n\nsolar source sun\n0\n0\n4     0.378842567554    -0.642038575073           0.666532\n 0.533\n\n\nvoid brightfunc skyfunc\n6 skybright perezlum.cal -i 1 -rz 30\n0\n10              38.97              29.25          -0.878528\n -0.366494          12.997644           -3.44062           0.249106\n  0.007068\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010186.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010186", "created_by": "Vaib"}
