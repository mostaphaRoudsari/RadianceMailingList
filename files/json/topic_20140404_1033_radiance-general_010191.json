It never\nhappened as I never get the chance to capture an illustrative video.\n\n\nThis Sunday (April 6) I will be teaching a workshop to cover the essential\nworkflows for conducting effective daylighting analysis with Honeybee.\n\n\nWe will stream the workshop live. It should be a good place to get started\nuntil I capture a number of short videos.\n\n\nHere is a video that shows what current version of Honeybee does (\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5WNxkgL0hc).\n\n\nIn case you are interested check this link to find more information about\nthe workshop:\nhttp://www.mebd-penndesign.info/Honeybee-MEBD-Workshop-PennDesign\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\nCheers,\nMostapha\n\n\nPS: In case you haven't heard of Ladybug and Honeybee and you haven't click\non any of the links above here is a short description:\nHoneybee is an open-source plugin for Grasshopper3D that connects\nGrasshopper/Rhino to Radiance, Daysim, EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. Currently\ncomponents for Radiance and Daysim are released to the public. You can read\nmore about Honeybee here (\nhttp://core.thorntontomasetti.com/honeybee-is-out-and-flying/) and check\nthe source code on github (https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/).\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010191.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010191", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
