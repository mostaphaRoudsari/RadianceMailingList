I've observed two \"defaults\":\n\n\n* rtrace, rcalc - RGB fields separated by tabs. Sensor records separated by newlines.\n$ vwrays -vf myview.vf | head -n 1 |  rtrace -ab 0 -h model.oct\n$    0.000000e+00<TAB>0.000000e+00<TAB>0.000000e+00<TAB><CR>\n\n\n* dctimestep - RGB fields separated by spaces. Time-series records separated by tabs. Sensor records separated by newlines.\n$ gendaymtx -m 4 city.wea | dctimestep -n 8760 model.dc | head -n 1\n$    0.000000e+00<SP>0.000000e+00<SP>0.000000e+00<TAB>0.000000e+00<SP>0.000000e+00<SP>0.000000e+00<TAB>...\n\n\nIs there any reason to think that these two format specifications should be unified in the standard distribution (e.g. fields separated by spaces, time-based records separated by tabs, spatial records separated by newlines)? How many tools would be broken in the process?\n\n\nThanks in advance \u2014 Devon\n\n\n[1] http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf\n\n\nDevon Sparks\nConsultant  |  Lighting Group\n\n\nArup\n560 Mission Street  Seventh Floor   San Francisco CA 94105   United States\nt +1 415 957 9445  d +1 415 946 0240\nf +1 415 957 9096\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-April/001413.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001413", "created_by": "Devon_Sparks"}
