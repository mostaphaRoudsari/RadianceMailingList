The first will be unshaded and\nrecord global horizontal irradiance.\n\n\nThe second will have a shadow band applied and will serve to record diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance.\n\n\nI will then subtract the diffuse-horizontal contribution from the global\nhorizontal value to obtain an estimate of direct-horizontal irradiance.\n\n\nI wanted to confirm that this is an appropriate approach, as well as to see\nif anyone has an alternative (better) idea, that does not involve a\npyrheliometer.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n-Kyle\n\n\n\n\nKyle Konis, AIA, Ph.D\nAssistant Professor\nSchool of Architecture, WAH 204\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0291\nhttp://arch.usc.edu/faculty/kkonis\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010208.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010208", "created_by": "Kyle_Konis"}
