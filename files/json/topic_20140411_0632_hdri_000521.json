I am\nusing a Uniform Luminance Sphere to create a uniformly lit background in\norder to create a reference image.\n\n\nI have used radiance to create the HDR images, and I am wondering if there\nis a way to take the HDR image and divide each pixel intensity by that of\nits optical center. This would create an image/mask of fractional pixel\nvalues that can be divided into another image to correct for the cameras\nspecific vignetting.\n\n\nOther suggestions would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\n\nThanks,\nJosh\n\n\n\n\n*Joshua Wilson*\n\n\n4th year Architectural Engineering Student (Lighting/Electrical)\nDurham School of Architectural Engineering and Construction\nUNL College of Engineering (Omaha Campus)\njjwilson at unomaha.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-April/000521.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000521", "created_by": "Joshua_Wilson"}
