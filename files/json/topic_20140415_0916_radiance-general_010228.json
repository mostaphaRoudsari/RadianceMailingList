What could be the reason?\n\n\n*When I try bgraph command, I get an error that .plt file is not found.*\nbgraph lux.plt | x11meta\ninclude=line.plt\nbgraph: lux.plt: File not found: line.plt\n\n\n*Here is the lux.plt file:*\ninclude=line.plt\ntitle=\"Working Plane Illuminance\"\nxlabel=\"Distance from Window\"\nylabel=\"Illuminance [lux]\"\nAdata=lux.csv\nAcolor=2\n\n\n*line.plt file is present in:*\n/usr/share/radiance/meta\n\n\n*RAYPATH is set to:*\necho $RAYPATH\n.:/usr/share/radiance:\n\n\n*When I copied the line.plt file to working directory, the error is:*\ninclude=line.plt\nbgraph: lux.plt: File not found: line.plt\n\n\n*When I gave absolute path of line.plt file in lux.plt file, the error is:*\nbgraph: Cannot open: /usr/share/radiance/meta/line.plt\n\n\n*Radiance version is:*\nRADIANCE 4R1+20120125-1+b1 (Debian package) 32bit\n\n\nSo the question arises, Where does bgraph look for .plt files?\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010228.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010228", "created_by": "Vaib"}
