{"topic": "rcollate troubles in Five-Phase CFS tutorial", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Chris Coulter", "created_at": "April 15, 2014 at 09:16PM", "body": "All,\n\n\nI\u2019m having some issues running through Andy\u2019s Five-Phase CFS tutorial, specifically the last stages of combining all of the matrices into readable illuminance data. I\u2019m using the bash script that was included in the downloadable files. I can get through section 6.7 without any errors (so it seems). I start to get errors in 6.8 Putting it all together.\n\n\nThe epw2wea and gendaymtx seem to work just fine. I get errors of \u201cIncomplete record / unexpected EOF\u201d when running the dctimestep commands for the base 3-phase and direct 3-phase pieces. I also receive a \u201cBad transpose specification \u2013 check dimension(s)\u201d error on output of the direct sun dctimestep. The commands I\u2019ve executed are as follows:\n\n\ntime dctimestep -n 8760 -if matrices/viewmatrix.vmx bsdf/fullwindow.xml  \\\n      matrices/daylightmatrix.dmx matrices/OakLand.smx | \\\n      rcollate -h -oc 1 > i_3ph.txt\ntime dctimestep -n 8760 -if  matrices/viewmatrix_direct.vmx bsdf/fullwindow.xml  \\\n      matrices/daylightmatrix_direct.dmx matrices/OakLand_direct.smx | \\\n      rcollate -h -oc 1 > i_ds3ph.txt\ntime dctimestep -n 8760 -if matrices/directsun.dsmx matrices/OakLand_direct_m6.smx | \\\n      rcollate -h -oc 1 > i_ds5ph.txt\n\n\nHas anyone else run into these errors? I tried to separate dctimestep from piping directly into rcollate to see if I could track down the problem. Seems as if dctimestep creates a file the has a header, then 6 rows of data (corresponding to photocells.pts), with each row containing RGB triplets in floating point format. Counting up columns, looks like there are 8760 triplets. This is what I would expect.\nI then would expect rcollate to transform the matrix and strip off the header (-h). I was expecting the output matrix to be 8760 rows by 6 column, I\u2019ve tried playing around w/ various \u2013oc \u2013ic \u2013or \u2013ir options in multiple combinations, but keep getting errors.\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I\u2019ve managed to understand things to this point and am now getting hung up on some minutia\u2026(such is life w/ Radiance)!\n\n\nChris\n\n\nChris Coulter\nSenior Lighting Designer\nBuro Happold Consulting Engineers\n100 Broadway, 23rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\nTel: 212.334.2025\nDirect: 212.616.0254\nEmail: chris.coulter at burohappold.com\nWebsite: www.burohappold.com\n\n\n\n\nThis transmission is confidential and intended solely for the person or organization to whom it is correctly addressed.
