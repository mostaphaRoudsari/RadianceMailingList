Doing some right-hand gymnastics, the coordinate\nsystem of the BSDF-plane is translated as the (x,z) coordinate system with\nthe \u2018top\u2019 of the default-BSDF in 0 0 1 ?. Since the BSDF I\u2019m about to\nsimulate is oriented 55\u00b0 clockwise in this coordinate system my \u2013vu vector\nwill be (-0.82 0 0.57). The kbin for my view matrix then turns into\nkbin(-0.0936,0,0.2578,-0.82,0,0.57). I have tried to sketch this on a very\nsimple hand drawing located here:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9713279/20140422145308628.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy question is \u2013 is my understanding of the view up right ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMed venlig hilsen/Best regards,\n\n\nAnne Iversen\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne Iversen\nPhD, MSc Energy, Sustainability Engineer\n\n\n\n\nDirect tel +45 8233 3049\n\n\nMobile +45 6035 2049\n\n\nHenning Larsen Architects A/S\nVesterbrogade 76\n1620 Copenhagen V\nDenmark\n\n\nTel +45 8233 3000\nwww.henninglarsen.com\n____________________________________________\n\n\n>>> Klik her for at tilmelde dig vores nyhedsbrev p\u00e5 dansk og modtage\nnyheder fra Henning Larsen Architects.\n<http://da.henninglarsen.com/nyheder/nyhedsbrev.aspx>\n\n\n>>> Click here to subscribe to our newsletter in English and receive\nupdates from Henning Larsen Architects.\n<http://www.henninglarsen.com/news/newsletter.aspx>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-April/010244.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010244", "created_by": "Anne_Iversen"}
