Sensor file represents spatial resonse  \nfile of a cosine corrected sensor.\nWhen I have changed the sensor file with one having a narrow filed of  \nview (2x10 degrees) illuminance value using the 3phase approach was  \nthe same (~1% difference) as in the case of the cosine corrected sensor.\nThe command was :\nrsensor -h -rd 5000  -vf view_test.vf  narrow10.dat . |rcontrib   -c  \n5000 -f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -b kbinS -m glazing -I+ -ab 11 -ad  \n50000 -ds .1 -lw 1e-5 test_r.oct>narrow10.vmx\n\n\nRepeating the calculation with rsensor command only (again narrow  \nversus cosine corrected sensor file):\n\n\nrsensor -h -rd 5000 -ab 5 -ad 2500 -ar 300 -aa 0.1 -i -vf view_test.vf  \nnarrow10.dat  overcast.oct|rcalc -e  \n\"$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)\">overcast_rsensor_10.dat\n\n\nresults differ 98%. Any hint would be appreciated.\nI've examine the ray directions coming out from rsensor for both the  \nsensor files and are in accordance with the spatial response.
