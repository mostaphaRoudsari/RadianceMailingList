The way I'm currently using is by specifying a sun\n!gensky 4 1 12 +s -a 40 -o 98 -m 105\nskyfunc glow sky_glow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\nsky_glow source sky\n0\n0\n4 0 0 1 180\n\n\nThis results in shadows in the final scene. I found that -u option or -c\noption can give me a uniform cloudy sky and maybe give me the ground truth\nvalues. I tried both of them but always get 'no lighting source warning'\nand a very dark scene when I try to use rpict and pfilt on the .oct\ngenerated. I think I might be understanding something wrong. Could you\nplease give me a hint on this? The two options I tried are:\n!gensky 3 20 12 -a 40 -o 98 -m 105 -u -B 100\nand\n!gensky -ang 45 0 -c -b 1\n\n\nThank you very much!\nBest,\nVera\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010260.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010260", "created_by": "Vera_Liu"}
