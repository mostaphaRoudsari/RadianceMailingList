Attached are\nmy comparisons - Results to the left (study case measurements) should be\nmultiplied by 10.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3RBjK2uI5SlaV92MTdLVHMzNUkxZWl6NGhWRHZDU19wY0xr/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nBshara Rezik* |* B.Arch\n\n\nARCHITECTURE | INTERIOR *| *SUSTAINABLE *|* DESIGN\n\n\nAddress: HaNasi 28A, Apt. 6*,* Haifa, Israel *|* Tel: +972-54-6314584\nWebsite: http://www.bshara-arch.com *|* e-mail: bshara at gmail.com *|*\nLinkedIn <http://il.linkedin.com/pub/bshara-rezik/20/726/981>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010266.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010266", "created_by": "Bshara_Rezik"}
