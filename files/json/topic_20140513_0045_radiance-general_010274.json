Also I have highlighted some areas in the time-series\ngraph, where the model is systematically (occurring during the same time)\nunder-estimating the illuminance. I don't know why?\n\n\nDo you think, there is still some scope of fine-tuning the model, or the\nsystematic error is uncertain to hypothesize?\n\n\nDo you think the results correlate well enough with other similar benchmark\ndaylight studies that used Radiance?\n\n\nI observed that the model correlates better in the case of \"observed sunny\nsky\" as compared to \"observed cloudy sky.\" But I couldn't understand the\nreason behind this. ?\n\n\nRequest you to please ask me if I missed to provide any info. about the\nmodel.\n\n\nThank you in anticipation.\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010274.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010274", "created_by": "Vaib"}
