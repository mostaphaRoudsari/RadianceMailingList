I could download the binary files for each software, however I'm not able to use them since they are not in a friendly format and I'm not really sure about what to do with those files. I assume that I need another software that works as an interface but I'm not really strong/sure on how to do it. I'm developing a building project with trnsys and I will really appreciate your help. \n\n\nBest regards, \n\n\nMarcel \n\n\nPs: I don't know if what I'm asking is really stupid or not...I'm not really a computer geek :)\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-May/000045.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000045", "created_by": "Marcel_PERRET-GENTIL"}
