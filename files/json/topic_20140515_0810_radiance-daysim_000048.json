Then checking\nthe Daylight Autonomy I calculated the percentage of the space that had more\nthan 300 lux 50% of the time to get my number of sDA300-50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the ASE 1000-250   I ran the same model ( no blinds) with 0\nambient bounces (ab-0) and ran the analysis 1000 lux as my DA threshold for\na 10 hour day.  If the standard year is 365 days x 10 hours =3650 hours, 250\nhours would be would be a DA1000 of 6.85%  for no more than 10% of the\nsensor points would demonstrate  compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil an updated script  or Daysim GUI can calculate these values directly,\nI think this methodology should work.  I am pursuing this path to utilize\nfree of Daysim in conjunction with Sketchup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if I am missing anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJAMES F.
