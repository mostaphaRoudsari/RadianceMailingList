Previously we've only analyzed on\nreal-world scenes. And we're looking for to do some experiments on\nsimulation scenes and we figured pictures generated by radiance using light\nsimulation would be perfect. Currently the scenes I'm using are from the\ntutorials of Rendering with Radiance. I'm wondering if there are any public\navailable datasets of built radiance models such as tables, windows,\nchairs... that I could use? Thank you very much for taking a look!\n\n\nBest,\nVera\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010279.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010279", "created_by": "Vera_Liu"}
