I suspect that the issue\nmay be in the lumen output (or candela multiplier) in the IES file. Please\nhave a look at the report.\n\n\nArtificial lighting report: http://bit.ly/1qXigtU\n\n\nMay I request your suggestions on how this issue can be resolved ? How much\nshall I reduce the Candela multiplier, if that is to be done ?\n\n\nBest regards,\nVaib\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010285.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010285", "created_by": "Vaib"}
