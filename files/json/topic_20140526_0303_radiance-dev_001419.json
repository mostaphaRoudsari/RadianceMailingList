I've been using the Git repository linked from the CMake dashboard at http://public.kitware.com/gitweb?p=radiance.git;a=summary however when looking for a bugfix for falsecolor.pl which Axel Jacobs submitted around the 16th of April, it only exists in the CVS repository at http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?pathrev=MAIN which I'd been led to believe was now deprecated in favour of the Git repository.\n\n\nPersonally I prefer the Git repository as it has the ability to download a snapshot with a single click. The CVS repository doesn't have this functionality enabled (apparently ViewVC can generate tarballs automatically but either it's not enabled for the Radiance repository or I can't find the link to get the file) & I'd prefer not to have to get a client application to do this if I don't have to.\n\n\nPalbinder Sandher \nSoftware Platform Engineer \nT: +44 (0) 141 945 8500\nF: +44 (0) 141 945 8501\nhttp://www.iesve.com \n\n\n**Design, Simulate + Innovate with the <Virtual Environment>** \nIntegrated Environmental Solutions Limited.
