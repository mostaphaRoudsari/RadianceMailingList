I have been searching the web for candlepower distribution files\nfor standard PAR38 LED lamps you might find at your local home improvement\nstore, for conversion to an imposter surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't had a lot of luck but I'm still looking! I came across Krzysztof\nWandachowicz's papers on calculating luminaires for Radiance, getting me\nthinking more often the data might not be available and a measurement is\nrequired?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of interest is a Masters Thesis by Randolph Fritz describing the\ndevelopment of a luminaire modeling program called LumBuild. I haven't found\nmuch follow on information related to the program?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppreciate any knowledge you can share!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\nBrian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-May/010298.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010298", "created_by": "Brian_Karr"}
