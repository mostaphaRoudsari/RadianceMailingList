{"topic": "su2rad update for SketchUp 2014", "category": "radiance-general", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 01, 2014 at 09:26PM", "body": "Hello everyone.\n\n\nI have just updated my plugin su2rad to fix a problem that was introduced\nby SketchUp 2014 that was released earlier this year.\n\n\nThis is a just quick fix to solve the compatibility issue and also packages\nthe plugin as a SketchUp extension. The extension can be managed via the\nextension manager built into the SketchUp preferences dialog so you don't\nneed to dig for the SketchUp \"Plugins\" directory to install the plugin.\nBeginning with SketchUp 2014 plugins are installed into the user's personal\nhome directory and so the installation of the extension does not require\nadministrative rights on the PC any more.\n\n\nUnfortunately Google has discontinued the download feature for Google Code\nprojects so I am hosting the new plugin temporarily on my Dropbox account\nuntil I can move the whole project over to github. The temporary download\nlocation is\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pewocv4df0i2i05/su2rad_2014.0.0.rbz\n\n\nI have done some testing on SketchUp 8 and 2014 both on Windows 7 and OS X\n10.7.5. I only tested that the plugin works in general but have not done\nany extensive verification. However, there have been no large changes to\nthe code so I don't expect that there are any problems that haven't been\nthere for quite a while. If you find any bugs or other issues please report\nthese back to my email address for now. I will send out another email when\nthe new code hosting is set up and reporting of bugs is possible.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010303.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010303", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
