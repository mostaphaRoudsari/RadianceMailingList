I will respond to both in sequence.\n\n\nRoss\n\n\n\n\nMessage 1\n\n\nHi John,\n\n\n'oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct'\n\n\nstill produces the error message 'xform: cannot find file...'\n\n\nI have added a screenshot (error1) to the folder below:\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regards to 'objview' I don't actually have that program.\n\n\nI downloaded a windows version of radiance from the link below and it wasn't included.\n\n\nhttps://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage 2\n\n\nHi Thomas\n\n\n'rad test.rif' runs and produces and HDR file but it is completely black.\n\n\n\n\n'xform test.rad > test_combined.rad' again gives an error that it can't find the file 'test.rad' which is clearly at the location.\n\n\nI have put a screenshot of the error into the my dropbox folder (error2)\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a\n\n\n\n\nThe huge number of materials was because I had previously imported some DAYSIM results. These have now been purged off an the export files updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 1\nDate: Tue, 17 Jun 2014 09:04:01 +0000\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010324.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010324", "created_by": "Ross_Thompson"}
