I have built my Sketch up model, and I exported it to radiance(using the su2rad_1.0_alpha version) and I\u2019m in the rendering stage (rpict). The problem is that the window frame elements are not visualizing well: they appear undefined and missing some parts (as shown in the link below).\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/lwvi9f35e0r33pv/AACqWAvwn0Wx7ybWb1OVno78a\n\n\nI used 2 types of Radiance parameters, first I used the very accurate parameter, and since this didn\u2019t seem to improve the image I increased these parameters, but this problem continues to happen.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if maybe I\u2019m doing something wrong with the su2rad geometry exporting process because I have done this from Ecotect to Radiance before and I haven\u2019t had this issue.\nI\u2019m sending you the link to the folders that contain these files so you can give me your opinion and hopefully help me to solve this.\n\n\nAgain, thank you for your time.\n\n\nM.
