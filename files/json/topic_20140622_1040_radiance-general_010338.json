But when I tried to\nuse:\nvoid spotlight lightring3\n0\n0\n7 2000 2000 2000 60 0 1 0\nI get a warning: rpict: warning - invalid spotlight direction for ring\n\"spot2.downlight3\"\n\n\nI'm not sure which part I did wrong. Could I specify a spotlight with\ndirection 0 1 0?\nBest,\nVera\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-June/010338.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010338", "created_by": "Vera_Liu"}
