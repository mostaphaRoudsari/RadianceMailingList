{"topic": "Create Octree File from SU2RAD", "category": "radiance-dev", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Thomas Bleicher", "created_at": "June 23, 2014 at 06:29AM", "body": "Interesting.\n\n\nIt seems that your rad version is out of sync with the oconv version and\nproduces commands that are not compatible with oconv. Can you check which\nbinary you are using? The commands are:\n\n\nwhere rad\nwhere oconv\n\n\n\n\nBoth should point to binaries in the same directory. Perhaps the rad binary\nfor Windows has not been updated along with the other apps.\n\n\nTo solve your problem you can save the commands that rad would execute into\na batch file and then manually remove the -sj option from the oconv command\nlines with a text editor:\n\n\nrad -n test.rif > rad_commands.bat\n\n\n\n\nThe -n option tells rad to list the generated commands but not to execute\nthem.\n\n\nBTW: It's quite normal not to have any \"render=\" options in the rif file\ngenerated by su2rad. They only show up when you use one of the option\noverrides (the check boxes in export interface).\n\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-June/001423.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001423", "created_by": "Thomas_Bleicher"}
