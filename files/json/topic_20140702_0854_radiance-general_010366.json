In fact\nif I use the command:\npkgBSDF -s blinds.xml > blinds_pkg.rad\nthe output file contain the original geometry.\n\n\nInstead if I use the BSDF created or contained  in the database of WINDOW 7\nthese file do not contain a geometry.\nWith pkgBSDF I got an error.\n\n\nMy questions are:\n1.  in the equation i=VTDs the T matrix has to contain the window geometry\nor take knowledge of these from the other two matrix(V,D)?\n2.  I have understood that 3 phase method uses only the front transmission\ndata [A. McNeil, Three-Phase Method tutorial]  but in\n an other discussion [\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008969.html\n]  I have discovered that WINDOW and genBSDF use an opposite meaning of\nfront and back, so the front transmission regards radiance or window\nmeaning?And what part of the T matrix I have to use in the 3 phase method\nfor the respective cases (WINDOW or genBSDF)?\n\n\nKind regards,\n*Giuseppe*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010366.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010366", "created_by": "Giuseppe_De_Michele"}
