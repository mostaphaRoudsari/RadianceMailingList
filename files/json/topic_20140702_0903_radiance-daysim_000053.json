I have tried downloading the lower version 3.1 which comes along\nwith a flash plugin in daysim website. This neither works and while\ninstalling it asks for a second disk as unable to locate the correct\npathway. I am unclear what that supposed to be.\n\n\nAnyone using Daysim latest versions please help me. I appreciate quick\nresponse.\n\n\nKind regards,\nVarma\nResearch Associate\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-July/000053.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000053", "created_by": "hara_kumar_varma_namburu"}
