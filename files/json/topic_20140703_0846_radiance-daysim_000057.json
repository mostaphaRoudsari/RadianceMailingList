When I click Analysis tab  \nI only can view Zone description, Occupancy Profile, User Requirements  \nand Behavior and Lighting and Shading Control System. Daysim I will  \nnot allow me to choose \"View Daylighting Analysis Results\" under the  \nanalysis pull down.\n\n\nThanks,\nUrtza.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-July/000057.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000057", "created_by": "Urtza_Uriarte"}
