You know, go to \"Manage Grid Data\" at the Grid Management panel to import/export those data.Probably you'll see that your results seem to be displaced. To solve this, before importing the *.DA files, you must open the files with notepad (or a similar software) and delete the second row, corresponding with the coordinates of every sensor at the Analysis Grid, and left that row in blanck.Ihope you'll find this information useful.Regards,Paula M.
