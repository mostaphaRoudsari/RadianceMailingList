However the results are no longer repeatable.\n\n\nDespite getting values for UDI and DA etc. all the daylight factors are now 0.\n\n\nMy suspicion is that the DAYSIM installation has clashed with a RADIANCE installation and the system paths are confused.\n\n\nI have tried uninstalling everything and just reinstalling Daysim 3.1e.\n\n\nThis produces the following system paths:\n\n\nPATH: ;C:\\Daysim\\bin_windows\\;C:\\Radiance\\bin\\;C:\\DAYSIM\n\n\nRAYPATH: ;C:\\Daysim\\lib\\;.C:\\Radiance\\lib\\;.\n\n\n\n\nAs C:\\Daysim\\lib is in RAYPATH, I can\u2019t see what is causing the problem\n\n\nThanks for your help\n\n\nRoss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss Thompson\n\n\nSenior Sustainability & Energy Engineer\n\n\nT: 01865 864500\n\n\nOxford:\nSouth House\n3 Farmoor Court\nCumnor Road\nOxford OX2 9LU\nPhone: 01865 864500\nFax:  01865 864584\nEmail: oxf at cbgc.com<mailto:oxf at cbgc.com>\n\n\nLondon:\nLector Court\n151-153 Farringdon Road\nLondon EC1R 3AF\nPhone: 0207 833 8815\nFax: 0203 302 0050\nEmail: lon at cbgc.com<mailto:lon at cbgc.com>\n\n\nFor the latest CBG news visit www.cbgc.com<http://www.cbgc.com>         [cid:image28db7f.PNG at 81668ce8.45a0476b] <http://facebook.com/cbgconsultantsltd>  [cid:image77df6b.PNG at d88bd5ec.43a12340] <http://twitter.com/CBGConsultants>\n\n\nCBG Consultants Ltd Registered No. 538 4147/VAT Registration No. 860 3120 63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[cid:image2ef2b6.PNG at a4132549.4ba7c0d9]\n\n\nPlease consider the environment - do you really need to print this email?\n\n\nThe views expressed in this e-mail are those of the sender and not necessarily those of CBG Consultants.\n\n\nThe content of this email is private and may be confidential for the intended recipient only.
