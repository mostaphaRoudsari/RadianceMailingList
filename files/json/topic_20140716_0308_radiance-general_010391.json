Is there a more basic description that could help me understand it better? For example, I think I am supposed to describe the sky material somehow under -m but I am not sure how to do that. Also I don't understand the -e, the -b, -bn or the -faf options. \nThanks in advance,\nAle\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010391.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010391", "created_by": "Alejandro_Pacheco_Di\u00e9guez"}
