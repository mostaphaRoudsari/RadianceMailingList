Manyfacturer of imaging luminance measuring devices (camera photometer).\nOur aim is to export our own image file format (pixel-wise HDR float values) into the Radiance rgbe file format.\nThe aim is to give radiance users access to the measured luminance information combined with our information about lens configuration (geometrical data).\nThis may of interest for the \"glare\" community when analyzing the glare using radiance tools.\n\n\nAnyway, writing the rgbe information is no problem.\n\n\nBut what about the header structure of the radiance HDRI format?\nI'm a little confused about it and can't find a documentation structure how it is organized?\nUnfortunately I'm no radiance user for carrying out own radiance projects to study it?\n\n\nWith my best regards\nDipl.-Ing.
