But even adding that for the command below I get this error \"Use of\nuninitialized value in split at /usr/local/ray/bin/genskyvec line 129, <>\nline 17.\" and some other lines of similar error.\n\n\nMatlab command:\nunix('/usr/local/ray/bin/gendaylit 03 12 07:35 -a 48.2 -o -16.37 -m -15 -W\n3.26 67.30 | /usr/local/ray/bin/genskyvec -m 1 -c 1 1 1 filename.dat')\n\n\nbut if I return this command in Terminal I get no error and works\nperfectly. Any idea why is it like that and what should I do?\n\n\nCheers, Ehsan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010405.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010405", "created_by": "Ehsan_Vazifeh"}
