I started with something very very simple to see how \nit works and maybe compare the results with other simulation methods, before I \ntry to do something complicated.\n\n\nI created a simple rectangular room that is lighted through another \nrectangular box on top of the roof. This box I want to use to make a BSDF. It \nis just a rectangular kind of pipe, with two of its surface (the one on top \nand bottom) translucent, from which the light will enter the room.\n\n\nI created the Daylight matrix for the upper part of this shape. Then I created \nthe rad files for the box's geometry and materials that are really simple.\n\n\nHowever when I try to generate the BSDF, the genBSDF stops working. I tried to \nuse a different genBSDF (I found one of different size from WINDOWS software). \nThis one runs but at the end I get the message \"Generation of Tensor Tree \nBSDFs is not supported on windows\". Anyone has any idea why I get these \nerrors? I am really new in this and maybe I miss something really obvious. \n\n\nThank you in advance,\n\n\nAriane\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010412.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010412", "created_by": "Ariane_Johanson"}
