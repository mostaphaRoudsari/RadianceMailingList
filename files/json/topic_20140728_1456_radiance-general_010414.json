The normal way I would\ngo about would be converting values to HSV, but because of the values that\nreturn from rtrace, I don't know how I would go about doing this.  Is such\na thing possible or is there another way to look at the colour of the light?\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\nKelly Moylan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010414.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010414", "created_by": "Kelly_Moylan"}
