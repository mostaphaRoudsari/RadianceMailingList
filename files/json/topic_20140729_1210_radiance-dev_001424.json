The problem I've run into is that some of the rtrace options the\nfindglare program will not take. My terminal is return the following line:\n\n\nUsage: findglare [view options][-ga angles][-p picture][[rtrace options]\noctree]\n\n\nwhich I understand to mean that it believes I am using the program\nimproperly.  The options which I have tried and found to not work are: -i,\n-u, -I, -h, -n, -bv, -me, -ma, -e\n\n\nI'm not sure if this was on purpose because of the interaction between\nfindglare and rtrace.\n\n\nThanks,\nKelly Moylan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-July/001424.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001424", "created_by": "Kelly_Moylan"}
