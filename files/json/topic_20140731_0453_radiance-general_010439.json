Since the pipes are not straight I need to be sure that the\nvectors I set are correct and I am a bit confused about what the \u201cvu\u201d vector\nstands for. So here is what I did.\n\n\n\n\nThe room with the pipes is oriented towards\nthe northeast and the pipe bending is towards the southwest. I generated the BSDF through a model where the pipe\nbending part is facing towards the \u2013y axis.  I attached a small picture to make it clearer. So here are some of my questions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat should the \"vu\" be at the daylight matrix?\nI am not sure which axis of the BSDF corresponds to the \u201cvu\u201d. My guess is that \u201cvu\u201d should be 1, 1, 0 or 1, -1, 0? Should the pipe\nmodel from which I generate the BSDF be correctly oriented as well? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any way to have the model of the\nroom oriented towards the north (y axis) and then set the correct orientation\nvia the \u201cvu\u201d or some other way?\nI thank you in advance,\nVayia\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010439.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010439", "created_by": "Vayia_Koukouvayia"}
