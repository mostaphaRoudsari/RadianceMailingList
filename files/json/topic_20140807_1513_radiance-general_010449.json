I have a room with clerestory\nwindows which consist of 2 layers of translucent panels. Exterior glazing\nis 60% VLT and interior glazing is 30% VLT with about a 30cm of cavity in\nbetween.\n\n\n*Simulation 1*\nvoid trans panelext60\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.65934066 0\n\n\nvoid trans panelint30\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.32967033 0\n\n\n\n\n*Simulation 2*\nvoid trans panelext60\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.65934066 0.9\n\n\nvoid trans panelint30\n0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.32967033 0.9\n\n\nrpict command is as follows,\n\n\nrpict -vtv -vp 0.1 7.3 1.8 -vd 1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 130 -vv 90 -x 3000 -y\n1400 -ab 4 -aa 0.08 -ar 512 -ad 2048 -as 512 -ds .01 -dj .6 -t 60 sunny.oct\n> lookeast_june21_noon.pic\n\n\nI was expecting a significant difference in renderings for 2 scenes. The\nsecond simulation should have resulted in more defined bright patches.\nThough that's not the case. Am I missing something obvious here?\nUnfortunately I cannot attach the complete renderings due to confidential\nnature of the project. I have attached screenshots of the area of interest.\n\n\nAny help is much appreciated,\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nShri\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010449.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010449", "created_by": "Shrikar_Bhave"}
