NREL has created a release tag and binary packages on our git mirror of the Radiance source repository. Some noteworthy items:\n* This is the second NREL release based on core RT code revision 4.2.b, and includes new Hessian-based error control in ambient cache.\n* gendaymtx has changed to include a header on output, which causes an incompatibility with OpenStudio's Radiance-based daylighting routines. A fix will be included in the next iteration release of OpenStudio.\n* This version includes the new rfluxmtx utility,  which should ease the pain of using rcontrib for 3- and 5-phase calculations, as well as a host of other novel applications.\n\n\nLinkage:\n\n\nMain Radiance source repository (cvs), hosted at LBL:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN\n\n\nNREL's git mirror of the cvs:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined\n\n\nSource code snapshot for official Radiance release 4.2:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/4.2\n\n\nCurrent Radiance Release (4.2):\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2\n\n\nWindows installer:\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-win32.exe\n\n\nMac installer (Universal, 10.8 or greater)\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-Darwin.dmg\n\n\nLinux binary archives (32/64bit, include library files):\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-Linux32.tar.gz\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-Linux64.tar.gz\n\n\nAs ever, a tremendous debt of gratitude is owed to Greg Ward, LBL, and DOE for the continued work on and funding for Radiance.
