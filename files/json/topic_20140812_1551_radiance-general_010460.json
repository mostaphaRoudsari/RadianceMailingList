All\nthe other values show a clear sun-patch in the space.\n\n\nAny clue why this is happening? Would you expect such results? Everything\nelse is constant in the model. (images are attached)\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nShri\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010460.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010460", "created_by": "Shrikar_Bhave"}
