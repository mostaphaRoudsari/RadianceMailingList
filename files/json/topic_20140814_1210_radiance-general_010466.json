Would you please tell me commands that can simulate roller blind(diffuse reflection) and solar film blind(speculation reflection)\n\n\nIs it possible to have a solar sensor to trigger Up/Down motions of motorised roller blind and motorised solar film?\n\n\nWhere can I find examples of Atrium?\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\nStanley\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010466.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010466", "created_by": "Stanley_Cheung"}
