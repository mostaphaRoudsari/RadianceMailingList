I keep *y* constant (10m) and I get\nthis results for 2000 points.\n\n\nWhat is wrong with the simulation or my calculus ? Why do the points spread\nout at large angle ? Why do  the coefficients becomes small at very large\nangle ? Does the source follow the Lambert's cosine law ?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nSorry for my english,\n\n\nMario Geiger\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010470.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010470", "created_by": "Mario_Geiger"}
