Looks like hdr mapping is scaled.\n\n\nIs there some consideration in generating the tiff file or converting it to\nhdr that I am missing. I tried to use pfilt and re-size the image to make\nsure the size is fixed but it didn't help.\n\n\nHere is a slide that shows the problem:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/eklns2rv5bv6tyj/RhinoVSRadiance.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nAlso the hdr file generated from tiff image in case it can help:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o293dqh04ack1hb/random_pattern_1.HDR?dl=0\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010479.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010479", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
