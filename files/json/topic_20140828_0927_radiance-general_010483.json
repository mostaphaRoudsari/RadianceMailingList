I picked up one column out of the every RGB(view matrix and daylight matrix), so that I made a simple matrix multiplication.\n2. I created daylight matrix as a ASCII data instead of binary.\n\n\nThank you. \nJinsook\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-August/010483.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010483", "created_by": "jinsook_kang"}
