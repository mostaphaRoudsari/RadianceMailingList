I put the *.rad files in attachment.\n\n\nBy varying *y* the distance from the \"window\" in the box I get the\nfollowing results.\n\n\nAlso it takes much longer to run *rtrace* than *rcontrib* :\n\n\n*rtrace* : Elapsed time is 475.741 seconds.\n*rcontrib* : Elapsed time is 1.10356 seconds.\n\n\nTo compute all the 50 points.\n\n\nWhy don't I get the same result in the same time ?\n\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\n\u200b\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010492.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010492", "created_by": "Mario_Geiger"}
