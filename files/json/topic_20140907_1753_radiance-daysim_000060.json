Interestingly\nenough when I close the error. The study keeps running and returns some\n[wrong] results.\n\n\nThe error looks to be view dependent as it works fine for some views and\nnot for the other ones. Anybody has encountered similar issue and/or knows\nthe solution?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n\n\nPS: I'm using Daysim 4.0 and Here is the view file:\n\n\nrview Perspective -vth -vp 2.004 5.478 1.496  -vd -0.526326 -2.530093 0.0\n-vu 0.0 0.0 1.0  -vh 180.000 -vv 180.000 -vs 0.000 -vl 0.000 -x 250 -y 250\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2014-September/000060.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000060", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
