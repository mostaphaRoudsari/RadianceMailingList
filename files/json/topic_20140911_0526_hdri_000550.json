The task involves\ncomparing several images which are outputs of HDR deghosting algorithms.\n\n\nThis is a study which everyone can do in front of his or her computer and\nlasts for less than 30 minutes (most people finish it in 15-20 mins). The\nlink to the user study is below:\n\n\nhttp://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~tarhan/userstudy/\n\n\nAll instructions are explained in that page. My student and I would greatly\nappreciate if you can be a participant in this user study. We would be\nfurther delighted if you can forward this link to anybody else who might be\ninterested.\n\n\nThanks very much and all the best,\nAhmet Oguz Akyuz\nMETU - Department of Computer Engineering\nhttp://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~akyuz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2014-September/000550.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000550", "created_by": "Oguz_Akyuz"}
