To get better looking and more accurate results I am using a BRDF as the standing geometry that is based off of a .cal file that greg wrote for metal grating:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzo9apzcl4ioika/rollershade.cal?dl=0\n\n\nwhen I apply this material to geometry it behaves as expected and cuts off the direct relative to the angle of incidence (which I hope explains this funny test scene I\u2019m using)\n\n\nimage of BRDF shades:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/tlcqqij9rjng5s6/BRDF_mar21_test_test_fc.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nBut this does not give me accurate diffuse values.  So I then put the BRDF as a proxy for the BSDF and get an image like this:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7k2n38kvn5jp8fg/both_mar21_test_test_fc.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nMy question arises when I look at image without proxy geometry for the BSDF.\n\n\nFirst rendered with multiple processes: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1cw56kwevnx9ajt/mt_BSDF_mar21_test_test_fc.jpg?dl=0\nAnd run on a single processor: https://www.dropbox.com/s/pm5q8ikh6kgwh6f/BSDF_mar21_test_test_fc.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nor to view it more starkly, the difference between the BSDF alone and with proxy:\n\n\nbsdf - proxy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hf2vy2wfpss7gr0/BSDFboth_fc.jpg?dl=0\nproxy - bsdf: https://www.dropbox.com/s/di8duoz2gob0ams/bothBSDF_fc.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nThere is a major change in the ambient values once the rendering gets to the window (which is why the band is horizontal in the single process run and vertical in the multiple process run.  I ran these using rad so there is an overture calculation.  Anyone have an idea as to what is going on?\n\n\nStephen Wasilewski\nLOISOS + UBBELOHDE\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n1917 Clement Avenue  Building 10A\nAlameda, CA  94501 USA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n510 521 3800 VOICE\n510 521 3820 FAX\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nwww.coolshadow.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010500.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010500", "created_by": "Stephen_Wasilewski"}
