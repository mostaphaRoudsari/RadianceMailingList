These algorithms are accelerated up to twenty times faster using\na ray tracing engine built for the graphics processor unit (GPU). The\nacceleration factor scales with the number of available GPUs and is\nexpected to increase on new generations of hardware. In order to allow for\nsmooth adoption among Radiance users and software developers, Accelerad\nmaintains compatibility with Radiance scene and output file formats and\ncurrently uses a subset of Radiance\u2019s material modifiers and command-line\narguments.\n\n\nFor more information and to receive a copy of the beta release, visit\nhttp://mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/Accelerad/.\n\n\nNathaniel Jones\nPhD student\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nhttp://nljones.scripts.mit.edu/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-September/010509.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010509", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones"}
