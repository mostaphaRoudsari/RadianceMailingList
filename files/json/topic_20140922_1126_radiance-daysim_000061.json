Simulation is running OK and\nno errors are displayed but the output intgain.csv file *does not show the\nactivation of electric lighting. It is as if the system is not activated at\nall but that does not make sense due to the minimum illuminance level\ndefined*. I tried other room archives, checked the electric lighting\nkeywords in the header file etc. but it is not working.\n\n\nI would appreciate if someone could point to me where to look for the\nprobable error. The files I am testing now are availabe at this link:\n*https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1Lk6lLtyxfUYjY5QXJXeGxRTGc&usp=sharing\n<https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1Lk6lLtyxfUYjY5QXJXeGxRTGc&usp=sharing>*\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n\n\n*.............
