The PVB is missing, though.  \n    How would you proceed when you solve this problem elegantly?    ATTACHED : the materials of the whole double insulated glazing system#output window7.2   \t\t\t \nthe single glass pane materials#output opitcs6  \n  Any comments are highly appreciated.  \n  Kind Regards from Vienna,  Niya\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2014-October/001432.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001432", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov"}
