I generated an xml file that when light is perpendicular on the surface it behaves in a vertical linear direction using the klem patches, however this is not the case when I simulate it using radiance; the transmitted light has an abnormal behavior with light spots all over the receiving surface.\nI was wondering if the problem is in the genBSDF line i wrote or the geometry I created for the bsdf of the geometry  used in the simulation.\nHere are some of the points I applied:\n1. The genBSDF line:genBSDF.exe -c 16000 filename.rad > newfilename.xml\n2.The surface geometry:0.1 x 0.1 x 0.01 [meters]\n3. The simulation environment geometry:0.4 x 0.4 x 1 [meters]\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010524.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010524", "created_by": "Islam_Mashaly"}
