The PVB is missing, though.  \n    How would you proceed when you solve this problem elegantly?    \n\n\n  Any comments are highly appreciated.  \n  Kind Regards from Vienna,  Niya \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n var m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010518.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010518", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov"}
