I saw the CUDA 6.0 requirement on Radiance blog. Would that be enough for DGP and Radiance RAD Luminance(for instance) calculation?  \n  #my student computer reads like that:  \n  I am triggering with a file from Ecotect 2011 39MB on a\n  Windows System, i5-2400 @2.5GHz  RAM:4GB  and \u00b0appr.40GB free space  \n  yet the DGP simulation takes at least 20 hours. -eventough i\u00b4m exporting only 10-12 sensor pts.  i believe there is some ground-snoozing in my equipment and it could go faster,no?  \n  Any advice is greatly appreciated,  \n  Best,  Niya \n\n\n var m3_u = (location.protocol=='https:'?'https://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php':'http://a.abv.bg/www/delivery/ajs.php');   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = ',';   document.write (\"  \");\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010534.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010534", "created_by": "Todor_Syarov"}
