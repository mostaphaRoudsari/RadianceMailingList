One of the objectives is to demonstrate how the visibility to the exterior scene changes with different types of glass (as exported from LBNLWindow), depending on tint, vlt, and interior reflection.  This is why having a realistic exterior scene is more compelling than whatever simplistic scene I would be able to model myself.\n\n\nThe only way I know of is to take a horizontal fisheye view from a rooftop and map it to the sky dome.  Are there any other methods that people have used?  Ideally ones that didn't require a fisheye camera lens?\n\n\nThanks,\nGalen\n\n\nGalen Burrell\nSenior Consultant  |  Arup Lighting\n\n\nArup\n560 Mission Street  Seventh Floor   San Francisco CA 94105   United States\nt +1 415 957 9445  d +1 415 946 2367\nf +1 415 957 9096  m +1 415 906 9191\nwww.arup.com/lighting<http://www.arup.com/lighting>\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010535.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010535", "created_by": "Galen_Burrell"}
