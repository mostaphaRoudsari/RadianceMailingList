Perhaps the visible component would have to be assessed first, and then the IR on a second run, after modifying the surface reflectances? Could Radiance be used like that?\n\n\nRichard Watkins\nKent School of Architecture\nUniversity of Kent\nKent, UK\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010563.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010563", "created_by": "Richard_Watkins"}
