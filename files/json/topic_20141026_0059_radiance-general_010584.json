But I just don't know why there are \"errors\" generated,\nespecially considering this is a \"clean\" installation after I reinstall and\nupdate the OS, Xcode 6, command line tools and X11 ... So, hope you can\nadvise!\n\n\nThe entire installation log is shown in the following Google Doc file, and\nthe warnings or errors as assumed by myself are highlighted, too:\n*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqIIHEkg3uIr1oOMr2bWg2J24XShzFAVsqcgQwZYURM/edit?usp=sharing\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqIIHEkg3uIr1oOMr2bWg2J24XShzFAVsqcgQwZYURM/edit?usp=sharing>*\n\n\nThank you in advance!\nJoe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-October/010584.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010584", "created_by": "Joe_Smith"}
