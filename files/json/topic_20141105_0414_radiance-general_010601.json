I have the latest LM-62\n(2002), but it doesn't even mention MGF, and I don't seem to be able\nto find an example ies file with embedded MGF.\n\n\nThe reason why I'm looking into this is this:  I have a round bollard\nlight and need to generate the distribution for only the vertical\ncylinder, but not the top and bottom which ies2rad generates as well.\nI figure that removing the top and bottom 'rings' would invalidate the\nphotometry.\n\n\nMany thanks\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-November/010601.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010601", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
