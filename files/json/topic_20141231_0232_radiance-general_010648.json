Site layout for planning guidance from BRE in UK states that 39.6%\nis the highest value possible when using the Waldram methodology however I\nhave a model which is achieving 40/42% do I need to set anything additional\nwithin the software?  The result is going to form part of a planning\napplication therefore I need to be confident that it is correct. Any advice\nwould be welcome.\nThanks Rosemary\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-December/010648.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010648", "created_by": "Rosemary_McLafferty"}
