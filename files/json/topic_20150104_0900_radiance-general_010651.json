Starting with an\nimage created via rpict, and using the photosphere histogram, the max\nluminance value is 351 nits. Selecting a small area around the top outer\ncorner of the shelf results in a mean around 302 nits. This agrees fairly\nclose to a measurement with a spot meter on the outer corner of a physical\nversion of the scene, so far so good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand: rpict -vtv -vp 0.75 .75 5.5 -vd 0.3 1.0 -0.6 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 45 -vv\n45 -vo 3 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -av .1 .1 .1 -x 2000 -y 2000 -ab 2 -aa .1\nshelf.oct > shelf_rpict.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_rpict.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a false color version, the histogram max luminance however is 177 nits,\nthe small area mean is 131 nits. Im not sure why the luminance values\nbetween the two versions are different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand: falsecolor -ip shelf_rpict.hdr -e -s auto -n 16 -lh 1000 -lw 225\n-log 4 -l > shelf_false_log_norm.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_false_log_norm.hdr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nBrian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010651.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010651", "created_by": "Brian_Karr"}
