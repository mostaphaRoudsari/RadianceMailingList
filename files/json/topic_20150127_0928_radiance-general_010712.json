I suppose it might be a graphic interfacing\nproblem but I don't how to solve it.\n\n\nBesides, I found a little strange that every time when I tried to input 'vi\nroom.rad', I cannot directly input the next line which is 'void light\nbright', I must input an 'o' first and then 'void light bright'. Can someone\nexplain this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nJiajie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010712.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010712", "created_by": "Jonathan_Zhu"}
