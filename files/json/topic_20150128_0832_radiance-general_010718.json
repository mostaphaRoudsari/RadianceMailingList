I didn't expect such a difference for 0.75\u00b0\nfor the sake of completeness: in the next chart this results are compared with the ones provided by a full deterministic model, please notice how there is not much difference, and they all are really similar to the 10\u00b0 one, so the 8.5\u00b0 clearly stands out of the group\n[cid:image005.png at 01D03B20.5C09C200]\n\n\nHope somebody can give me a clue, I am clueless\nThank You much everybody for your kind attention.\n\n\nMarco Lovati, MEng\nInstitute for Renewable Energy\n\n\nEURAC research\nInstitute for Renewable Energy\nVia Luis Zuegg 11, I-39100 Bolzano\nt +39 0471 055 667\nmarco.lovati at eurac.edu<mailto:marco.lovati at eurac.edu>\nwww.eurac.edu<http://www.eurac.edu/>\n\n\nEURAC research\nLegal Seat\nViale Druso 1, I-39100 Bolzano\n\n\nThis transmission is intended only for the use of the addressee and may contain confidential or legally privileged information.\nIf you receive this transmission by error, please notify the author immediately by mail and delete all copies of this transmission and any attachments.\nAny use or dissemination of this communication is strictly prohibited by the \"Privacy-Code\", D.Lgs. 196/2003 and may lead to penal prosecution and liability for damages.\nP Think before you print\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-January/010718.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010718", "created_by": "Lovati_Marco"}
