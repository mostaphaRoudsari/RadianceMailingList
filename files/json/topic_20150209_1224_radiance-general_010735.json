I wonder if there\nis an easier way to address this issue?\n\n\nA smarter solution is probably to create a smaller part of the panel and\ncopy it around (which is what I'm going to do next) but I wanted to make\nsure that I need to do so.\n\n\nThanks,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010735.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010735", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
