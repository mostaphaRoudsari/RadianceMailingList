Below some results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell height: 2.7 m and cell width: 5.5 m. The transparent facade faces\nsouth and it is divided in 2 windows, the bottom one has a fixed shading\nsystem composed by simple lamella at 45\u00b0 tilt angle. For the upper one two\nsystems has been tested:\n\n\n- Complex lamella for light redirection\n\n\n- Internal light shelf (width 1.2 m) with clear glass\n\n\nThe cell is located in the northern Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reflectance coefficients used are the common one except for the ceiling\nset at 0.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have performed three (one for each depth) annual simulations\nclimate-based with the 3-phase method. Then, the UDI index has been\nanalyzed (images at the link below). Observations:\n\n\n1.    From your knowledge, are the results reliable?\n\n\n2.    From the 4 meters the two systems seems to be equivalent. Can it be\nsince the systems do not influence the daylight trend from that distance?\n\n\n3.    Until the 7 meter, the daylight trend seems to be equal comparing the\nthree scenarios. After, we have the largest differences.\n\n\n4.    It is interesting to note as the UDI300-3000 on the 9 m pass from the\n60% of the working hours (image 45 - 9m) to almost 40% (image 45 - 10m)\ngoing under the UDI>3000 extended the depth from 9 to 10m.\n\n\n\n\nHere the images:\n\n\nhttp://s8.postimg.org/w22xxny9h/45_8m.jpg\n\n\nhttp://s8.postimg.org/ht3bfljqt/45_9m.jpg\n\n\nhttp://s8.postimg.org/fd1i1r1o5/45_10m.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments on the results?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the next step, I would like to use a reflectance coefficient very low\nfor the bottom vertical wall.\n\n\nMany thanks in  advance for the feedback.\n\n\nBest,\n*Giuseppe*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010777.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010777", "created_by": "Giuseppe_De_Michele"}
