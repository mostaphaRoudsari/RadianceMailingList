I have spend some times to \nfigure out what is not working and then some times to find a post in which the \nfull procedure is described. As I haven't found anything, I am now hopping you \ncan help.\n\n\nThanks\nSerge\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010781.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010781", "created_by": "Serge_Neuman"}
