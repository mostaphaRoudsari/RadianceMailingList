I searched then for some tilted files but there are\nnot existing for my luminaries.\nCan I ask, If there is any programe to tilt the actuall IES file and than\nput it into Radiance or is there any possibility to rotate or tilt an IES\nfile in Radiance ? Any tips and hints?\n\n\nThanks a lot\nKind regards,\n\n\nPeter Zatko\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010786.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010786", "created_by": "Peter_Za\u0165ko"}
