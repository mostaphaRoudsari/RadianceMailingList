For a\nbetter visual impression i have created an Imaging layer using the\ncolorpict material.\nlooking like this:\n\n\nvoid colorpict imagin_layer\n9 red green blue forestfl.pic . frac(U) frac(V) -s 2\n0\n0\n\n\nimagin_layer trans image\n0\n0\n7 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\n\nwhen this is rendered the material is divided into small samples giving an\nodd pattern.\nhere a picture of the rendering:\nhttp://api.ning.com/files/7F975s5rOKhNOb-MzrDw-IgT*9VAIHqtJ-jdmmewN42*lfsh9FDJX2BIr5Chxy1EG5VXoec5toLZlOaGexMtx8LzXqDF9y3t/Test_lightsource_highres_4096_.15_1024_2.bmp\n\n\nThis is a picture rendering using the standard settings for the high\nresolution rendering in diva, except for -ad 4096 -ds 0.15 and -as 1024.\nThe setup is one imported light source behind the transparent colorpict\nmaterial.  I have already tried using the ds/dj parameters without luck,\nthe subdivision seams fixed. Also changing the -n parameter when creating\nthe .oct file has not worked.\n\n\nI have tried various combinations of -ad -as -ds -dj and -ps until now.\ni hope someone can help.\n\n\nNiko\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010793.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010793", "created_by": "Niko_Planke"}
