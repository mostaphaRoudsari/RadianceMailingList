I have successfully run this same header file in regular mode and I would have thought the sensor file should be the same.\nIs there anywhere I can find this behaviour?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n\nReinier Zeldenrust\nEnvironmental Designer\n\n\nAtelier Ten\nEnvironmental Design Consultants + Building Services Engineers\n\n\nCIBSE Building Services Consultancy of the Year 2011\nUK-GBC Sustainability Consultant of the Year 2009\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2015-March/000097.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000097", "created_by": "Reinier_Zeldenrust"}
