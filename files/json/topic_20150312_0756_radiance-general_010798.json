I have a multi aspect room, so I divided the windows in two groups, depending on their orientation, each group with its own modifier (is it alright even if they are in the same file?). In this way, the first run of rfluxmtx automatically produces two view matrices. The second run, for the daylight matrix, works well either if I use the same single file with all the windows in it or if I create two separate rad files for the two orientations, but the final illuminance results are somehow different (lower for the first option, higher for the second). I am carrying on with the two separate files, because of something reported in the older version of the 3-phase method tutorial about this, but I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s the right way to go.\n\n\nThe ambient parameters I\u2019m using are:\n-ab 12 -ad 50000 -lw 2e-5\t(for the view matrix)\n-ab 2 -ad 5000 -lw 2e-4\t\t(for the daylight matrix)\n\n\nAlso, when at the end I have one illuminance file per orientation, is it correct just to add them together using the rmtxop addition?\n\n\n2. As well as the transmission matrix, all the other matrices in the rmtxop multiplication can be substituted if I am changing only one condition, right? e.g. if I\u2019m testing different grid resolutions I am changing only the view matrix and if I use different time steps I\u2019ll change only the sky matrix.\n\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\nEleonora\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010798.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010798", "created_by": "Eleonora_Brembilla"}
