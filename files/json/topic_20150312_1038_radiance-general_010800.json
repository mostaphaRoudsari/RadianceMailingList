I generated windows using Honeybee msh2rad, converting a Rhino mesh to a radiance geometry file via TurtlePyMesh & obj2rad.\n\n\nWhen I generate my view matrix, it works fine for some windows, but not for others - and there's no clear difference in geometry between those that work and those that don't work. My command is:\n                Rfluxmtx -ab 4 -ad 5000 -y 81 < ChEast.pts - windows_pts/window_04.rad material.rad ChEast.rad > viewpts_04.mtx\n\n\nAnd the error I get is:\nrcontrib: fatal - duplicate modifer 'M-nor'\n\n\nMy daylight and sky matrices work for fine for all of the windows, so I don't know what it is. Any idea what can cause this kind of behaviour? Does rfluxmtx need perfectly flat / regularly shaped objects?\n\n\nThanks,\nReinier\n\n\nHere is an excerpt of my window_04.rad file:\n#@rfluxmtx h=kf u=Z\nvoid glow windowglow\n0\n0\n4 1 1 1 0\n# c:\\radiance\\bin\\obj2rad C:\\ladybug\\genBSDFtest\\window_03\\MSH2RADFiles\\window_03.obj\n# OBJ file written by TurtlePyMesh\n\n\nwindowglow texfunc M-nor\n4 dx dy dz tmesh.cal\n0\n10           2\n    0.00014694    -0.00056977    -0.39197137\n   -0.00262064     0.00269441    -1.04630966\n    0.00007866     0.00016957    -0.86569177\n\n\nM-nor polygon object_1.1\n0\n0\n9\n          -245.804            137.307            31.8827\n          -229.021            137.314            22.0454\n          -252.533            117.213            36.8545\n[ it continues with more windowglow texfunc M-nor  & M-nor polygon object_x.x lines]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinier Zeldenrust\n\n\nEnvironmental Designer\n\n\nAtelier Ten\nBuilding Services Engineers + Environmental Design Consultants\nFire Engineers + Lighting Designers\n [signature]\nLONDON | GLASGOW | EDINBURGH | NEW YORK | NEW HAVEN | SAN FRANCISCO | DOHA | BANGKOK | SINGAPORE | SYDNEY\n19 Perseverance Works, 38 Kingsland Road, London E2 8DD\nT +44 (0)20 7749 5950\natelierten.com<http://www.atelierten.com/>\nAtelier Ten is an accredited ISO 9001 and 14001 company and is a founding member of the UKGBC.
