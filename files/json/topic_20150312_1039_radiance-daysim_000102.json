I have this glass\nmaterial:\n\n\n*void glass GenericDoubleGlazing72*\n\n\n*0*\n\n\n*0*\n\n\n*3 0.784590 0.784590 0.784590*\n\n\n\n\nbut in the .rad file at Daysim it appears as:\n\n\n\n\n*void trans GenericD 0 0 7 0.8848 0.8848 0.8848 0.0000 0.0000 0.4760 1.0000*\n\n\n\n\nI am aware of the RGB/monochrome conversion but the type of radiance\nmaterial is changing too (*\"glass\" *to* \"trans\"*). Is that correct? Does\nthat mean that the results the way as they are refer to a *translucent\nmaterial instead of a glass*?\n\n\n\n\nBesides that, if I want to customize a material file I would have to\ndirectly run the radfiles2daysim instead of importing the material using\nthe GUI?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would appreciate any directions on that subject.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2015-March/000102.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000102", "created_by": "Kamila_Mendon\u00e7a"}
