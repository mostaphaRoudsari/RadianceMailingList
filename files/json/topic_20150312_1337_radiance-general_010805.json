I haven't\nused AGI 32 at all to understand the nuances myself.\n\n\nCould someone please provide salient features comparing the two and/or\npoint me to the correct resources? What I have found online hasn't been\nconvincing. May be I am not searching in the right place.\n\n\nSo that you know, the audience is not technically sound. But understands\nlight well in the architectural context.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nShri\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010805.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010805", "created_by": "Shrikar_Bhave"}
