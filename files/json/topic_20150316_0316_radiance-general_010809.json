The issue is that obj2rad inserts textures between the material modifier \tand the surfaces, which confuses rfluxmtx (and rcontrib).  If you add the -f option, it should eliminate the issue.\nthe script works, rfluxmtx behaviour is back to normal!\n\n\nCheers, \n\n\nReinier Zeldenrust\nEnvironmental Designer\nAtelier Ten\nEnvironmental Design Consultants + Building Services Engineers\n\n\nCIBSE Building Services Consultancy of the Year 2011\nUK-GBC Sustainability Consultant of the Year 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-March/010809.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010809", "created_by": "Reinier_Zeldenrust"}
