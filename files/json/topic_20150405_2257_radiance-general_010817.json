I am using DIVA for Rhino simulation interface for\nRadiance simulation. I am representing the glass as a single surface in the\nmodel.\n\n\nI am struggling to come up with the Transmitted specularity(Ts), Diffuse\nTransmission(Td) , Reflected specularity(Rs) and the Diffuse reflectance\n(Cr, Cg,Cb) , so as to calculate the A1 to A7 trans material values.\n\n\nAny suggestion or pointers on how to estimate or get the above values?\n\n\nfor example, I have the following frit glass assembly with 60% coverage\nthat I pulled form glass manufacture website.\n\n\n1/4\" (6mm) clear VE-85 #2 and 60% Coverage V175 #2\n\n\n1/2\" (13.2mm) argon space\n\n\n1/4\" (6mm) clear\n\n\n\n\nAppreciate your help!\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\n\nAditya Potipireddi,\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010817.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010817", "created_by": "Aditya_Potipireddi"}
