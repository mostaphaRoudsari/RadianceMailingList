I found this previous discussion on email list (\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007983.html)\nbut I'm not still clear about the whole workflow. I break up the question\ninto 3:\n\n\n1. Is it possible to generate the sky just for UV radiation? or is it\npossible to generate the sky for an specific wavelength range? I understand\nthat gendaylit does provide the full spectrum but how can can I filter out\nthe values for UV?\n\n\n2. In case I can generate the filtered sky (question 1), does it effect the\nRadiance calculation for light transmittance? I assume as far as I input\nthe correct number (UV transmittance) the calculation should be accurate.\n\n\n3. Can/should I use BSDF materials in this case? Does BSDF materials\ninclude information for UV wavelength? and how does this will work with the\nsky (question 1). As an alternate method, and in case I can't filter the\nsky, I was thinking to modify BSDF material and make it opaque for all the\nwave-lengths except UV?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nMostapha\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010824.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010824", "created_by": "Mostapha_Sadeghipour"}
