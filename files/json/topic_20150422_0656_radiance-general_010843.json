I want to\nassess the DGP at a certain point in my building caused by the fa\u00e7ade across the street. What I have done is running the simulation DGP simulation, then setting the\nfacade as a black body and run it again (this way I account for everything but\nthe fa\u00e7ade). Then I subtracted both results to get the DGP produced by the fa\u00e7ade. However, I am\nkind of suspecting that DGP is not that simple (since it also considers\nfactors like contrast) and one cannot operate with it in that way.If so, can someone think of an alternative way to measure glare produced by a certain elemhent?Thanks in advance, Alejandro\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010843.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010843", "created_by": "Alejandro_Pacheco_Di\u00e9guez"}
