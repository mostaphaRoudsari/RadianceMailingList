I want to assess the DGP at a certain point in my building caused by the fa\u00e7ade across the street. What I have done is running the simulation DGP simulation, then setting the facade as a black body and run it again (this way I account for everything but the fa\u00e7ade). Then I subtracted both results to get the DGP produced by the fa\u00e7ade. However, I am kind of suspecting that DGP is not that simple (since it also considers factors like contrast) and one cannot operate with it in that way.If so, can someone think of an alternative way to measure glare produced by a certain elemhent?Thanks in advance, Alejandro\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010844.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010844", "created_by": "Alejandro_Pacheco_Di\u00e9guez"}
