(I use \u201cgendaylit.exe 3 21 12.0 -a 59.7 -o -18.0 -m -15.0 -W 0.0 1.0-O 2\u201c to create a sky with only 1 watt horizontal diffuse irradiance)\n\n\n\n\nHowever Ineed to estimate the times that the skylight is less than 100 lux. \n\n\nI use Genskyto produce automatically the sky file for the times that the sun altitude isclose to horizon (below and above horizon), but it gives me much higher valuesthan I expected. I checked the IES handbook and it says that to estimatediffuse skylight (the Sky ratio method is not accurate for low solar altitude,and I guess that Gensky use the same method).\n\n\nTherefore, Ireally appreciate if anyone can help me to produce a series of sky with 1minute intervals for the time the sun is very close to horizon (below or abovehorizon)\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nMajid\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-April/010860.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010860", "created_by": "Majid_Miri"}
