This should keep you from trying to access a negative entry in\nostable. Change lines 182-183:\n\n\nint  osentry, ntries;\nlong  hval;\n\n\nto:\n\n\nunsigned int  osentry, ntries;\nunsigned long  hval;\n\n\nFor good measure, you might also change line 197:\n\n\nosentry = (hval + (long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n\n\nto:\n\n\nosentry = (hval + (unsigned long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;\n\n\nI'd suggest moving this thread over to the radiance-dev list. I'm\ninterested to hear how your large models go.\n\n\nNathaniel\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 27, 2015 at 2:36 PM, Kolomenski, Andrei (JSC-SF311)[WYLE INTEG.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-April/001446.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001446", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones"}
