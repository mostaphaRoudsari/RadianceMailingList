We have made several fotos and combined this in an .hdr The problem we are facing is the low exposure level influencing the result. The values are low due to this fact. Trying to change something in the pcomb gives the failure \"can't open pcomb\" The problem is in the .hdr information, opening the file in photoshop gives the image we want to use. But Evalglare doenst uses the information of the .hdr, neccesito to type the information in the cmd.\n\n\nWith the normal comand in cmd evalglare filename.hdr gives a failure \"no valid view specified\". Neccesary to type the command C:/HDRI>evalglare -vth -vh 140 -vv 80 filename.hdr to get an result.\n\n\nMaybe its the problem we cannot acces the pcomb.\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nJasper Overduin\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2015-April/000557.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000557", "created_by": "Jacobus_Pieter_Overduin"}
