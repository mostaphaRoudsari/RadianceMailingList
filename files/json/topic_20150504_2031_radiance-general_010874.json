I hope Radiance can simulate the\nbehaviour of light direction, such as refraction dan internal reflection.\n\n\n I have tried to give dielectric material, but failed.\nand then i wanna give a prism material, but in prism materials the shape\nmust be a planar shape. but the shape that i want is trapezoidal.\nthe image of example room with shading acrylic can be downloaded in\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2kswj2ws0x0e6ni/room.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nthe image of shading acrylic that i want can be downloaded in\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qk2ozpjktc3k1ol/acrylic%20material.jpg?dl=0\n\n\nBest Regars,\n*Christy Vidiyanti*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010874.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010874", "created_by": "christy_vidiyanti"}
