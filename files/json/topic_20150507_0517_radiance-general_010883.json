I obtain a weird\ndata format in Reflection scattering data section. This is an example:\n 0.13983950.13990250.14006050.13999150.14011450.... etc. Various numbers,\nthat compose the matrix are not split by comma like in trasmission matrix.\nI ran the analysis in Ubuntu with these parameters:  *genBSDF -n 2 -c 20000\n-r -dj 1 -ds 0.01 -dt 0.05 -dc 0.99 -dr 50 -ss 100 -st 0.0001 -ab 10 -ar\n128 -aa 1 -ad 2054 -lr 50 -lw 0.0000000001*\n\n\nTherefore, I really appreciate if anyone can help me to create a right bsdf\nboth in trasmission and in reflection data.\nThanks so much.\n\n\nBest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Andrea Zani*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010883.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010883", "created_by": "Andrea_Zani"}
