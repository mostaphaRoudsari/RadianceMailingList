As Radiance Desktop is no more recommended for CFS daylighting, what is the alternative if one wants to study illuminance distribution (points values) inside an office that has CFS (with both diffuse and specular materials)?\n\n\n2.       Is there any user-friendly-interface program that can do the task without the need to work with command-line procedure (that I am not good with at all)?\n\n\n3.       If it's compulsory to use command-line tools, how can we construct/import CAD geometry and assign its materials?\n\n\n4.       And, is there a step-by-step tutorials on how to run Radiance (in case of command-line)?\n\n\nYour help/advice is really so appreciated.\n\n\nMany thanks in Advance :)\n\n\nIkrima Amaireh\nUniversity of Nottingham, UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message and any attachment are intended solely for the addressee\nand may contain confidential information.
