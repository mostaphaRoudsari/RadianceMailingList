To\ndo this I have used the next command (in addition,I attached the respective\nfiles)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/c8vrn445gz2nmd8/glazing.rad?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7foi5rqb5a4ll78/Layer0.rad?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o8rz1bw28la0s8g/materials.mat?dl=0\n\n\ngenBSDF -n 8 materials.mat glazing.rad Layer0.rad > Case1.xml\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/objuhir1asplcog/Case1.xml?dl=0\n\n\nApparently,It worked right since I can see it in  BSDF Viewer.\n\n\nHowever , the problem happen when I connect this BSDF with the window which\ncontains WINDOW 7.3 software.So, when I try to add a shading since XML\nfile, the program shut down.\n\n\nI have looked over each step but I dont know where can be the mistake.Do\nyou have any idea about this problem or what is happening?\n\n\nThanks you in advance,\n\n\nKing regards,\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Uribe C\u00e1ceres\nEstudiante de Ingenier\u00eda Civil\nDiploma en Ingenier\u00eda Estructural\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010905.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010905", "created_by": "Daniel_Uribe"}
