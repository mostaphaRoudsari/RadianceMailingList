Also, we still need to use command-line (radiance) to generate BSDF that will be used with SPOT Pro . Is that right?\n\n\nAlso, what is the difference between SPOT Pro and Daysim tools in terms of accuracy and flexibility (as both using Radiance engine)?\n\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010907.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010907", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
