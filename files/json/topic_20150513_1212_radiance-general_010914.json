I wish if you can help me to answer:\n\n\nAs Daysim and SPOT Pro's main difference is mainly how to treat with sun and sky components, is that applies to all radiance-based-engine tools (including Radiance command-line approach itself)? By other words, is the way sun-and-sky-being-treated the main motivation to go for radiance-based-engine-tools rather than simple tools (i.e. like Ecotect)? So if someone needs to just investigate how different complex fenestration systems will affect indoor daylight coefficients (no illuminance levels nor pictures needed), there is no need to generate BSDF data for those CFS and even no need to use radiance?\n\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\n\nSorry for my long emails, but really this will help me a lot at my early stages.\n\n\nBest regards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010914.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010914", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
