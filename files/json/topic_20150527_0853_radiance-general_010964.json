I have a .rad geometry file that contains numerous polygons and it would be helpful to be able to identify a specific polygon identifier name by simply clicking on its surface within an .hdr image. This is useful for debugging purposes, where the geometry consists of a large number of geometry primitives.\n\n\nIf anybody has developed a Radiance utility that performs this task, I would greatly appreciate it you could share it or give some insight into the procedure.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010964.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010964", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski"}
