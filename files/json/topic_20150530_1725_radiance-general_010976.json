Since the room geometry will remain the same in each case, my octree will comprise of : room materials, room geometry and luminaire(18 of them, one at a time). So, I want to implement a loop where I can call oconv each time and  pipe the output directly to rtrace without writing the octree to disk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example in the man page is :  rtrace \u2212ov scene.oct < samples.inp > radiance.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to do something like : rtrace samples.inp <scene.oct>radiance.out. ? If yes, is there a specific flag that I should be using for the ray file(samples.inp) ? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been able to make this work with rpict for images with something like : oconv  radfiles | rpict \u2013vf viewfile \u2013ab etc.. | pfilt | ra_ bmp etc, however I couldn\u2019t find a way to create a similar pipe with rtrace. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010976.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010976", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam"}
