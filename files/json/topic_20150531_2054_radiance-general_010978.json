I am creating a sky model using gendaylit with a \nhigh amount of direct solar component as seen below,\n > gendaylit 05 18 8.667 -W 881 63 -a 1 -o -104 -m -120\n\n\nThe issue is that when I render my scene using -ab 1, I can see the \nsolar disc. When I render it with a higher number of ambient bounces, \nsuch as 4, the solar disc is absent from the final visualization. You \ncan see the results here: 1 ambient bounce \n<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab1.png>, 4 ambient bounces \n<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab4.png>. You will notice \nthat in the rendering with 4 ambient bounces, the shadows are still cast \nproperly as if the sun is present.\nI am using a slightly older version of Radiance right now (RADIANCE 4.2a \nlastmod  by  on w015t-001), but I suspect that isn't the root of the \nproblem. This issue also occurs when I use gensky \n<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab4_clsky.png>. I have \nnever seen this kind of behavior before from Radiance. Does anyone have \nthoughts as to what might cause this?\n\n\nThank you,\nAlstan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-May/010978.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010978", "created_by": "Alstan_Jakubiec"}
