I have\ngone through the two tutorials in Chapter 1 & 2, a lot of code are now\noutdated but I cannot figure out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nJiajie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/010992.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_010992", "created_by": "Jonathan_Zhu"}
