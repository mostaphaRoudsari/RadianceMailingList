I have understood that there is a bug in the code and I tried\nto follow the procedure in this discussion\nhttp://radiance-general.radiance-online.narkive.com/kKC0HCmV/su2rad-rb-update-of-the-sketchup-to-radiance-converter\nbut without success.\n\n\nThis is what I have done:\n\n\n- Add my materials in the materials.rad file in the su2rad folder of\nSketchup\u2019s plugins\n\n\n- Name the layer in Sketchup with the identifier of the material\n\n\n\n\nSomething changed in the \u201csu2rad export window\u201d, since the layer/material\nare displayed no more yellowish-brown but blue.  However, the materials.rad\nfile exported contains again the \u201cdefault_material\u201d for each material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny advice? Thank you in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGiuseppe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011000.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011000", "created_by": "Giuseppe_De_Michele"}
