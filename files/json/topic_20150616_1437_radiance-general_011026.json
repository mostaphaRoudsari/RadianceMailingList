I'm definitely a novice at using Radiance, but I am trying to\nrun simulations as close to reality as possible for simple scenes. I have\nthe lighting and geometry down, but would like to implement defining a\nsurface with a BSDF material. I have the BSDF file but have no idea where\nto go from there.\n\n\nAny assistance on how to pass this or include this in the command would be\nmore than appreciated!\n\n\nThank you,\nChristian\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011026.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011026", "created_by": "Christian_Sarmiento"}
