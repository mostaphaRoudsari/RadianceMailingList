By the end, what I need exactly is running Radiance (with almost all its programs) for two things:\n\n\n1. generate BSDF for CFS to be used with Window7.3 tool.\n2. calculate daylight levels for a grid points inside the space with same CFS.\n\n\nTo be honest, I did a lot of readings on how to do that but can't try that because I can't manage to install full Radiance package (I have already installed Radiance for windows but can't run genBSDF program, as I know).\n\n\nI hope you can help me to sort that out :)\n\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011041.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011041", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
