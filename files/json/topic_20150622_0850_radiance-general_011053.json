My first\nquestion is: where these weighting factor come from? Do they incorporate\nthe spectral sensitivity of the human eye (so called V(\u03bb)) in the\nirradiance calculation? My second question is: should the summation of\nthese weighting factors be always equal to 1.\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance,\n\n\nParisa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/011053.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011053", "created_by": "parisa_khademagha"}
