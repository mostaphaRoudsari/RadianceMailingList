The main one\nbeing that we are getting a consistent green tint to the RAW HDR images\ncreated with raw2hdr, which is not shown in its counterpart HDR image\ncreated with hdrgen. I have attached the images for reference. The two HDR\nimages are composed of the same sets of LDR images taken at the same time\nexcept, of course, with one created with the JPEG files and one with the\nRAW files.\n\n\nA second issue, which has only happened once so far, is that I am getting a\ndiagonal white bar in the final composed HDR image. I was able to create a\ncorrected image by toggling on the -x setting, to remove over- and\nunder-exposed images, but I was still curious what exactly is causing this\ntype of error so I can avoid it moving forward. Again, image has been\nattached for reference.\n\n\nIf the links to the images are not working, please let me know and I can\nsend them directly.\n\n\nAny insight is much appreciated!\nMio Stanley\nGraduate Student, University of Colorado Boulder\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2015-June/000559.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000559", "created_by": "Mio_Jane_Stanley"}
