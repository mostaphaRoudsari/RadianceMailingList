I have done as following for Windows (I have\nUbuntu 14 now, but, I am checking the first steps done by Windows):\n\n\ngensky 12 21 15 -c -B 0.55866 | perl c:/radiance/bin/genskyvec.pl -m 4 -c 1\n1 1 > review/skies/12_21_15.skv\n\n\n(I do not know if is good) So, I am sure that for each time during the year\nit generates the same Sky Vector. However, I think that the \"genskyvec\"\ncalculation divided the sky in different parts in contrast with \"gensky\"\ncommand that generate void brightfunc material. Therefore,\u00a0the skyvector\ndoes launch different values for each sky division? If I rotated my model I\nget different illuminance date for only Sky Vector variable?\n\n\n2)\u00a0Klems divisions of Daylight Matrix:\nWhen there is a definition of \"kbin(Nx,Ny,Nz,Ux,Uy,Uz)\", is it because for\neach orientation there are some different values? I suppose that for each\norientation it uses the same divisions.\n\n\nExcuse me, but, I am trying with a rotated model and I want to ensure that\nI understand well the method. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u00a0Thank you in\nadvance.\nYour faithfully,\nUrtza.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011083.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011083", "created_by": "Urtza_Uriarte"}
