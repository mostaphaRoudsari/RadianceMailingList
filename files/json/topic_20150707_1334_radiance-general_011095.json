Is there a validation procedure carried out? If so, who is in charge of this and what are some of the test cases used for validation?\n\n\nThank you in advance,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011095.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011095", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski"}
