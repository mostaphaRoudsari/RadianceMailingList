I could install Cygwin (works fine), Xming (not sure if working) and Radiance (not all its programs are working!).\n\n\nI'm a bit confused as I'm not sure if running Radiance on windows using Cygwin will be enough for carrying my work. For example, can I work out phases methods and generate BSDF data?\n\n\nI wish if you can help me to do that.\n\n\nMany thanks\nikrima\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 3\nDate: Thu, 9 Jul 2015 16:44:49 +0000\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011109.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011109", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
