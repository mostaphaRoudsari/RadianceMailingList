It's just for specific hours of the day and the target is to produce a illuminance levels for indoor grid under different CFSs. Hence, according to my understanding from Larrain words, I can use either 2-phase or Ray-tracing methods. My question is how can I draw/define the CFS geometry and Space for these calculations? Is it similar to the way use in Ecotect/Radiance calculations?\n\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011111.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011111", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
