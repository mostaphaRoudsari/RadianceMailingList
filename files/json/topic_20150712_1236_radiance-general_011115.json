So, do recommend this (radiance tutorial would be enough to start with 3 or 5-phase methods and understanding of BSDF data approach, etc) or advice another tutorial/source for better understanding of radiance basics (using command prompt)?\n\n\nMany thanks again :)\n\n\nRegards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage: 2\nDate: Fri, 10 Jul 2015 15:52:23 +0000\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011115.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011115", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
