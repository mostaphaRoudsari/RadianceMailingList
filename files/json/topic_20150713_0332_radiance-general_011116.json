I suppose that it is\nbecause it takes a lot of time. If I use RGB conversion as follow:\n\n\ndctimestep results/photocellsSouthWest.vmx\ndata/JK_ClearGlass_T70_emis2_0.077_VBlinds.xml results/southwest.dmx\nskies/Geneva.smx | rcalc -e \"$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)\" >\nresults/illum_vb20-smxklemsSW.dat\n\n\nwill I have problems? I would like to manage with sensorpoints x 8760 file.\n\n\nThank you in advance.\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n\n\n\u00a0\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011116.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011116", "created_by": "Urtza_Uriarte"}
