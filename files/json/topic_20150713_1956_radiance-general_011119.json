The problem was, in these deeper regions of \nthe object, the ambient lighting term dominated the rendered patch.\n\n\nIn the physical world, there is probabilistically only one darkest \nregion (i.e., a single darkest pixel in HDRI) in any particular image of \na scene. However, with Radiance, I find large patches that share the \nsame darkest luminance value, and the subtle shading information is \nlost. In my last experiment, I was able to overcome this problem with a \nhack: I added a large, dim area light for fill. This, in effect, caused \nthe cosine reflectance function to dominate the shading values, which is \nnot the same as indirect lighting effects caused by inter-reflections \nand contour changes. Unfortunately, although that hack worked for my \npurposes at the time, it would not be the right approach for my current \nproject. How does one eliminate this problem in his/her renderings using \nRadiance?\n\n\nIn general, is there a way to recreate an environment using Radiance \nthat ensures photometric accuracy in subtly-shaded concave regions of \nconvoluted objects (e.g., caused by gradual orientation changes, umbras, \nself-occlusions, and inter-reflections)?\n\n\nThank you for your thoughtful considerations.\n\n\nSincerely,\nChris Kallie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011119.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011119", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie"}
