Now I\u2019m close to\nthe results, there\u2019re some errors I can\u2019t fixed. There\u2019re quite\nstraightforward in the terminal, but I have no clue. I\u2019m wondering if\nanyone could help me out. Thank you very much in advance.\n\n\n\n\n1) The terminal says: cannot open scene feel \u201cart_mat.rad\u201d, but I do have\nthe file in art_lib. After searching all the files with\nart_lib/art_mat.rad, I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Additionally, I checked\nmy .profile and .bashrc, they both have \u201c.\u201d to the RAYPATH variable.\n\n\n2) The terminal keeps giving me the errors concerning the views, no matter\nda or db. For instance, it says \u201cbad view\u201d if I linked the view files to\nthe ones in view_lib directory. If I just wrote down the view in\nscene2_d.rif, it gives me \u201cview up parallel to view direction\u201d (with -vd 0\n0 -1 for da). Or \u201cerror in overture for view da\u201d if I changed into -vd 0 1\n-1. (\\\n\n\nI\u2019m sharing my files below.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Zhe Kong*\n*PhD Student*\n*University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee *\n*School of Architecture and Urban Planning *\n*2131 E.
