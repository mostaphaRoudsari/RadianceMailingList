In person DIVA training<http://diva4rhino.com/page/diva-day-2015-training-course-schedule> will be offered in conjunction with DIVA Day on October 22 and 24 at the Architectural Association in London.\nCompete: Finally, please alert any of your student contacts of our 2nd DIVA Day student competition<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015/student-competition>. We want to see how you are using DIVA. The winner(s) will receive a \u00a31000 stipend to cover travel costs to DIVA Day, free conference registration, and will have their submission displayed during DIVA Day, on 23 October 2015! The submission deadline is September 19.\nHappy simulations,\nChristoph\nChristoph Reinhart\nAssociate Professor\nDepartment of Architecture\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n77 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 5-418, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\nt: 617 253 7714, f: 617 253 6152, creinhart at mit.edu<mailto:creinhart at mit.edu>\nSustainable Design Lab<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/> | DIVA<http://www.diva4rhino.com/> | Daysim<http://daysim.ning.com/> | mapdwell<http://www.mapdwell.com/> | umi<http://www.urbanmodeling.net/>\n\n\nEvents  Modeling Urban Sustainability<https://model-sustainability.mit.edu/> | DIVA Day 2015 <http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011141.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011141", "created_by": "Christoph_Reinhart"}
