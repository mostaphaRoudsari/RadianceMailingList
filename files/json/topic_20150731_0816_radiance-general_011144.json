How does one use (select and \ncombine?) the appropriate release/pre-release files to compile a fully \nfunctional program suite? Presently, I need the original functionality \nplus the ability to compute caustics (making the latest official release \ninsufficient).\n\n\nI am sure this is a common issue, but without access to a convenient \nsource of organized information (i.e., a wiki), I find myself fumbling \nwith Google searches and generally lost.\n\n\nThanks again,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-July/011144.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011144", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie"}
