However,\nfor some other locations (I have seen them with files created from IWEC\ndata), the timestamps are half-integers (8.5, 9.5 etc). I am not sure what\nis causing this difference. I'm using Daysim 3.1 on windows.\n\n\nI am doing nothing different except changing the weather file. Any help\nwould be appreciated.\n\n\nThanks,\nCraig\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2015-August/000110.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000110", "created_by": "Craig_Collins"}
