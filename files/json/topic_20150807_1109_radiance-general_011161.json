I am asking\nthis because I want to add this feature to the plugin I am developing.\n\n\nWhat is the recommended method for modelling luminaires in Radiance? I\nintend to use IES files as input. Hopefully I would also have the geometry,\nbut I have to consider cases when this is not available.\n\n\nI know there is an IES2RAD program, but I am not quite sure how general it\nis. Also, I have heard about the use of illums (a sphere, for example) that\ncovers the entire luminaire....?\n\n\nI am kind of lost, so if someone could give me a hint, I would really\nappreciate it.\n\n\nAlso, if someone know where to find information about IES files and their\nformat, that would also be really helpful.\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011161.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011161", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
