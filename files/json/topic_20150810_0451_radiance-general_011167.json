So far, I have been advised by you for several stages, which really helped me a lot for better understanding of radiance and how it works.\n\n\nNow, I have a question about how I use ray-tracing method in radiance? Is it similar to the way explained through the following attachment? As here, calculations are run using Radiance engine but Ecotect or Daysim interface (for geometry modelling and material assignment).\n\n\nDocument: http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/TeachingResources/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf\n\n\nI hope if you can kindly advise me on that asap, please?\n\n\n\n\nBest regards\nIkrima\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011167.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011167", "created_by": "Ikrima_Amaireh"}
