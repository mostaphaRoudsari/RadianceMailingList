Here is\nthe problems that I have:\n\n\n1.       If I use the glass type material for the building facade with -i\noption in rpict, there will be no facade in the final result. I have checked\nthe manual page that I know it is because of the Boolean calculation will\nignore the transparent surface in the final result. But I do need the facade\nto be seen in the final result, how can I solve it.\n\n\n2.       I found in the result that if I use the glass type material, no\nmatter how low I set the transmissivity values, there will always no\n'hotspot'/convergent irradiance on the ground level. It seems that the\nprogram just ignore the reflection process on the glass surface.\n\n\n3.       If I change the facade material to mirror type, I can find an\nobvious 'hotspot' on the ground level as well as the facade in the final\nresult. So I just wonder is it proper to modify the facade material into a\nmirror type if I am only interested in the exterior irradiance map of a\nbuilding. Besides, if mirror type material can be used in my situation, how\ncan I set the RGB reflectance values for mirror? For example, if the facade\nglass has a 40% transmittance, is it equivalent to set RGB values into 0.6\n0.6 0.6 for a mirror material?\n\n\nMany Thanks,\n\n\nJiajie\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011173.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011173", "created_by": "Jiajie_Zhu"}
