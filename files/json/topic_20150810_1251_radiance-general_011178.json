Visit\nSPOT home <http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>\n\n\n\n\nto learn more about it and download the software.\n\n\nSPOT Pro is a Windows-based stand-alone lighting and daylighting design\ninterface to a powerful Radiance ray-tracing engine that sits, accessible,\nbehind the scenes.  SPOT Pro has a number of unique simulation capabilities:\n\n\n   - *Optical daylighting system annual simulation* - SPOT uses \"system\n   BSDF\" files to describe these optical or complex fenestration systems and\n   perform annual simulation.\n   - *Shade control simulation* - both automated/photosensor-based control\n   and a range of manual shade control algorithms are available\n   - *Annual metric reports* - compare various daylighting metrics with\n   standard daylighting reports for LEED (v4, 2009, v2.1), CHPS and\n   a SPOT performance report.\n   - *\"Design Day\" calculations* - results showing average \"design day\"\n   conditions (calibrated to climate data) rather than a specific weather\n   condition in an hourly weather file.\n   - *Simulation of photosensor systems and electric lighting* - SPOT simulates\n   the actual photosensor system response, lets you refine the control system\n   settings, and provides an annual simulation of the interaction between\n   electric lighting and daylighting.  For those aiming for truly accurate\n   simulation of the interaction between daylighting and electric lighting,\n   this may be the *only tool* that does not use workplane illuminance (an\n   average or a point) as a proxy for the photosensor signals, and that\n   accounts for the interaction of electric light feedback on common\n   closed-loop control systems.\n   - *Output to DOE-2 and EnergyPlus* - After optimization and simulation\n   of the photosensor system, SPOT provides annual LPD multiplier schedule\n   output files for both DOE-2 and EnergyPlus.  Direct output to HAP coming\n   soon....\n   - *Internal Geometry Modeler* - The internal modeling tools are fairly\n   robust, with blocks, sloped ceilings, monitors, and sawtooth geometries\n   available, yet still easy and quick to use with no CAD experience\n   necessary.  Sketchup models can be imported into the software behind the\n   scenes.\n   - *Material Database and Editor * - New material database allows colors,\n   patterns, glass, metals, and BSDF files to be assigned to your model's\n   surfaces.\n   - *Improved Renderings -* The use of materials and patterns greatly\n   improve the quality of the perspective and sectional renderings.\n\n\nThe software is in its final weeks of beta testing with the official v5.0\nrelease coming at the end of August, 2015.  Commercial licenses bought\nduring this final beta stage are 1/2 off and will be valid for all SPOTPro\nv5.X releases (at least a 3 year cycle).  Reduced price educational\nlicenses are also available.\n\n\nThe SPOT user manual\n<http://www.manula.com/manuals/zrogers/spot-pro-v-5/1/en/topic/1-0-introduction>\n\n\n provides detailed information about the software including screen shots of\nthe various aspects of the program and this SPOT webinar\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecBFe83HRSY> provides a good introduction\nto the software.\n\n\nThe next SPOT training webinars will be held at the Radiance workshop in\nPhiladelphia on August 18, 2015 (register at the workshop website\n<http://www.cvent.com/events/14th-annual-international-radiance-workshop/event-summary-9869b51ebebe45ad8cb25fdf2e31fd89.aspx>\n\n\n)  followed by a Performance.Network webinar on Sept 4, 2015 (register at\nperformance.network <http://www.performance.network/>\n\n\n).  E-mail spot at daylightinginnovations.com if you are interested in joining\nor scheduling a future SPOT webinar.\n\n\nHappy Simulating!\n\n\n[image: Inline image 3]\n\n\n\n\nZack Rogers, P.E., LEED AP BD+C\nDaylighting Innovations, LLC\n808 S.
