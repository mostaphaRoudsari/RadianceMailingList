The artifacts look like a\nwhite, or sometimes half-black and half-white, patch at random locations.\nSee below for examples:\n\n\nhttp://minjung.ca/tmp/artifacts1.png\nhttp://minjung.ca/tmp/artifacts2.png\n\n\nI've tried (1) setting ad = 4096, as = 1024, and (2) setting aa = 0, ar =\n0, but neither of these two settings fixed the problem. Do you have any\nidea what might be happening? Here are some possibly relevant factors:\n\n\n- The object is completely Lambertian.\n- The only light source in the scene is a glow source that is positioned\nbehind the camera, and covers as much of the sky as possible.\n- I don't think I've ever encountered such artifacts with untextured\nstimuli.  I could be wrong, though.\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nMJ\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011203.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011203", "created_by": "Minjung_Kim"}
