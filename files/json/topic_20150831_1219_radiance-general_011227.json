With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.\n\n\nDeveloped to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.\n\n\nThe training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.\n\n\nSpace is limited so we encourage early registration.\n\n\n <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> Additional course information and registration.\n\n\nAre you designing and modeling net zero buildings? What are you waiting for? DesignBuilder is the best software on the market today for that job!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 DesignBuilder USA, All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\nOur mailing address is:\n\n\nDesignBuilder USA\n\n\nPO Box 4477\n\n\nSanta Rosa, CA 95402\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=3387488/grpspId=1705007389/msgId=34989/stime=1439300402> \n  <http://y.analytics.yahoo.com/fpc.pl?ywarid=515FB27823A7407E&a=10001310322279&js=no&resp=img>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011227.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011227", "created_by": "Christian_Stalberg"}
