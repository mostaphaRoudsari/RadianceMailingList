I look at two types of installed effect - 5 W/m2 and 10 W/m2. which is the only difference between the two calculations. There is no solar shading in the model.\nI use the same model for both analyzes. This means that I only make a one calculation of daylight coefficients.\u00a0The light is controlled in both analyzes via photo sensors with dimming (photo-sensor control).\nThe for my question. Why is there a smaller increase in energy consumption of approximately 1 W/m2 by going from 5 W/m2 to 10 W/m2 installed power? Here I compare 2 x the energy consumption for 5 W/m2 with the energy consumption of 10 W/m2\n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you\n\n\nBest regards\nPer Haugaard\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011228.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011228", "created_by": "Per_Haugaard"}
