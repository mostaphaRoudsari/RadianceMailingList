I wonder if it would make sense to add an option to\nRadiance that would allow users to force additional direct samples when\nthey want nice penumbras (assuming that -dj is non-zero). Then when I want\na final image that is 1200x800 I don't need to render it at 9600x6400 and\nfilter it down, I could render at 1200x800 and request 64 direct samples\nper light source to get the same smooth penumbras.\n\n\nWould this actually help me, or is the time difference between rendering\n9600x6400 with 1 direct sample to rendering 1200x800 with 64 direct samples\nnegligible?\n\n\nAndy\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2015-September/001457.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001457", "created_by": "Andy_McNeil"}
