I'm using the trans modifier and am coming across issues when rendering.\n\n\nWhen I try to render my scene for Illuminance values, the output render removes the translucent material from the scene, exposing the interior to the external exterior. However when I render for luminance results, everything works fine.\n\n\nHas anyone come across this issue before and know what might be causing the issue.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nGarry\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011236.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011236", "created_by": "Garry_Luu"}
