I have to do the same calculation for several locations.\n\n\nThe second approach that comes to mind is to apply a bulk reduction factor,\nbut this would not be very accurate in the presence of direct radiation or\nanisotropic diffuse radiation.\n\n\nA third way could be to use rtrace to calculate the contribution to the\nirradiation from the various sky patches and use the projection factor for\neach one of them. As far as I understand though, rtrace provides the total\ndirectional irradiation on an ideal surface placed in the point of interest\nand perpendicular to the ray under examination. This corresponds to the\nradiation generated from the portion of the sky visible from the surface.\n\n\nHas anyone tried something similar? Do you have any recommendation?\n\n\nThanks\nRuggiero\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011239.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011239", "created_by": "Ruggiero_Guida"}
