I export the model from Rhino, and the rendering works well in Window system. Then I copy all the text files in Mac, the terminal gives me \u201cSegmentation fault: 11\u201d. I saw others ran into the same error with gendaylit. But no matter with or without a sky file (I have artificial lights for night occasion), the file gives the same error. Does anyone else have the same experience?\nPlease feel free to ask for my file it you\u2019d like to help me figure out. It is too large to share them. \n\n\nThank you in advance. \nZhe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011249.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011249", "created_by": "zhekong"}
