I have Yosemite 10.10.5. I have to use Radiance for my Master thesis.\nI am already having a hard time in the installation. I am trying to follow the video tutorial on the official website but it refers to an old version (of both website and Mac software): everything is a little bit different and I am doing something wrong. I can\u2019t even start: as I type the command -xzf in order to extract the files, the terminal says: \u201ccommand not found\u201d.\nDoes anyone know what I am doing wrong? Is there an updated tutorial where I can see what I have to do step by step?\nThank you!\n\n\nMarta\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-September/011255.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011255", "created_by": "Marta_Benedetti"}
