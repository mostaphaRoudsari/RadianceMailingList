That\nsame wall is 29 cd/m2 at 12:00, yet when displayed (using ximage) it\nappears darker.\nExposure times in the headers are of course quite different:\nvp-A-092108.00.pic:EXPOSURE=3.008155e+00\nvp-A-092112.00.pic:EXPOSURE=3.957302e-01\n\n\n\n\nBasically I want the tone mapping according to a constant (perhaps log)\nscale for all images.\n\n\nHow can that be accomplished?\n(Looks like falsecolor could do this if it also had a greyscale palette.)\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nWouter\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011274.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011274", "created_by": "Wouter_Beck"}
