The problem I am getting is in the recommended reverse ray \ntracing commands. I see the following errors:\n\n\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at '-apd'\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at '-apg'\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at '-app'\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at '-apc'\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at '-apv'\nrpict: fatal - command line error at '-apd'\nrpict: fatal - command line error at '-apdb'\nrtrace: fatal - command line error at '-apdb'\n\n\nI understand that rpict and rtrace don't have these options (maybe they \nwere there in earlier versions of Radiance). Is there a resource that \ncan explain these differences? Or, is there a more recent set of demos \nfor the pmap function? I may also be having compilation errors, so I'm \npretty much open to any explanation.\n\n\nAt your mercy, always,\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011291.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011291", "created_by": "Chris_Kallie"}
