Looks like I have some more files to include in the CMake files, so our packages work correctly, thanks for the catches. As for item (1), it seems like the right move there is to have Greg change the shebang line to call \"wish\", and place the onus on the users to have a symlink for wish that points to whatever they have on their systems.\n\n\nLet's sort it out on dev when we have time. Thanks again for the heads up.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\nOn 10/20/15, 8:32 AM, \"Terrance McMinn\" <t.mcminn at iinet.net.au<mailto:t.mcminn at iinet.net.au>> wrote:\n\n\nMust report that \"trad\" does not run as installed by the radiance-5.0.a.6-Darwin.dmg OSX installer.\n\n\nIssues:\n1. $ -bash: /usr/local/radiance/bin/trad: /usr/local/bin/wish8.0: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\n\n    Fixed by sudo vi /usr/local/radiance/bin/trad and change the first line to \"#!/usr/local/bin/wish8.5\" as that is what is installed on my system.\n2.
