The obtained SPDs are in the range of 360 to 740 nm., commonly considered the photopic range. Then I compute the total photopic specularity using the equation below.\n\n\n[cid:image002.png at 01D10B51.83998D30]\n\n\n\n\nFor a black shiny metal sample, I compute a specularity of 21%. Is it correct to use a value of 0.21 for my specularity definition of a metal material primitive. I\u2019ve read that specularity values greater than  0.1 are not realistic (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Materials) in Radiance. In the .hdr rendered image, the material appears to be highly specular to the degree that it acts like a mirror. So this why I\u2019m concerned if I\u2019m using the right procedure to define the specularity for the Radiance metal primitive.\n\n\nIs it correct to use a hemispherical reflectance meter, and the equation above to define the Radiance specularity term.\n\n\nThank you for your input,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011299.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011299", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski"}
