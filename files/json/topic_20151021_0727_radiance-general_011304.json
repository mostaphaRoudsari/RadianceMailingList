This software uses the Three-Phase Method of Radiance to help\nyou analyse the effects of \u2018Complex Fenestration Systems\u2019 from the\nperspective of visual comfort and daylight availability. Additionally, it\ngives you the opportunity to develop custom control strategies for dynamic\nshading devices. Its integration in the TRNSYS environment allows for the\ndynamic simulation of both daylight and thermal performances of buildings\nand their interaction. The tool has been presented at the 13th\nInternational Radiance Workshop in London.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped within the FP7 EU \u2018CommONEnergy\n<http://www.commonenergyproject.eu/>\u2019 project, the TypeDLT software is open\nsource, allowing anyone to use it and to contribute to its development. The\ncode with the documentation and an example file are available at the GitHub\nrepository https://github.com/EURAC-EEBgroup/TypeDLT-for-TRNSYS .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nGiuseppe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n\n\nGiuseppe De Michele\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEURAC Research\n\n\nInstitute for Renewable Energy\nVia G.
