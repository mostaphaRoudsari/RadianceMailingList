I want to get cd/m2 values by using the pvalue. Now\nI'm not sure how to get those cd/m2 values - I read somewhere that you\nshould multiply the values you get from pvalue with 179, but if I do\nthat I get crazy high values (about 15941203). Do I do something\nwrong? I have been trying to search for what pvalue exactly gives you\n(I know it's the brightness value but I can't find what unit it is\nin), but had no luck on that so far. I also wanted to know if this\nvalue is dependent on the area of your luminance picture or not.\n\n\nThank you so much in advance!\nIris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011312.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011312", "created_by": "Iris_Moonen"}
