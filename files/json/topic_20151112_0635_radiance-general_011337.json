As REVIT has essentially become the architectural industry modeling tool, the pipeline to Radiance is an important one.  It seems that the latest version of Sketchup has some challenges with the very helpful su2rad, written quite awhile ago. I heard that others were using some other pipelines, perhaps integrating obj2rad, etc.\nI would appreciate your sharing conversion pipelines which interface with the MOST CURRENT releases of REVIT, SKETCHUP, etc. Hopefully a generous and expert code person would consider writing a direct REVIT plugin for this purpose. There might be modest financial encouragement to fill this gap. I do realize that it may be short-lived as AutoDESK releases are moving targets, yet to engage the full Radiance tool kit for lighting design and analysis on REVIT generated models, will keep  Radiance on the forefront and accessible to a broader audience.\nAppreciatively,\nRob Shakespeare\nshakespe at indiana.edu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011337.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011337", "created_by": "Robert_A._Shakespeare"}
