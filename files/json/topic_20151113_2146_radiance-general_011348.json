Here is the thing, I have never used Radiance before in Linux, I\nonly used Desktop Radiance, and I have great knowledge about daylighting,\nglare, HDR, ...etc. Can anyone point me toward resources and tutorials that\ncan help me startup with my little program?. I'm also willing to pay if\nanyone is interested in giving me a private tutorial via Skype, or any\nother method. Thanks\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011348.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011348", "created_by": "Rania_Labib"}
