The surface seems quite specular and will have great influence on how to plan the lighting design and in special the artificial lighting. I am planning to have someone help me do measurement on the material to help me describe the surface\u00a0correctly\u00a0in means of RGB reflectance and specularity for use in Radiance.Have a nice weekend :)\n\n\n\n\nBest Regards\nPer Haugaard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Den 21:01 fredag den 20. november 2015 skrev \"radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\" <radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org>:\n\n\n\n\n Send Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 radiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n\u00a0 1.
