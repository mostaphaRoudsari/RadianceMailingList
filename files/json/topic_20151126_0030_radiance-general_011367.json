I am using\nEvalglare v 1.11 with real illuminance (-I Ev) data for photographs\nconverted to hdr by WebHDR and for visualizations got by Radiance.\nFurthermore, I am testing glare by DIVA. I have tested with both, Evalglare\nand DIVA\u2019s Evalglare with Clear Sky without Illuminance data and with\nilluminance data.\n\u00a0\n# gensky 7 22 11 +s -a 41 -o -2 -m -15\n\u00a0\n# gensky 7 22 11 +s -a 41 -o -2 -m -15 -B 458.100\n\u00a0\nI have taken photograph\u2019s Daylight Glare Probability index with real\nilluminance data as reference. Therefore, without Ev data, DGP\u2019s with\nClear Sky without illuminance data is more similar than Sky with\nilluminance data (-B):\n\u00a0\ndgp photographs= 71%\ndgp DIVA Sky without illuminance data= 63%\ndgp DIVA Sky with illuminance data (-B)= 100%\ndgp (just Radiance-Evalglare) Clear Sky without illuminance data= 62%\ndgp (just Radiance-Evalglare) Clear Sky with illuminance data (-B)= 100%\n\u00a0\nMy illuminance data has both, direct and diffuse irradiance. Could someone\nconfirm if \u2013B parameter is only for diffuse radiance? I think, that is\nexplained in the program specifications.\nThank you in advance.\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\nUrtza.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-November/011367.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011367", "created_by": "Urtza_Uriarte"}
