This is indeed the lowest value in my picture, but\ntherefor I'd like to get the second lowest value of the picture. Is\nthere an easy way to get this, or is the only way to get this value by\nlooking into the list of values for every pixel when I don't use the\ntotal command?\n\n\nBest regards,\nIris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011394.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011394", "created_by": "Iris_Moonen"}
