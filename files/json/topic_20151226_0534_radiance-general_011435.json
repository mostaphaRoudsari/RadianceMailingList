In  \nparticular, we have observed deviations exceeding 50% in some cases with  \nGLOW sources.\n\n\nWe are issuing this advisory to inform current and prospective users of  \nthe RADIANCE photon map about this issue. As a workaround, we suggest  \nusing the -ab -1 option with rcontrib, which evaluates contributed photons  \ndirectly at the sensor points. This will increase performance but results  \nin substantially higher noise, possibly requiring a larger photon map for  \nacceptable quality.\n\n\nWe will issue a bugfix and commit it to the RADIANCE CVS and HEAD release  \nin January. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause in the interim.\n\n\nHappy holidays and best wishes for the new year,\n\n\n--Roland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Roland Schregle\nSenior Research Associate\n\n\nLucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts\nSchool of Engineering and Architecture\nCC Envelopes and Solar Energy (EASE)\nwww.hslu.ch/ccease\n\n\nT direct: +41 41 349 36 26 (New)\nroland.schregle at hslu.ch\n\n\nTechnikumstrasse 21, CH-6048 Horw (Correspondence)\nEbenaustrasse 20, CH-6048 Horw (Office)\nT +41 41 349 33 11, F +41 41 349 39 60\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-December/011435.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011435", "created_by": "Schregle_Roland_HSLU_T&A"}
