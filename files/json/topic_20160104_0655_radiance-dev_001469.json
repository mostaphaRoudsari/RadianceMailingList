At the meantime I'm working on way of usage of this standard in\nnational building daylighting practise and very interested in it.\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong but as I understand this model is not\npresented in latest release of Radiance software and cal-file \"SSLDLum.cal\"\nof Dr. Phillip Greenup wasn't include. How do you think is there a possible\nto write in addition source code of CIE sky luminance distribution in\n\"gensky.c\"? If the Radiance licence and community allow maybe I can help\nwith it but need some clarifications about the existing\nin \"gensky.c\" source code.\n\n\nThank You.\n\n\nSincerely,\nDmytriy Radomtsev.\nPostgraduate, MArch, at Architectural constructions department,\nKiev national university of construction and architecture.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-January/001469.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001469", "created_by": "Dmytro_Radomtsev"}
