This year we are trying to take our daylight models\nto the next level and be able to achieve all options of LEED v4 EQ Credit:\nDaylight. For Option 1, we have to prove a Spatial Daylight Autonomy of\n300lx for 50% of occupied hours per year as well as analyze the Annual\nsunlight Exposure of 1000lx for 250h (ASE1000,250).\n\n\nWe are familiar with working with RADIANCE but we are not sure if it is\npossible to carry out this analyses and get both results needed. Could you\nhelp me with this doubt?\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\n\nRegards,\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011445.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011445", "created_by": "Stefanie_Madriz"}
