But how do these parameters influence rtrace simulations, where I don't have a picture but sensor points?\n\n\nThanks and happy simulations\nMatthias\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-January/011456.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011456", "created_by": "Matthias_Rammig"}
