This is despite the fact that my working\ndirectory is already set to the directory where the blinds.rad file is\nsaved in and the blinds.xml file should be saved to.\n\n\nCommand: \"genBSDF +f +b -c 500 -geom inch -dim 199 201 1.5 2.5 -0.939693 0\nblinds.rad > blinds.xml\"\n\n\nError: \"Segmentation fault\"\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, I was wondering if there are any solutions to visualize a\nTensor-tree BSDF data file produced by genBSDF on Windows?\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance.\nRegards,\n\n\nAlireza\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011471.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011471", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo"}
