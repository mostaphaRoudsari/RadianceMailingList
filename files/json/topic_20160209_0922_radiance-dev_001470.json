We use it to make the process of building and hosting Radiance installers, and that's about it. The CVS is still the home of Radiance, and that is where code changes are checked in, generally by Greg and sometimes by Roland now. On the rare occasions I actually do something to the Radiance code, I make my changes to combined and make a diff off that which I send to Greg and he merges into the CVS. Our Git bot updates the mirror hourly, at which time I revert to the last checkout and pull again, and off I go. I do make release tags on GitHib for the packages, but that's about it. Some people have used the Git issues to report, uh, issues, as well. But generally speaking the flow of code is one way, from CVS to Git.\n\n\nAs to why branch \"master\" is so out of date: master dates to the time when we started the mirror. From the outset the intent was to have a separate branch from which to develop the CMake system, and the Windows version of rvu. The developers responsible for the CMake work set it up this way, and when we moved the mirror crap to NREL we just left it as is. It all Just Works, provided you know about the whole 'combined' branch thing.\n\n\nNow then, what are you trying to do, Randolph? What changes do you have that you wanted to merge? Again, you wouldn't merge them to NREL/GitHub, they'd need to go to Greg. You could also fork the NREL repo and do whatever you wanted, I suppose.\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/8/16, 11:46 PM, \"Randolph M.

How I would merge my local \"combined\" branch with the github respository (should I have changes and the permission to merge them) I don't understand, but then there's lots of things about git I don't understand.\n\n\n(And I suppose we ought to move this discussion to the development list, bah!)\n\n\nRandolph\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 8, 2016 at 7:55 PM, Randolph M.

Branch \"master\" is ancient. As the link Nathaniel posted shows, the combined branch has the evalglare source, and the CMake files include it in the build and package targets:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/combined/src/util/CMakeLists.txt#L101-L104\n\n\nMatter of fact (file under: I love GitHub):\n\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/dde95dd17644c0fe8e6849ded9ee48498a5487ba\n\n\n- Rob\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/8/16, 8:18 PM, \"Rob Guglielmetti\" <rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com<mailto:rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com><mailto:rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com<mailto:rob.guglielmetti at gmail.com>>> wrote:\n\n\nYeah, whatcha talking about?\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 8, 2016 at 7:03 PM, Randolph M.
