So i tried installing it in my home folder. The installation ended with 'There were some errors'. Checking the error log I have seen the following error.\n\n\ncd ../libtiff ; make install\n/bin/sh: line 0: cd: tiff: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: ./configure: No such file or directory\n/bin/sh: line 6: cd: port: No such file or directory\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/software/users/FMTGA/Radiance-5.0.a.4/src/px'\nmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `all'.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/software/users/FMTGA/Radiance-5.0.a.4/src/px'\n/bin/sh: line 7: cd: ../libtiff: No such file or directory\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/software/users/FMTGA/Radiance-5.0.a.4/src/px'\nmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `install'.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/software/users/FMTGA/Radiance-5.0.a.4/src/px'\nmake: *** [../lib/libtiff.a] Error 2\n\n\nIs it because of lack of root access or something else? Could  anyone please help me  with doing a successful installation.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011492.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011492", "created_by": "Raghuram_Kalyanam"}
