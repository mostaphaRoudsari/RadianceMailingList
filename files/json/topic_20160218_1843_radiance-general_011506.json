I also have four misprints left that I'll ship anywhere in the USA for $12, total.\n\n\nThe Amazon hardcovers are the second printing. They are print-on-demand books and (Chas tells me) the cover looks a bit rough They are available for US$80 + shipping at:\n  http://www.amazon.com/Greg-Ward-Larson-Rendering-Radiance/dp/B00SB6HKNK\n(don't even worry about the over-priced ones that Amazon lists; the pricing seems to be the result of some weird Amazon thing.)\n\n\nMy softcovers are the third printing and contain some additional corrections to the mathematics. They are available for US$35 + shipping through my web site (or just write me) at:\n  http://www.panix.com/~randolph/book/\n\n\nTruth in marketing: there will eventually be a cheap or free PDF version of the book, but don\u2019t hold your breath.  Amazon\u2019s shipping prices outside of the USA may be better than mine . . . or not, I really don\u2019t know.\n\n\nRandolph M.
