You can learn how to use the software from them, but the printer left out the Greek letters in these (ouch!) so the mathematics is trashed.  They are marked \u201cmisprint\u201d all over.  I\u2019ll copies anywhere in the USA by media mail for $12; if you\u2019re outside of the USA, shipping prices is ridiculous, so spring for a good copy.\n\n\n\n\nRandolph M.
