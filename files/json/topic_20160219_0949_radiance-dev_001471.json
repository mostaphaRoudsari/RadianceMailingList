This is\nwith the latest HEAD from today.  Here is how to replicate this:\n\n\nCreate a test HDR\n\n\n$ pcomb -x 400 -y 300 -e 'lo=(x/400)' > test.hdr\n\n\nnow extract pixel brightness, and re-assemble into a new HDR:\n\n\npvalue -d -b -h -H test.hdr |pvalue -r -d -b -h -x 400 -y 300 > test_out_xy.hdr\n\n\nThis produces a 300x400 (portrait) image, not 400x300 (landscape) as I\nexpected.  As a result, the scanlines are all wrapped:\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/test_out_xy.hdr\n\n\nBUT\n\n\nIf I reverse the -x and -y options, the result is as expected 400x300\n(landscape):\n\n\npvalue -d -b -h -H test.hdr |pvalue -r -d -b -h -y 300 -x 400 > test_out_yx.hdr\n\n\nhttp://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/test_out_yx.hdr\n\n\nis this a bug or a known quirkyness of pcomb?  AFAIK, the order of\ncommand-line options is irrelevant with most (all?) other commands.\n\n\nHave a very good weekend\n\n\nKind regards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-February/001471.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001471", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
