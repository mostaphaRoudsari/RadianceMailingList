(I have checked the 'oconv' command  description but I could not\nunderstand the given explanation for the hyphen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2- Direct Sun Coefficient Matrix: Illuminance Calculations Vs. Rendering\n\n\nIn the tutorial, the Example 1 describes the application of five-phase\nmethod for illuminance calculations and the Example 2 describes the method\nfor renderings (luminance maps). There are obviously, overlaps between the\ntwo examples. With regards to the development of the Direct Sun Coefficient\nMatrix for illuminance calculations (Example 1), a 'model_suns.oct' file is\ngenerated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCommand (generating the 'model_suns.oct' file):\n\n\n$ xform -m black objects/testroom_Swall.rad objects/testroom.rad\nobjects/ground.rad \\\n| oconv materials/testroom.mat - objects/glazing.rad\nobjects/venetianblind.rad \\\nobjects/glazing_bsdf.rad skies/suns.rad > octs/model_suns.oct\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Example 2 for renderings uses two separate octree\nfiles to generate the Direct Sun Coefficient Matrix: 'model_suns.oct' and\n'model_nosuns.oct'\n\n\n\n\nCommand (generating the 'model_nosuns.oct' file):\n\n\n$ xform -m black objects/testroom_Swall.rad objects/testroom.rad\nobjects/ground.rad | \\\noconv materials/testroom.mat - objects/venetianblind.rad >\nocts/model_nosuns.oct\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n- Why is the 'venetianblind.rad' passed to the 'oconv' call in the command\ngenerating 'model_suns.oct' without a hyphen \"-\", whereas the\n'venetianblind.rad' is passed to the 'oconv' call in the command for\ngenerating 'model_nosuns.oct' with a hyphen?\n- Why is the 'glazing.rad' (which is an identical polygon definition to\n'daymtxsurf.rad' with a glass modifier) is included in the 'model_suns.oct'\nfile but it is excluded from the 'model_nosuns.oct' file?\n- Unlike the 'model_allblack.oct' for Direct Daylight Matrix, why is the\n'venetianblind.rad' not assigned a 'black' modifier in the Direct Sun\nCoefficient Matrix calculations ?\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance,\n\n\nAlireza\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011511.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011511", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo"}
