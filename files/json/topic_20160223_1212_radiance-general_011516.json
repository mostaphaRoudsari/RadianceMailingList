Answering the survey takes about 10 minutes and all the answers are kept anonymous. I aim to collect the results in a nice interactive graph, that will be made available online later on.\n\n\nThe link for the survey is:\nhttps://lboro.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/cbdm-workflows-2\nFeel free to pass it on to whoever you think might be interested.\n\n\nFor any question, email me directly at e.brembilla at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:e.brembilla at lboro.ac.uk>.\n\n\nThanks\nEleonora\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011516.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011516", "created_by": "Eleonora_Brembilla"}
