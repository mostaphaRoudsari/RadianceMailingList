I am pretty sure that EnergyPlus\nwill not be able to do it...\n\n\nI know EPlus is capable of dealing with CFS by means of BSDF... but that\nassumes that the CFS is an extra layer in the facade. In my case, you could\nconsider the facade to be just anything.... a moving (ondulated and\nmicroperforated) overhang, a tree, a complex exterior environment, etc.\n\n\nMy plan is to use Daylight Coefficients and use\nSurfaceProperty:SolarIncidentInside object in E+. That is, I want to\npre-calculate the incident solar radiation using Radiance. *Just the\nincident! interreflection will be calculated by EPlus (is that correct?)*\n\n\nI understand this could be done as:\n\n\n   1. Create an office with black walls, floor and ceiling... the exterior\n   and the envelope keep their properties.\n   2. Create a sensor file for each surface... sensors are normal to each\n   surface, pointing inside\n   3. Calculate Daylight Coefficients for each wall\n   1. cat Wall.pts | rfluxmtx [options] -I+ - white_sky.rad scene.rad >\n      Wall.dcmtx\n   4. Calculate irradiance over surface\n      1. cat weather.wea | dctimestep Wall.dcmtx | averageSensors >\n      WallSolarRad.txt\n\n\nNow... I am not sure if this is correct, because what ANDY SHOWED IN 2011\n<http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day3/AM_Radiance_EnergyPlus.pdf>\nis sort of different. He calculated a wird View Matrix.... is that an old\nway of doing this same thing? What am I missing?\n\n\nBest!\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011529.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011529", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
