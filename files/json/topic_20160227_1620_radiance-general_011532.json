The reason for such transformation is\nthe significant impact that calling a \".exe\" file has on the overall\nworkflow using Radiance on Windows in comparison with having to call the\nPerl interpreter and passing the given script's path\n(Radiance/bin/<filename>.pl) every time that a single Perl script has to be\nused on the Windows command line (In particular, Git Bash). However,\nrecently, there has been changes and I have not managed to use the\nopen-source PAR package for Perl to package the Radiance perl scripts into\n.exe format.\n\n\n- I was wondering if it is possible to release a \".exe\" file for each\nRadiance Perl script (corresponding  with the release of each update to a\nscript)?\n\n\n- Otherwise, I would appreciate if you could guide me on alternative\nsolutions to transform Perl scripts to .exe files on Windows.\n\n\n(Other than the open-source PAR package, I have used a trial version of the\ncommercial Active State Perl Development Kit including PerlApp that allows\nyou to make executable file for perl scripts. However, once the trial\nperiod is over, the generated .exe files by the application will no longer\nwork.)\n\n\nThank you very much,\nAlireza\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-February/011532.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011532", "created_by": "Alireza_Hashemloo"}
