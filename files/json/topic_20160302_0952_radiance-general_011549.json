Since I do\nnot have any of those programs, or a WINDOWS machine and is hard for me to\nfind the time for performing these comparisons, I decided to ask for this\nawesome community for help.\n\n\n*Is there anyone who is willing to help me with this? I cannot really pay\nyou for it, but I can guarantee that you will get the require training and\nsupport (remotely, probably).*\n\n\nHERE IS A LINK TO SOME SAMPLE IMAGES\n<https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2NfkTSl19hQYUNZOFliMHp2dXc&usp=sharing>\n\n\nIn any case, you are welcome to download and try and use Groundhog as mucha\nas you want.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n Molina, www.IGD.cl\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011549.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011549", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
