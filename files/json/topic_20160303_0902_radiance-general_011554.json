Version 1.1 can also create view files.\nBinaries are available from my own site. If anyone wants to contribute\nany other platforms, I'll be happy to publish them there as well.\nIn the case of dxf2rad, this would probably first be Darwin on various\ntypes of hardware.\nWith Radout, someone with a more recent Autocad and some experience with\nthe SDK should be able to port it with little effort. I still need\nto update the R15 download on my site to include the ACIS enabled \nversion.\n\n\n\n\n3.\nhttps://github.com/gmischler/RRadout\nLast but not least.\nAs already mentioned for this one, contributions welcome and necessary!\n\n\n\n\nAny further related discussions should probably go to radiance-dev.\n\n\nHave fun!\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011554.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011554", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
