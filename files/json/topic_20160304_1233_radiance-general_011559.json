The story is the following:\n\n\n   1. I already read what Axel Jacobs has to say about Trans, read the\n   Radiance Reference Manual and also Googled a bit.\n   2. After all that, I found out how to model Fabric materials using Trans\n   (I need some uncolored specular transmission and a bit colored Diffuse\n   transmission). After the research, I noticed that Trans, as I wanted to\n   model Fabrics, would only work for gray textiles... but that is good enough\n   for me.\n   3. I managed to do all that, and actually run genBSDF to check if the\n   diffuse and direct parts were OK.... they came very close, but not quite\n   perfect, even if my parameters were pretty high.\n   4. Assuming it was as good as it would get, I continued with my\n   simulation... I am using rcontrib's 2-phase method, with \"-ab 12 -ad 4096\n   -aa 0.1\" parameters... but I get some NOT SMOOTH results. LINK TO PICTURE\n   <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2NfkTSl19hQSF9rbTF4S0tMWXc/view?usp=sharing>\n\n\nAny hints on the parameters I have to use in order to model this product\nwell? Is this caused by the fact that there is no direct light in the\ncalculation of the DC matrix? Will my approach work?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011559.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011559", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
