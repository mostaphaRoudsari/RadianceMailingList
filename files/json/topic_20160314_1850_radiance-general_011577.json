If anyone has done anything similar, or knows of anyone who has, please let me know!\n\n\nThank you,\nClyde\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011577.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011577", "created_by": "Clyde_Wheeler"}
