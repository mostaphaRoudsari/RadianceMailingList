I'd rather treat it as\na kind of rock quarry of concepts and ideas to use when doing it right.\nIt won't interact with any of the build systems though, and maybe it\ndoesn't need to be included in the nightly HEAD downloads either.\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\nPS: Darn, just started snowing again here...\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-March/001501.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001501", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
