It all works quite well. However, I can not fully understand how to use ambient files.\n\n\nQuestion 1: Is there any comprehensive documentation on the topic?\n\n\nQuestion 2: It seems to me that when rtrace is used with ambient files, a higher value of illuminance is calculated than when no ambient files are used. Is there any explanations to that? Which value is more correct?\n\n\nI have put together a simple example that illustates the problem. I attach the files. The run.bat file needs to be run and the result is printed to the file res.txt.\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nGrigori Grozman\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011581.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011581", "created_by": "Grigori_Grozman"}
