Which obviously falsifies the\nresult of the chain.\n\n\nInteresingly, the NREL binary doesn't do that.\nRob mentioned using gcc, so there seems to be a disagreement between\nthe two compilers as to the semantics of writing to stdout on program\ntermination.\n\n\nGoing to have some discussion with the debugger on this one.\nI'd only be too happy if a simple flush() would solve the problem...\n\n\nAh, and first I should probably create a few test cases to cover this\nkind of bug.\n\n\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\n>> I've searched for similar complaints online.
