Then the second term would\ncorrespond to the evalglare output (with simplified image)?\n\n\nI'd appreciate your help.\n\n\nChantal.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-March/000117.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000117", "created_by": "minchaca"}
