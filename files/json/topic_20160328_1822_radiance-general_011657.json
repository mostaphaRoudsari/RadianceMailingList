The\nproblem is the file that is coming out of \"rlam\" doesn't look good, it has\nto much rows, and when i try to run \"rmtxop\" to convert RGB values to\nilluminance values i get the fallowing error:\n\n\nrmtxop: operation failed on 'results/illuminance_RGB/closed_50.dat'\n\n\nAny hint on how to solve this, or a more efective way to do it?\n\n\nBest regards\nHumberto A.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-March/011657.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011657", "created_by": "Humberto_Antunes"}
