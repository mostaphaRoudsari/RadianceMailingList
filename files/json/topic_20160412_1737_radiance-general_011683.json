At the end of it, I was left wondering what languages\npeople are using in their research, engineering, and design practices.\n\n\nMy impression is that Python has become something of a standard in the\nresearch community, with tools like SciPy, NumPy, and SAGE widely\nused, though Perl has a library comparable to NumPy in PDL, and there\nis a SciRuby also, of course, LISP.\n\n\nOn the statistical side there is R and Excel and LibreOffice Calc.\n\n\nThen there is MATLAB, Mathematica, MAPLE, and even Maxima is still around.\n\n\nI suppose we might also have some Visual Basic and C# users around\n\n\nSo who is using what? What do people like?\n\n\nRandolph\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011683.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011683", "created_by": "Randolph_M._Fritz"}
