I am using SketchUp Make 2015 and\nsu2rad_daysim_r03. Unfortunately, the export doesn't work, neither by\ncolour/layer nor by \"daysim\". \n\n\nExports by colour and by layer generate the .rif file and a few directories,\nbut as I try to import it into daysim, the following error message appears:\n\n\n\"Cannot find files:\n\n\n.\\radiance\\medium\n\n\n.\\radiance\\ambfiles\\untitled1.amb\n\n\n.\\1)\"\n\n\nExport by \"daysim\" doesn't work at all. The following error message appears:\n\n\n\"Error reading file: prefs.dat\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the material assignment doesn't work as well. It's impossible to\ndrop the radiance materials over the SketchUp elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan anybody help me? I would really appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeidenmeise\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011698.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011698", "created_by": "Marzena_Husser"}
