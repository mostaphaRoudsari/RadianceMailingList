Apart \nfrom converting the .pic files to .hdr and adding an extra line at 711 \nto remove 'rvu' rather than 'rview' from the viewfile lines the script \nruns on the more updated versions of radiance available today. (Pity it \ndoesn't use rpiece to utilise multiple cores though...)\n\n\n From what I can see radmap uses gensky throughout - therefore the CIE \nstandard sky and horizontal direct irradiance from the weather file.\n\n\nHas anybody done work utilising the Perez sky model (gendaylit) for \nannualised irradiation/illumination mapping or created newer \nmethodologies for annualised mapping?\n\n\nRegards\n*Terrance McMinn*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011706.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011706", "created_by": "Terrance_McMinn"}
