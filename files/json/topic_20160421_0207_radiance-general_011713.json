Whenever I run objpict or objview or rvu, I get the \nsame warning each and every time:\n/rpict/ (or rvu accordingly)/: warning - unknown object type \"ashik2\" /\nThis error repeats no matter what I try to preview, a simple chair or a \nmore complex model.\nThe preview than is/is not produced - I was not able to identify the \ntrigger.\n\n\nI am new to Radiance (and Linux). I got aware of this problem since I \nreinstalled Radiance from the NREL Radiance releases (I did this because \nI realised I was missing some files).\n\n\nIf I do understand it well, ashik2 should be an anisotropic BRDF model, \ndescribing the appearance of a material, and it is a calculation model - \nso \"something built in\".\n\n\nPlease, how do I fix the problem? Can please someone explain what went \nwrong?\n\n\nI also get an X11 error. /\nXIO: fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server \n//\":0.0\"\n\n\n/This was already once discussed on the mailing list, but was not \nsomehow resolved. I have tried to upgrade the graphic card driver, but \nwith no impact. Please, did someone solve this?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nPaul\u00edna\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-April/011713.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011713", "created_by": "Paul\u00edna_\u0160ujanov\u00e1"}
