I am attempting to input a luminance value (cd/m2) into an HDR image with Photosphere software. The ultimate goal is to save a .hdr file to bring into Evalgare.\n\n\nI've used an luminance meter to record the cd/m2 in the room and now I'm trying to pick that same spot on the HDR image and calibrate the luminance within the Apply Menu of Photophere. Trouble is the Apply button is grayed out.\n\n\nHas anyone experienced a similar problem? Any advice would be much appreciated.\n\n\nThank you.
