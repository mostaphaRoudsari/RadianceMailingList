After the \ncritical point is defined you can select the SET ELECTRIC button to \ndefine the dimmed or switched ligthing control. For this, you need to \nimport a photosensor distribution file, that is an archive (.sen). My \nquestion is: where can I find it? How is the format of this distribution \nfile? In the Daysimps-Manual is not specified.\n\n\nThank you for your help.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-April/000120.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000120", "created_by": "Kiko"}
