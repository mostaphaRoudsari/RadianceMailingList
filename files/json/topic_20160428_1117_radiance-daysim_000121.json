Of\n\n\ncourse I can use the dynamic shading model options in daysim to limit the\n\n\nglare as well, whether it is option 1 standard blinds or option 2 the\n\n\ndynamic model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        With that in mind will the work flow work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with your approach is that it does not accurately address the\n\n\nshading devices, which need to close completely across a window group to\n\n\nprevent direct sunlight from striking more than 2% of the work plane\n\n\nanalysis points.  Shading devices must be applied to obtain sDA according to\n\n\nLM-83.  Penn State currently have a new module for DAYIMps that can do this,\n\n\nbut it requires a slightly different header file format that is not 100%\n\n\ncompatible with the GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo correctly calculate sDA with a manual approach like you are trying, you\n\n\ncan determine the direct sunlight values by running the model with the\n\n\nshades up and -ab set to 0.  The points without sunlight will have values of\n\n\nzero.  At any hours when the more than 2% of the points from this \"-ab 0\"\n\n\nrun reach 1000 lux, you apply the data from a full shade run, otherwise you\n\n\nuse the data from an unshaded window.  We are currently finalizing a new\n\n\ninterface to address this and other advanced calculations, but it is\n\n\nprimarily designed to analyze a single space rather than an entire building.\n\n\nWe are also working on a solution for an entire building, but that is\n\n\nperhaps 9 or so months from completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Mistrick\n\n\nAssociate Professor\n\n\nPenn State University\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-April/000121.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000121", "created_by": "Miguel_Corujo"}
