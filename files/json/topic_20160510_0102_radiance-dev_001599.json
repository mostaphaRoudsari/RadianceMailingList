Since they do include the\nexecutables that require those files, that seems slightly suboptimal...\nBut it shouldn't be hard to fix. Just copy over \"ray/lib/meta/*.mta\".\n\n\nI've found a previous mention of the topic here:\nhttp://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-October/011273.html\n\n\n\n\nSome unsorted thoughts on the topic of meta files in general, given that\ndue to the availability of objline.csh/py, and some newer tutorials, \nthey\nwill inevitably get more attention in times to come:\n\n\nA few messages down the above thread, Greg mentions the undocumented(!)\nenvvar \"MLIB\". The first thing running through my mind seeing this was:\n\"This must be the worst possible name for an environment variable, ever\"\n(way to generic).\n\n\nI also never quite understood the point of inventing yet another\nproprietary vector format just for Radiance. Or are such meta files used\nanywhere else that I'm not aware of?\nThey do not seem to be the same as the ISO standardized \"Computer \nGraphics\nMeta Files\" (http://www.fileformat.info/format/cgm/egff.htm), which \nwould\nbe a possible candidate for something like that.\nAnother possible approach would be SVG (or a suitable subset thereof),\nwhich has excellent support libaries available nowadays.\n\n\nOf course, I haven't looked into how much work it would be to use either\nof those (or yet something else), so this basically just amounts to me\nranting at the moment without any real purpose. But I'm still just \ncurious\nwhat the motivation behind this format was (or which format it actually\nis), and what other people are thinking about possible alternatives.\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-May/001599.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001599", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
