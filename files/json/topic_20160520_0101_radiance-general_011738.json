I am generating sky \npatch vectors via genskyvec \u2013m 1 (e.g.). Input is either a sky generated \nby gensky 6 21 12 (e.g.) or gendaylit <lots of options>.\n\n\nNow, my problem is that genskyvec produces different output for these \nsky definition options which is quite a nuisance when trying to \npostprocess the sky vectors. For gensky, the output is a triplet (r g b) \non an individual line per patch, 146 lines in total. For gendaylit, \nhowever, the output is a single line!\n\n\nOf course, I can reorganise the output, somehow. However, I would be \ninterested what I am doing wrong, here.\n\n\nThanks for any ideas!\n\n\nBest\nAchim\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011738.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011738", "created_by": "Achim_Geissler"}
