Is this version perhaps stable enough for distribution?\nOtherwise, what would you use as an alternative if not Photosphere? Has anyone used successfully any other workaround (e.g. an OS X virtual box)?\n\n\nThanks for any ideas!\n\n\nBest,\nKynthia Chamilothori\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-May/011749.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011749", "created_by": "Chamilothori_Kynthia"}
