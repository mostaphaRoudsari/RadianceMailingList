The program seems to do the job, but\nfails on the header, assuming the output is a matrix with 8760 rows (hours).\n\n\n... I wonder if the error is just the header (i.e. change the number of\nrows and go with it) or if gendaymtx is actually doing something wrong\nbecause of the unexpected input.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011786.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011786", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
