In this process, I've encountered some\ndifficulties that I'd appreciate your assistance.\n\n\nI'm mainly using light as primitive type, since I want to figure out the\npossible ray paths between receiver point and artificial light sources.\nHowever the ray paths is not what I\u2019ve expected.\n\n\nIn the testing condition where there is one receiver and one polygon light\nsources directly exposed to each other. The polygon light source is the\nonly light in this scene. The source and receiver are placed in the middle\nof two building blocks. I\u2019m controlling rtrace function with the parameters\n\u2018 \u2013ab\u2019 \u2018 \u2013ad\u2019 \u2018\u2013dj\u2019 \u2018\u2013 ds\u2019 \u2018-st\u2019 \u2018-ss\u2019.\n\n\n1.       No matter what parameters I\u2019ve set for rtrace function, there\u2019s\nonly one ray in the output. Yet, I\u2019m expecting multiple rays emitted from\nthe receiver points to the light source, as described in radiance manual.\n\n\n2.       I\u2019d also like to know what parameters can control reflections\ncharacters of rays. For instance, I want the rays to partly diffuse after\nreflecting on the surface. The desirable condition is: for a bundle of rays\nhitting the surface, 1) 70% of the rays will follow specular reflection,\n30% will be scattered after reflection. 2) for the scattered part, I want\nthem to be reflected within an angle (e.g. 30 degree) to the specular\nreflected ray.\n\n\nCould you suggest me how to achieve the condition of 1 and 2 with radiance?\nIs there any other suggestions on the setting of model or scene?\n\n\n3.       Another question is: acknowledged that the emitted rays are not\nevenly distributed for hemispherical sampling. I'm still wondering if it's\npossible to evenly send rays with radiance.\n\n\nThank you very much with best regards,\n\n\nMengdi Guo\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011801.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011801", "created_by": "Mengdi_Guo"}
