How can I define a Radiance material\n(i.e. plastic, metal, glass, etc.) from an RGB combination and the global\nReflectance (transmittance)? The purpose of this is to enable \"eyedropping\"\na color, and assigning a reflectance or transmittance to it.\n\n\nWhat I initially did was to find the combination of RGB reflectances that\nsatisfied the rho = R*0.265 + 0.67*G + 0.065*B while maintaining the\noriginal proportions of RGB. However, since the RGB color that comes from\nthe eyedropper has Black/White components (which intend to emulate shadows\nand different light exposures), my procedure often ends up returning an R,\nG or B channel that is greater than 1.\n\n\nI guess my question is: Is there any way of reconstructing the R, G and B\nreflectances (or transmittances or whatever) from an RGB pixel? Maybe\nplaying with HSL space or something?\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011803.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011803", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
