I\u00b4ve been looking\nthrough the documentation posted on the web site but its been really\ndifficult for me to understand.\nI was wondering if there's an easier way to do it, since it was really easy\nto do it on R-Y-O.\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nVioleta Escobar Ruiz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011823.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011823", "created_by": "Violeta_Escobar_Ruiz"}
