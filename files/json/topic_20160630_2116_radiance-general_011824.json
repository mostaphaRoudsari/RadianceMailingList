The subject is a dynamic\ntriangle mesh from a computational fluid dynamics simulation of a\nsphere of fluid with a density discontinuity. (Lots of grey\ncylinders.)\n\n\nThe original (2D rendering) video is here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OShSC1VyBi0\n\n\nThe new video (3D-360, for GearVR and other VR HMDs) is in multiple places:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGFMqEKiAGM\nhttps://vimeo.com/173000788\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mark.stock/posts/10153805081796376\n\n\nI'll provide a direct download link for all you Radiance fans, who\nknow how hard this actually was:\nhttp://markjstock.org/vr/MarkStock_SmokeWaterFire_UHDlo_360_TB.mp4\n\n\nThe rendering took 8 months on a 4.4GHz, 8-core Intel Haswell chip.\nEach original frame was 11520x11520 (in HDR, of course), but reduced\nto 3840x3840 for storage, and further reduced to 3840x2160 for\npublishing. In all, almost 1 Terapixel of primary rays were traced.\nThe directory takes up ~600 GB. I used an rcalc/rtrace trick to\ngenerate the 3D-360 frames. The command line for each frame looked\nlike:\n\n\ncnt 11520 11520 | rcalc -f 3d360.cal -e\n\"XD=11520;YD=11520;X=0;Y=0;Z=0;IPD=0.02;EX=0;EZ=0\" | rtrace -ab 2 -aa\n0 -ad 32 -as 0 -dj 0.7 -ds 0.06 -u+ -dv- -x 11520 -y 11520 -n 3 -fac\nscene0695.oct > img_0695temp.pic\n\n\nI attached the 3d360.cal file in case anyone else is interested.\n\n\nHave fun, and good night!\n\n\nMark\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-June/011824.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011824", "created_by": "Mark_Stock"}
