Also, I want to superimpose an image on the monitor such that the light projected through the image is affected by the monitor's beam pattern.\n\n\nI'm running into trouble with my current procedure (INCORRECT IMAGE COLORS -  TOP IMAGE), it produces a monitor image that appears to be color inverted, also the image surface has 0 radiance even though it is applied to a light primitive that has a radiance definition.\n\n\nSee top display image doesn't look like the bottom one, also the top image has no light output: https://s31.postimg.org/8cal8he6j/Monitor_Dif.png\n\n\n******* INCORRECT IMAGE COLORS -  TOP IMAGE ********\nvoid brightdata Monitor_BeamPattern\n5 flatcorr Mockup_Lamp_BeamPattern.dat source.cal src_theta src_phi\n0\n1 1\n\n\nMonitor_BeamPattern colorpict monitor_image2\n9 clip_r clip_g clip_b Image.hdr picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 0.254\n0\n0\n\n\nmonitor_image2 light monitor2_background\n0\n0\n3 10 10 10\n\n\nmonitor2_background polygon monitor_surface2\n0\n0\n12\n0 0 0\n0.444 0 0\n0.444 0.254 0\n0 0.254 0\n\n\n******* CORRECT IMAGE COLORS BUT NO BEAM PATTERN -  BOTTOM IMAGE ********\nvoid colorpict monitor_image3\n9 clip_r clip_g clip_b Image.hdr picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 0.254\n0\n0\n\n\nmonitor_image3 light monitor3_background\n0\n0\n3 10 10 10\n\n\nmonitor3_background polygon monitor_surface3\n0\n0\n12\n0 0 0\n0.444 0 0\n0.444 0.254 0\n0 0.254 0\n\n\nWhy is the top definition, using brightdata, produce a color distorted image, that has no luminance? Advice on modelling a monitor will be much appreciated!\nI originally posted this on the developer forum but received no replies so I posted this on the general forum.\n\n\nThank you for your time,\nAndrei Kolomenski\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011828.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011828", "created_by": "Andrei_Kolomenski"}
