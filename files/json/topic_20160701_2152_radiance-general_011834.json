It has a constant value for each direction below the\nhorizon.\n\n\nIf I consider a surface dA placed 1 m above the ground (assumed flat for\nnow) and pointing downwards, I would measure:\n\n\ng x 2 x Pi [W/m2]\n\n\nThis is assuming that I have used the typical descriptions for the ground\ngeometry as an hemisphere below the horizon and that there are no\nobstructions as these would change the light that is reflected from the\nground.\n\n\nIs this correct?\n\n\nIf it is, then in order to consider grounds with generic surfaces I should\nignore the first value in gendaymtx and use the actual geometry for the\nground.\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\nThanks\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011834.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011834", "created_by": "Ruggiero_Guida"}
