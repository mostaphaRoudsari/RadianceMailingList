What are Eglare_cie and Lveil_cie? if you could explain in simple terms it would be good.\n3. How is the lum_sources calculated? is it area weighted or just the average of luminance sources?\n4.difference between Lveil and Lveil_cie?\n5. what is band_avlum? every time i get -99 as its value.\n6. Why is the last column for each glare source repeated i.e i think its sigma which is repeated? is it on purpose or its a bug?\n\n\nIf you have some documentation which can explain this, that would be very useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks & Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-July/011837.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011837", "created_by": "Raghuram_Kalyanam"}
