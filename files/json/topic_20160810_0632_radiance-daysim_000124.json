My interest\nis to calculate the solar irradiation but I have some queries:\n- What solar irradiance spectrum is measured if I use irradiance sensors\ninstead of illuminance sensors?\n- Could Daysim take into account the SHGC of different window glazing?\n- Is it possible that the glazing system was opaque to the long-wave\nradiation?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\nAbigail\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-August/000124.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000124", "created_by": "Abigail_Chi"}
