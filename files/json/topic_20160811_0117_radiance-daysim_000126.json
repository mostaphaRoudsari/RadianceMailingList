I have the following queries.\n\n\n- I choose a material (in this case a glass) and specify its transmissivity\nas follows:\n\n\n     mod glass id\n        0\n        0\n        3 rtn gtn btn\n\n\nThis defines the way \"visible light\" is transmitted through the glass. I\nthink this is useful when I use illuminance sensors.\nBut, if I use the irradiance sensors, do I need to specify the solar\ntransmittance of the glass instead of the visible transmittance?\n\n\n- What is the way in Daysim to customize all sensor points in the file\n*.pts as irradiance sensors? This last in order to avoid customizing all\nsensors, one by one, in the sensor type column of the Daysim interface.\n\n\n- I am new in Diva-for-Rhino, but I have seen that  it can calculate annual\nirradiation at node locations (radiation maps-grid based). Is this\nequivalent to the calculation of the solar irradiation in Daysim?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nAbigail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Aug 10, 2016 at 9:00 PM, <\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-August/000126.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000126", "created_by": "Abigail_Chi"}
