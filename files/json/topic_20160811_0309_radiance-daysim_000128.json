This last in order to avoid\ncustomizing all sensors, one by one, in the sensor type column of the\nDaysim  interface.\n\n\n- I am new in Diva-for-Rhino, but I have seen that  it can calculate annual\nirradiation at node locations (radiation maps-grid based). Is this\nequivalent to the calculation of the solar irradiation in Daysim?\n\n\nMany thanks\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-August/000128.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000128", "created_by": "Abigail_Chi"}
