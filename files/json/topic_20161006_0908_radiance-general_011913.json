I found this following vwrays and rtrace command sequence to work well to get around this. This is for creating a few renderings of a single static scene (for example electric lighting, or single daylight condition). Of course there would be additional ambient parameters on the command line. So I have two questions in addition to opening this to general critique:\n\n\n1. Has rpeice changed much over the past few years, and would it have any processing speed benefits if I were to try it again?\n2. Would using rcontrib offer any processing speed benefits? (I started that way but then realized I should gain speed using the ambient file for rtrace)\n\n\nExample successful command sequence using 6 processors:\n\n\nview1=\"-x 4096 -y 2160 -vf view1.vf\"\nvwrays -ff $view | rtrace    -w -n 6 -af scene.amb -ffc $(vwrays -d $view) scene.oct > view1.hdr\nvwrays -ff $view | rtrace -i -w -n 6 -af scene.amb -ffc $(vwrays -d $view) scene.oct > view1-i.hdr\n\n\n\n\nThanks for all feedback.\nChris\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011913.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011913", "created_by": "Christopher_Rush"}
