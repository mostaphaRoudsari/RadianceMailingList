I use Canon 5D 2 with a SIGMA fisheye lens. I put a Koda\nneutral density filter 3 between the camera and the lens before taking a\nsky image. However, when I put the filter in, the camera loses aperture\ninformation. When I take the filter out, the camera works normally. I can\nset the aperture size before taking images with filter in, but all the\nimages I take have no aperture information and cannot be applied to hdrgen\nfor combination. Does anyone have the same problem? What is the solution to\nthis problem?\nAny suggestion is appreciated. Thank you,\n\n\n\n\n*Zhe Kong*\n*PhD Student*\n*University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee *\n*School of Architecture and Urban Planning *\n*2131 E.
