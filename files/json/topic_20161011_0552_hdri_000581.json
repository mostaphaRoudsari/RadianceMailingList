Unfortunately the used colorspace of the radiance program is not the CIE-RGB-system. So the displayed luminance values are not correct. We have tryed to change the primary values in the header of the convertet .pic file, but the result of the shown picture and the shown luminance value is not correct. In the below-mentioned diagram i've shown you both used RGB-primary-systems. In the diagram the orange triangle is the CIE-RGB-System and the blue one the radianceused system.  As you can see they do not fit very well.\nCould you please tell me, which primarysystem is used for radiance? Do you have an idea how we can make our measurementfile with the radiance program compartible?\n\n\nsincerely<http://dict.leo.org/ende/index_de.html#/search=sincerely&searchLoc=0&resultOrder=basic&multiwordShowSingle=on&pos=0> yours<http://dict.leo.org/ende/index_de.html#/search=yours&searchLoc=0&resultOrder=basic&multiwordShowSingle=on&pos=0>\nDipl. -Ing.
