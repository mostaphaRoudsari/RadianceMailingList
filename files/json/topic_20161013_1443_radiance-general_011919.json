I saved the file as\ndctimestep and use $chmod a=r+w+x dctimestep, I got the errors as below:\n\n\n/Users/zhekong/Radiance/usr/local/radiance/bin/dctimestep: line 2: static:\ncommand not found\n\n\n/Users/zhekong/Radiance/usr/local/radiance/bin/dctimestep: line 4:\n/Applications: is a directory\n\n\n/Users/zhekong/Radiance/usr/local/radiance/bin/dctimestep: line 5:\napply_overcast.bash: command not found\n\n\n/Users/zhekong/Radiance/usr/local/radiance/bin/dctimestep: line 6:\napply_overcast.bash: command not found\n\n\n/Users/zhekong/Radiance/usr/local/radiance/bin/dctimestep: line 7:\napply_overcast.bash: command not found\n\n\n/Users/zhekong/Radiance/usr/local/radiance/bin/dctimestep: line 8: data/:\nis a directory\n\n\nand so on. The list is a bit long to include all. I don't think I install\nit right. Could someone let me know how to replace dctimestep correctly, if\nthis is the problem, or what is the solution to make this step work?\n\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n\n\n\nZhe Kong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhe Kong\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011919.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011919", "created_by": "Zhe_Kong"}
