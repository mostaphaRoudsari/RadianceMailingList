Alstan mentioned it to me and I could \nreproduce that problem in my windows-7 64-bit-VirtualMachine.\n\n\nI have no idea why, maybe it is a 32/64bit issue (in one of the crash \nfiles I could see an entry \"kernel32.dll\", although I have a 64bit \ninstallation. But I'm not familiar at all with windows...\n\n\nI also have a stand-alone version, compiled with mingw (32bit). I could \nprovide that to you for an easy-fix in the installer, but this does not \nsolve the problem. Let me know, what I could do to fix that.\n\n\nI also tested quickly the linux-installer-binary version and this works \nproperly, but it is actually 25% slower than the one I have compiled \ndirectly on my machine...\n\n\nthx!\n\n\nbest\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
