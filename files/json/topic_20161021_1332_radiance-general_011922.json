I need to put Daysim on a Linux workstation.\n\n\nI cannot find source code for Daysim anywhere.  The Daysim website suggests it is bundled with the Windows executable, but all I get are .msi and .exe files for the Daysim and Daysim Legacy (respectively).\n\n\nMany Thanks,\n\n\nNeal\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011922.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011922", "created_by": "Neal_Lewislighting"}
