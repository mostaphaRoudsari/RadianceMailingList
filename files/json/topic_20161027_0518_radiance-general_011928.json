I would like to use the \ntensor tree preview, but however I am not sure whether it is worth the \ncollective effort. So maybe, please, if you could send me the version \nonly with klems, I would be thankful.\n\n\nOtherwise to answer:\n\n\n1. I did check the /usr/lib/liBSDF.so - its there.\n\n\n2. I have added the -fPIC flags (that is also what Andre has written), \nbut no changes.\n\n\n3. I do run everything as root.\n\n\n4. I have tried to install it on a different computer just to be sure \n(same system Ubuntu, java development environment installed, with and \nwithout -fPIC), but with the same outcome - g++: error: libBSDF.so: No \nsuch file or directory\n\n\nHmm, I do not know what more to do. So if you have any other ideas I \nwould be thankful.\nThanks for all the help.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\nPaul\u00edna\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011928.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011928", "created_by": "Paul\u00edna_\u0160ujanov\u00e1"}
