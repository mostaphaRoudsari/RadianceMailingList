So far I have included\nthe new type in image.c and included a reference in view.h. However, the\ncompilation is still not working for rpict. I wonder if that could be due\nto the modifications I've made (I have already corrected a couple of small\nerrors) or because I would need to modify also other files. Basically, what\nI am asking is what files should be considered in order to include an\nalternative view type for rpict and vwrays.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nVictor Lopez-Rioboo Gil\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011934.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011934", "created_by": "goodriver_laurus"}
