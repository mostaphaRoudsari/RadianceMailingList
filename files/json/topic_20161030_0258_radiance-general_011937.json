I wonder if more information could\nbe included:\n\n\n- How to replay: I've noticed that sometimes a topic creates a tree of\nreplies, but sometimes the topic is branched out.  Should I include Re: at\nthe beginning? What if I replay to another reply? Should it be Re: Re:?\nShould I copy paste the entire message or just my reply? Should the name in\nparentheses be changed when replying?\n\n\n- Attachments: Can/should attachements be included? If so, how should it be\ndone? An image should be attached or included in the body of the text?\n\n\nSorry if the topic has been answered before. I remember seeing something\nsomewhere, but I cannot find it anymore.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nVictor\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-October/011937.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011937", "created_by": "Victor_LRG"}
