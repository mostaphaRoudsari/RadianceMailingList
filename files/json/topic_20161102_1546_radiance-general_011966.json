I have been using DIVA for Rhino/Grasshopper  but as far as I'm aware this is incapable of forward ray tracing to predict critical locations. Also as I am interested in reflected light primarily from the building being investigated at the locations of interest (rail corridor),  any glare studies I run at these locations do not provide the results I am after. As light direct from the sun is included in the results.\n\n\nI'd appreciate any help in advice or in directing me to applicable Radiance docs.\n\n\nI'm new to Radiance but have programming experience.\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nTom\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-November/011966.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011966", "created_by": "Tom_Moyle"}
