David Geisler-Moroder and Christian Knoflach discovered an issue with the solid angle correction in genBSDF (actually in wrapBSDF) that was introduced back in spring of 2015.\n\n\nThis issue has been corrected in the latest HEAD, but we have not made an official release yet with the updated version.  If you are relying on genBSDF or any XML files generated by it with the Klems distribution, you should probably regenerate them using the latest HEAD version.\n\n\nThis problem does not affect tensor tree XML files generated by genBSDF, nor Klems files created using bsdf2klems.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-November/011965.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011965", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
