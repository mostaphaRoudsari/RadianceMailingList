Additionally, I found some command is in perl formal, not in exe format.\nCan anyone tell me why some command is writtern by perl file?\nAnd also are there any document how I can use these perl file through command prompt?(ex. What is the argument etc)\n\n\nThank you.\nRegards,\nKatsuya\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup  business\nsystems are scanned for acceptability of content and viruses\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-November/011971.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011971", "created_by": "Katsuya_Obara"}
