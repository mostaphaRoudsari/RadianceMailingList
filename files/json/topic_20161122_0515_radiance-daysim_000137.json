My interest\nis to compare the different methods for calculating contributions from\ndirect sunliight. I have seen that Daysim give three options to calculate\ndaylight coefficients as follows:\n1. Use original daylight coefficients file format\n2. Use DDS file format\n3. Use DDS file format with shadow testing\n\n\nMy query is\n- Which is the way to calculate the direct luminances with the assignment\nmode of 'Nearest Neighbor (NN)'?\nThanks in advance\n\n\nAbigail Chi\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2016-November/000137.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000137", "created_by": "Abigail_Chi"}
