I want to start a discussion.\n\n\nAs a small group of you may know, I am the developer of a Radiance-based\nlighting tool. This tool has the purpose of taking the state-of-the-art\ndaylighting calculation methods and practices to industry. However, since\nindustry sometimes just jump over a software, I am always worried about\nmethods and tool being used incorrectly.\n\n\nIn this last regard, I have been wondering for a while whether I should add\nglare calculation capabilities or not. My impression is that they are\nincredibly easy to misuse. For example, at the NREL's 12th Radiance\nWorkshop, Jan Wienold and Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg made Glare-oriented\npresentations that did not really agree much.\n\n\nSo, my question is: are glare indices, such as UGR, DGP, etc. etc. ready\nfor use? Maybe only the Electric Lighting ones are ready? How about the\nDaylighting ones? I do not want to offer something that looks like a magic\nblack-box, but which leads to incorrect results. I also know that having\nsomething is better than nothing, but that only works as long as that\n\"something\" helps guiding the design in the right direction.\n\n\nThanks very much in advance.\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/011989.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011989", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
