I want to calculate average luminance value of the masked HDR\npicture without taking zeroed values into account. I am using \u2018pvalue \u2013o \u2013d\n\u2013h \u2013b \u2013H masked.hdr | rcalc \u2013e if\u2019cond=$1-5;$1=$1\u2019| total \u2013m\u2019. But the \u2018if\ncondition\u2019 is not working. Your help is very much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nParisa\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2016-December/011998.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_011998", "created_by": "parisa_khademagha"}
