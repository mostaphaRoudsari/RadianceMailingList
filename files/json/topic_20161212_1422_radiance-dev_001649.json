I \ntherefore thought that downloading and installing the \nradiance-5.0.a.12-Linux.tar.gz archive is the quickest option for her to \nget all the latest additions and bug fixes.\n\n\nSo I went to\nhttps://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases and downloaded the 5.0.a.12 \ntar ball, which was released 3 Oct, which would suggest that it comes\n\n\n- with the latest evalglare (2 Aug 2016)\nhttp://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/util/evalglare.c?view=log&pathrev=MAIN\n- with the latest getinfo (30 Aug)\nhttp://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/util/getinfo.c?view=log&pathrev=MAIN\n\n\nIt turns out that the latest file in the entire tar ball is from 27 \nApril 2016:\n\n\nfind -type f -printf '%TY%Tm%Td-%TH%TM %p\\n' |sort -r -n |head\n20160427-2350 ./NREL_ver.txt\n20160427-2350 ./lib/vchars.mta\n20160427-2350 ./lib/symbols.mta\n20160427-2350 ./bin/libtiff.so.5\n20160427-2349 ./bin/rvu\n...\n\n\nand does not even contain the new fisheye_corr.cal which was added to \nRadiance 30 Aug 2015\n\n\nhttp://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/cal/cal/fisheye_corr.cal?view=log&pathrev=MAIN\n\n\nIs there an issue with the build system for LINUX?  Within the source \ncode Zip file on the NREL release page, all files are time stamped 3 Oct.\n\n\nThank you for looking into this\n\n\nCheers\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-December/001649.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001649", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
