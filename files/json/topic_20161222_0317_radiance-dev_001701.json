The compilation finished\nwith no errors (although some 1700 warnings), but when I am trying a simple\ntest I get the following error with ovonv: fatal - (!xform\nobjects/cage_sphere2.rad): bad arguments for polygon \"311s1m134f\". This\nobject has the following description, which seems right to me:\n\n\ncage_sphere polygon 311s1m134f\n0\n0\n9 -0.833925170898 0.506038208008 0.096073600769\n   -0.819481933594 0.473128112793 0.0903565139771\n   -0.853187255859 0.492587890625 0.0980178833008\n\n\nIn VS I can see the following warnings regarding oconv and xform:\n\n\nC4273 'erf': inconsistent dll linkage\nC4273 'erfc': inconsistent dll linkage\n\n\nThey both refer to rtmath.h file, which I guess they should refer to erf.c\nas well? Actually, this warning also appears for most projects. I've\ncompiled and used the same package in linux before with no problem.\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nVictor Lopez-Rioboo Gil\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2016-December/001701.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001701", "created_by": "Victor_LRG"}
