When those sources are reflected however, the reflection shows the output as if -ds isn't set, like this:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6lddahgf716yzip/reflection.JPG?dl=0\n\n\nIs there a way to force direct sampling into reflected sources? Or perhaps something else is going on I'm confused by... Thanks for any tips!\n\n\nMM\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012010.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012010", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez"}
