Since I use\nSIGMA 8mm 1:3.5 for Canon, I need to convert equisolid-angular to\nequiangular project. I see very useful information from the post below:\n\n\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org:447/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011184.html\n\n\nHowever, I still have some questions need to figure out.\n1) pinterp does not include equisolid-angular projection, so a equation\nneeds to be applied to the function. Greg mentioned this simple expression,\nsin(theta)/theta, but I am still confused. Could anyone offer me the\ncommand?\n\n\n2) The post discussed the steps of processing HDR images. If I get it\nright, the steps following \"adjust exposure\" are vignetting correction,\nadding view information, converting project from equisolidangular to\nequiangular, then calibrating the image. I use a GOSSEN Starlite 2 to\nrecord the luminance value on a grey card for calibration. My question is,\nshould I calibrate the image before or after converting fisheye projection?\n\n\nAny suggestions or explanation would be appreciated.\n\n\nZhe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-January/000589.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000589", "created_by": "Zhe_Kong"}
