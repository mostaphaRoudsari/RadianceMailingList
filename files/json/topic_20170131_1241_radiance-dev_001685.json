As far as I can tell, genBSDF still works. The output looks\nreasonable, anyways. Can someone confirm that the warning is benign or\nsuggest a way to fix it?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nNathaniel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-January/001685.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001685", "created_by": "Nathaniel_Jones"}
