I hope to use radiance to model daylight on exterior\nsurfaces. The geometry I work with are DEMs typically coming in raster\n(geotiff) format.\n\n\nCan anyone suggest a most efficient (or path of least resistance) workflow\nto translate the DEMs into Radiance scene description file?\n\n\nI can convert the raster DEM into one of the many vectorized mesh-based\nformats (i.e., some type of CAD format); but am hoping the community may\nhave some insight here to help narrow this down for me (best CAD file\ntype). It seems a triangle-mesh file would be ideal; wonder if there is\nsoftware that export this file type?\n\n\nAny advice, references to plug-ins or tips would be most appreciated!\n\n\nSincerely,\nIan\n\n\n\n\n*I A N  S E I F E R L I N G *PhD\nianseifs at mit.edu\nPostdoctoral Fellow | MIT Senseable City Laboratory\n<http://senseable.mit.edu>\n\n\n77 Massachusetts Avenue 9-209\nCambridge, MA 02139 USA\nianseiferling.com <http://www.ianseiferling.com/>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-January/012028.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012028", "created_by": "Ian_Seiferling"}
