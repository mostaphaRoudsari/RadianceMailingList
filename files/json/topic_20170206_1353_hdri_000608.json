I am trying to calculate CCT of each light source based on RGB extracted. But I am not sure how wide an HDR image can cover the differences between white color, like cool white and warm, based on RGB. I also illustrate them on chart to see how RGB values are acting for different light sources. As shown in the following:\n[cid:image005.jpg at 01D28091.23CDF880] [cid:image006.jpg at 01D28091.23CDF880]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my question is : 1)is HDR able to give me the difference between white colors (different CCT) based on RGB value ?( or would I be able to extract CCT from an HDR image ?)\n2) when the light source is getting cooler, R values getting slightly lower. Is this point of view acceptable here ? B and G value are almost the same. Is there a reason for that ?\nThank you very much !\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-February/000608.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000608", "created_by": "Seyedeh_Farzaneh_Mahlab"}
