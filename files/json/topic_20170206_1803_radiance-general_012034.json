The system is made up of small units which are doubly curved,\ngradated (depending on orientation to the sun), and symmetrical on one\naxis. I am unsure if the MGF format is able to model that type of\ngeometry, so it would be helpful to understand how to model geometry to\ninput into the genBSDF command. Let me know if I need to clarify or\nprovide more information. I'm relatively new at this, and any help would\nbe appreciated!  \n\n\nThank you in advance,\n\n\nStephanie Truong\nDOSU | studio architecture\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-February/012034.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012034", "created_by": "Stephanie_Truong"}
