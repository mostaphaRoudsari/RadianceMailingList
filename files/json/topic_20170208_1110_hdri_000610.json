I then use hdrgen with the response curves I defined previously to generate HDR images from these LDR images. I calibrate the HDR images for the vignetting effect and the distortion (equisolid to equidistant projection). Finally, I apply a calibration factor of around 1.39.\n\n\nWhen comparing the vertical illuminance and luminance values of the HDR images with the real measures I took (Minolta LS-110 luminancemeter and Hagner EC1-X luxmeter), I noticed that the HDR images are underestimating the illuminance (e.g. 1217lux instead of 1993lux) and the high luminance values (e.g. 208 cd/m\u00b2 instead of 402.3cd/m\u00b2). I determined the illuminance value of an HDR with Evalglare -V and the luminance values with ximage in Radiance.\n\n\nI also tried only applying default hdrgen (+cropping & header modification to set the VIEW to vta to use in Evalglare) but I still got big differences between the HDR-derived and the measured luminance and illuminance values.\n\n\nIs somebody using the same instruments I am? If yes, do you also happen to have this issue? Or does anybody have already encounter this problem?\n\n\nThank you for your insights !\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nClotilde\n\n\n[Test]\n\n\nClotilde Pierson\nFNRS PhD Fellow | Arch.
