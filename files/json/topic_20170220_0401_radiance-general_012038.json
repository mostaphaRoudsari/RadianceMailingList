My\nscene contains some 6,000 artificial light sources.\n\n\nThe question I have is this:  Is there something within rtrace/mkillum\nthat is not multi-threaded that is run before the actual ray tracing\npart starts (which does honour the -n option)?  I could think of some\nlight source visibility or intensity test that need to be done before\nthe actual ray tracing.\n\n\nMany thanks for your thoughts\n\n\nBest regards\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-February/012038.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012038", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
