{"topic": "Question about the overall correction factor for raw2hdr", "category": "hdri", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Zhe Kong", "created_at": "February 27, 2017 at 01:25PM", "body": "Dear all:\nSorry to bring up this topic again, but I run into the same issue Coltide\nhas (Coltide's original post is here: http://radiance-online.org/\ncommunity/mailing-lists/archives/hdri). I also use Canon 5D 2 with\nSIMGA Fisheye lens 8mm f/3.5. I want to figure out the -C factor when using\nraw2hdr to combine LDR images. I took the images (f/11) under different\ncircumstances: two HDR images were taken along a side window, two\nimages were taken under electric lighting condition, and the last one were\ntaken far away from a glazing. For each scene, 12 images were taken and\nassembled. The luminance values from the HDR images and the lighting meter\nare below (cd/m2):\nSide window: 123.0(HDR) 225.0(measurement) 1.83(-C factor)\nSide window: 101.0(HDR) 195.4(measurement) 1.93(-C factor)\nElectric light: 1.9(HDR) 3.3(measurement) 1.74(-C factor)\nElectric light: 1.4(HDR)   2.6(measurement) 1.79(-C factor)\nAway from glazing: 9.8(HDR) 18.5(measurement) 1.88(-C factor)\n\n\nQuestions:\n1) I can average the results (1.84) as the correction factor, but is it\ncorrect? Some values have great difference (1.74 VS 1.93).\n2) I notice that I use the same model as Coltide, however, our results are\nvery different. Is this normal? (The production of each camera and lens\ncannot be exactly the same?)\n3) Does lighting source influence the accuracy of the factor? Focusing on\ndaylighting data collection, should I take images under consistent electric\nlighting conditions or daylighting conditions? (Daylighting conditions have\ndynamic changes, but electric situations offer lower results.)\n\n\nAny suggestion or comment is appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Zhe Kong*\n*PhD Student*\n*University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee *\n*School of Architecture and Urban Planning *\n*2131 E.
