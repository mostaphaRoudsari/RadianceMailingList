To evaluate whether glare occurs or not, we \nneed the luminance of the reflection on the surface the PV panel \nreflects light on. However we only get the illuminance of the sun (light \nsource). How can we translate the illuminance from the sun to the \nluminance of the surface? There has to be a way since we can get the \nluminance via simulations, however we are interested in a way to \ncalculate the luminance. We also have to take into account that PV \npanels are neither perfectly specular nor perfectly diffuse.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nErik Hjorth and Florian Wochele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012053.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012053", "created_by": "Florian_Wochele"}
