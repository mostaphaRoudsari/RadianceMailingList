Multiplying the\nabove directional transmittance to the radiance value along each ray gives\nthe correct result which is inline with the report.\nBut for some reasons I cannot get same from Radiance. I have set the\ntransmissivity\nof the glass to 1 but am not sure what value should I use here?\nIn other words if I want to scale the radiance along a ray by the above\nformula only, how should I define the glazing?\n\n\n\n\nThe window rectangle is defined as two triangles\n\n\nvoid brightfunc bf\n2 val gtrans.cal\n0\n0\nvoid glass Glass1\n0\n0\n3 1 1 1\n\n\nGlass1 polygon triangle1\n0\n0\n9 (3 coordinates here..)\nGlass1 polygon triangle2\n0\n0\n9 (3 coordinates here..)\n\n\nThe \"gtrans.cal\" file is defined as below based on the formula given on the\nabove link:\ncosine =  Dx * Nx + Dy * Ny + Dz * Nz;\nval = -.028378 + (3.156075 * cosine) - (3.058376 * cosine * cosine) -\n(1.428919 * cosine * cosine * cosine) + (4.014235 * cosine * cosine *\ncosine * cosine) - (1.775827 * cosine * cosine * cosine * cosine * cosine);\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAli Fatoorechi\nMBS Survey Software Ltd\n\n\n*62 High Street*\n\n\n\n\n*SteyningWest SussexBN44 3RD*\n\n\n*T +44 (0)1903 879323M +44(0)7830751409*\nali at surveymbs.com\nwww.surveymbs.com\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012057.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012057", "created_by": "Ali_Fatoorechi"}
