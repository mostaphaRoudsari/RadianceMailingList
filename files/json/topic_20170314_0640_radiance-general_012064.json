Hopefully this is the right mailing\nlist to ask. \nCan DGP be calculated for a -vta fish-eye photo capture that has a view\nangle of 172 degrees? The manual says that Evalglare can be run for an image\ncut horizontally given an externally measured vertical eye illuminance and Y\nmax and Y min coordinates but does not mention the possibility of using an\nimage that is also cut vertically, or shall I say, all around.\nThank you for your help.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\n\nRaquel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaquel Viula\n\n\nPhD candidate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTU Delft | Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment |\n\n\nArchitectural Engineering and Technology\n\n\nJulianalaan 134, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands | P.O.
