I am implementing some simulation methods within\nGroundhog, and I am intending to use the -5 option in gendaymtx. However, I\nsee that it does not exist in genskyvec.\n\n\nDoes it make sense to include it? I might include it in my Ruby version,\nbut I am not sure it makes sense since it is not implemented in the\noriginal genskyvec.\n\n\nIf it does make sense... how does that work? any hints?\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-March/001687.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001687", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
