I obtain very low radiation values (from 30% to 50% of radiation loss).\n\n\n\n\nDoes this loss seem unreal as a result?\n\n\nDo you think that \"trans\" material is the right choice for the\npolycarbonate? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny suggestion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErika\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012076.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012076", "created_by": "Erika_Saretta"}
