Since the wxfalsecolour.exe can show me the \nextremes I assume the information is somehow saved in the file.\nHowever now I am searching for a command which is giving me the maximum \nluminance value as a number, so not in the picture itself.\n\n\nThe goal is to have a list of all the maximum values of a series of \nimage-based simulations for all the hours of the year - so a manual \nsolution is not an option for us. Since the point of the highest \nluminance is also changing by time we can't just use the same \ncoordinates for each picture.\n\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n\nKind regards,\nFlorian Wochele\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012074.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012074", "created_by": "Florian_Wochele"}
