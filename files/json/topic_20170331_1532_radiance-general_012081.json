I guess it can be done\nmanipulating the source code, but I cannot think of a simple way.\n\n\nPerhaps it could be done inverting the initial ray, measuring the luminance\nof the surface by using a lambertian white material with an altitude\nmodifier, and calculating then the illuminance, but it is a bit convoluted\nand the white material may distort too much the real lighting levels in the\nscene.\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nVictor Lopez-Rioboo Gil\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-March/012081.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012081", "created_by": "Victor_LRG"}
