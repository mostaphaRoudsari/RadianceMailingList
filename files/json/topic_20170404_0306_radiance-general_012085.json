I am looking at the process of\nconverting EPW files to WEA files.\n\n\nI am trying to understand the meaning of the minute field in an EPW file.\n\n\nI read in\nhttp://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008968.html\nthat the minutes field does not relate to '*the time when the measurement\nwas recorded, but to the **recording interval'.*\n\n\nThe EPW Data Dictionary (\nhttp://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html#field-minute)\nis not useful for understanding the meaning of the minutes field, as it\nsimply says:\n\n\n* Field: Hour - This is the hour of the data. (1 - 24). Hour 1 is 00:01 to\n01:00. Cannot be missing.\n\n\n* Field: Minute - This is the minute field. (1..60)\n\n\nIf I take the EPW file for Gatwick Airport in London (\nhttps://energyplus.net/weather-location/europe_wmo_region_6/GBR//GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC)\nI see that its minute fields are set to 60 (hours and minutes in bold):\n\n\n...\n\n\nDATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31\n\n\n1991,1,1,*1,60*,...\n\n\n1991,1,1,*2,60*,...\n\n\n...\n\n\nIf instead I take the TMY3-based EPW file for Central Park in New York (\nhttps://energyplus.net/weather-location/north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/USA/NY/USA_NY_New.York-Central.Park.725033_TMY3),\nI see that its minute fields are set to 0 :\n\n\n...\n\n\nDATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31\n\n\n1976,1,1,*1,0*,...\n\n\n1976,1,1,*2,0*,...\n\n\n...\n\n\nYet if I take the TMY2-based EPW file for Central Park in New York (\nhttps://energyplus.net/weather-location/north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/USA/NY/USA_NY_New.York.City-Central.Park.744860_TMY2),\nI see that its minute fields are set to 0:\n\n\n...\n\n\nDATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31\n\n\n1976,1,1,*1,60*,...\n\n\n1976,1,1,*2,60*,...\n\n\n...\n\n\nCan someone please explain in simple terms what the meaning is of the\nminutes field?\n\n\nWhy is there a difference in the value of the minutes fields in the\nIWEC-based EPW file for Gatwick (value is 0) and in the TMY3-based EPW file\nfor Central Park (value is 60)? What is the minutes field telling me about\nthe data?\n\n\nWhy is there a difference in the value of the minutes fields in the EPW\nfile for Central Park depending on whether it is TMY2-based (in which case\nthe value is 60) or TMY3 based (in which case the value is 0)?\n\n\nThank you in advance for your help,\n\n\nPhilip Schwarz\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012085.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012085", "created_by": "Philip_Schwarz"}
