I am not sure if this is supported on Windows?\nAlso breaking the points in chunks and running separate rtrace processes\ndidn't seem to speed it up much.\nI don't go mad with -a numbers but the time tends to increase, sometimes up\nto an hour for a room on complex models.\n\n\n- I tried mkillum to increase the speed/accuracy but as the model is all\ntriangles I get the \"aiming failure\" error messages,\n and it was mentioned in another post that triangles are poor choice for\nlight sources(due to the way Radiance samples\ndirect lighting.) I guess mkillum may not be advised in this case? also the\ncalc time increases linearly with with more illums in the model.\n\n\n- rtrace with interpolation switched off, seems to be pretty quick. but as\nit is blind monte carlo there is a concern on accuracy on\ndirect lighting I guess(unless using high -ad). I have seen the window\nglazing defined as glow in three phase method(and later to use genbsdf for\nT).\nI am not quite familiar but if glow material is part of the direct\nlighting, would this make it a better approach than pure MC?\n\n\nthanks and apology for this long post,\nAli\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012091.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012091", "created_by": "Ali_Fatoorechi"}
