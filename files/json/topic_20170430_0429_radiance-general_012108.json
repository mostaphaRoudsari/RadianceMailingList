My\nproblem is that, due to the extreme low contrast between the text and the\nb(l)ackground, I do have more and more difficulties to read the website.\nFor example pages like this one:\nhttps://radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages\nare hardly readable for me.\nI asume that I have to ask Andy to please consider to edit the text colors\nof the site to give the text a higher contrast with the background. After\nall this is a lighting program and lighting is all about the right contrast.\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\nLaurens Zonneveldt\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-April/012108.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012108", "created_by": "laurens_zonneveldt"}
