I'm working with -aa 0 renderings, and having a tough time smoothing things out.\n\n\nIn this example,<https://www.dropbox.com/s/fr23tpnv5uqlhxg/clear_section.jpg?dl=0> the diffuse bit of sky component directly below the skylight has subtle ripples of darkness in the pool of light, and also in the bright ceiling above the patch of direct sun...\n\n\nWith a trans material in the skylight<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptco2powrlhy48x/diffuse_section.jpg?dl=0>, the pattern is even more noticeable, and you can see it mapped onto the walls of the scene as well...\n\n\nSettings for these runs (which are oversampled x12):\n-dp 4096 -ms .14 -ds .1 -dj .9 -dt .05 -dr 3 -ss 16 -st .01 -ab 3 -av 0 0 0 -ar 0 -ad 64 -as 0 -aa 0 -ps 1 -pt .04 -lr 12 -lw 1e-5\n\n\nThings I've tried with no luck:\n- big and small -ar values;  300, 800, 3000 (I recall an old tip from Mark Stock to crank -ar with -aa 0 to get rid of halos?)\n- various -ad settings (16, 32 64, 200) while keeping -as 0\n-turned on -as with -ad 64 and -as 32\n- tried a negative value for -lr\n- tried making -lw super small; 1e-10\n\n\nI'm using the rad program to turn on penumbras - maybe there's something in the -dx, -sx, or -px settings I'm unaware of?\n\n\nMany thanks for any ideas...\n\n\nMM\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012110.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012110", "created_by": "Michael_Martinez"}
