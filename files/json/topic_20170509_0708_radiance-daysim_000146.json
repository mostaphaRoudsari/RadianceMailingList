{"topic": "gen_dc completes, but shows zero values at all sesnor points", "category": "radiance-daysim", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Kerger Truesdell", "created_at": "May 09, 2017 at 07:08AM", "body": "Hi all,\n\n\nThank you in advance for any input you can share.\n\n\nPROBLEM:\nI cannot generate daylight coefficients using gen_dc. The program *does *seem\nto complete successfully, creating the following files in the process:\n- direct_radiance_file.tmp.rad\n- skyPatches.rad\n- static_system.dif.dc\n- static_system.dir.dc\n- DC.dc\n\n\nCuriously, the .dc files show zero for every sensor point! It's as if rays\nwere traced from the sensors and found no light.\n\n\nThis would make sense in a closed box, but my geometry has a large\nsouth-facing window (I'm confident in the geometry definition, the\nmaterials definition, and the sky model).\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS / EXCEPTIONS\nThere were three occurrences where I DID manage to generate daylight\ncoefficients:\n1. When I removed the roof. Oddly, this returned direct daylight\ncoefficients but not diffuse coefficients. I would expect to have seen\ndirect and sky diffuse represented, possibly even ground diffuse.\n2. When I changed the roof material to glass. This, too, only returned\ndirect coefficients.\n3. When I changed my limit reflections parameter (-lr) to >/= 1. This\nreturned both direct and diffuse coefficients.\n\n\nBEST GUESS\nAt this point, my best guess is that rtrace_dc is somehow failing as a\nresult of my -lr setting (i.e. when it's set below 1). Is that possible, or\nwould I receive an error message?\n\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nWindows 10 (Intel Core i7-4600U CPU, 8GB RAM)\nDaysim 4.0 is installed\nRadiance is also installed on my machine\nPATH and RAYPATH are properly setup\n\n\nThank you again for any input you can provide!\n\n\n#####################\n# project information\n#####################\nproject_name Project\nproject_directory C:\\Desktop\\genDCtest\\\ntmp_directory C:\\Desktop\\genDCtest\\tmp\\\nbin_directory C:\\DAYSIM\\bin\\\n\n\n##################\n# site information\n##################\nplace Default\nlatitude 38.1074198\nlongitude 122.56970319999999\ntime_zone 120.0\nsite_elevation 120.0\nground_reflectance 0.2\nwea_data_file weather.wea\nwea_data_file_units 1\nfirst_weekday 1\ntime_step 60\nwea_data_short_file weather.wea\nwea_data_short_file_units 1\nlower_direct_threshold 2\nlower_diffuse_threshold 2\noutput_units 2\n\n\n######################\n# building information\n######################\nmaterial_file material.rad\ngeometry_file geometry.rad\nsensor_file points.pts\nshading 1\nstatic_system \\res\\DC.dc \\res\\ILL.ill\ndaylight_factor \\res\\DF.df\nviewpoint_file no_DGP_view_file_provided\nDC_file_format Daysim_original\n\n\n#####################\n# RADIANCE parameters\n#####################\nab 0\nad 256\nas 256\nar 32\naa 0.25\nlr 0\nst 1.0\nsj 0.7\nlw 0.05\ndj 0.7\nds 0.0\ndr 0\ndp 32\ndc 0.0\npt 0.15\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-May/000146.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000146", "created_by": "Kerger_Truesdell"}
