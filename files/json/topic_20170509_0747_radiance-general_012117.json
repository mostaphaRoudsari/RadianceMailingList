The mailer can't really handle it.\n\n\nAlso, might I suggest posting this to Unmet Hours <https://unmethours.com/questions/> instead?  The community there is more up on OpenStudio than the general mailing list, and your initial question lacks the appropriate detail needed for a good response.  Unmet Hours offers the opportunity for comments, feedback, and editing of posts.\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012117.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012117", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
