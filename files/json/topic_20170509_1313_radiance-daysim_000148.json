But if it's not -ab and not -lr, what\nelse *might* it be? I can run some experiments if you or anyone has a guess.\n\n\nThank you again for your help!\n\n\nKerger\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, May 9, 2017 at 3:00 PM, <radiance-daysim-request at radiance-online.org\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-daysim/2017-May/000148.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-daysim_000148", "created_by": "Kerger_Truesdell"}
