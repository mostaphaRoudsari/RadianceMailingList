Since I am working with the\nouptuts of RFLUXMTX, I am using RMTXOP.\n\n\nSince I have to do this lots of times, I designed my scripts so they are\nefficient. Accordingly, avoiding matrix multiplication was a priority... so\nI rearranged the equation:\n\n\nResults = DC1*sky + DC2*sky + DC3*sky + DC3*sky\n\n\ninto\n\n\nResults = (DC1+DC2+DC3+DC4)*sky\n\n\nI thought the latter one would be much faster... but it takes double the\ntime! Is there any reason for that? I am somehow surprised since, I\nunderstand, matrix multiplication is a O(n^3) algorithm while adding is a\nO(n^2) one.\n\n\nThe DC matrices are the contribution from different windows to the\nworkplane (using the 3-phase method... VTD) and the sky is a vector, not a\nmatrix.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGerm\u00e1n\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-May/001689.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001689", "created_by": "Germ\u00e1n_Molina_Larrain"}
