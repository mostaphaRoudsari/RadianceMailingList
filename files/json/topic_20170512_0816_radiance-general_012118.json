Or better, what\u2019s the difference between the Perez model implementation in gendaymtx and in gendaylit?\n\n\nI was comparing the output of these two methods, for each hour of the year:\ngendaymtx -m 1 GBR_London.wea > London.dmx\ngendaylit 1 4 9.5 -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m -0 -W 178 76 | genskyvec -m 1 >  london_0104h9_rad.skv\n\n\nAnd I was expecting to get an identical result, but instead the two data series are somehow different. The data I used for the gendaylit -W option are taken from the same .wea file I used for gendaymtx.\n\n\nSorry if you discussed about this previously, I searched a bit in the mailing list but I didn\u2019t find a precise answer.\n\n\nThanks a lot!\nEleonora\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEleonora Brembilla, MSc\nPhD Student\n\n\nBuilding Energy Research Group\nDaylight and CBDM\nSchool of Civil & Building Engineering\nLoughborough University\nLE11 3TU\nUK\n\n\n@EleBrembilla<https://twitter.com/EleBrembilla>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012118.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012118", "created_by": "Eleonora_Brembilla"}
