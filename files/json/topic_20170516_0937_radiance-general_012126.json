After poking around, I discovered another path to /radiance/lib\nand then ran \"ls -la /opt/rad4/radiance-5.0.a.12-Darwin/usr/local/radiance/lib\"\nand found picture.cal as well as many other files not in the original\ndirectory path above. I copied picture.cal into the directory for the\nRAYPATH, but still received the error.\n\n\nAnyway, I tried re-setting RAYPATH to\n\"/opt/rad4/radiance-5.0.a.12-Darwin/usr/local/radiance/lib\"\n(as well as =.:/opt/rad4/radiance-5.0.a.12-Darwin/usr/local/radiance/lib)\nbut I still received an error that picture.cal was missing. I finally\nfigured out a very kludgy way to get the missing files in radiance/lib to\nwork (by copying them into the current working directory), but I want to\nget the RAYPATH working properly.\n\n\nDoes anyone have advice/help?\n\n\nThank you very much, David\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012126.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012126", "created_by": "David_Gissen"}
