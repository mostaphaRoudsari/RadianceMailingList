There is a particular increment between 0\u00b0\nand 30\u00b0 of the incidence angle, instead i was expected something similar to\nthe dashed lines in the graphs. Is it normal to have this angular\ntransmission trend? If not, how can I fix this problem?\n\n\n[image: Immagine incorporata 1]\n\n\nTrans material\nvoid trans Fabric\n0\n0\n7 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.01 0 0.45 0\n\n\nBSDF:\ngenBSDF -n 4 -c 4000 -dim 0.299 0.338 0.373 0.429 -0.018 0 -r -ab 10\ntrans_test_tr3.rad\nFor the test the material geometry is a rectangle.\n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance.\nBest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Andrea Zani*\n\n\nMeng  |  Phd Student & Researcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politecnico di Milano*\n\n\nvia Ponzio, 31 | 20133 Milano | Italia\n\n\n*t* +39 02 2399 6015\n\n\n*@: *andrea.zani at polimi.it\n\n\n*@: *andrea89.zani at gmail.com\n\n\nwww.polimi. <http://www.polimi.it/>it\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-May/012135.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012135", "created_by": "Andrea_Zani"}
