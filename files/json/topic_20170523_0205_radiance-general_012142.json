I have searched through quite a few forums, and of these Radiance-Online repository\u2019s, however no-one seems to have had quite the same error. I get the following error:\n\n\njamessheldon at ATELIERTENXXXX MINGW64 ~\n$ genBSDF.pl C:/ladybug/Hyderabad/100mm_shading_screen/MSH2RADFiles/blinds.rad > C:/ladybug/Hyderabad/100mm_shading_screen/MSH2RADFiles/blinds_2.xml\nrcontrib: system - cannot find function file \"klems_full.cal\": Invalid argument\nC:/ladybug/BSDF/genBSDF.WPQU9v/behind.dat: cannot load matrix\nC:\\Radiance\\bin\\rmtxop.exe: operation failed on 'C:/ladybug/BSDF/genBSDF.WPQU9v/behind.dat'\nFailure running rmtxop at /c/Radiance/bin/genBSDF.pl line 463.\n\n\nI have changed the temp directory away from the traditional path variable in-case I didn\u2019t have the right run-permissions for that folder. On our system, the C:/ladybug has read, write and execute permissions. Clearly this didn\u2019t address the problem. My PATH and RAYPATH environment variables are as echoed:\n\n\njamessheldon at ATELIERTENXXXX MINGW64 ~\n$ echo $PATH\n/c/Users/jamessheldon/bin:/mingw64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/mingw64/bin:/usr/bin:/c/Users/jamessheldon/bin:/c/Radiance/bin:/c/Program Files (x86)/Panda Security/WaAgent/Common:/c/Users/jamessheldon/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python35-32/Scripts:/c/Users/jamessheldon/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python35-32:/c/Radiance/bin:/c/DAYSIM/bin:/c/Accelerad/bin:/c/Strawberry/c/bin:/c/Strawberry/perl/bin:.:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl\n\n\njamessheldon at ATELIERTENXXXX MINGW64 ~\n$ echo $RAYPATH\n.;C:\\Accelerad\\lib; C:\\Radiance\\lib;\n\n\nI also receive the same error when trying to run the accelerad version of genBSDF. I am struggling to find a way of progressing with this error, as we get no further feedback from an error console or event viewer. Thanks in advance for any assistance \ufffd\n\n\nWarm Regards,\n\n\nJames Sheldon\nMEng MA Hons.
