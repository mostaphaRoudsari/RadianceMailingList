I wonder if there is a way to overrule this default\nbehavior. For example:\n\n\necho 1,2,3 4,5 | rcalc -t, -e '$1=if($2-$1,$3,0)' gives '3' as result. Can\nit be forced to give '3 4'?\n\n\nIn this case the space is not a field separator, but it causes the rest of\nthe field be missing from the ouput.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nVictor Lopez-Rioboo Gil\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-June/012144.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012144", "created_by": "Victor_LRG"}
