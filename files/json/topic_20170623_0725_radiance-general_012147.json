The \nproblem is that the BSDF is supposed to be left and right symmetric (as is \nthe geometry). In practice the BSDF doesn't look left/right symmetric in \nBSDFviewer. Is it a problem due to the ray-tracing calculation with many \nsmall objects or did I mess up something? here is the command I have run \nto generate the BSDF :\n\n\ngenBSDF +f +b -geom millimeter -n 5 0.rad > 0.xml\n\n\nI attach the 0.rad file used to the email. Thanks in advance for your \nhelp!\n\n\nSincerely,\nMarouane Boudhaim.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-June/012147.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012147", "created_by": "Marouane_Boudhaim"}
