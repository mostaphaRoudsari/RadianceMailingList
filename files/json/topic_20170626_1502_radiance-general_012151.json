The only way I\nhave had success in doing this is to convert a particular color temperature\n(e.g. 2400k) to R, G, B values and then use the -c term followed by the\nconverted RGB values.\n\n\nThank you!\nKera\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-June/012151.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012151", "created_by": "Kera_Lagios"}
