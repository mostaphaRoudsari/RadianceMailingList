Let's assume now this image is \nequi-solid-angle and we want to transfer it to a equi-distant (-vta).\n\n\nFor this I applied /pcomb -f fisheye_corr.cal -o fisheye.hdr > \ncorrected.hdr/.\n\n\nIn the next step I counted the amount of pixels for the sun in the two \nimages. They are exactly the same!  What has changed is only the \nposition in the image. Neither the size of the sun nor the luminance has \nchanged.\n\n\nBut: The difference between the solid angles of a pixel at 85\u00b0 from the \ncenter between equi-solid-angle and equi-distant projection is around \n20%! (in my example the solid angle per pixel for a 5000x5000 image at \n85\u00b0 is: 3.2e-7sr  vs  2.58e-7sr)\n\n\nI would have expected also a change in size, accounting for the \ndifference in solid angles per pixel for the different projection \nmethods, the luminance of course should be the same.\n\n\nAm I doing sth. wrong?\n\n\nthx for the help.\n\n\nJan\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-June/000633.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000633", "created_by": "Jan_Wienold"}
