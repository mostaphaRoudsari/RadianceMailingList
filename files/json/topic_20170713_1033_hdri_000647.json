I'll include it in the package on my website for future downloaders.\n\n\nThe -s factor doesn't have to be exact.  It just has to have the correct relative relation between captures.  If you capture your images in the usual 1-EV separation, you might use for example:\n\n\nimg1.jpg\t\t1/60th second\nimg2.jpg\t\t1/125th second\nimg3.jpg\t\t1/250th second\n\n\nhdrgen -s 1 img1.jpg -s 2.0 img2.jpg -s 4.0 img3.jpg\n\n\nIn other words, you want the pixels times the multipliers to roughly equal each other (within the limits of exposure range).  If you happen to know what the absolute level of some image is, you can use that.  Here is an approximate formula for the -s factor based on ISO, f-stop, and exposure time:\n\n\n\ts2nits = 87*f_stop^2/(exp_time*ISO)\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-July/000647.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000647", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
