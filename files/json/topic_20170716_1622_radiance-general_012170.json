Can I make a calculation with an IES file where I can terminate the ray distance (at 100 metres for example) and remove any attenuation from the rays? \n\n\nIn summary, i want to use radiance to identify 'line of sight' to a maximum distance - a  point was/was not 'seen' from the light source position.\n\n\nIts properly an easy question but i cant find the answer. I have the rendering with radiance book if e answer is in there...\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012170.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012170", "created_by": "John_Everist"}
