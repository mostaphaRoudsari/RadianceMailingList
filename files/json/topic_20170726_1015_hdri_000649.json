{"topic": "How does Pvalue determine CCT in HDR images and how is the EV of a HDR image determined?", "category": "hdri", "attachments": [], "created_by_name": "Greg Ward", "created_at": "July 26, 2017 at 10:15AM", "body": "Hi Kars,\n\n\nI am cross-posting my response to the HDRI mailing list per Chris' suggestion.\n\n\nSpecifying the \"-o\" option of pvalue takes into account the exposure setting, which is determined from the ExIF data if you created the image using Photosphere or hdrgen.  The formula below has an empirically derived constant that may not exactly fit your camera, so it is best to add your own calibrating scale factor:\n\n\n\tsample_to_nits = 87 * (f-stop)^2 / (ISO * exposure_secs)\n\n\nThe sample_to_nits is converted to a Radiance picture exposure using:\n\n\n\tEXPOSURE = 179 / sample_to_nits\n\n\nwhere 179 lumens/watt is the agreed-upon efficacy of the equal-energy illuminant E over the visible spectrum.\n\n\nUnfortunately, pvalue is not very smart about reporting brightness using the \"-b\" option.  It uses a formula based on the standard Radiance color space, which differs from the CCIR-709 color space produced by Photosphere in both the green primary and the white point.  It only makes a small difference, but if you are worrying about such things, you had best use the following to report luminance from your image:\n\n\n\tra_xyze image.hdr | pvalue -o -b [other options]\n\n\nThis also takes care of the 179 factor, reporting results in candelas/meter^2.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-July/000649.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000649", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
