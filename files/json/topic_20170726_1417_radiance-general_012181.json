For example i have a camera and 100 sensors points (to pass to rtrace). Can i get the 100 vectors from each sensor to the source? This is to aim each sensor to the camera face - rather than the zenith.\n\n\nIm using python at the moment but its taking ages!\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012181.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012181", "created_by": "John_Everist"}
