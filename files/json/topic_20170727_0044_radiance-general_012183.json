(upper left image)\n\n\n2.)\n\n\nWhen I assign a spotlight to a ring, how does the direction of the \nring's normal\nand the direction of the spotlight act together?\n\n\nI would have expected the light spot to get elliptic when the spotlight \nis pointing\ndownwards but the ring has a different normal. (like the projected\narea of the ring when looking in the direction of the light)\nBut the light spot stays round. Why?\n\n\n3.)\n\n\nI found a comment in Radiance Digest\n\n\n> The focal length produces only a subtle difference as it shifts the \n> effective\n> position of the source behind the actual emitting surface.\n\n\nI interpret this as shown in the lower image. Is this correct?\n\n\n4.) Is the \"specularity\" parameter for the materials the same as \n\"reflectivity\" or \"reflectance\"?\n\n\nKind regards,\nJoe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-July/012183.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012183", "created_by": "Joe"}
