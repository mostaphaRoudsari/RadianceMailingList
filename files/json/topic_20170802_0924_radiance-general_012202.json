I made some progress on this and have new questions :)\n\n\nThe image linked below shows three scenarios I tried.\n\n\nThe left image shows heliostats reflecting the sun [source, at 0, 0, 1, \nring with 0.5\u00b0] onto the receiver. This works fine so far.\n\n\nBut I also tried other materials that I would have expected to work.\n\n\nThe middle image uses a white glossy plastic with specularity 1.0 and \nroughness 0.0 . I would have expected to see the reflection on the \nreceiver, too.\n\n\nSame for the right picture, here I used a non-transmitting dielectric.\nI would have expected that the complete radiation is reflected.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/soSzJNe\n\n\nDo you have an idea what might causethis behaviour or what I might have \nmissed?\n\n\nKind regards,\nJoe\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012202.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012202", "created_by": "Joe"}
