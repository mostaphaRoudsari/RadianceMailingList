The \"mirror\" type creates virtual light sources that allow the calculation to work, but the other two types do not.  You might get them to work with the photon map, however.\n\n\nYou should know that setting the transmission of a dielectric does not give you a 100% reflecting material.  At most, you'll get about 5% reflectance, but again, the calculation still needs to know where to look, and it does not.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n\n\nP.S.  It's best to keep the subject the same, so the thread holds together on the list archives.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012204.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012204", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
