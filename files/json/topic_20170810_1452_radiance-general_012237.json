These I\nwill be selling for $35 each.\n\n\nI also have a few misprints left; the printer left the special characters\nout. You can learn Radiance from one of these, but all the mathematics is\ntrashed; I just want to get rid of them and you can have one while they\nlast (I only have five left) for $5.\n\n\nI will be taking cards, checks, and cash.\n\n\nIf you're interested please let me know; I would like to plan for sales.\n\n\nRandolph M.
