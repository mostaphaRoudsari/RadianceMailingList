I'm not very familiar with the\ntechnicalities behind ray-tracing software so I was just wondering about\nwhat Mathematics/Physics I'd have to study in order to have a firm\nunderstanding of how Radiance works. The only thing that comes to mind is\nOptics and maybe Linear Algebra but I'm sure there's more to that.\n\n\nFor example, I studied Thermodynamics in order to understand EnergyPlus,\nand Multivariable Calculus w/ Fluid dynamics to understand CFD software.\n\n\nAlso, I was just wondering about the learning curve of Radiance. Although\nI'm not an expert, I'm quite confident in my Python skills. How long might\nit take me to get a good grasp of Radiance (Intermediate - Proficient) if\nstudy it for 2-3 hours a day?\n\n\nThank you very much!\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012242.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012242", "created_by": "\ud551\ud06c\u9ed2"}
