I haven't experimented with it enough to be sure if it's sufficient to just disable it for the Terminal, or if you have to individually apply it to the Radiance renderers (if such a thing is possible), or if you need to do it system-wide.  You may need to experiment, and please report back with what you found.\n\n\nI'm still running Lion (10.7), because it's the *oldest* version of OS X my MacBook supports.   So, I don't really know how big a problem this is, but I've noticed that background renders take forever under more recent versions.  (Can't say I'm a fan of anything Apple has done in the last 5 years.)\n\n\nAlso check out a very useful command-line tool called \"caffeinate\", which I just heard about.  It flags a process to keep the system from going to sleep while it's running.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-August/012247.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012247", "created_by": "Greg_Ward"}
