There is a problem when I run \"rvu\" (Windows 10 64 bits). It complains about a strange \"qstring\" missing. Using Dependency Walker I found that the problem was in \"qt5core.dll\", searching in other forums I see that this problem may appear when compiling a program against a QT version and distributing another. \n\n\nMaybe I am the only one to have this problem?\n\n\nThanks for replies.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-September/012252.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012252", "created_by": "Rocco"}
