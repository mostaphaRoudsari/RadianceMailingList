The reference manual describes roughness as \u201cthe rms slope of surface facets\u201d.\nWe had a sample tested and the lab has given us this value back, something in the order of magnitude of a few hundred microns. Does this number get input as the roughness factor (after converting microns to meters)?\n\n\nThis number is quite small, but for a metal panel surface it could be correct. Just curious how to take the input and make it a bit more useful.\nThanks in advance. Sorry to have missed everyone in Portland, hopefully next time!\n\n\nChris\n\n\nChris Coulter\nAssociate\nBuroHappold Engineering | Lighting Design\nT: +1 212 334 2025\nM: +1 646 574 2791\nwww.burohappold.com<http://www.burohappold.com/> | @burohappold<http://www.twitter.com/burohappold>\n\n\n\n\nThis transmission is confidential and intended solely for the person or organization to whom it is correctly addressed.
