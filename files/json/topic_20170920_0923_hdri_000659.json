I'm running 64bit Ubuntu but when I attempt to run this\nbinary using: ./hdrgen64bit I get the error: \"./hdrgen64bit: cannot execute\nbinary file: Exec format error\"\n\n\nGoogling this steers me towards discussion of the binary being compiled for\ndifferent processor architecture but offers no solutions. When i inspect\nthe binary it returns the following:\n\"hdrgen64bit: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1\n(GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.15,\nBuildID[sha1]=82befb063379a42cf05a3169b836fb275ce3373e, not stripped\"\n\n\nI don't know if it's a red herring but does the \"ELF 32-bit LSB\" bit imply\nthat the 64bit binary is actually 32bit?\nFor reference my processor architecture is: x86_64\n\n\n2) I have managed to get the non 64bit binary working on a different\nmachine, and have succesfully created a hdr image through trial and error.\nIs there a manual/user guide anywhere which explains what options are\navailable for the program?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\nDarragh\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-September/000659.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000659", "created_by": "Darragh_Gleeson"}
