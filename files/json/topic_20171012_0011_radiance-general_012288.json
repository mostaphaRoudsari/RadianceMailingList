What version of Radiance do you have?  (I.e., what does \"rpict -version\" return?)\n\n\nDoes it report any error at all?  Is the output file completely empty?\n\n\nIt works when I run it using 5.1, and I'm pretty sure it will work for anything later than the 4.1 release, which was in 2011.\n\n\nCheers,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012288.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012288", "created_by": "Wang_Clarence"}
