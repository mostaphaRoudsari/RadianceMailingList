I am working with a remote terminal window and \nwould like to generate the default views for a series of xml files by \niterating through them one at a time.\u00a0 I managed to do so by copying the \nrif structure from the perl file for bsdfview and turning off the -o \noption.\n\n\nIs there a reason why the non-interactive mode isn't a part of the \nfunctionality?\n\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nSarith\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2017-October/001720.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001720", "created_by": "Sarith_Subramaniam"}
