When I tried the command below, it actually created a bad .dmx file which I could not open.\n\n\n#genklemsamp -vd 0 -1 0 objects/south_window.rad | rcontrib -c 500 -e MF:2 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m sky_glow -faf model2_dmx.oct > results/south2.dmx\n\n\nBut I replaced \"-faf\" by \"-faa\", the \"south2.dmx\" could be successfully rendered. Its header was showed below:\n#?RADIANCE\noconv materials/testroom2.mat objects/testroom2.rad objects/ground2.rad skies/sky_white1.rad\nrcontrib -c 500 -e MF:2 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m sky_glow -faa\nSOFTWARE= RADIANCE 5.1 lastmod Wed Aug 30 10:22:48 HKT 2017 by root on clarence-ThinkCentre-M900\nCAPDATE= 2017:10:18 17:49:26\nGMT= 2017:10:18 09:49:26\nNCOMP=3\nNCOLS=578\nFORMAT=ascii\n\n\n2. I continued to try the command by using \"dctimestep\" like tutorial say  in order to render the image. But it reacted : fatal-unexpected column count in header. How to solve this problem?\n\n\n#gensky 3 21 10 | genskyvec -m 4 -c 1 1 1 > skies/3_21_10.skv\n\n\n#dctimestep images/vmx/window_east_%03d.hdr data/singleclear.xml results/east2.dmx skies/3_21_10.skv > images/3_21_10_clear.hdr\n\n\nBy the way, the \"results/east2.dmx\" was created by using the \"-faa\" in the previous command.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nClarence\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012298.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012298", "created_by": "Wang_Clarence"}
