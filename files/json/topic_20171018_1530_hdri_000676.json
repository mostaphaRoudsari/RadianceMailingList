Can somebody here give me some orientation about the specific features of the camera that we should look into, for a good performance HDR images? \nI think that one is that it should be possible to lock the flash to prevent its activation in a darkened environment, another one is that the camera should be able to take continuous images, and an exposure bracketing system to be able to increase/decrease the exposure \n(\u00b13 EV), this can be manual but auto bracketing is better. \n\n\nIs there anything else that we should check before ?\nI'd appreciate your help\nSteph \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Libre de virus. www.avast.com  |\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000676.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000676", "created_by": "Stef_Cy"}
