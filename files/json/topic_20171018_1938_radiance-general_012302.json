A few of the programs have changed slightly, and we generally recommend rfluxmtx over rcontrib for most calculations, as it is much simpler to use and therefore less error-prone.  You should use the new tutorial by Sarith, which was just recently posted to our website:\n\n\n        https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/matrix-based-methods\n\n\nThis is an advanced tutorial, but it starts with the basics and quickly moves through each of the methods.  There is also an associated set of input files here:\n\n\n        https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/radTutorialFiles-master.zip\n\n\nBest,\n-Greg\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012302.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012302", "created_by": "Wang_Clarence"}
