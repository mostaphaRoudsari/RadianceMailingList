If so, that suggests that is not that helpful to get a camera that can reach even 1/8000s, or that in order to take advantage of such speed, the use of the ND filter would be really necessary to achieve good results, is that right?\nThank you again for your help...\nSt.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/hdri/2017-October/000680.html).</sup>", "id": "hdri_000680", "created_by": "Stef_Cy"}
