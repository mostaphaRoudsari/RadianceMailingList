I currently run OSX  10.12.6. Trying to avoid a dysfunctional laptop if patches are needed to run Radiance.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\nRob\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012304.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012304", "created_by": "Robert_A._Shakespeare"}
