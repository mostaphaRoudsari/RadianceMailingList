When I start a program from the command line I get the error \"The application was unable to start correctly 0xc000007b\".\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDoes anybody have an idea what is going wrong here? There are a lot of hints on the net concerning this error. But I did not find the right one yet.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany thanks and best regards\n\n\nMartin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLichttechnik Martin Klingler\n\n\nSpraidt 7\n\n\n5271 Moosbach\n\n\nAUSTRIA\n\n\nTel ++43-7724-443833\n\n\nFax ++43-7724-443838\n\n\nemail martin at lichttechnik.co.at\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-October/012312.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012312", "created_by": "Martin_Klingler"}
