Up to my \nunderstanding, using the same geometry at different scales shouldn't alter \nBSDF properties. If my blinds are two times bigger, the angular properties \nshould not varry (excluding some randomness in the calculation). I feel \nlike I have missed something that would justify including the unit \ndistance if I don't want to keep the geometry.\n\n\nSincerely,\nMarouane Boudhaim.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012323.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012323", "created_by": "Marouane_Boudhaim"}
