But it turns out that the distribution is not \nuniform.\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\n\ngensky 6 12 21  -b 55.86592178771 -u\n\n\nGives a zenith-luminance of 10000 cd/m2 (was the goal) and close to the \nhorizon around 6500 cd/m2.\nAlso without the -b option the distribution is not uniform.\nAny idea?\n\n\nThx!\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.-Ing.
