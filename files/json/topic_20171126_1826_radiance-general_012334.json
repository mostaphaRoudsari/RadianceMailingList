The data of .smx file I rendered almost were null, so was the data of New York City . I had no ideas about its correctness.  Anyone could help me out of confusion?\n\n\n#Generate a direct-only sky-matrix for the sun coefficient calculation.\n#epw2wea weather/CHN_Hong.Kong.SAR.450070_CityUHK.epw weather/HK.wea\n#gendaymtx -m 1 -d weather/HK.wea > skyVectors/HKd.smx\n\n\n#Generate a sun-matrix for the sun coefficient calculation.\n#epw2wea weather/CHN_Hong.Kong.SAR.450070_CityUHK.epw weather/HK.wea\n#gendaymtx -m 2 -5 0.533 -d weather/HK.wea > skyVectors/HKsun.smx\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nClarence\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-November/012334.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012334", "created_by": "Wang_Clarence"}
