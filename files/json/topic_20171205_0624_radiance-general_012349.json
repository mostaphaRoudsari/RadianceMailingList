When running them\nthrough pmapdump, all caustic photons have a zero radius.  I am\nattempting to fix this with the -r option, but it gets ignored.  Is\nthis expected?\n\n\nThe man page states that\n\"In cases where the distribution is substantially nonuniform (e.g.\nhighly localised caustics) the radius can be manually corrected with\nthis option.\"\n\n\nDoes pmapdump know whether it is dealing with a 'substantially\nnonuniform distribution', and ignore -r if it is not?\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nAxel\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012349.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012349", "created_by": "Axel_Jacobs"}
