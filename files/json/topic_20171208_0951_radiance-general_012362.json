Currently I am only looking to run this at specific times and not annually.\n\n\nAny pointers or examples that anyone has would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nJason Giddings\nDesigner | Lighting\n\n\nArup\n13 Fitzroy Street  London  W1T 4BQ  United Kingdom\nd: +44 20 7755 4259\nwww.arup.com <http://www.arup.com/>\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nElectronic mail messages entering and leaving Arup business\nsystems are scanned for viruses and acceptability of content\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012362.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012362", "created_by": "Jason_Giddings"}
