One has 5.1a and the other 5.1.0.\n\n\nAs of the bsdf generation options. It has been generated through genBSDF \nwith only -dim option. I want to note that the BSDF was only used for the \n3-phase method, and the system's depth has been neglected (2mm depth seems \nneglectible in regards to scene's dimensions).\n\n\nRtrace scene used the real geometry (the one I generated from the BSDF) as \nI want to validate against it. I didn't use the proxy geometry. I don't \nknow if it answers your question.\n\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n\nSincerely,\nMarouane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVon:    radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\nAn:     radiance-general at radiance-online.org\nDatum:  10.12.2017 21:04\nBetreff:        Radiance-general Digest, Vol 166, Issue 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Radiance-general mailing list submissions to\n                 radiance-general at radiance-online.org\n\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n\n\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general\nor, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n                 radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org\n\n\nYou can reach the person managing the list at\n                 radiance-general-owner at radiance-online.org\n\n\nWhen replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\nthan \"Re: Contents of Radiance-general digest...\"\n\n\n\n\nToday's Topics:\n\n\n   1.
