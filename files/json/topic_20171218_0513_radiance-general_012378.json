I used optics2glazedb and glaze script to combine them. I have few questions about using them.\n\n\nI tried to add all the glasses to LLGlasses.db using below command, but this doesn't add \"CARDINAL_66_0.76.rad\u201d to the db. I had to add it manually, but why wouldn\u2019t it add to the db?\n\n\n\t./optics2glazedb  Clear-Float-Glass-8.rad CARDINAL_66_0.76.rad SageGlass-8905.rad SageGlass-8906.rad SageGlass-8908.rad SageGlass-8909.rad > LLGlasses.db\n\n\n\t2. After creating LLGlasses.db i executed the Glaze script and created glazing systems like below, only changing s2 with EC glass states and keeping other surfaces constant. The 'Normal hemispherical transmittance\u2019 calculated this way (0.553) is different from Tvis( 0.453) calculated using Window <https://seafile.rlp.net/f/eb88794094874c8c9843/?dl=1>, for the same combination of glasses (the case of 8905 and CARDINAL_66_0.76.rad, shown below). The only thing extra in Window is air gap (mix of Argon and air). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow normal faces interior\n\n\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |-->\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n  | |    | |\n s1 s2  s3 s4\n\n\nSupported surface types are:\n   1 - Clear-Float-Glass-8\n   2 - Cardinal\n   3 - SageGlass-8905\n   4 - SageGlass-8906\n   5 - SageGlass-8908\n   6 - SageGlass-8909\n\n\nWhat is the type of s1? 1\nWhat is the type of s2? 3\nWhat is the type of s3? 2\nWhat is the type of s4? 1\n\n\n############################################\n# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script\n# $Revision$\n# Loaded: LLGlasses.db\n# Mon Dec 18 10:47:37 CET 2017\n# Material surface normal points to interior\n# Number of panes in system: 2\n# Exterior surface s1 type: Clear-Float-Glass-8\n# Inner surface s2 type: SageGlass-8905\n# Inner surface s3 type: Cardinal\n# Interior surface s4 type: Clear-Float-Glass-8\n# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.160661531\n# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.129405804\n# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.553981928\n#\nvoid BRTDfunc glaze2_unnamed\n10\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.060),ft(0.789),fr(0.086)),cr(fr(0.119),ft(0.666),fr(0.071)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.077),ft(0.845),fr(0.08)),cr(fr(0.12),ft(0.69),fr(0.091)))\nif(Rdot,cr(fr(0.113),ft(0.767),fr(0.058)),cr(fr(0.144),ft(0.502),fr(0.116)))\nft(0.789)*ft(0.666)\nft(0.845)*ft(0.69)\nft(0.767)*ft(0.502)\n\t0 0 0\n\tglaze2.cal\n0\n9\n\t0 0 0\n\t0 0 0\n\t0 0 0\n\n\n\n\nI would like to know why they are different and which is the correct visible transmittance for the glazing. I have included all the files here <https://seafile.rlp.net/d/3b63eb865e8f49169d68/>.\n\n\n\t3. Why does optics2glazedb needs first argument a clear glass? I generated a db with Clear-Float-Glass-8 initially (see the Supported surface types above) and then another db after removing it (see below). It still generated db, but when using Glaze script, I see  a 1 - clear glass is generated in Supported surface types automatically. In both cases (above and below) i get same Normal hemispherical transmittance. Is it ok to use any clear glass here?\n\n\n   1 - clear glass\n   2 - Cardinal\n   3 - SageGlass-8905\n   4 - SageGlass-8906\n   5 - SageGlass-8908\n   6 - SageGlass-8909\n\n\nIt would be great if any one could explain this .\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012378.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012378", "created_by": "raghuram_kalyanam"}
