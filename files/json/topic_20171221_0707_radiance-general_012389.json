So I used *rfluxmtx.*\n\n\nI'm wondering why I need to use a different set of parameters for this two\nkind of simulations, especially for -ad and -lw.\n\n\nI also noticed that rfluxmtx is much faster than rtrace (even with Reinhart\nsky subdivision -m4) but I do not understand why.\n\n\nIs there a difference in these two algorithms of calculation? Or maybe it's\nmy fault?\n\n\nAntoine\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012389.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012389", "created_by": "Antoine_Bugeat"}
