Moderate two ambient bounces, a strong \ndirect transmission. The same octree was used in two rendering runs, \ncontrolled by rad and distributed over several cores by rpiece (leading \nto some artefacts). I share the results as links:\n\n\nTo the compressed HDR images (hdr.bz2):\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/m9l4gmWsoG995jO\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/yifVqTxDOYWJ4dT\n\n\nTo the falsecolor illustrations (jpg):\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/4JwoUBdgA7Ov4y1\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/kGxCBVD8JcKGZhv\n\n\nValues of a vertical row of pixels for varying -ad (and -lw = 1/ad) \nsettings (pdf):\nhttps://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/UQq3Nh4g38rQ2Cs\n\n\nThe images were rendered with -ad 1024 -lw .0008 -aa .15 (with ambient \ncache) and -ad 4096 -lw .00024 -aa 0 (without cache). The plot indicates \nthat for the given scene, even -ad 512 should give reasonable results. \nMy expectation was that both images should be more or less equal, but \nobviously they are not. Can anyone explain this effect, or is there \nsomething I missed?\n\n\nCheers,\nLars.\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012399.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012399", "created_by": "Lars_O._Grobe"}
