In general, I want to model energy arriving at different\npoints in the greenhouse, given weather conditions, building geometry, etc.\nAt each test point/sensor, I want to send backwards rays at evenly-spaced\nazimuthal angles and polar angles and sum the irradiance contributions from\neach ray.\n\n\nI assumed that RSENSOR does what I intend to do and that my sensor file\nwill determine what rays are sent and in what direction. But I don't know\nwhether my assumption is true.\n\n\nAlso, I don't understand what the sensitivity values on the SPOT matrix\nreally mean. Overall, I just want to calculate irradiance values at each\ntest point by evenly sampling backwards rays in all directions.\n\n\nI've looked at this:\nhttps://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2009-boston-ma/Presentations/rogers_SPOT%20on.pdf\n\n\nHowever, I don't understand the sin/cosine parts and I am focused and\nradiometric units, not human-centered units like luminance.\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nValerie\n\n\n\n\nValerie Tan\nComputer Science\nCollege of Engineering\nCornell University '19\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012403.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012403", "created_by": "Valerie_Tan"}
