If I\nwant to calculate the energy arriving at a point on a plane, calculating\nirradiance from a single direction isn't realistic. Thus, I asked about\nRSENSOR which you recommended that I use a long time ago. I am thinking\nthat for each point, I call RTRACE with the view direction -vd changing in\nequal increments and then add the irradiances. For example, the view\ndirections for a very rough calculation would be in spherical\ncoordinates/degrees: (1, 0, 0), (1, 90, 0), (1, 180, 0), (1, 270, 0), (1,\n0, 45), (1, 90, 45), (1, 180, 45), (1, 270, 45), (1, 0, 90).\n\n\nAlso, I am confused about \"a list of RGB irradiance values (watts/sr/m^2).\"\nThis looks like radiance, and reputable sources state that the units for\nirradiance are (W/m^2).\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nValerie\n\n\n\n\nOn Dec 28, 2017 3:00 PM, <radiance-general-request at radiance-online.org>\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2017-December/012406.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012406", "created_by": "Valerie_Tan"}
