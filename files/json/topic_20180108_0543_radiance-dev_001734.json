Most of this compiles fine, except for pmapooc.c, which\nis missing some header file includes. Unfortunately, that seems to\nbe the central cornerstone binding all the others together...\n@Roland:\n  Can you share some insight whether this is supposed to be working,\n  or still a work in progress that I should ignore for the moment?\n  Or alternatively, am I doing anything wrong for making it work?\n\n\n\n\nCheers\n-schorsc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorg Mischler  --  simulations developer  --  schorsch at schorsch com\n+schorsch.com+  --  lighting design tools  --  http://www.schorsch.com/\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-dev/2018-January/001734.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-dev_001734", "created_by": "Georg_Mischler"}
