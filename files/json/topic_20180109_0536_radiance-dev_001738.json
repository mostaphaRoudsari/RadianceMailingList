Threds might still be a good idea \nin\nthis case, though.\n\n\nOf course, I may still be missing some other trickery, but on the \nsurface\nthis looks like a manageable porting task.\n\n\n@Roland will have to supply some test cases though, so we can verify \nthat\nthe ported version still does what it's supposed to do. Let's hope he\nreturns soon from his ski resort (or tropical island) where he seems to \nbe\nhanging out at the moment...\n\n\n\n\n-schorsch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm 2018-01-09 02:21, schrieb Gregory J.
