These all seem\nto use ray-tracing, solve the global illumination problem, use physical units\n(albeit sometimes not very obviously, and sometimes require a conversion\nfactor), I see hints of illumination falsecolours out there, and can output\nunclipped HDRIs as final results... as you can see, at first glance to an\ninexperienced person it really does seem that these other rendering engines are\nindeed also physically based and can also give the same scientifically accurate\noutput that Radiance can (also perhaps not as easily parsable as Radiance\nresults). (Assuming that the user doesn't purposely use biased rendering\ntechniques)\n\n\nThere seem to be features such as human eye image calibration, or falsecolours\nthat are rarer to be found in other engines, but slowly I am seeing mentions of\nthese features emerging.\n\n\nI also stumbled upon this comparison website:\n\n\nhttps://www.janwalter.org/RadianceVsYouNameIt/radiance_vs_younameit.html\n\n\nIn that website, it is not obvious how the material and light properties were\nconverted for each engine, but in short, the graphical outputs look the same.\n\n\nI hope that someone on this list can help explain to me in simpler terms what I\nam overlooking :)\n\n\n\n\nDion Moult\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012428.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012428", "created_by": "Dion_Moult"}
