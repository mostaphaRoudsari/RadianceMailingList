This was brought\nup in a simple scene test I am trying out.\n\n\nThe scene definition is as such, with a sunny sky: https://pastebin.com/VWcmgmR4\nWhich produces this image: https://ibin.co/3q18YxSiOc2C.png\n\n\nBut when I change gensky to a cloudy sky: https://pastebin.com/swR7MFhu\nI get this: https://ibin.co/3q18v7qVrDXc.png\n\n\nIn order to get the leaves actually rendering and to get the shadows of the\nleaves less splotchy, I've had to increase -ps to 1 and -ar to 2048. My full\noptions are -ab 2 -ad 4096 -ar 2048 -ps 1. Is this the right approach?\n\n\nI feel guilty that I am adjusting these parameters to get a more \"believable\"\nimage without fully understanding it -- I might compromise the validity of the\nsimulation (although yes, the material in this test is nonsense, of course).\n\n\nWhere can I read to learn more about the mechanics of Radiance and its options\n(in more detail than the man pages, and preferrably not hard math, as that is\nnot my strength) so that I can better understand the knobs I am turning?\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\nDion Moult\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-January/012435.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012435", "created_by": "Dion_Moult"}
