We generated HDR image from a set of 360 degree LDRs and then converted to fisheye HDR ( using a custom made tools). The intension was to use these Fisheye HDRs as input to Evalglare and get DGP value. The Camera used is Ricoh Theta V 360 degree camera.\n\n\nThe problem I am facing is, the DGP calculated from the generated fisheye HDR with Evalglare is always 1.0. We did the calibration but I would like to have expert opinion from you people, what is going wrong with these set of images. Here is the link <https://seafile.rlp.net/f/0212995d110648d38032/?dl=1> to the pictures.\n\n\nIt would be great if anyone could identify the issue.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRaghu\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012438.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012438", "created_by": "raghuram_kalyanam"}
