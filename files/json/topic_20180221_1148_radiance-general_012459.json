I found Jack's program (glaze) really interesting.\n\n\nI tried to create my glass database using optics2glazedb, but I am not able\nto generate any output except for one glass, as you can see in the figure\nattached.\n\n\nAttached also some .rad files that I have exported from optics and I tried\nto convert. I am using a virtual machine with Linux Mint.\n\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Any suggestion?\n\n\nThank you so much in advance for your time.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Andrea Zani*\n___\n<sup>Automatically generated content from [radiance mailing-list](https://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2018-February/012459.html).</sup>", "id": "radiance-general_012459", "created_by": "Andrea_Zani"}
