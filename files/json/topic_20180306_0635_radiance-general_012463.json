The focus of the workshops is to educate attendees about the\nbest practices of using parametric/generative visual scripting interfaces\nfor simulation.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a great opportunity for individuals who have wanted to get started\nusing Ladybug Tools (Workshops #1, #2, #4 and #6) and for more advanced\nusers who want to improve their current workflows and understand the logic\nbehind the tools.\n\n\nWorkshops #1, #2, #3 and #4 should most likely be interesting for Radiance\nusers. You can see the detailed schedule for all the workshops on our\nwebsite (http://www.ladybug.tools/workshop/london2018) and on the\nregistration page (https://ladybug.eventbee.com).\n\n\nWe will also do a public presentation on March 21, 6:00 pm at Foster and\nPartners\u2019 office. You need to RSVP for the event in advance at (\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-you-have-been-told-about-parametric-environmental-modeling-is-wrong-tickets-43881346288\n).\n\n\nWe are offering discounts for students, for those attending more than two\nfull days of workshops, and for those attending all of the workshops.
