- Which release of Radiance?
  (reccommended is 3R1p20 from http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/ )
- Which compiler version?
- What is the exact wording of the error message?

Without at least that much information, there's no way
that anyone could give you a useful suggestion. Most likely
you are trying to compile an outdated release, though.

Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict error: address not found in avlmemi
Message-ID: <3B5C8CD2.1E4E6CBD@gmx.net>

Hi List!

Finally, I've put my email address onto this list, nice to have
radiance-online.org!

And here's my first question:

I am trying to render a quite complex model (imported from CAD, and
there are no
instances, so it takes a lot of memory). If I try to get better quality
and higher
resolution, rpict gives me an error:

[...]rpict: 6581491 rays, 49,87% after... [...]
rpict: consistency - address not found in avlmemi
rad: error rendering view 1

I did this on a netfinity with a lot of ram and two pIII-833. But in
fact, the
machine is a fileserver... so is this error the result of insufficient
memory?

I have installed 3r2p11. On Linux 2.4.4 (SuSE 7.0).

BTW, as I know that Georg Mischler is on the list: dxf2rad is a great
way to import
data from formZ!!! I wrote dxfr14 and translated it with dxf2rad, it
works perfectly!
So this is an alternative besides the obj-way and the
3ds/mgf/rad-conversion.

Thank You, CU, Lars.

BTW: I just found patch 20, I never found it on the ftp. I will try
this, too.

Radiance 3.2 is "experimental" and was never officially released.
Technically, this error points to corrupted ambient data.
Your problem will most likely go away when you try with 3R1p20.

Cool!
Is there anything you need to set up correctly on the formZ side
for this to work? In particular, does formZ automatically create
seperate layers, so that dxf2rad can use different modifier
names? You could earn yourself at least a pat on the back and
a honorable mention by writing a very short description of the
exact procedure for my web site.


Have fun!

Sorry... I haven't been able due to a lot of problems - e.g. buggy
versions of radiance, the fact that Rayfront doesn't run on alphas
(and for the last months, I only had an alpha, no intel), my bad
planning... ;-)

Ooops, again.. I already tried 3.2, but this time, I meant 3r1p11
(the official download link). And p20 gives me the same.

It doesn't, and that seams to be a problem of memory. I can observe
very nice the free mem going down and the use of radiance going up
... ;-)

I just put the p20 source on my alpha, which has enough memory (512MB),
compiled it (I have put a new entry in makeall, containing some options
like -mcpu=ev56 etc for some speed ;-) and started the next try. At the
moment, I have rad saying 38%...

I will send some screenshots when I am at university. I am at my own
machine at the moment, and I don't have formZ here.

Hi!

One simple question: what hardware are you currently using? Everybody on
x86? Or are there some Sparc/Alpha/PowerPC-users here?

In fact, I have never been interested too much in cpu-performance,
benchmarks
etc... I only wanted my machine to run stable ;-) But as I have access
to wider
range of platforms at the moment (sparc and ultrasparc, alpha, powerpc)
I
would like to hear if there is the ultimate platform for radiance, or at
least
if these non-x86 are used by radiance-users.

Still the same problem, and I get very big ambfiles, about 10 MB. I
think I will try to reduce the model... but it is still a problem, as
I just wanted to test for a project with larger models.

At the moment, I work with a 4MB octree-file.

Hi!

It's me again... I had an error in my rif-file. The zone was wrong,
as during the import, units changed from meters to centimeters.
So, I have a model of 1500 x 1500 x 1500, and the zone was
15 x 15 x 15... maybe this caused errors. I just corrected it.
I hope it works now...

The problem with 3ds is that it will triangulate
EVERYTHING - and only the windows-version of formZ
has an 3ds-export.

With programs like 3DWin by Thomas Baier (PC-only), file conversion should 
not really be a problem.

What you say about polygonising everything is true. Only when using file 
formats that support other kinds of geometry (NURBS, Bezier-patches, 
CSG-constructs) then you'll be able to have the most economic conversion. 
There is no "general 3D-file format" at the moment, so unless you can write 
a plug-in for your software directly, you'll have to live with these 
limitations...

If we could get the software-firms aware of the importance of Radiance, then 
they could write export-plugins with a much better support of the 
radiance-primitives.

Radiance is however capable of rendering files with a lot of polygons. It is 
not the fastest way, but it'll get you there.

I use the ConRAD-program from Ole Lemming and most models come through. It 
is not unlikely that these models generate octrees of more then 100MB, which 
takes time... but the results are OK.

Do you use a modified radiance? As far as I know there are limits
concerning the
number of entities.

The Desktop Radiance distribution on a PIII-600/256RAM with Win2000.

There are limitations. In the (so far) largest project I used it with, I had 
to redo the terrain in ArchiCAD, to be able to calculate the octree. This 
octree was about 350MB. The "error.log" grew one time to 450MB of aiming 
failures! I guess there were slight rounding errors, causing troubles.

As I am still learning Radiance, the process was a bit cumbersome, but it 
got through.

Do you freeze all your octrees?
Scene data in the tens of MB are common, but a non-frozen
octree beyond 10 MB should be rare.

There are no inherent limits, if you answer the right questions
when compiling (or at least I'm sure you haven't run into *those*
limits yet).

I finally found the avlmemi error in some old mail:
Your problem most likely has to do with a defective qsort()
routine in Linux. Radiance uses this routine in the context
of an attempt at saving some memory when the ambient data
grows beyond a certain margin. If you have lots of RAM, then
you don't really need this, and you can set the margin to
a very big size with the following compilation option:

 -DSORT_THRESH=0x7fffffffffffffff

I remember that older versions used an option -D_QUICKSORT or similar.
The p20 doesn't have it. I also deleted this in older versions, because
it didn't work on my system.

I don't know quite how to reply to a thread to get the subject right, so
I entered this manually and it may end up in the wrong place.  (Help, Peter!)

The rpict error you are getting is due to a broken qsort() routine that
infiltrated the GNU library and keeps resufacing on various versions of
Linux.  I'm not sure which ones have it and which ones don't, so the
only thing I can suggest is recompiling ambient.o using the following switch:

	-Dtracktime=0

This will turn off the ambient sorting optimization, which won't affect
results but will eliminate this problem.  The faulty zone in the .rif
file is not the problem.

Hope this helps!

The archiver keeps track of the message IDs, so that simply replying
to a message will usually put the reply in the right (indented) place.
Of course, if you just joined and don't have the original message,
then you'll have to live with generating a new thread.

Ah, finally the official way, so I won't have to publish that old

Yeap, - the 'reply' button is somewhat a missing feature in mailman's archives.
We'll see
what mailman 2.1 offers (it's currently alpha). Yet I found this mailing list
manager more
useful and flexible than other software. My personal schedule is to do the
upgrade of the software
used to run the radiance-online site once a number of new versions for the
packages are released,
presumably late summer 2001. Once we accumulated more knowledge onsite, we'll
either have
a search function for the archive or a FAQ generator.
If anyone has suggestions what features to add to this site, please let me know.

6   x_pert y_pert z_pert function/corg.cal
    -rx 90
0 
1           0.075

Then i created a pattern using the picture.cal file using the definition below.


void colorpict logo1
15  fadered fadegreen fadeblue images/arco.pic function/picture.cal pic_u pic_v
    -rx 90 -rz 180 -t 4 0.0 1.3
0 
4               1             1             1
                1

The problem that i am having is that the image only appears as a brightness function
of the red wall (i.e. a monotone image)

Does anyone know how I can get the picture to be a colour image on the wall.

The image was saved in Photoshop as an 8-bit RGB image and converted to a pic file
using ra_tif

Russell,

Has the the explanation I sent through the Radiance-Support
mailing list not arrived downunder yet? Modifiers just multiply
their values with the material values. And a multiplication based
on blue/green material values of zero will simply give zero again.
You want to use a white base material, and a red logo picture.

Looking from a more general point of view:

If you want a *full color* picture without a tint from the
color of the surrounding wall, then you have two basic choices.

One would be to add a polygon to your model for holding the
picture, which gets a white material.

If you want to avoid the modelling effort, then you'll have to
manipulate your picture, so that it's color values compensate for
the color values of the base material.  Of course, this only
works if the rgb values of the material are all non-zero, or you
will run into the multiplication-by-zero dilemma. Seems like the
polygon solution will be simpler in most cases.

Actually, you could combine the two approaches, by defining
a mixfunc which selects the red plastic for the surrounding
area, and a white plastic with the colorpict in the picture
area. Mixtures are the exception to "normal" modifiers, in that
they can actually replace material values according to their
functional criteria, instead of just modifying (sic!) them.

Rayfront makes the use of mixtures exceptionally easy, after all,
and the function for this task is trivial:

  if(and(inside(X0,Px,X1),inside(Z0,Pz,Z1)),1,0)

If you replace X0, X1, Z0, Z1 with the lower and upper X and Z
boundaries of the image, then you can write this directly into
the expression field of the mixfunc dialog. If the image is
aligned to the YZ-plane, then you'll have to adapt accordingly.
The white plastic and colorpict will now go into the foreground
slot, and the red plastic becomes the background.
