Hi all,

anyone know of a VRML (virtual-reality-marker-language, 3d geometry for
the web)
to/from Radiance translator ? (VRML-1.0 would be fine)

TIA1e6
Peter

Hi Peter,

I don't have a direct translator to Radiance, but I do have a reasonably
robust two-step process.

Visit http://home.europa.com/~keithr/crossroads/ - there you can download
quite a useful freeware 3d file translator.  Using it, you can convert from
VRML (version 1.0 only, I am afraid) to DXF.  Then of course you can convert
DXF to rad by a number of established methods (I use torad in AutoCAD, but
of course Desktop Radiance does the same thing).

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Jeff

Ahem... could it really be that anyone is not aware of
the easy way to convert a DXF file yet?

  http://www.schorsch.com/download/dxf2rad/

And if you're really *still* using torad for exporting
from Autocad, please have a look at Radout instead!


Have fun!

There are Linux binaries available at the distribution site:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/ <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/>
, though I can't currently reach the site. I didn't have any problems with
the compile on Redhat, so I would be curious to know what version you are
trying to compile and what the errors are.

In the same directory as the binaries, there are also the
sources to 3R1P20. The version P8 is out of date and does
indeed cause problems when compiling on recent (ie. less
than three years old) Linux systems.


Have fun!

You can get from Radiance to VRML via MGF, but not the reverse as far as
I know.  To create an MGF file from a Radiance description, use rad2mgf.
 It won't translate textures, patterns, and some of the fancier
materials, but it captures most of the rest of it.  Then, use mgf2inv to
get to Inventor format, which is the same as VRML.  You need to use the
-vrml switch to get the correct version header, but otherwise the output
is identical.

The reason there's no translator from VRML to Radiance is because it's
very difficult (in my opinion) to support VRML, plus it's such a moving
target...  It requires a parser library and I just never got around to
implementing it.  Volunteers are welcome, as always.

I find torad a useful tool still - note that I have upgraded the torad.lsp
code to work perfectly well in AutoCAD 2000.  Yes - if your file is a DXF to
start with, the dxf2rad is a good tool, but I often start with DWG files,
meaning that I would have to use AutoCAD anyway to convert to DXF.  I
realise that something like radout probably is more robust and converts more
entity types, but torad usually works fine for me - so if it isn't broke,
don't fix it...

Hope you find the Crossroads program of some use - I found it while trying
to solve the exact same problem a couple of years ago...

ConRAD on http://www.openentry.dk converts a 3DStudio file (including the 
texture mapping) into Radiance quite well...
The free version doesn't support the textures though :)

I have some renderings in my rendering comparison on http://asro.sbuild.com 
that used it.

Subject: [Radiance-general] where to get macbeth colorchecker?
Message-ID: <24844.1000464368@www3.gmx.net>

Hi!

I will go to make some fotos of a building that will be modeled and rendered
in 
radiance (to do some research on previous concepts of this building). I want
to use 
these fotos to get an idea about color. So I wanted to use gray levels to
determine 
the reflectance and fotos to get rgb values (in fact I wanted to do this as
described 
in "Renderin with Radiance").

Now I have problems getting the Macbeth Target. We us Kodak targets here,
but 
those are not supported in the radiance "color management".

So, is it possible to use Kodak targets with radiance, or do you know where
I get 
Macbeth colorchecker in Germany?

Thank You, CU, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Solid acrylic cylinder
Message-ID: <2.2.32.20010914115831.006b8f60@pop.ansatt.ntnu.no>

I am trying to simulate a cylinder made of solid acrylic material, lying on
the table by the window. I defined the sky as "sunny sky with sun". The
sunlight is incident on the cylinder. I used the "dielectric" material
description and the primitive "cylinder". 

You can see on the picture, that the cylinder is transparent, but there is
no any spot of the sunlight that comes through the material. I gues the
reason is that the dielectric material is not a secondary light source. 

Has anybody an idea which other "material" should I use?

Barbara.

As Peter already mentioned, you'd need a forward raytracer to
do this "right".

If you're really desperate, then you could try to cranc up the
numbers of diffuse rays to really insane values (-ad >10000 ?)
and hope that you generate enough rays on paths that actually hit
the sun through your cylinder to get some visible effects. As
long as the receiving surfaces are close enough to the cylinder,
something *might* become visible, but it certainly won't be
realistic on a numerical level. The sun is much to small for that.

You can see that *in principle* it does work when all elements
are very close together, and the light source is very big, on
this page:   http://www.q-bus.de/Blender/test009.html
The first picture made with Radiance is the only one where the
highlight inside the shadow of the glass sphere has a square
shape, which is what you'd expect given the square light source.
But this really rather happens almost by chance (and of course
because Radiance follows physical models in the core). The
backwards raytracing method used by Radiance makes caustics
extremely inefficient in almost any other situation, eg. with
smaller light sources, greater distances, and especially with
non-trivial scenes that prohibit excessive numbers of diffuse
rays.


Have fun!

Thank you for the address! I just have ordered one at Calumet Photo,
Hamburg, it is about 165 DM there. Has anybody experiences with this kind of getting
material parameters? Any hints? My flight goes on Thursday ;-))) What should
I know BEFORE taking photos?

Most importantly, you should know that the photos will NOT give
you any realistic color values... But you probably know that
already. The best thing would be to compare the colors of the
real object with those swatches *in the same lighting conditions*,
and to only use the photographs for sanity checking the results.

If you *only* compare with the photos, then the use of any color
calibration system really sonds like a waste of time.

Hi from a new member!!

Are there any know problems with XEON (PIV) CPU's and SUSE 7.2?
We would (and could!! :-) buy new a new Dual-CPU 1.5 GHZ workstation for
our Student Simulation Workshop.

Any comments welcome ....

Ciao Mathias Wambsganﬂ

You know that Suse runs a whole battery of mailing lists to
answer such questions? In addition to the normal hardware
support lists, of course. You might find an answer there just
by browsing through the archives.

Okay .... maybe my question was not clear enough. I definitly know that
there are
no problems with SUSE 7.2 and XEON CPU's.

But are there known problems with Radiance?

Actualy we run the red-had compiled binaries with SUSE 7.1 to fix the
problem with killed processes in case of large ambient files. That's the
problems I'm looking for!

That's a problem with a broken qsort() routine in the system
library, as I'm sure you have seen in another thread further
above (together with the official solution). It has nothing
to do with the CPU type of your system. If the OS runs fine on
your CPU, then so will Radiance.

Trash the sortambvals(0) call in ambient(..) (file ambient.c) and lo and behold, runs
cherry. Never saw the point of that routine anyway.

See ya!

Subject: [Radiance-general] Questions about local coordinate systems
Message-ID: <3BB0A045.24652.2A73AC81@localhost>

Hi! 

I am using the transdata material for incorporating BTDF's in 
Radiance. In this context, I have to convert cartesian coordinates in 
polar coordinates.
For a surface (i.e. rectangle) the normal is determined by the right-
hand rule. So far - so good. Unfortunately, I am not sure how the 
local coordinate system for the rectangle is defined?! How are the x-
axis, y-axis and z-axis are oriented? The source ray direction 
(x,y,z) and the transmitted ray direction (Dx,Dy,Dz) are referring to 
this local coordinate system, aren't they?

Could anybody give a hint to solve my problems?

Best regards,

Frank

no- All coordinates refer to world coordinates. Radiance doesn't
support a local coordinate attached to the primitive. If you want one,
you have a calculate it manually using the surface normal and a
reference axis and do some vector crosspoducts.
Other programs (e.g. Rayshade) supply a default local coordinate system,

I guess Greg hasn't build one into it since it's not clear what
'default'
means: For one large polygon it *might* seem obvious, for a tesselated
surface it would be not.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Tonemapping code...
Message-ID: <3BB3270D.8DD2D86D@sa.erisoft.se>

Hi!

I have tried to implement the tonemapping but the radiance site seems to
be down so I can't looak at all the code. All I have is tonemap.*. I
have managed to get something which compiles and runs but I seem to get
a linear mapping.
Either my code is wrong, likely.
Or the data I send into the mapping is wrong, even "likelier".

This is how it is done.
 Read an HDR file
     Convert RGBE data like this
        Procedure rgbe2float(var red, green, blue : Double; rgbe :
rgbetype);
        var
          f : double;
        begin
          if (rgbe[3] <> 0) then
          begin  //nonzero pixel
            f := power(2,rgbe[3]-(128+8));
            red := rgbe[0] * f;
            green := rgbe[1] * f;
            blue := rgbe[2] * f;
          end
          else
          begin
            red := 0;
            green := 0;
            blue := 0.0;
          end;
        end;

For all pixels in image
  Get RGB as float values
  Convert to XYZ
  Y := Y * 100;
  If Y = 0 then
    Y := 1e-4
  AddToHist(Y);

ComputeMap

For all pixels in image
  Get RGB as float values
  Convert to XYZ
  Y := Y * 100;
  If Y = 0 then
    Y := 1e-4
  Map(X, Y, Z);

Am I totally wrong here or?

Many thanx in advance/Erik
