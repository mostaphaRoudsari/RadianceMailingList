RADIANCE WORKSHOP REGISTRATION DUE AUGUST 31

We have enough registrants that we are OK for the workshop finances, so 
if any of you were waiting to buy your non-refundable tickets, please go 
ahead.  We have at least 10 confirmed speakers (plus me and Raphael), 
and about as many additional "listeners" who have sent in their 
registrations.  We need to get the rest by the end of this month.

The tentative agenda and registration forms are available at the 
following website:

	http://www.eif.ch/~compag/rw/

If you are a speaker, we also need a final abstract and any materials 
you would like to include on the CD-ROM by August 31 as well.

Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you there!

Hi Randolph, hi all,

two thoughts:
How does a user know the real visual appearance of the "light yellowish
wood" he finds in the library ? Plus variants like "polished" "slightly
polished" etc. One may supply photographs of the real thing, but I'm not
sure that's good enough.
Secondly, measuring materials (spectral and/or angular) is, even with
automated and fast machinery, some work, data processing and modeling
are too, especially for an easily increasing number of materials, such
as in a catalogue.  

It'll be very valuable to get feedback from users how they would use any
form of catalogue - education or project work, for filling in data when
no materials are given in a project or for matching a given material in
a project ?

I had the idea of compiling a reference sample catalogue, around 8-12
material samples (e.g. 3x6cm) initially, plus their measurement data and
fitted Radiance model. Would be quite handy for projects and feasible
too, using my 12 year old, still used and fully automated
gonio-photometer at FhG-ISE or a newer one, but I doubted there'll be
enough interest. 

Any comments welcomed
-Peter

Well, it's still a good start, for the newbies (like me) especially.  
Learning by trial and error is so time consuming; a "starter set" of 
materials that are maybe from a common pallete, that could be 
used as a starting point for experimentation could help the trial and 
error process move along a bit more quickly.

Here's my perspective, coming from the Lighting Designer-who-
uses-Lightscape side of the fence: we tend to use "value-only" 
materials in Lightscape (ie, hue=0, saturation=0, value=.xx, where 
".xx" is the "reflectance" of the material).  The limited reflection & 
transmittance capability of Lightscape does not allow for really 
complex material definitions.  In addition, most other lighting 
design calculation programs used in the US (Lumen Micro, AGI, 
etc) don't support anything more than a reflectance value.  So long 
ago I adopted this simplified method of material definition in 
Lightscape.  Our models are greyscale representations of spaces.  
We like to think of them as "electronic foam core models". We shy 
away from hyper realism in the interest of time, and also in the 
interest of reducing the number of variables.  

But I've always wanted to learn Radiance, and the latest debacle 
with Lightscape going the way of the dinasour (and the advent of 
OS X) have pushed me into the radiance camp at long last.  So 
now I have this wonderfully capable calculation program, and 
suddenly have all these possibilities in terms of materials and 
reflection models.  It's exciting, but daunting.

So, a catalog of materials with known properties, perhaps tested 
with your gonio-photometer would allow me to create Radiance 
models that I could stand behind.  Even if it's not all-inclusive, at 
least if there were a selection of common materials with known 
performances, we could use them and then extrapolate as 
necessary, until a more fully-developed library is created.

Well, I for one *am* interested!!  I actually have been meaning to 
ask you if your device is available to test submitted samples, 
Peter.  I'm involved in a 1/2-scale gallery mockup right now, costing 
the museum client hundreds of thousands of dollars, because 
Lightscape was in no way up to the challenge of testing the 
glazings.  Radiance probably could have, but not without good 
BRDF data.  Only way to obtain that is with your gonio-photometer. 
 Would this be an option in the future, perhaps for a fee?  We send 
you samples, you send us data files?

Hi,

its an iteresting coincidence that this question is asked right now. I
did spend some work on this, too, however tackling the topic from a
completely different, namely the aesthetical/visualisation point of
view. It will be a part of my short presentation at the workshop in
sept/oct.
Generally, I judge something like a materials library a necessary thing
not only for beginners but for all users, especially the ones without
programming experience. As Rob already pointed out, this doesn't have to
be a 1000-entry catalogue, just a set of examples which covers usual
applications and, more important, offers a guideline to the matter for
each user to create new descriptions fitting the individual needs.
Applying a material description to an object is already difficult enough
within Radiance :), but this is another matter..

 BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) database with 
reflectance measurements for over 60 different samples, each observed with 
over 200 different combinations of viewing and illumination directions. 
 BRDF parameter database with fitting parameters from two recent BRDF models: 
the Oren-Nayar model and the Koenderink et al. representation. These BRDF 
parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. 
 BTF (bidirectional texture function) database  with image textures from over 
60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of

Hi!

I know that there has been a thread about bumpmaps not long ago. But I found 
that Simon Crone has implemented a  texpict modifier for an old version of 
radiance. Is there anybody out there  working with this and current radiance 
releases? And why has this not been added  to the official radiance code 
branch?

I need some kind of bump-mapping, as I have a large model of a church with  
some more detailed elements. There are reliefs on parts of the building which 
exist in  their geometry, but I don't want to model the relief ;-) BTW, this 
would make the model too large, too.

So I will have to use colorpict for now... but I don't really like this... We 
have all those nice bumpmap features in our modeling software, and now I have 
to tell the others that I work with mapped images... ;-)

BTW, any hints regarding black/white-images as colorpict-maps?

Thank you, CU, Lars.

I think a even little catalogue with maybe a few materials would be great, 
not with the standard materials, but with those one can't easily describe 
without special measurement hardware (e.g. I still don't know how to describe 
a surface of gold mosaic). I am working with radiance for university projects 
here. On the other hand, I have my little collection of marble surfaces that 
I got from my current work.

BTW, while not really fitting to the subject line, do you have a MacOS X 
version of rshow? A friend of mine started with radiance on OS X, and there 
is a nice previewer missing ;-)

CU Lars.

What's wrong with the "texdata" primitive?  You'll have to convert your 
bump maps to ASCII data files.  The in-memory size is the same as if the 
input were from a picture.  The reason I didn't use pictures to describe 
the surface normal perturbation map is because they don't support 
negative values.  What form is your input?  If they're height fields, 
then you'll have to derive surface normal perturbations from these.  I 
never liked or supported the use of height fields for bump maps, because 
there is no definitive mapping from a height field to a surface normal 
map, which is what you really want for this type of texture.

>
> BTW, any hints regarding black/white-images as colorpict-maps?

Just use the colorpict map with "grey grey grey" as the modifier 
functions.  If you don't like using 3x as much memory as single-channel 
data, then you'll have to convert your data to ASCII again and use the 
brightdata primitive.

The "glrad" program seems to work on my system, though it's not terribly 
fast.  This is a new program that comes with 3.4 and uses the same mouse 
interface as the holodeck program rholo but just draws the scene 
cosine-shaded using OpenGL primitives.  Doesn't work too well for large 
models, but if the model's reasonably small, OpenGL handles it OK.

Most Radiance related sites have a collection of links, but
they tend to point to the same set of "usual suspects".
This includes mine, although I have tried to apply a somewhat
more systematic categorization than most.

Maybe the best thing would be to maintain a canonical list
collaboratively. As a path of least resistance, I could offer to
start a section for Radiance related links in the Lighting Wiki.
Since everybody can edit any page in the Wiki, this might give
us the most complete collection with the least effort. if you
know about a link, just add it yourself: http://lightingwiki.com/

An alternative location would be radiance-online.org, but for
the moment it would involve a significantly larger administrative
overhead to do it there (unless Peter wants to install a wiki too).
In any case, I'm crossposting this to the radiance-general list
there, as the topic is not exclusively related to DR.

Message-ID: <200208191704.NAA15172@bellerophon.cnchost.com>

I recently posted a question regarding perforated 
metal.  The material worked great, but I had to do a 
lot of tedious manual labor getting it to work right 
on a 3D arch due to the changes in surface normal of 
each section of the arch.

So, I've been wondering if there is a better way to 
handle adding orientation specific materials to mesh 
geometry.  (practically all the "advanced" materials 
in radiance seem to be orientation specific)  So, is 
there a tool that will facilitate this process?  
Seems like it would need to read a rad file, 
calculate the surface normals for the polygons, and 
then write out a corresponding material file & 
possibly new rad file to go with the material file.  
My guess is that's how it would need to work.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!  Mark

Hello Mark and all

You can use barycentric coordinates on triangular polygons to handle the
normals and other info. I use this in ConRad to preserve the uv info from
3ds files and to allow for smoothing, by interpolating the 3 normals. Both
needs a special cal file.
(The smoothing is not available to the public yet).
With this method it should be possible to do, what you're looking for.

Hi Mark !

Radiance provides the surface normal of the actual ray hit as Nx, Ny,
Nz. These data are accessible by the caculation engine evaluating the
cal-files, in the same way as the coordinates of the ray hit (Px, Py,
Pz) and some other stuff.

This means that you have to analyze in which way your texture or the
appearance to be produced by it depends on the surface normal, and then
adapt it to the new normal with help of the Nx/Ny/Nz values. (Generally,
this will be a rotation).
By this, the textures can be adjusted to the normals without having to
know the object on which they are applied.

Message-ID: <3D62B271.45DA4296@fes.uwaterloo.ca>

When you run the rad command the first thing it does is to call on rpict
with arguments like the following where the resolution, -x, and, -y, are 64.
The output pic image is then piped to /dev/null

rpict -vu 0 0 1 -vf ca1.vf -dp 1024 -ar 32 -ms 2.5 -ds .3 -dt .1 -dc .5 -dr
1 -sj .7 -st .1 -ab 3 -af sc5.amb -aa .15 -ad 768 -as 196 -av 0.5 0.5 0.5
-lr 6 -lw .002 -x 64 -y 64 -ps 1 sc5.oct > /dev/null

What is the purpose of this call on rpict?

The second call to rpict which does the real work following the above would
look like:

rpict -vu 0 0 1 -vf ca1.vf -x 2048 -y 1536 -ps 4 -pt .08 -dp 1024 -ar 32 -ms

Subject: [Radiance-general] oconv
Message-ID: <3D62B53A.B4D905C0@fes.uwaterloo.ca>

A little while ago I wrote about using the i option to combine smaller
octrees into a larger one. This is described in chapter 8 of the Radiance
text, section 8.5 on large data sets. Page 467 give the following example:

oconv -f fl.lgt st.lgt cl.lgt -i e_twr.oct -i w_shr.oct ...  > bridge.oct

My experience with this approach is that you will get an error message
complaining that the file "-i" cannot be found. If you reverse the arguments
to avoid this message by placing the i options first followed by -f and the
.lgt files (or rad files in my case), then only the last i option (say
w_shr.oct) is included in the output octree (bridge.oct in this case). The
only way of combining octrees that works for me is the approach of using the
octrees as instances as described on the same page 467 in the text. Could
someone clarify how the i option can be used?

That is called the overture calculation; it's a way of populating the
ambient cache file with useful data, which speeds up subsequent
renderings.  Since it's a tiny file (64x64 pixels) the computation 
does not take long, but the abmient file can be used for 
subsequent larger images.  

... and that would be my first *answer* posted to this list, opposed 
to the usual litany of questions. Hooray!  (awaiting corrections...)

Hoooray !! Bring on some Champagne ...

by the way, I still have to tell you about the Chi-Chi's, but I rather
think I should keep this out of the radiance-newsgroup .. :-)

Subject: [Radiance-general] Solar penetration
Message-ID: <EF5077DDD024D411B6B100C0DFE0D9340DCCB2@SERVER01>

When I did 'Building Science' many years ago, we used "solar protractors" to
read off the suns altitude and azimuth at different times of the year. The
solar protractor was a plot of the suns path across a hemisphere for
different times of the day for a given latitude, generally printed on a A4
bit of clear plastic. This was used in assessing orientation of designs in
plan and overhangs/shading in section. Alternatively we could use it to
assess solar penetration from a point inside the building by marking out on
the protractor the area of sky visible through openings.

What I would like to do is step back a bit to the solar protractor idea. I
want to plot the sun's path across the sky from a specified view - say for
the solstices and equinox - annotate the time of day, and overlay on a
previously rendered view. I think this could be a more graphic illustration
of when and for how long the sun will penetrate into a space. It should be
quicker than several animations.

I think this could be quite easily done by rendering sequences of empty
scenes from the required viewpoint and combining them and the fully rendered
scene using pcomb. The sun positions could appear as dots. (Would the 0.5
degree angle subtended by sun be too small?). Can anyone help me with
functions I would need to feed pcomb - to convert "suns" to dots and the
skys to white graphic infomation and how do I automate the annotating? The
final compositing could be done with Photoshop. I have tried the long way
round - plotting the sun paths on cad - but this seemed unneccessarily
fiddly and potentially inaccurate.

Many thanks

Nothing to do with Radiance, but some of your might be interested in
knowing that these are still available.  It's now called the
Pilkington Sun Angle Calculator, and they can be ordered from the
Society of Building Science Educators at
<http://www.sbse.org/resources/sac/index.htm>.

Message-ID: <E17hnG0-0001yC-00@saturn.dmu.ac.uk>

For a novel approach to solar penetration using
a Radiance-based technique, see:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/sol_pen/jmcibs.html

(HTML slide-show, 25 slides).

The space-time maps of solar irradiation generated
using this approach are far more revealing of the
performance of shading devices than traditional
methods based on shading patterns.  It's a new
idea and there isn't yet an end-user version.

Thanks John

Its all a bit beyond me however. It sounds perfectly suited to assist in
compliance with the new Part L Builiding Regs. I'm sure you'll have a lot of
interest in an end user version.

I've thought a bit more about it and have two or three ideas. What I want to
establish is a bit more rudimentary: ie if/when does the sign shine directly
into users eyes.

Hi Thomas,

Rob Guglielmetti's response about the overture calculation used by rad 
is correct except for the reason why.  It is not merely to speed up the 
final rendering calculation -- the time spent in the overture 
calculation is greater than the time saved in the final one.  The real 
reason rad does this is to minimize interpolation artifacts as explained 
at the top of page 551 in the "Rendering with Radiance" chapter 12 on 
the indirect calculation.

Omigosh.   I don't know how this one slipped by the editor -- no one 
ever pointed it out to me before, but it must have been pretty late at 
night when Rob typed it in...  Quoting the oconv man page:

> SYNOPSIS
>        oconv [ -i octree | -b xmin ymin zmin size ][ -n objlim ][
>        -r maxres ][ -f ][ -w ][ - ] [ input ..  ]

This is meant to indicate that the options must preceed the scene input 
files.  The man page doesn't explicitly state that only one octree may 
be added to, but it should.  The reason for this is because the starting 
(-i) octree defines the boundaries of the scene, which may not be 
changed when adding new objects.  If you were to attempt to combine two 
octrees, their different boundaries would make them impossible to 
reconcile -- you might as well start fresh from the objects, 
themselves.  The only reason for building octrees incrementally is if 
oconv runs out of space building the whole octree at once, or you are 
trying to save time in an animation where only a few objects are 
changing in an otherwise static environment.

I'd like to expand upon what Greg said about using oconv, but you might also take a browse through the old Radiance archives as the issue has been discussed in depth.

To quickly highlight some of the advanced uses of oconv, instances and octrees...

The first scene.rad file to be oconv'd must use the -b option to define a large enough boundary to encompass all future scene additions, as Greg mentioned.  You can get the boundary size for your scene by doing "getbbox all_scene.rad" or a "getinfo -d all_scene.oct".  The latter presumes that you have successfully completed an octree generation.  Of course, for either approach you could pick a subset of your scene geometry which you know contain the greatest x, y, and z-dimensions.  Note that the output of these two methods is different and the version that matches the input needed by oconv is the "getinfo -d" version.  Then, each scene .rad file you add into the original octree is specified, one at a time, using "oconv -i scene.oct newscene.rad".  

The instance primitive is more general, flexible, and much easier to decypher later on when you want to recreate what you've done.

Other tips:

Oconv works much better when the scene geometry is world-axis-aligned.  Rotate the scene sub-components after oconv-ing them using the instance primitive type.  For example:

void instance building1
7 building1.oct -rz 25.2 -t 1.0 2.0 3.0
0
0 

And of course, do not rotate the scene to align it with the Y-axis pointing north, but rather, rotate the sky (gensky | xform -rz ) the opposite direction!  These two tricks will solve most problems with oconv.

When the going really gets tough, i.e., there is just too much scene complexity, then you may need to use lots of instances.  At some point, say 6 instances (one more than the default value of -n), you will notice that oconv will take a lot longer to finish and you will get tired of waiting for all of your instances to be merged into the master octree.  It is reasonable to increase the "-n" parameter of oconv when doing the final oconv.  You can set -n equal to the number of instances.  This will prevent oconv from trying to sub-divide the instances so that no single voxel has more than n number of entities.

Greg at one time claimed that using instances and sub-instances, it would be possible to model the entire earth down to a resolution of 1 inch!!!

Another famous Greg Ward quote, "Everything you need to know about Radiance is documented somewhere, once.  Your challenge is to find that one place."

What I have found to be incredibly valuable in finding that one documented location is the online Microsoft-format "help" document that we created for Desktop Radiance.  The installation program for Desktop Radiance should, if my memory serves me, be able to install just the help docs if you regrettably don't care about the rest of this fine program. :-)  The help docs include all of the manual pages, the reference manual to radiance (with primitive descriptions), user manual, tips and techniques (with the "notes", and quite a bit of other stuff) and .  Give it a try!

-Chas

Depends what you're looking for - help/FAQ/trouble-shooting , nice
examples of what people achieved, references to companies offering

for the moment "wiki" is not top on my nice-to-have list at
radiance-online.org, although the ability for others to contribute to
some sort of knowledge base via a web frontend is.

(crossport to Desktop Radiance as the question origined there)
