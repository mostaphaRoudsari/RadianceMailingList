Hi all!

I realized today's December 2nd, 2002!
Has Radiance been released under GPL, or not?

It seems that nothing has changed at radsite.lbl.gov ...

Dear Radiance community,

 

Following your enthusiastic response to the announcement of our plans
for "open sourcing" the Radiance software, we are happy to announce the
new Radiance Open Source License! The objective of the Radiance Open
Source License is to encourage further development and distribution of
the Radiance software and derivative applications, so that a larger
number of users can benefit from Radiance's capabilities.  

 

The Radiance Open Source License follows the "Apache" open source
paradigm, which provides complete freedom on the use, development and
distribution of the Radiance source code and executables.  The initial
version of the Radiance software that is distributed under the new open
source license is version 3.4, which has been available through the
Radiance web site (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance) since January 2002.

 

To address the expected "versioning" issue, LBNL will maintain an
official version of the Radiance software that will include all of the
new functionality developed by LBNL and contributed by Radiance
developers that has been evaluated and approved for inclusion.  This
will increase the chances of maintaining a version that includes as many
improvements as possible.  LBNL intends to use a small group of
advisors, headed by Greg Ward, the "father" of Radiance to evaluate
software contributions and include them in upcoming releases.

 

LBNL is currently supporting the development on a new, "ANSIfied"
version of the Radiance source code.  This new version is developed by
Greg Ward and will result in code that is easier to use under both UNIX
and Windows operating systems.  We currently expect to release the new
version sometime during spring of 2003.

 

LBNL encourages Radiance developers to contribute enhancements and
improvements to the Radiance software back to the Radiance community.
LBNL will be happy to evaluate contributions for inclusion in the
official LBNL version.  We intend that end-user applications using the
LBNL version of the Radiance software will be entitled to use a "Powered
by Radiance" logo (although this logo does not exist yet) to indicate
that the underlying engine is the LBNL-approved version of the Radiance
engine. 

 

We look forward to exciting new opportunities on improving the Radiance
software and making it easier to use!

 

For the LBNL Radiance Development Team,

Message-ID: <A3B2C545704E3E429C597334E9456EE305537881@jsc-mail01.jsc.nasa.gov>

I am a naïve user of Radiance involved in modeling various lighting
conditions encountered during spacecraft docking/berthing operations.
Recently I encountered some unexpected luminance values when modeling
distant views of docking lights.  

As the separation between the viewpoint and a light source is increased, the
luminance of the source should remain constant.  Sources I have modeled
using Radiance behave in this way until they occupy a solid angle relative
to the observer of less than 4.9e-06 steradian or so (for example, a
two-inch radius disk source at 134 feet).  Beyond this distance, however,
the modeled luminance of the source decreases in inverse proportion to the
square of the separation distance.  This behavior is only exhibited by light
sources.  In contrast, models of small reflective surfaces illuminated by a
fixed local source exhibit constant luminance as the surface viewing
distance is increased, finally disappearing from view altogether when they
occupy a solid viewing angle of approximately 2.2e-06 steradian.  Can anyone
explain the light sources'departure from ideal constancy of luminance with
distance?

I'll gladly provide additional information about my modeling attempts to
anyone interested.

Hi Charles !

I haven't examined the matter in full detail, but I think I may give a
first hint:

In rpict, an extra "source-drawing" function is called for tiny sources,
(resp. those appearing tiny) and this is done (most probably) for the
following reason: If an object is very small and far away, it may not be
hit by a view ray at all. That wouldn't matter much for normal stuff,
but for sources, this might be confusing. So this "drawsources" function
assures that at least a bright spot appears. 
I've tested it the other way, if the routine is disabled, a tiny source
becomes invisible when the distance is too big or the solid angle too
small, (ressembling the disappearing of your illuminated objects). I
noticed the effect already at solid angles of 1e-5 steradian, of course
it depends strongly on the absolute pixel resolution of the image. 

As said, I haven't examined this "drawsources" routine, but probably it
doesn't perform an exact calculation as its purpose is just to create an
impression of the source being there far away as tiny spot. This could
explain the deviations observed by you. Although, I am wondering about
this, too, as just displaying the original luminance would be no
problem. Hmm?!?

Message-ID: <3DF9A4BD.83CDF5A7@t-online.de>

Hi again,

just one more short contemplation on the matter: In order for something
to appear in an image, obviously the minimum drawing size is a pixel.
This means if far away tiny sources are to be drawn in the image to
generate a vivid impression, they have to be spread out over a larger
area, say, e.g from a quarter of a pixel to a full pixel. In order not
to exaggerate, it makes sense to reduce the luminance accordingly. Now,
the necessary amout of "spreading out" increases proportional to the
square of the distance, so the luminance has to decrease accordingly,
which would explain your observations.

Hi Charles,

Carsten is probably right -- the src/rt/srcdraw.c routines are likely 
responsible for the observations you are making in your renderings.  
These routines were included to prevent annoying aliasing artifacts 
that result when sources are too small to be reliably sampled by rpict 
view rays.

I can explain the reasoning behind the routines thus.  Normally, rpict 
is followed by a pfilt command to perform anti-aliasing, and ideally 
you would send such a large number of initial samples (oversampling) 
that you were guaranteed to see everything there is to see in each 
pixel.  These pixels would then be filtered down (averaged together) to 
compute the final output pixel, which would then be equivalent to the 
photon sampling that goes on in a physical camera.  (Equivalent -- not 
identical, as rpict simulates an ideal pinhole camera with zero 
extent.)  If we were able to perform this calculation in our lifetimes, 
what we would see for light sources (and for all objects) is a constant 
pixel luminance while the object completely covered the pixel, then a 
proportionally decreasing value as the object covered less than a full 
pixel as it moved farther away.  As Carsten pointed out, an object's 
diminishing size with distance is proportional to 1/r^2 since there are 
two dimensions to an image, and that is what you should see and would 
see with a real camera.

In short, if you apply pfilt following rpict, you should see an 
approximation of this behavior for all objects, not only light sources. 
  Since the straight output of rpict has only one sample (at most) per 
pixel, the sample either hits an objec or it doesn't.  The reason you 
get effective oversampling for light sources is because of the special 
routines in srcdraw.c.  The approximation in these routines is not 
exact (nothing is exact in a simulation), but it's fairly close to 
being correct -- certainly a lot closer than you could get with Monte 
Carlo sampling.

If this behavior is a problem, you can couple the vwrays program with 
rtrace to avoid all of rpict's sampling optimizations.

Message-ID: <C80A00EE-1B7A-11D7-BE6C-000393824274@rumblestrip.org>

Hi everyone (happy holidays!)-

Quick question.  Since I use a laptop (PowerBook/OSX) to do my Radiance 
experiments, I have always been loath to start any lengthy calculations 
on it, since I inevitably need to put the thing to "sleep" for 
transport to/from work, etc.  The long calcs always run on a PC I have 
at the office.  But it would be nice to be able to do test scenes on my 
laptop, and not have to worry about interrupting the process when I put 
the thing to sleep.  So the question is, CAN I?  That is to say, what 
happens if I start an rpict or rad process, then put the laptop to 
sleep?  If I wake it up later will it pick up where it left off, or 
will there be errors in the calculation from that point on?

An inquiring mind wants to know.

Hi, I dont know if this helps you, but you might try to let the process
work in the background,
using the '&' sign at the end of the command like:  rpict option option
model.oct &
You also might try to set the monitor to a non-existing external monitor,
that will cause the lcd to turn off, and maybe that saves enough energy to
keep your laptop awake during your travel.

Regards,

Iebele

Hi Rob,

if all else fails, read the instructions :). OK, I haven't done this
myself, but once I had at least a quick glimpse on them, and I remember
that rpict has a recovery-option (-r or -ro ??) which checks an
unfinished picture and resumes calculation at the point where it
stopped. Maybe this suits your needs, (haven't tried it myself so far),
so check the manpage to find out more.

ok
here pillo from his little (1 feet) ibook.. ;-))
if i understood well your question:
"may i use radiance in apple systems and putting them to sleep... what 
happens???"

and my bad english summary is right the answer is:

1) YES you can run radiance, putting the mac to sleep (SLEEP and not 
SHUT DOWN) and then wake it up to continue the calculation without any 
problem (i usually do it when i come back home from work).

2) if you want to logout or to quit the terminal you ca use the command 
'nohup' followed by the command task not to be suspended (exemple:  
nohup rpict -ad 1231212......)

3) if radiance quits (as my friend Carsten said - potato factor expert 
!!!)  you can recover your pict by recovery option (i tried it and it 
works, also on apple...!!)

i hope this helps.


nice holidays to all

Sleep mode should not affect a background (or foreground) calculation 
in any way.  The processor picks up where it left off, and the only 
thing that has really changed as far as the programs can tell is the 
system clock.  If reporting is switched on in rpict, you will see under 
the real time section that you have quite a bit of unaccounted time in 
the calculation, but the results won't be affected.

Good news.  Thanks Greg, Pillo, Carsten and Iebele, for the info. 
Iebele, for the record, your tip would not help me because what I am 
looking to do is to put my laptop in a bag and take it to/from work. 
When you close the lid, it automatically goes to sleep.  So I was really 
interested in seeing what affect sleep mode has on an ongoing 
calculation, not so much  how to avoid causing my computer to go to 
sleep.  Thanks for the info though!

P.S.
I'm approaching my one year anniversary with my PowerBook, and I'm still 
very much in love.  OSX is really an amazing OS (which is to say, UNIX 
is amazing).  Coming from the underpriviledged world ruled by Bill 
Gates, I'm constantly amazed by the depth of UNIX; that Apple was able 
to build UNIX into a more user-friendly OS is indeed a godsend for 
people like me.

Happy New Year, to all the photon wranglers on the Radiance-General list!

I'm trying to download Radiance, but radsite.lbl.gov seems to be 
unreachable (I tried from 2 different locations from Europe). Any 
hint here? Is Radiance (for Linux) available at Radiance Workshop ISO
image (just downloading it)?

Kind regards.

Hi Aleksandar-

It appears to be unreachable from here (east coast of the USA) as well. 
  AFAIK, Radiance was not distributed on the workshop CD.  I'm sure it's 
just a temporary outage; you might want to just try again tomorrow at 
radsite.lbl.gov.

Well, since LBNL is shut down for the week, there doesn't seem much 
hope in getting the Radiance website back up immediately.  It's stupid 
not to be able to grab the distribution now that it's Open Source, so 
for the time being, I've hung it off my own website at:

	http://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/gwlarson/pickup/

I don't have the patches for the 3.4 distribution, so be sure to go to 
the Radiance website to pick those up before you use ies2rad, which has 
some problems in this release....

While you're at my website, feel free to download the latest version of 
Photophile, the image browser I've been working on for Mac OS X.  (I 
don't have any other operating systems available at this time -- sorry!)

If you want the patches soon, I can email them to you as an attachment.
I downloaded the patch file (rad3R4.tar.gz) from LBL on April 2002.
The file is only 72K.

Let me know if you're in a hurry for these.
