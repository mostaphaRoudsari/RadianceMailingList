Dear Radiance Community,

 

This message is about the future of the Radiance software.  Some changes
are in store and we want to inform you of our plans.

 

As you know, Berkeley Lab has been developing Radiance and distributing
Radiance executables at no cost to the public for over 10 years.  The
Radiance source code has been available for academic and non-commercial
use at no charge for many years and several companies have purchased
licenses to distribute Radiance or Radiance-based products commercially.

 

During the last decade, a number of software developers have contributed
code to the Radiance software, complementing the main development
efforts supported at the Berkeley Lab.  At present time, the funding for
Radiance related developments at Berkeley Lab is very limited, but there
is still strong interest by software developers to further enhance the
Radiance software because Radiance remains unique in its ability to
accurately simulate the propagation of light.

 

In investigating alternatives to leverage interest from the Radiance
community with the core code development from Berkeley Lab, we have
decided to make Radiance an "open source" software product.  The goal of
this is to facilitate continuous development of enhanced versions of
Radiance, whether from bug fixes or additional features and
functionality, all of which we anticipate will be contributed by the
larger Radiance development community.

 

Subject to any required approvals from US DOE, we intend to launch
Radiance as an open source product on December 1, 2002. Beginning on
that date, Radiance source code and executables will be available for
download to any party for any use (commercial or non-commercial),
pursuant to an appropriate open source license agreement.  These plans
also apply to the Radiance engine of the Desktop Radiance software and
are considered for other parts of the Desktop Radiance code as well.

 

We believe that this open source initiative represents an exciting step
forward in ensuring Radiance's continued technical development and
widespread adoption.  We welcome your comments to our proposed plan by
June 30.

 

Regards,

 

Kostas Papamichael

Hi,
=20
We are working on simulations involving complex glazing assemblies and
day lighting.  We use LBL Window4.1, and LBL Optics5 to construct and
simulate these assemblies. We now want to use the assemblies we have
created in Radiance.  We see that Optics5 exports "Radiance" files.  Has
anyone used this method to simulate glazing systems?  Any info would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Hi,
here pillo (me, superBEGINNER, may be spiderBEGINNER)
  with some questions about road design with Radiance:

i would like to use UNI's r-tables (UNI 10489),
where  r=[(luminance/illuminance)*cos3(g)],
to describe asphalt behavior.
i think BRDF is the way.
but i need some advices:

where i can found some examples of BRDF usage?
is it possible only with r tables ?

best regards,
pillo

PS r coefficients are measured at point P in function of the angle (g) 
between source rays (looking at P) and  surface normal, and the 
horizontal angle (b) between source rays and observation direction 
(looking at P).
The observation direction has a vertical, fixed, angle of 1°.
the source is tought punctual.

Interesting.  I didn't know about those programs.  Seems 
to be a large collection of glazing definitions.  When you 
export to radiance in Optics5, you get something like this:

======================
void  glass       GRAY_6_glass
0
0
3     0.492     0.490     0.515

void  BRTDfunc    GRAY_6_front
10
      0.049     0.049     0.051
      0.451     0.449     0.472
      0 0 0
      .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

void  BRTDfunc    GRAY_6_back
10
      0.050     0.050     0.053
      0.451     0.449     0.472
      0 0 0
      .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
=====================

So it appears to be defining a highly accurate material 
definition using BRTF.  Could some of the gurus comment? 
 This could be a useful database for the novice Radiance 
user with a skimpy materials library (me).

Subject: [Radiance-general] Compilation on Solaris 8 SPARC
Message-ID: <200206042152.g54LqAX23299@inet.kitchenandassociates.com>

Hello:

I'm having difficulty getting Radiance complied on Solaris 8. (Note:  I 
successfully compiled and generated test images on SuSE Linux 8.0)

The system is an Enterprise250, 2x400MHz processors with 1GB RAM and gigs of 
available storage.  It's running Solaris 8, 07/01 Release, with the latest 
8_Recommended patch cluster (Kernel version: SunOS 5.8 Generic 108528-14 
February 2002)

I have all GNU tools from the Solaris Companion CD installed, (gcc & gmake).

I have tried running ./makeall install two different ways without success, 
and I've tried each way using both the default directories (/usr/local/....) 
and my preferred directories (/usr/local/radiance/bin  
/usr/local/radiance/lib)

 
1.  Using the Solaris cc and make, virtually nothing works.  I get the 
'language optional package not installed' error on pretty much every instance 
of cc being invoked.  I decided that it was probably better to pursue the GNU 
route, so...

2.  Using gcc and gmake, my rmake file is as follows:

#!/bin/sh
exec gmake "SPECIAL=ogl" \
        "OPT=-O -DSPEED=80" \
        "MACH=-DALIGN=double -I/usr/openwin/include -L/usr/openwin/lib 
-DNOSTEREO
-DDCL_ATOF -DBIGMEM" \
        ARCH=sun "COMPAT=bmalloc.o strcmp.o getpagesize.o" \
        INSTDIR=/usr/local/radiance/bin \
        LIBDIR=/usr/local/radiance/lib \
        CC=gcc "$@" -f Rmakefile

...and I've set $RAYPATH to .:/usr/local/radiance/lib  all to no avail.  Some 
things compile and install, but I get at least one instance of the following:

error.c:37: `sys_nerr' undeclared (first use in this function)
error.c:37: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
error.c:37: for each function it appears in.)
error.c:38: `sys_errlist' undeclared (first use in this function)
gmake: *** [error.o] Error 1



...and  more importantly, pretty much all of the applications fail in the 
following manner:

gcc -I../common -L../lib -O -DSPEED=80 -DALIGN=double -I/usr/openwin/include 
-L/usr/openwin/lib -DNOSTEREO -DDCL_ATOF -DBIGMEM   -c -o psign.o psign.c
gcc -I../common -L../lib -O -DSPEED=80 -DALIGN=double -I/usr/openwin/include

I read Greg's posting about the libtiff issues with compiling on Solaris 8. 
Following those instructions allows me to get the px stuff compiled, but the 
rest of the program is my biggest headache right now.

Am I going down the wrong path by using gcc & gmake?
What else do I need to do to make this work?  I desperately need to make this 
work in the next few days so that I can test the other elements of the system 
and meet my deadline (Radfront, ArrisCAD integration, rendering throught the 
Sun Grid Engine on 30 SunBlade 100 workstations).

Thanks in advance for any assistance.  I'm looking forward to making a bunch 
of architects very, very happy....

Hi Pillo,

I don't know much about most of your question, but i can point you in the 
direction of an example application of the brtdfunc.  have a look at 
he.cal.  it doesn't actually work as well as it could (problems in 
calculation of z0 and Dsum2 which i had to fix up), but it is a working 
function file and example of application of brtdfunc.

good luck,
Phil.

Hi Rob,

These definitions are good and bad.  they allow you (or Optics5) to define 
both the specular reflectance and specular transmittance of the glasses, 
but they don't allow for any angular variation in either.  you may be 
better off just sticking with the glass primitive, using transmissivities 
calculated from the transmittances delivered by Optics5.

Hi Len,

I'm sorry to hear you're still having compile problems.  For some 
reason, your version of the GNU-C headers doesn't include a definition 
of sys_errlist or sys_nerr, which causes the compile of error.c to fail 
in src/common, and subsequently the main Radiance library doesn't get 
built.  The build all falls apart after that, as you noticed....

You will have to manually edit the src/common/error.c file with a plain 
text editor and change the following lines near the top from:

> #ifndef __GNUC__
> extern char  *sys_errlist[];    /* system error list */
> extern int  sys_nerr;           /* number of system errors */
> #endif

to:

> extern char  *sys_errlist[];    /* system error list */
> extern int  sys_nerr;           /* number of system errors */

(I.e., take off the surrounding precompiler # statements.)  After saving 
the file, rerun "makeall install".  I'm hoping the build will work after 
that, assuming this was the only problem.

-Greg

Thanks for the response, but the same thing happened using the gcc/gmake 
configuration in my previous post.  Any ideas?

Dear Desktop Radiance and Radiance community,

 

As many of you know, last year we completed a 2.0 beta version of the
Desktop Radiance software, but did not release it because of lack of
funding to provide support, i.e., respond to installation problems, bug
reports, improvement suggestions, etc.  However, since in Version 2.0
beta we have corrected several of the bugs in the 1.02 version, we
decided to release the 2.0 beta version for those who would like to try
it, with a "use at your own risk" disclaimer.

 

In addition to bug fixes, Version 2.0 beta includes editors for
user-defined materials, glazings (through links to the Optics software),
furniture and electric lighting luminaires.  However, these new editors
have not been tested extensively and may have introduced new bugs.  Both
versions are now available at the Desktop Radiance web site, at
http://radsite.lbl.gov/deskrad.  In the absence of a funded activity the
Desktop Radiance Yahoo Group will serve as the main mechanism for
support.

 

Regards,

Is there any particular reason why you're avoiding the standard
function strerror() from string.h here? As far as I understand
the documentation, sys_errlist and sys_nerr aren't really meant
for direct access by user code.  Or do we really still have to
take pre-ANSI implementations into account? If so, which ones?

Speaking more generally, I'd like to put in a strong vote for
ansifying Radiance completely. Even though this might look like a
highly tedious task (and probably is), I'd expect it to uncover
and eliminate at least a one or two dozen subtle bugs throughout
the code. In the long run, it would make all future development a
lot easier. Of course, if Radiance were to be put on public CVS
later this year, there's no reason why you would have to make
this conversion yourself...

Are there formal plans to do this at this point, do you know?  Is
LBL going to continue to maintain radsite?

It certainly would make a lot of sense though.

positively a good idea. IMHO a full rewrite would be a better
investment, timewise, than an ANSIfication, at least for the existing
core rendering. I'm not saying the core is badly written or
malfunctioning. Just that any code tends to grow over the years and
accumulated insights are sometimes best served when starting freshly
with a blank sheet. - Greg ?

Peripheral programs (practically everything apart from
rpict/rview/rtrace) will be a lot easier to port to ANSI-C and could be
dealed with in a parallel way.
 
Problems of the technical infrastruture (like setting up and running a
CVS server) are very certainly easily solved (e.g. on this machine which
handles the mailing list).

Radiance and Desktop Radiance Users,

I applaud the efforts of Lawrence Berkeley National
Lab to develop an Open Source license for Radiance and
Desktop Radiance.  Bravo!  Those of you who know me
know that this is something I've worked toward for
many years.

And to those of you seeking a more streamlined way of
contributing to and maintaining Radiance, I think that
a CVS server for Radiance would be a great idea.  But,
the future of Radiance relies upon more than a
technological solution.  There is also a need for
ongoing administrative support.  I do not know what
plans LBNL has along these lines.

And so, I think this is an appropriate time to propose
the formation of a Radiance Consortium.  Its purpose
would be to set forth a general direction for
development of Radiance, handle the management of the
source code modifications, and distribute the
different source code development lines.  The
consortium's purpose should NOT be to limit the
possible avenues of development such that progress can
only proceed along some ordained, pre-determined path.
 On the contrary, the success of Radiance has depended
upon the independent efforts of researchers around the
world since is inception almost 15 years ago!  

I think that a semi-formal organizational structure
(as opposed to an ad-hoc group of programmers)
composed of some programmers and some
technically-minded non-programmers would be
appropriate so that Radiance can go on to outlive its
original progenitors.  I also suggest that we offer a
leadership position to the firms which have purchased
$10,000 distribution licenses from LBNL, of which
there are about 6.  I like the way the "IntelliCAD
Technology Consortium" is organized and would suggest
that we mimick its structure. (www.intellicad.org)  

And for Desktop Radiance, I make the same suggestion. 
It could exist as a special interest group within the
Radiance Consortium, or as a separate entity. 
Compatibility between Desktop Radiance and IntelliCAD
would be a nobel goal for future, Open Source
development efforts for Desktop Radiance.  This would
greatly reduce the cost of ownership and eliminate a
major barrier toward widespread use of Radiance in the
architectural and lighting design communities.

The good news is that I have contacts with several
architecture/energy efficiency firms which are
interested in supporting this idea and will gladly
contribute (money and effort) to the Open Source
version of Radiance and Desktop Radiance once a
mechanism is in place to do so.  I also think that it
will be possible to find some funding to support this
effort if enough players come up into the fray and
express support for this idea.

I am willing to serve as a point man for these
efforts, but the door is open for other suggestions
and nominations.  Whatever way it falls out, I'm in
this for the long haul.  And, I've got a great domain
name to contribute.  Check out the "whois" on
"radsite.org".

With 100 Radiance-online subscribers and 200 Desktop
Radiance list subscribers, I think we have a pretty
good base of support.  I know this is going to be
controversial, but that has never stopped me in the
past.

The Desktop Radiance Yahoo Group has a "polling"
feature
(www.yahoogroups.com/group/desktopradiance/polls).  If
those of you who do not like Yahoo can plug your nose
long enough to subscribe to the Desktop Radiance list
(under a fake alias if you wish), we can utilize this
simple mechanism for polling the users to determine
which approach people favor the most.  Other ideas?

I agree that a code rewrite would be nice, but would require way more 
free time than I have, and I'm not sure I'd trust the task to someone 
else.  Making Radiance ANSI-C compatible, at least as far as adding 
function prototypes and the like, wouldn't be terribly difficult, and is 
probably a recommended first step to having others working on the code 
base.  I only wish I were more familiar with what's in ANSI-C and what's 
not.

There are two reasons Radiance wasn't converted to ANSI-C long ago.  
First, some systems (Sun in particular) were distributed with a free K&R 
compiler, but you had to pay for the ANSI-C compiler, so many people 
couldn't have built Radiance if it were ANSI-C.  Second, I had a bias 
against ANSI-C because I never ran into portability problems before its 
invention, but had nothing but trouble afterwards.  From my perspective, 
ANSI-C was a giant step backwards in compatibility, with a subsequent 
explosion of header files and prototypes and subtle system differences.  
Before ANSI, I could hop onto virtually any machine and read the header 
files to know what was going on.  After ANSI and the related attempts to 
"standardize" UNIX, I couldn't make sense of any of the headers anymore, 
since there were about a dozen #ifdef's in each one for all the various 
attempted compatibilities.

If I were to really rewrite Radiance, I would want to start from the 
ground up and take a different approach to many problems.  The process 
might take years, and it's by no means certain that the final result 
would be any better than what we currently have.  Furthermore, who would 
fund such a development effort?  It was a brutal struggle to do it in 
the first place within all the budget constraints at LBNL, and what 
little money there was for research software development there and 
elsewhere in the U.S. has all but dried up.

I solved Len's compile problems by jumping onto his machine and making a 
few changes.  Besides the sys_errlist definition, there were a couple of 
other things that were messed up due to the combination of GNU-C and 
Solaris.  That's a good idea to use strerror(), though -- I'll put that 
into the next release.  I embarrassed to say that I didn't know about it.

This is really a collection of notes on various Radiance software
engineering issues that I've gathered up into one message...

I think that who decisions about what code goes into mainline Radiance
is very important.  I, at least, want very much to see the physical accuracy
of the simulation maintained; in my view it's the engagement with
the physical behavior of light that makes Radiance so very valuable in
architectural design.  (I bow in the general direction of Greg Ward.)

Georg Mischler:
  Speaking more generally, I'd like to put in a strong vote for
  ansifying Radiance completely. Even though this might look like a
  highly tedious task (and probably is), I'd expect it to uncover
  and eliminate at least a one or two dozen subtle bugs throughout
  the code. In the long run, it would make all future development a
  lot easier.

Do I understand that you are thinking of using function prototypes
throughout?  Then I agree it's an excellent idea--in fact, I would
like to see clean compilation with strict prototype warnings.  The gcc
tool "protoize" might be useful in approaching the problem, but I say
that without experience with the tool.  I also agree with Greg Ward
Larsen about the problems of conditional compilation (and so do the
Bell Labs developers of C, see
<http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/comp.html>), and hope that whoever
handles the development avoids cluttering the code with conditionals
and their associated reliability problems.

Peter Apian-Bennewitz:
  positively a good idea. IMHO a full rewrite would be a better
  investment, timewise, than an ANSIfication, at least for the existing
  core rendering.

I agree with Greg Ward that this would be lot of work with no
guarantee of improvement at the end.  The core of Radiance works
fairly well; I think we could get bogged down trying to perfect it.
Personally, I'd rather see effort spent on new facilities, perhaps on
better support of current graphics technologies, and updating some of
the associated scripts.

Also, tendered very cautiously, it might be worth removing some of the
older system components that are not much used, or at least relegating
them to unsupported status.  I think, for instance, we could do
without Imagewriter support.<g>

That said, I will admit that I have had a very rough quarter at
school, and am unlikely to have much time to spend on this until the
fall of 2003, at least.

I second that. Additionally we might consider stepping up to C++. A
package the size of RADIANCE screams for modularity. I'm not saying we
should make liberal use of those mindbending abstractions OOP has to
offer, but simply *organise* the code and facilitate extensions. Of
course this has to be weighed against  potential portability problems.
Can C++ compilers be taken for granted on all platforms nowadays?

I second Chas' motion to start a proper Radiance consortium, and I think 
LBNL would cooperate with such an effort as well.  The main thing is to 
maintain good communication between developers and users of the 
software, as I believe that keeping this open line was Radiance's key to 
success in the first place.  A consortium web site with a proper set of 
FAQs and links to distributions and sublists for Desktop and UNIX users 
would be great.  Contribution from consortium members could take the 
form of time and a good host server on a fast connection.  We'd probably 
want a mirror site in the U.S. and Europe, and could probably continue 
to use the LBNL and ISE sites for this for the time being.

I like what Randolph had to say about code conversion.  There is a lot 
of accumulated fluff in Radiance, such as the various printer drivers.  
I never bothered to take them out because they still seem to compile, 
and they don't affect anything (other than taking up a bit of space on 
everyone's systems) since Radiance programs that are never run never 
interact with the rest of the codebase...  This is traditional, 
old-style modularity in UNIX -- a bunch of separate tools that work 
together.  It works well for many of the subproblems in rendering, 
except for the rendering process itself, which requires a rather large 
program to do the job properly.  Thus, we have rpict, rview, and rtrace, 
which could definitely use a bit of ANSI-fication and (in an ideal 
world) a major rewrite in C++.  I have had really good luck porting C++ 
between various platforms, even (shudder) Windows, though the tools 
there are horrible in my opinion, at least the Microsoft offerings.

I should mention that I am currently working on an image browser and 
cataloguer for JPEG and high dynamic-range images on Mac OS X, and I've 
been employing a combination of C++ (for new bits) with links to some 
old ANSI and non-ANSI C modules for reading and writing various 
formats.  I just put up with the compiler noise with the latter, but 
since I know the code works and it requires almost no maintainence at 
this stage, I just ignore it.  Perhaps I've gotten too used to ignoring 
compiler warnings over the years, but I'm sorry, casting every float 
assignment is just so tedious and so ugly, that I just switch certain 
warnings off even in my new efforts.

Rewriting oconv and the core renderers in C++ might be worthwhile, but 
it would take at least 6 months full-time, and would introduce many more 
bugs than it would eliminate.  In fact, I doubt it would eliminate any 
bugs.  I'm sure there are still a few lurking in there, and I'm always 
amazed when I find something that's been wrong with the code for years 
and never surfaced or had a harmless manifestation, sort of like junk 
DNA in an organism that evolved over eons...  And, as much as I'm 
getting comfortable with C++, which has to be the most overblown 
language since ADA, I think such a rewrite would ultimately be slower 
than the current C implementation, however carefully we approached it.

Having said that, if it started raining money over my house tomorrow, I 
would leave my job and devote myself to some serious development work.  
In particular, I've had some ideas brewing for years on a radically 
different approach to rendering, which eliminates explicit geometry 
throughout most of the scene, and uses a mathematical construct (TBD) 
for both geometry and light scattering.  I could see pursuing something 
like this in a Ph.D. program, but my current financial constraints don't 
permit me the luxury of enrolling in one.  Such a renderer, even if it 
worked, would probably be an adjunct rather than a replacement for 
Radiance, which has been carefully tuned for architectural rendering 
applications.

Getting back to ANSI-fication, the main problem I have in modifying the 
Radiance codebase is a lack of knowledge of what works on various 
platforms.  The portability fixes that have accumulated over the years 
are still functioning and useful, many of them, and some are useless.  
Separating one from the other is difficult for me, since I have limited 
access these days to different systems, though the proliferation of UNIX 
flavors seems to have slowed down at least, thankfully.  As long as we 
offer solid support of Linux, FreeBSD (including Mac OS X, my current 
fave) and Solaris, we should do pretty well.  Perhaps the thing to do is 
for each of you who has experience in the relevant systems to put 
together a list of compile problems you've noticed.  We could scour the 
code for #ifdef's and identify ones that can be eliminated or aren't 
working properly.  I have kept these to a minimum, so that shouldn't 
take long.  Third, we could identify useless programs that don't need to 
be supported in the main distribution.  Finally, we can begin on 
function prototypes and header inclusion for ANSI-C, making sure our 
calls are to supported system and library functions, rather than ones 
that may become obsolete.

We're probably looking at a week or two of one programmer's time, and a 
few hours from each volunteer.  Who wants to step forward?

An afterthought to my last message.  The process of ANSI-fication should 
probably include a merge of the Desktop Radiance version, at least 
insofar as supporting Windows compilation as well.  I don't know how 
much additional time this would take, as I'm not familiar with the 
changes that were made to the code on that branch.  Some of them we 
might want to include, but I don't know how long it would take to sort 
it all out.  Probably a couple of additional weeks and some good 
communication with the main Windows branch author(s).

Yes, I am also in favour of a somewhat formal organization in
charge of the further development of Radiance. I'm not sure if
the ITC is the optimal role model, though, as their membership
options can involve significant amounts of money. There are a
number of more open software consortiums around, all of which
seem to be organized in a similar way. Examples are the Python
Software Foundation (http://www.python.org/psf/), the Apache
Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/), and others. For
some reason (probably tax related), those organizations are all
incorporated in the state of Delaware. I'm sure that we could
ask some of the members of the existing organizations for more
specific information about the potential pitfalls of this and
other options (I have some connections to the Python community,
so that might be a useful starting point).

Kostas didn't say anything about the topic in his announcement,
so it is likely that LBNL plans to keep the copyright on the code
("Open Source" is not the same thing as "public domain"). This
doesn't necessarily conflict with the establishment of a seperate
organization of developers, although it would be more elegant to
assign all the rights to a formally independent legal entity.
Since LBNL is still awaiting approval by the DOD, it may be
premature to discuss this in public in great detail, but since
there was a request for feedback, here it is.

I don't have a full list of the current and past licensees, but I
assume that most of them would be interested in some kind of
participation. This is certainly the case for me!

*phew*, what have I started here?
I really hope we're not scaring any non-developers away from this
general purpose list with such a highly technical discussion!

If ANSI C created portability problems at the time it was
introduced (I don't think it still does today, btw.) then
C++ will be a true nightmare in comparison. Before switching
an existing codebase over to C++ you need several *very* good
reasons, and I can't personally think of even one good reason in
this case. I am really surprised that Greg reports about good
porting experiences with C++, as pretty much everybody else I
talk to warns me about exactly the opposite. The most experienced
C++ developers I know invariably call the language "a bloody mess".

As a more technically solid argument: Remember that you can
always call foreign C code from your C++ programs, but if you
want to call C++ from C, then the only way to do so is through
shared libraries, which opens yet another can of worms in terms
of portability and functional limitations. The performance issues
with a more complex language have already been mentioned. This is
no surprise, as there has gone around 20 years of experience into
C compiler technology, and only a fraction of that into any  C++
compiler. This alone would be alarming, even when ignoring that
C++ is at least an order of magnitude more complex to compile,
and the standard has been in flux until very recently.

There are much simpler ways to make Radiance more modular than it
currently is, without throwing out all the work that has already
been invested in it. ANSIfication will be a great step into that
direction, forcing all function prototypes into header files.
As a second step, if we then manage to encapsulate the global
variables of each functional unit into a struct that can get
passed around as a pointer, then we might already have all the
modularity we need, without introducing anything that would
prevent Greg from still recognizing his own programs.

As a principle, I'm a big fan of object oriented programming (90%
of my own work is object oriented), but neither is C++ a good
object oriented language, nor do I think that object orientation
would be of any benefit for this specific task. The core
implementation of Radiance has to remain as simple as possible,
and using ANSI C is one of the factors that will keep it simple.
I really can't see how the introduction of "mindbending
abstractions" would be of any benefit at this level.

I do support the idea of relegating some parts of the system to
"legacy" status. I guess this would only put a formal label on
those modules that haven't been touched for several years anyway.
Maybe this label could simply result in putting them into a
seperate and optional support package.

It could also be interesting to consider another implementation
framework for all the helper programs circulating around the
actual Radiance core. Some of the csh scripts have been rewritten
in C for Windows, with limited flexibility and robustness. My
personal favourite language for this kind of task would be Python
(with some parts already existing). Note that such a more
portable reimplementation of individual small programs can be
done one by one, and there's no problem in keeping the old
versions around as long as necessary.

The problem of platform specific code variations is actually
independent from the ANSI conversion. In part, the ANSI standard
was supposed to reduce those incompatiblities, but succeeded in
that point only to a certain degree. I have no experience with
GNU autoconf myself, but maybe that would be a reasonable way to
eliminate the need to actually know which platform has what kind
of quirks. The configure scripts generated by autoconf simply
test the target machine and set the right compile variables
automatically. Again, this will probably have to be a step by
step replacement effort, but I think it would be worth it in the
long run. In the end, the #ifdefs in the code won't be about
specific OSes anymore, but simply about feature variations in the
available APIs.

Thanks for mentioning the Windows issue! The code of Radiance for
Windows includes some changes in the way how the stored ambient
values are accessed, which apparently were written for a
completely different platform. As far as I understand, those
changes are responsible for a large part of the performance
improvements that can be observed under Windows. I must admit
that I didn't find the time yet to have a look at the code of
3R4, so I have no idea whether it already includes the same
modifications. If not, then it might be a good idea to keep them
around during the merge, although that might make the task quite
a bit more involved.

Ignoring this aspect, the merge of the core functionality will
be relatively straightforward. The Windows code base is not very
clean (there are several conflicting compatiblity libraries in
use), so most of the result should probably be based on the unix
code. There are a number of details involving line endings in
text files and other differences between the systems where
Radiance needs to be more tolerant in the input it accepts, but I
have already fixed most of those for the binaries included in
Rayfront. I don't expect any major obstacles in porting those
fixes back to 3R4, especially after ANSIfication. The GUI based
programs are a different problem that needs to be tackled
seperately.

I happily back Georg's comments on C++ being slower (at compile time
and, apparently, running), non reciprocal to ANSI-C and not as
standardized as ANSI-C is, plus the fact that "object oriented"
programming is possible with, yet not inforced by ANSI-C.
As example, system dependancy in a job distributing system for
HP-UX,Linux,IRIX and SUN-OS was, thanks to Posix, limited to a small
number of system calls. Approx 200 lines total out of 4500 are ifdefed
and fit into two seperate files (file locking and getting system
parameters like load, swap space, physical ram etc.).
Compared with compiling stuff like the URT kit a decade ago, systems
have become more standardized. Is GNU's autoconf really needed for a
raytracer, which is supposedly not close to the system ? (fork&flock
aside)

Thoughts on a rewrite were founded on the limited and cumbersome
"interface" for extending the core rendering. My line of thought runs

Radiance has been used to solve light problems other programs can't
handle (in the early days its arbitrary geometry was better than the
than solely available box-oriented illumination programs, it's surface
description is more realistic than _todays_ Lightscape, the ambient
cache was a big step forward, etc. ). That top-notch position is one
reason people use it.
 
As much as I appreciate a broad use of it in daily usage for problems
which aren't driving the algorithms to its limits (and my highest
respect to those using it for that, the lighted world would be a much
better place if people use 20% of Radiance capabilites early enough in
the architectural planning process), is the rest of the
rendering/light-calculating software industry in a non-dormant state.

Algorithms for global illumination have been progressing since Greg
introduced the ambient cache into Radiance, and it would be quite nice
to extend Radiance more easily. Validation is of top priority (that's
what I help Roland Schregle to do at FhG-ISE), and the number of
extensions ideas is less than a handful (given we find people to do it).
Yet without a clearer interface not only is the effort reproduced for
each project, but different projects potentially cludge (as happens with
Roland Schregle's photon-map and Christopher Reinhart's yearly
simulations). Furthermore, not without reason we may expect advances in
commercial programs, which may (I have to grasp for the heart pills...)
force us someday to use a closed-software, non-tracable package just
because Radiance can't do what the client expects and gets from other
packages.

However, that interface is not changed solely by prototyping functions.
Doing more than that risks new bugs- well, we'll get them out. Maybe
there's a core structure between just-prototypes and a full rewrite ?

Dear Robert,

I 'm using frequently Optics software to get data for radiance window
modelling. You can also use WINDOW 4.1 instead. I think that the BRTDfunc
description of the glazing gives values for transmittance (and reflectance)
instead of transmissivity (glass material). Naturally there are two
descriptions for front and back surfaces of the window since properties are
quite different. The description in your example deals only with direct
normal transmittance hence it does not take into account the transmittance
angular behavior of the glazing. This can be treated as follows: by using
for example  Window 4.1 you can calculate the transmittance in various
incidence angles. By using a polynomiac interpolation you can create a
function of transmittance versus angle of incidence (i.e. Rdot). In fact
this fucntion is a normalized function because each value is diveded by the
normal  transmittance. Thus is your BRTDfunc description you should add
glazing.cal function with modified transmittance and reflectance
accordingly.
I hope that this might help.

Thank you Aris.

This is how I had planned to use the info from Optics, that is as a
brtdfunc with glazing.cal.  However glazing.cal is based on fits for
clear and bronze tinted glass only, is it reasonably accurate for more
complex glazing, such as low-e coating?  

Thanks again,

Robert

I agree...but I don't see good reasons to preserve some of them
through an extensive rewrite.  If they're hard to ANSIfy, I think we'd
be advised to just put them aside.

How do people feel about Cygwin/gcc
<http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/> under Windows?  I don't know the
package, and it probably still needs an MS compiler for the header
files, but otherwise we can use the familiar Unix tools on Windows.  I
have, however, only a bit of experience with cygwin, and don't how
well it works for a large project.

I like this very much, but am a bit concerned about requiring all
users to install Python libraries.  Also, some users will want other
scripting languages; TCL, Perl, and (gack!) Visual Basic are likely
candidates.  Ummm...probably Mathematica.

Autoconf...scares me.  It's one of the most difficult scripting
languages and it actively encourages #ifdef-laden code.  Personally, I
favor the Kernighan and Pike (*The Practice of Programming*) approach
to portability; write the base code portably, and bottle up the OS
dependencies in separate libraries and APIs.

Hmmmm...Radiance plug-ins.  Most Unices support some version of
dynamic loading these days.  Windows does.  I don't think Plan 9 does...

Now, I'm interested in ways to standardize the GUI API.  In my
opinion, it would be useful if we could customize ximage and rview to
native OS conventions easily, perhaps by providing an OS specific
library.  It might also be useful to embed the core rendering tools in
a dynamic loading environment.  But, again, I don't know what it would
take.

Ops, that should read 'knot' file, containing the spline parameters. The
pre-1998 rshow, running only on IRIX-GL, had the animation spline
feature, but I haven't come around to add it back into the new Open-GL
rshow. 
Meanwhile, one way would be to use rshow for writing a series of view
files and do the interpolation externally.

I din't even know that list existed. When was it created?
I'm also posting to both for the moment, but I'd suggest that we
move this discussion over completely from now on.

Cygwin is a wonderful hacker's tool, but I wouldn't recommend it
to the typical Windows user. I think the MS header files can be
downloaded somewhere, so that wouldn't necessarily be a problem.
But there are still a lot of issues that require custom coding
for Windows, as cygwin doesn't support all the unix APIs, and
some are only supported in relatively hackish ways. Apart from
that, as much as I hate to admit it, the MS compilers still
optimize a lot better than any gcc version I have seen so far.

This just reminds me of another problem that we'll have to solve
in this context. Since Windows doesn't support NFS file locking
(and neither did cygwin, last time I looked), we'll need to find
a better solution for concurrent access to ambient files. I can
think of two portable ways to do this: Either we invent a file
based locking mechanism, or we establish a seperate server
process that accepts network store and retreival requests by the
actual simulation processes. The latter would be more technicall
involved, but probably a lot more robust. Any thoughts?

Python is trivial to install on every supported platform (which
are a lot more than even Radiance supports). Most unix systems
nowadays come with a preinstalled Python interpreter, (plus Tcl
and Perl, of course). The reason why I prefer Python in this
context is that it can be easily understood even by normal users
(in contrast to Perl), and that it has a very robust and stable
feature set, so that programs usually don't break with the next
release (in contrast to Tcl, as Gregs heroic efforts with trad
have demonstrated).

On top of that, a large body of related code in Python already
exists, parts of which may eventually be released as Open Source
as well (tough I can't make any promises just yet). In any case,
this is more a general thought for the future than an immediate
requirement. The basic core of Radiance should probably continue
to work without too many external dependencies. But a second
layer of tools could profit a lot of some improved flexibility
and portability.

Anyone who wants to use proprietary stuff like VB is always free
to do so, but I'm not sure about the chances of such code to be
included in the core distribution of Radiance even in the long run.

I don't think that those two approaches are mutually exclusive.
Some more complex dependencies certainly belong into seperate
modules with a thick layer of barbed wire around them. But there
are also many other small variations and bugs among different
systems with no clear borderlines between vendors, kernel and
library versions, etc. Keeping track of those without a tool like
autoconf is a real pain for both developers and users.

Have you had a look at the makeall script lately? This is
complexity that the user has to handle when something goes wrong.
Autoconf is generally a one-time effort, that only needs to be
handled by one or two of the developers. Once that is done, the
trusty mantra of "./configure; make; make install" just magically
works on pretty much any system, whether its specific quirks have
been cataloged before or not. Not every user can grant Greg ssh
access to solve compile problems, and Greg probably wouldn't have
the time to do this for every user anyway.

The Radiance sources are currently littered with hundreds of
instances of preprocessor symbols referencing more than a dozen
individual operating systems. This has almost worked yesterday,
it's already breaking today with very current systems, and it's
garanteed to break in the future, unless someone constantly keeps
a list of all the systems out there and their specific bugs and
other nonstandard behaviour. I will chose #ifdefs of the form
"HAS_<feature>" any time, against the alternative of multiple
nested OS specific conditionals in the same place.

Prototypes and the elimination of global variables will make the
*internal* interfaces of Radiance a lot clearer and more obvious
than they are right now. After that, it will be much easier to
isolate those parts that need to be changed to better accomodate
any present or future extensions, and the risk of breaking all
the rest when doing so will become much smaller.

The default compile and installation should probably be designed
for static linking, but on most systems it will be relatively
easy to generate dynamic options from there. Creating dynamically
loadable extension modules for Python from existing C libraries
is almost trivial, btw. (the image converter module in Rayfront
is just one practical example involving Radiance code).

You're not the first one to think that thought.

In the end it won't really take a lot of effort, but only after
the above steps have been taken. Despite all its shortcomings,
the Windows version of rview already points into the right
direction here, by demonstrating approximately where the
interfaces between the simulation core and a display framework
should be placed. Unfortunately, the existing implementation is a
horrible mess, due to the difficulties of integrating the current
Radiance code on one hand, and some other obstacles the original
developers were facing on the other. I realize that most of you
haven't seen those sources yet, so you'll simply have to take my
word for it... ;)

Thanks Aris, and the others who replied to this one.  Looks like I'll shy away from 
these more complex materials until I have a real handle on them.  I'll look at 
glazing.cal too, so I understand what's going on there before I start using it. 

I don't recall seeing any tutorials or info on applying the BRTDfunc in "Rendering 
with Radiance".  Is there a good tutorial available?

Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaylit
Message-ID: <937AC68A9AFF694991B176C5E13831179545D3@engrmail1.engr.psu.edu>

Dear Radiance experts:
 
try this with gendaylit:
 
gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5 
 
This is for Pittsburgh. The weather station data are 20.5 W/m^2 diffuse horizontal and 200.5 W/m^2 for the "beam" component (towards the sun). Both irradiance data are in the visible range only. 
 
I expect 46.8 W/m^2 from the sun, measured on the horizontal plane, since the sine of the sun altitude angle multiplied by 200.5 gives 46.8
 
What I get is 21 W/m^2. Does the gendaylit -W option require W/m^2 measured over the full spectrum? The gendaylit man page says it uses data based on the visible spectrum. 
 
I asked someone who used gendaylit previously and this is what he wrote:

I did.  Here's what I got -

gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5
# gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5
sky clearness or sky brightness out of range 1.029410    0.620136

Hmmm...  It appears we are using different versions.
Are you using, as I am, UNIX or some PC version?

And for the cal file:

I haven't used gendaylit for ages, I tend to stick with the sky
blends described in the thesis chapter.  I'm still a little concerned
that Perez can give unexpected distortions.

Martin,

It seems you have inverted the parameters providing direct beam irradiance
and diffuse global irradiance.
So instead of calling:  gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5
do this:

gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 200.5 20.5

My experience with gendaylit is that it is a rather reliable program. Its
validation is documented in gendaylit author's master thesis.

I can add to this that my former colleagues at the Fraunhofer ISE and I have
been using gendaylit extensively over the past years and all in all the
results seem to be very reliable under a wide range of sky conditions (just
around sunrise and sunset you can easily run into errors). 

We kind of "validated" the gendaylit source code in a study in which be
measured and simulated indoor illuminances based on direct/diffuse
irradiances under over 10,000 sky conditions and the results were rather
encouraging.

In the Radiance validation I carried out using measured sky luminances, I
also tested a number of sky models including Perez (gendaylit).

Of the 754 skies, there were 41 for which the Perez model description could
either not be generated (outside parameter range - 27 skies) or which produced
negative vertical illuminances (14 skies). These were eliminated from the analysis
for this model leaving 713 skies. The negative vertical illuminances
resulted from distortions in the sky luminance distribution that can
occur unexpectedly for certain combinations of input parameters. These
parameter combinations were present in the data collected by the BRE 
but they were not encountered in the Berkeley data that were used to 
derive the model. This effect was noted by Littlefair and an 
adjustment to the model to prevent this distortion was advised by 
Perez. A routine examination of the gendaylit code showed this fix
to be present.  So it would appear not to correct all occurrences.

The presence of a distortion was taken to be a negative value for any
of the predicted vertical illuminances. The actual luminance distribution
for the sky was not examined. So the possibility remains that some of
the other skies may yet have exhibited some distortion.

The distortion manifested itself, weirdly, as a region of -ve luminance
sky that could be seen in rview as a conspicuous strangely coloured patch.
Note, Radiance (v2.4) didn't complain that -ve luminances were encountered
when rays 'hit' the glow material.  Which is fair enough, who'd expect -ve
luminances to be present?  Also, -ve luminances notwithstanding, the diffuse
horizontal illuminance predicted using rtrace was *correct*.  So, other
parts of the sky were no doubt high (+ve) luminance to compensate.  As
noted above, a minimum test that distortions were not present would be 
reasonable predictions for vertical illuminances from the Perez sky.  To
be certain, you'd really have to test individual rays that sampled the
hemisphere.

The above is a report of what happened. I'm not suggesting that Perez/gendaylit
should not be used.  In fact, as far as I recall, the parameters that led
to these distortions were also around sunrise/sunset with diffuse horizontal
illuminances of only a few klux - not a big deal for daylighting/energy calcs.
Rather, i'd caution that strange things can happen (or at least did) when gendaylit
is (was) routinely used to generate skies from measured data.

For desperate insomniacs, sky model tests (Chapter 5) and other stuff can
be downloaded from here:

Hello,

I've forwarded some discussion I was part of regarding Radiance and
Optics5.  I apologize its a little messy.  Basically, I concluded that
Optics 5 does produce fairly accurate glazing definitions for most
applications.  Anymore accuracy, particularly accuracy at higher
incidence angles, would require the use of a modified glazing.cal
function.

Hope this helps!
Zack

              I have been in communication with Chas and Judy Lai on
this - Chas sent me
              some very helpful information which helped me to decide
that there was an
              error in the way we were calculating these numbers, and
the code has since
              been changed by myself and Richard Versluis based on Chas'
comments.  The
              updated code will be used in the next version of Optics5
which we expect to
              release next week.

              I am not sure how to test the results except by forwarding
some examples to
              you for checking and comment in this email.
              Please review the attached files and send any comments to
me.

              The files represent:
              Single Glazings
                      6mm clear glass   :  CLEAR_6.rad
                      applied film on 6mm bronze glass  :
SLCLBZ06.rad
              Multiple Glazings

Clear6Double.rad
                      6mm bronze glass / 6mm low-e glass  :
BronzeLowe.rad

              Just for the record, here is how we are doing the
calculations now for
              single glazing layers and glazing systems (multiple
glazing):

              First we determine the color co-ordinates of the T/Rf/Rb
spectra using an
              equal-energy ('pure white') source and the CIE 1964 10
degree observers from
              ASTM E308
              These color co-ordinates are transformed into a RGB gamut
with:
                      Red   x,y = 0.640, 0.330
                      Green x,y = 0.290, 0.600
                      Blue  x,y = 0.150, 0.060
                      White x,y = 0.333, 0.333

              Finally, two types of Radiance primitive are output - a
glass primitive and
              a BRTDfunc primitive.

              The glass primitive has 'adjusted' transmittance RGB
values since this
              primitive uses as input the transmittance without
interreflections taken
              into account.  The effect of interreflections is
subtracted from the total
              transmittance assuming a constant index of refraction of
according to:
              tn =
(sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn

              Both primitives also adjust the RGB values so that they
scale to the total
              photopic transmittance or reflectance by using the
following scaling factor:
              1/(0.265074126*R+0.670114631*G+0.064811243*B) applied to
each RGB value.

              The .rad file output by Optics5 contains both primitives
regardless of
              whether a single glazing layer or a glazing system has
been selected.  The
              glass primitive is probably not appropriate for glazing
systems (I guess).

              Some reference information is output as a header (comment
lines) in the
              Radiance file.  For single layers, this includes the
filename, product name,
              NFRC ID, Glazing Type, Coated Side and Thickness of the
layer as well as the
              Photopic (visible) averaged T/Rf/Rb values.  For glazing
systems, some of
              these fields do not apply and they are left blank.  For
glazing systems, the
              thickness is set to -999.

              To use (in the next version of Optics5):
              Load one or more layers into the glazing system.
              Either select a layer by pressing one of the buttons #1,
#2, etc.
                      or
              Select the glazing system by pressing the button 'Glazing
System'

              Choose the menu option File|Create Radiance File, select a
filename and
              press OK.

            Rebecca,

            I took a second to look over these rad files and for the
most part they seem accurate.  A few questions and comments (anyone,
please correct
            me if I am wrong):

            1)  The incidence angle data in Optics 5....does this data
come from actual measurements performed by the manufacturer or does
Optics 5 come
            up with these values using an equation?  I am assuming this
data is true, measured by the manufacturer, and am using it to compare
the results of
            these rad files.  What are the options of
assymetric...symmetric etc. for?  It seems like this setting doesn't
change any of the characteristics.

            A side note: it would be a nice feature to have an option
that allows the user to view the data for all incident angles in a
single graph.  Like a
            toggle that would switch from the view of all wavelengths at
a single incident angle to all incident angles at either a given
wavelenth, or showing
            three typical RGB wavelengths or just an overall average of
all wavelengths.

            2) As I'm sure you know, the normal transmittance seems to
be right on with Optics5 normal transmittance.  One question....how come
we are
            making the radiance definition in 3 parts like so:

            As far as I can tell these two radiance definitions give
very similar results.  The second definition, besides being a little
more compact, then gives
            the option to use a different .cal function if necessary.
Below I tried to look in more detail at whether or not a different .cal
function is
            necessary.

            3) As far as using the same glazing.cal function for all
glazings, it seems like for the most part this is okay since most
glazings have very similar
            trans vs. incident angle characteristics.  See the attached
graph.

            The glazing .cal functions, both the clear and the bronze,
are supposed to be in bold.  (I apologize if this is illegible.  Let me
know and I can just
            send you the excel spreadsheet I created this in)  I tried
to get both extremes, from the quickest cut-off (Double bronze), to the
slowest
            (Starphire) although I didn't spend too much time looking
for these extremes.  From the graph, the two glazing.cal functions do
not grossly
            mispredict ( I know thats not a word but you get the point)
the transmittance.  The worse case possibly occuring at 60deg incidence
where it
            could mean a difference of at most +/- 250 fc.  It seems
like a specialized .cal function for each glazing might be overkill but
it seems like
            modifying the glazing.cal file to include another one or two
functions might do the trick.  Right now, the break between the clear
function and the
            bronze function is a normal trans=0.645.  It does seem that
the relationship between normal transmittance and incident angle
drop-off is pretty
            linear, that is the lower the normal trans the quicker the
drop-off.  And so, for example, another break could be added with trans
= 0.5 and then
            trans = 0.35 (or whatever break will give the best fits).
Then the same glazing.cal function could be used for all glazings and
the error would be
            reduced significantly.  And I guess that if there are
coatings or films with very different trans vs. angle characteristics, a
special .cal function
            may still be in order.  I am personally hoping to find a
glazing system that doesn't significantly drop in trans until 80deg or
so.

            I hope this all makes sense.  Please let me know if you have
any questions/comments/clarifications etc.  Overall, I am really excited
to have this
            new functionality in Optics 5.  For any Radiance modeler, it
gives the ability to compare numerous glazing systems with the assurance
that the
            results are relatively accurate.  Any update on when the new
version will be released?

        Hi all,I think that there is one other person who needs to be
involved in this discussion.  It was Eleanor Lee who originally brought
to my attention the need for
       better accuracy glazings in Radiance.  While most uncoated
glazings have similar angular transmittance properties, I think it was
coated glazings that introduce
       angle-dependence issues.  I think Eleanor can contribute some
greater understanding of the issue to this discussion.The reason I
created two BRTDfuncs is
       because the reflectance is different for front and back.  While
it is reasonable to define a different front/back reflectance within a
single BRTDfunc, the other
       limitation we are working with is Desktop Radiance and AutoCAD.
The orientation of the glazing determines the direction in which the
light flows into a building,
       i.e., from outside to inside.  This is impossible to reconcile
with DesktopRadiance's need to use glazing orientation to define the
direction of the flow of
       illumination. Currently Desktop Radiance only uses the first
entity type--glass.  The other two are for future use.  But regardless,
two will be necessary to work
       within the AutoCAD framework.I am not sure I follow Zack's
suggestion of creating a different Radiance file for different types of
glazings depending upon normal
       transmittance.  Is it true that the fall-off is a function of the
transmittance?  It also does not really make sense on a conceptual level
to transfer the burden of
       accurately rendering these glazings (Radiance) upon the modeling
tool (Optics). A single glazing.cal file makes the Optics-->Radiance
interface much cleaner
       and straightforward.  So, I advocate an improved glazing.cal
file.There has already been work done on what the new glazing.calf
function should look like based
       upon total solar transmittance.  Perhaps Eleanor remember's the
citation?Thank you Zack for your excelent work!  I would like to get a
copy of your Excel
       spreadsheet.-Chas

     Chas, thanks for your comments!  I've attached the excel file I
used for my comparison.  It is crudely notated so please ask me if there
are any questions.

     I'm still not totally clear why two BRTDfuncs are needed since you
can still specify different front and back reflectances with one but I
am not at all familiar
     with the Desktop Radiance to ACAD relation.

     As far as the relationship between transmittance and fall-off;  I
just noticed a trend in the glazings I analyzed that showed this
somewhat linear relationship.  The
     fact that the glazing.cal function uses the clear equation for
Trans>0.645 and the Bronze for Trans<0.645 also suggested to me that
atleast someone else thought
     that there was this relationship.  My suggestion was to still
maintain a single glazing.cal function but with the addition of another
one or two divisions, ie Trans
     <0.5 and Trans <0.35, if this relationship proves to be true
enough.  But I agree, it seems like a coating or film could have a major
impact on the angle-dependant
     transmittance and in those cases a special *.cal file would be
necessary to accurately model in Radiance.  By the way, if anyone knows
of such coatings, in
     particular coatings that increase or maintain transmittance at high
incident angles, I would be very interested.  This could be very useful
in daylighting
     applications.

     Zack

Hello,
<p>I've forwarded some discussion I was part of regarding Radiance and
Optics5.&nbsp; I apologize its a little messy.&nbsp; Basically, I concluded
that Optics 5 does produce fairly accurate glazing definitions for most
applications.&nbsp; Anymore accuracy, particularly accuracy at higher incidence
angles, would require the use of a modified glazing.cal function.
<p>Hope this helps!

I have been in communication with Chas and Judy Lai on this - Chas sent

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
some very helpful information which helped me to decide that there was
an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
error in the way we were calculating these numbers, and the code has since
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
been changed by myself and Richard Versluis based on Chas' comments.&nbsp;
The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
updated code will be used in the next version of Optics5 which we expect
to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
release next week.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am not sure how to test the results except by forwarding some examples
to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
you for checking and comment in this email.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please review the attached files and send any comments to me.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The files represent:

6mm bronze glass / 6mm low-e glass&nbsp; :&nbsp; BronzeLowe.rad
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just for the record, here is how we are doing the calculations now for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
single glazing layers and glazing systems (multiple glazing):
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First we determine the color co-ordinates of the T/Rf/Rb spectra using
an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
equal-energy ('pure white') source and the CIE 1964 10 degree observers
from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ASTM E308
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These color co-ordinates are transformed into a RGB gamut with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Red&nbsp;&nbsp; x,y = 0.640, 0.330
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Green x,y = 0.290, 0.600
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Blue&nbsp; x,y = 0.150, 0.060
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
White x,y = 0.333, 0.333
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, two types of Radiance primitive are output - a glass primitive
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a BRTDfunc primitive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The glass primitive has 'adjusted' transmittance RGB values since this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
primitive uses as input the transmittance without interreflections taken
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
into account.&nbsp; The effect of interreflections is subtracted from the
total
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
transmittance assuming a constant index of refraction of&nbsp; according
to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
tn = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both primitives also adjust the RGB values so that they scale to the total
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
photopic transmittance or reflectance by using the following scaling factor:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1/(0.265074126*R+0.670114631*G+0.064811243*B) applied to each RGB value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The .rad file output by Optics5 contains both primitives regardless of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whether a single glazing layer or a glazing system has been selected.&nbsp;
The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
glass primitive is probably not appropriate for glazing systems (I guess).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some reference information is output as a header (comment lines) in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Radiance file.&nbsp; For single layers, this includes the filename, product
name,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NFRC ID, Glazing Type, Coated Side and Thickness of the layer as well as
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Photopic (visible) averaged T/Rf/Rb values.&nbsp; For glazing systems,
some of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
these fields do not apply and they are left blank.&nbsp; For glazing systems,
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
thickness is set to -999.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To use (in the next version of Optics5):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Load one or more layers into the glazing system.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Either select a layer by pressing one of the buttons #1, #2, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Select the glazing system by pressing the button 'Glazing System'
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Choose the menu option File|Create Radiance File, select a filename and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
press OK.

took a second to look over these rad files and for the most part they seem
accurate.&nbsp; A few questions and comments (anyone, please correct
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
me if I am wrong):
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;
The incidence angle data in Optics 5....does this data come from actual
measurements performed by the manufacturer or does Optics 5 come
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
up with these values using an equation?&nbsp; I am assuming this data is
true, measured by the manufacturer, and am using it to compare the results
of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
these rad files.&nbsp; What are the options of assymetric...symmetric etc.
for?&nbsp; It seems like this setting doesn't change any of the characteristics.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
side note: it would be a nice feature to have an option that allows the
user to view the data for all incident angles in a single graph.&nbsp;
Like a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
toggle that would switch from the view of all wavelengths at a single incident
angle to all incident angles at either a given wavelenth, or showing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
three typical RGB wavelengths or just an overall average of all wavelengths.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)
As I'm sure you know, the normal transmittance seems to be right on with
Optics5 normal transmittance.&nbsp; One question....how come we are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
making the radiance definition in 3 parts like so:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
far as I can tell these two radiance definitions give very similar results.&nbsp;
The second definition, besides being a little more compact, then gives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the option to use a different .cal function if necessary.&nbsp; Below I
tried to look in more detail at whether or not a different .cal function
is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
necessary.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)
As far as using the same glazing.cal function for all glazings, it seems
like for the most part this is okay since most glazings have very similar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
trans vs. incident angle characteristics.&nbsp; <b>See the attached graph</b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
glazing .cal functions, both the clear and the bronze, are supposed to
be in bold.&nbsp; (I apologize if this is illegible.&nbsp; Let me know
and I can just
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
send you the excel spreadsheet I created this in)&nbsp; I tried to get
both extremes, from the quickest cut-off (Double bronze), to the slowest
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Starphire) although I didn't spend too much time looking for these extremes.&nbsp;
>From the graph, the two glazing.cal functions do not grossly
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mispredict ( I know thats not a word but you get the point) the transmittance.&nbsp;
The worse case possibly occuring at 60deg incidence where it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
could mean a difference of at most +/- 250 fc.&nbsp; It seems like a specialized
.cal function for each glazing might be overkill but it seems like
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
modifying the glazing.cal file to include another one or two functions
might do the trick.&nbsp; Right now, the break between the clear function
and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bronze function is a normal trans=0.645.&nbsp; It does seem that the relationship
between normal transmittance and incident angle drop-off is pretty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
linear, that is the lower the normal trans the quicker the drop-off.&nbsp;
And so, for example, another break could be added with trans = 0.5 and
then
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
trans = 0.35 (or whatever break will give the best fits).&nbsp; Then the
same glazing.cal function could be used for all glazings and the error
would be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
reduced significantly.&nbsp; And I guess that if there are coatings or
films with very different trans vs. angle characteristics, a special .cal
function
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
may still be in order.&nbsp; I am personally hoping to find a glazing system
that doesn't significantly drop in trans until 80deg or so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
hope this all makes sense.&nbsp; Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/clarifications
etc.&nbsp; Overall, I am really excited to have this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
new functionality in Optics 5.&nbsp; For any Radiance modeler, it gives
the ability to compare numerous glazing systems with the assurance that
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
results are relatively accurate.&nbsp; Any update on when the new version
will be released?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi all,I think that there
is one other person who needs to be involved in this discussion.&nbsp;
It was Eleanor Lee who originally brought to my attention the need for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better accuracy glazings in Radiance.&nbsp;
While most uncoated glazings have similar angular transmittance properties,
I think it was coated glazings that introduce
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; angle-dependence issues.&nbsp;
I think Eleanor can contribute some greater understanding of the issue
to this discussion.The reason I created two BRTDfuncs is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because the reflectance is different
for front and back.&nbsp; While it is reasonable to define a different
front/back reflectance within a single BRTDfunc, the other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limitation we are working with
is Desktop Radiance and AutoCAD.&nbsp; The orientation of the glazing determines
the direction in which the light flows into a building,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e., from outside to inside.&nbsp;
This is impossible to reconcile with DesktopRadiance's need to use glazing
orientation to define the direction of the flow of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illumination. Currently Desktop
Radiance only uses the first entity type--glass.&nbsp; The other two are
for future use.&nbsp; But regardless, two will be necessary to work
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within the AutoCAD framework.I
am not sure I follow Zack's suggestion of creating a different Radiance
file for different types of glazings depending upon normal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transmittance.&nbsp; Is it true
that the fall-off is a function of the transmittance?&nbsp; It also does
not really make sense on a conceptual level to transfer the burden of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accurately rendering these glazings
(Radiance) upon the modeling tool (Optics). A single glazing.cal file makes
the Optics-->Radiance interface much cleaner
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and straightforward.&nbsp; So,
I advocate an improved glazing.cal file.There has already been work done
on what the new glazing.calf function should look like based
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon total solar transmittance.&nbsp;
Perhaps Eleanor remember's the citation?Thank you Zack for your excelent
work!&nbsp; I would like to get a copy of your Excel
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spreadsheet.-Chas

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chas, thanks for your comments!&nbsp; I've
attached the excel file I used for my comparison.&nbsp; It is crudely notated
so please ask me if there are any questions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still not totally clear why two BRTDfuncs
are needed since you can still specify different front and back reflectances
with one but I am not at all familiar
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Desktop Radiance to ACAD relation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the relationship between transmittance
and fall-off;&nbsp; I just noticed a trend in the glazings I analyzed that
showed this somewhat linear relationship.&nbsp; The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that the glazing.cal function uses the
clear equation for Trans>0.645 and the Bronze for Trans&lt;0.645 also suggested
to me that atleast someone else thought
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that there was this relationship.&nbsp; My
suggestion was to still maintain a single glazing.cal function but with
the addition of another one or two divisions, ie Trans
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;0.5 and Trans &lt;0.35, if this relationship
proves to be true enough.&nbsp; But I agree, it seems like a coating or
film could have a major impact on the angle-dependant
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transmittance and in those cases a special
*.cal file would be necessary to accurately model in Radiance.&nbsp; By
the way, if anyone knows of such coatings, in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particular coatings that increase or maintain
transmittance at high incident angles, I would be very interested.&nbsp;
This could be very useful in daylighting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applications.

Subject: [Radiance-general] rpiece and parallel processing
Message-ID: <3D08CA1E.DD081D79@fes.uwaterloo.ca>

Here is part of a recent exchange with Greg Ward on this subject:

Hi Greg,

When I first started to use rpiece I thought it would automatically start up

separate processes but then I realized that the processes I started were all

on the same processor. I don't know where to find the option in rpiece to
start parallel processes. I could not find it in the manual. ..... As for
the -PP option, I included it with a file name and
noticed that Radiance put something into the file when I checked after a run

but it was only one entry, I think. ............

Thomas
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Thomas,

To run rpiece on a machine with 4 processors, do like so:

% rpiece -X 10 -Y 10 -F syncfile -o output.pic -PP mach1.pst -af ambfile
[rpict options] octree &
# wait 10 seconds or so for the first process to load the octree, then:
% rpiece -F syncfile -o output.pic -PP mach1.pst octree &
% rpiece -F syncfile -o output.pic -PP mach1.pst octree &
% rpiece -F syncfile -o output.pic -PP mach1.pst octree &

The first invocation initializes the synchronization file and starts the
initial rpict process.  The rpict process then forks itself and waits
for another process to attach to it via the named pipes in mach1.pst.
This is why you don't need to specify the rpict options on subsequent
invocations.  However, you need to invoke rpiece once for each separate
rendering process, and that is how it's supposed to work.

To run rpiece on another machine sharing the same directory over NFS,
execute:

% rpiece -F syncfile -o output.pic -af ambfile [rpict options] octree &

If that machine also has multiple processors, add a -PP option to the
first invocation, this time giving it a unique name for that machine,
and add one invocation as above for each additional processor, assuming
you want as many rpict processes running as you have processors.

Is that clear enough?
-Greg

Martin,

two errors in your gendaylit command line:
1. You mixed up direct and diffuse radiation
2. Gendaylit uses the full spectrum irradiation as input! It's the 
default output which is in the visible range. The Perez model (and 
gendaylit) calculates the luminous efficacy (W -> lm) according the 
actual sky state.
How can you measure irradiantion in the visible range only?

Concerning the reliability, I can underline the statement from 
Christoph. Besides these mentioned validations, we did additional 
validations (measurements of direct and diffuse irradiation and 
horizontal and 4 vertical illuminance) years ago with 10sec data for a 
dataset of one year and found a good match between measurements and the 
model.
Of course, for extrem low sun position, the model could have some 
problems - but also the correct measurements of these flat sun positions 
is often critical. And be careful if you have mean values and not actual 
values (e.g. 1 value for an interval of an hour or 15 min)! This can 
lead also to problems at sunset/sunrise!

Subject: [Radiance-general] rshow
Message-ID: <3D08F7A4.77625521@fes.uwaterloo.ca>

After trying to run rshow with a 70MB octree created in Radiance, rshow
failed with the following message: "out of tree space memory in gettree". A
smaller octree of an order of magnitude smaller posed no problem for rshow.
A processor on our SGI system has a 1 GB of memory. Is this a problem we can
fix or does it require a change in gettree?

The Open-GL rshow is quite memory hungry (using Open-GL display lists)
but 70MB on 1GB machine should be expected to run. Any images/instances
loaded with the main octree ? What does 'top' or 'grosview' say while
rshow starts up ?

Message-ID: <937AC68A9AFF694991B176C5E13831179545D5@engrmail1.engr.psu.edu>

I did what you suggested, Raphael. 
 
Again, the weather station data for Pittsbugh tell me that the diffuse horizontal component is 41 W/m^2, and the "beam" component measured towards the sun is 401 W/m^2 
 
I was shortcutting the luminous efficacy of these values by dividing both values by 2, assuming that approximately 50% are in the visible range. That was a mistake. 
 
gendaylit's man page generates a CIE clear sky as follows:
gendaylit -ang 60 0 -W 840 135
 
These irradiance data are integrated over the full spectrum, not just the visible range. Therefore:
gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.9 -m 75 -W 401 41 
This gives me horizontal irradiance values of 41 for the sun and 38 for the sky, which is ok. 
 
The important difference between gendaylit and gensky is the input of irradiance data. If those data given to gensky -B -R are integrated over the full spectrum, not just the visible range, interior daylight levels will double! Gensky wants W/m^2 in the visible range only, whereas gendaylit uses the actual irradiance data from weather stations, which are approx. twice as high.

	Martin,
	
	It seems you have inverted the parameters providing direct beam irradiance
	and diffuse global irradiance.
	So instead of calling:  gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 20.5 200.5
	do this:
	
	gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.4 -m 75 -W 200.5 20.5
	
	My experience with gendaylit is that it is a rather reliable program. Its
	validation is documented in gendaylit author's master thesis.

Hi Greg,

Yes, that is clear enough and it is essentially what I had in a C shell script. I
have now added a ten second wait after the first invocation as you suggest. The
script file is run like this
mrpiece n
where n + 1 is the number of invocations
and args2 is a file with all the arguments for rpiece.

Here is  the script I wrote (I am a beginner) to save invoking up to 16
processes:

#!/bin/csh -f
#
# script to execute rpiece $1 + 1 times
#
if ($#argv != 1)then#Script needs exactly one argument
 echo "Incorrect number of arguments"
exit 1
endif
sleep 10
rpiece -v @args2 &
set end=$1
@ x=0
while ($x < $end)
 @ x=$x + 1
      rpiece -v @args2 &
      echo $x
end
-------------------------
In the future I will add more arguments to provide more flexibility.

Thomas
p.s. a 70MB octree took less than two minutes to render at 1024 x1024 resolution,
medium quality and two bounces of indirect lighting using 11 processors.

Hi Peter,

I ran rshow with top running in another window and found that the maximum current
memory usage (RES) was 140MB and the total size of the process (SIZE) was 162MB.

Ooops, I slipped up in the C shell script I posted in the previous message
on this subject. The "sleep 10" line should be moved down one line after the
first invocation of  rpiece (it works this way but not as efficiently).
Thanks Greg.

For those interested in the system I am running rpiece on: It is a 16
processor SGI Onyx2 IR3 with R12000, 400Mhz processors (not directly
comparable to PC Mhz) and 1GB memory each.  In the reported run I was not
using 11 of the processors because another user was running on the remaining
ones. We are also setting up an 8 processor Linux cluster and will make

Hi Martin,<br>
<br>
You are right that the irradiance data fed to gensky should be treated
with caution.&nbsp; The reason for this, however, is Radiance's use of a
constant luminous efficacy of 179 lm/W.&nbsp; If you want accurate
interior daylight levels using gensky, you should use illuminance data if
you have it, rather than irradiance data.&nbsp; simply take the
illuminance data and divide it by 179 lm/W to get 'pseudo-irradiances' to
feed to gensky.&nbsp; it is highly likely that this will not equal
measured irradiance data as realistic sky luminous efficacies are between
90 &amp; 150 lm/W.&nbsp; if you have irradiance data only, that should be
first multiplied by a reasonable luminous efficacy (refer for example,
Lam, J.C. and Li, D.H.W. (1996), <i>Luminous Efficacy of Daylight under
Different Sky Conditions, </i>Energy Conservation and Management<i>,</i>
37 (12), 1703-1711) to get illuminance data.&nbsp; then follow the same
process to get your 'pseudo-irradiances' for input to gensky.<br>
<br>

<blockquote type=cite cite>The important difference between gendaylit and
gensky is the input of irradiance data. If those data given to gensky -B
-R are integrated over the full spectrum, not just the visible range,
interior daylight levels will double! Gensky wants W/m^2 in the visible
range only, whereas gendaylit uses the actual irradiance data from
weather stations, which are approx. twice as high. <br>

How's the maximum per-user or per-process kernel limit for the process
size configured on your IRIX ?

materials submitted by the speakers and edited by the organizers.

We have received 29 pre-registrations for the workshop, and a list of 
planned speakers and preliminary titles is broken into categories below:

Introduction
---------------------------
	Greg Ward, "Radiance 3.4 and Open Source Development"

Daylighting Studies
---------------------------
	Giulio Antonutto, "a radiance application in daylighting analysis" (from 
his thesis)
	Annalisa Simonella, "daylighting analysis" (two titles offered -- we liked 
them both)

Lighting Analysis
---------------------------
	Jack de Valpine, "Architectural Visualization: Radiance in Production"
	Georg Mischler, "Simulating daylight redirection systems"

in urban area"

The names and titles above are not final, and we may get new speakers and 
lose some people before we can provide a proper workshop agenda in 
September.  About half the pre-registrants have said they would like to 
come but do not wish to speak, and we can accommodate everyone we have 
heard from at this point.

By August 31, we will also need the final titles and abstracts for all the 
talks, along with any materials the speakers wish to include on the 
workshop CD-ROM.  At minimum, we would like to get a copy of each speaker's 
presentation in PowerPoint, PDF, or HTML (preferred) format, and a short 
bio with contact information.  If the speaker also has test scenes, images, 
and/or software they would like to share, these would be most welcome.  We 
need to get all of these materials in order to have sufficient time to 
assemble them into a usable CD-ROM, so we cannot promise to include 
anything submitted after the August 31 deadline.

Thank you to everyone who responded, and we look forward to meeting you at 
the workshop!

Greg Ward and Raphael Compagnon

Subject: [Radiance-general] simulating fritted glazing systems
Message-ID: <3D1230F7.5020302@visarc.com>

Hello:

I am interested in people's comments on how best to simulate frit 
glazing systems from a performance and appearance standpoint.   We are 
interested in comparing the appearance based on available performance 
data of a variety of fritted glazing systems on the exterior of a 
building system under daylight conditions. The fundamental challenge it 
seems to me is how to use the data that is readily available (from 
software such as LBL's Optics5 as well as from manufacturers themselves) 
to make an appropriate material in Radiance and whether the readily 
available data is in fact sufficient to describe the material behavior.

All the frit systems that we are looking at use the same basic 
insulating glass with the following makeup:

    * (exterior) 6mm clear glass with low-e coating on the second surface
    * (airspace) 13.2mm
    * (interior) 6mm clear glass

A Radiance material description (brtdfunc) for this makeup can be 
generated by the LBL Optics5 program. Note that Optics5 outputs material 
descriptions for the glass primitive as well as interior and exterior 
descriptions based on the BRTDfunc. In this case I believe that the 
"front" version of the BRTDfunc represents the exterior and is the 
appropriate description to use for this study.

void  glass       ve1-2m_glass

      0 0 0
      .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


The information that we do know is as follows:

    * measured photopic transmittance, and exterior and interior
      reflectance of base insulating glass system (70%, 11% and 12%)
    * radiance material description of  base insulating glass system
    * measured photopic transmittance, and exterior and interior
      reflectance of selected composite frit glass systems (ie the
      composition of the frit silkscreen [white] onto the 2nd or 3rd
      surface of  the base insulating glass system, for example 45%,
      22%, and 24% based on a 50% frit on the 2nd surface) , note that
      as far as I can tell it is not possible to build up such as system
      in a program like Optics5 (unless additional baseline measured
      data can be obtained from the manufacturer)

Is it sufficient to figure out the percentage variations for the 
transmittance and reflectance values between the original glass and the 
composite frit glass and then modify the brtdfunc material description 
accordingly? I know that this will not completely account for the change 
in color of the glass due to the white silkscreen on the 2nd or 3rd 
surface. But is this a reasonable approximation to start with.

Another thing to consider is the 'modeling' of the actual frit pattern 
on the glass. My thinking is that this is only important for cases where 
the glass is very close to the viewer. Typically a lot of the frit 
patterns (such as dot and lines) tend to disappear the the farther away 
from the building you are. Now in the cases where the view is close to 
the glass, what is a good way to build a composite material in Radiance 
(a mixfunc is probably a good starting point)? We know the data for the 
base insulating glass but what is a good way to figure out the 
reflectance of the frit silkscreen as seen through the glass?

I will look forward to your suggestions and comments.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Hello,

I just recently tackled fritted glass for a project with a huge central
atrium covered by a huge glass spire roof.  I used the perforate function to
combine the glass material and the frit material as follows (the perforate
function creates a pattern of dots or holes, a different function would be
needed for fritted lines);

1).....Definition of glass material from optics 5;

void  glass       SGP_VE1-2M_glass
0
0
3     0.661     0.759     0.670

void  BRTDfunc    SGP_VE1-2M_front
10
      0.104     0.105     0.107
      0.607     0.696     0.615
      0 0 0
      .

9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

void  BRTDfunc    SGP_VE1-2M_back
10
      0.095     0.110     0.102
      0.607     0.696     0.615
      0 0 0
      .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

notice this definition can be simplified to an identical definition as
follows (as seen in the glazing.cal file);

void BRTDfunc CLEAR_6_2_glass
10     rrho grho brho
        rtau gtau btau
        0 0 0
        glazing.cal

        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        0.104     0.105     0.107
        0.095     0.110     0.102
        0.607     0.696     0.615



2)....Definition of Frit material;

void trans blackfrit
0
0
7 0.091 0.091 0.091 0.010 0.150 0.556 0.000



3).....Using mixfunc and perforate.cal to combine glass and frit materials;

void mixfunc frit-b40
6 SGP_VE1-2M_glass blackfrit z_hole perforate.cal -s .5
0
1 .357

or in general

void mixfunc name
6 foreground_material background_material (z_hole,x_hole or y_hole)
perforate.cal -s 1
0
1 (radius-to-spacing fraction)

where;
x,y,z_hole signifies the direction of the dots or holes
the spacing of the holes is determined by the scale -s command (one-to-one
relationship. ie. -s 1 = 1 unit spacing)
the radius/spacing fraction tells how large the radius is compared to the
spacing.  (ie. with a value of .5 the dots will touch, a value of 1 is
completely dots, a value of 0 is no dots)

Hope this helps!
Zack

Zack:

Thanks for the follow-up.I understand your glazing
definitions. I also know a  variety of ways to
generate a pattern whether dots or lines, this gets at
the appearance of the frit when viewed close up.

Based on the data that I have seen available from
manufacturers of glazing sytems, the measured
performance data are for the composite glazing system
(with the frit applied). What are your assumptions
about the fritting material itself? How do you go
about determining the frit definition as a trans? Can
you walk through your process in greater detail for
the trans material?

Best Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

The trans model can be fitted to BRTF data of the material (rarely
available from manufacturers, but quite easily measured:
http://www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/gonio-photometer), resulting in a
validated trans model with known error bounds. If trans is not a
suitable fit, use BRTDfunc with you own model: Functions which
empirically model the underlying physics of the material (e.g. extruded)
and steered with few variables (2-6 approx.) fit best (german
description found at http://www.pab-opto.de/apian/phd/phd.html).

here is pillo with another beginner question....

i m tiyng to use rpiece on osx + linux


i made it work on linux dual proc system (a rocket) , on two mac 
computers (some problems, overlapping calculations, little performance 
gain)


the problem:
1)
nfs sharing between mac and linux, the linux box mount a mac folder with 
a scene.
solved
2)
launching rpiece on the mac, solved
3)
launching rpiece on linux

now the problem: due to network lock manager, the linux system can't 
read sync file (i m the same user on both systems) and stops.



any idea?

the mac doesn't seem to have any network file locking trick running... 
may be the name is not the same as on the linux system...

what can i do?

regards

pillo

Dear RADIANCE users,
 
The purpose of this message is to inform you of a RADIANCE add-on that might
be of interest to some you.
 
The National Research Council of Canada and the Fraunhofer Institute for
Solar Energy Systems have developed a RADIANCE-based dynamic daylight
simulation method called DAYSIM that allows you to efficiently simulate
annual indoor illuminance profiles at points of interest in a building.
DAYSIM is based on Tregenza's daylight coefficient approach and the Perez
sky model. DAYSIM further features a method to simulate the short time steps
dynamics of daylight, creating 1 min-time-series of external direct and
diffuse irradiances based on hourly means. This model is a modified version
of an older approach from Olseth and Skartveit.
 
DAYSIM is now available for download from
<http://www.nrc.ca/irc/ie/light/daysim.html>
http://www.nrc.ca/irc/ie/light/daysim.html. Any comments or suggestions are
welcome.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Numeric output composited with picture
Message-ID: <EA81673E-8971-11D6-BCCB-003065FB3106@verizon.net>

Hi,

Based on all the previous mail regarding numeric output I have been able 
to generate files containing the location, and illuminance values, 
throughout a daylit space.  Now I would like to be able to take data and 
place the output onto a *.pic of the same area in the grid they were 
taken.  If the readings were taken on 4' centers, I would like to feed 
the data back into Radiance to produce a picture containing those values 
at their actual locations in a grid.

Some ideas:

1.    Pipe the output from lam contining x/y/val into psign and pcompos 
to produce the composited image.  With this idea, the grid dimensions 
would have to be a known pixel spacing.  I'm also not sure if pcompos 
will allow for the translating of the input.
2.     Pipe the output into a new rad file as brightext and use the x/y 
to locate in the scene, the value to act as input into the text field, 
and excluding the mat from the calculation.

Any ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Of course if anyone 
has already done this...

One last note, short of rewriting my shell script in perl, is there a 
way to round the rcalc output to two decimal points?

Thanks,

Robert Westling
